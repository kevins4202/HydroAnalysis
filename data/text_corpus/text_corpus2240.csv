11200,the improved subsurface drainage is a new drainage technique which has large discharge verified by experiments it can be used to solve the problems of frequent floods and cultivated land shortage in south china considering large scale applications a general drainage formula of the improved subsurface drainage with ponded water in a homogeneous and isotropic soil was proposed based on kirkham equation firstly the drainage formulas based on different assumptions were deduced and verified by laboratory experiment and field test additionally further validation and simplification were studied by numerical simulation in which the critical conditions to distinguish whether the filter was saturated or not were given results showed that the proposed formulas passed the validation by laboratory experiment and field test based on method 1 and method 2 in which the bottom of the simplified boundary overlapped with the bottom of the drain pipe and the center of simplified boundary located at the center of filter were assumed respectively the numerical simulation results showed the formula based on method 1 was more applicable than that based on method 2 moreover for method 1 that b 0 h 0 d equaled 0 6 could be regarded as the critical boundary between filter saturated and unsaturated working condition considering the ratio of drain distance and impermeable layer depth a more simplified formula was given in this simplified formula that drain spacing was three times of impermeable layer depth was a critical condition the research results could provide scientific basis for improved subsurface drainage design and lay a good foundation for its application meanwhile it would be beneficial to enrich agricultural drainage technologies and promote development of agricultural drainage in china keywords improved subsurface drainage drainage formula laboratory experiment field test numerical simulation 1 introduction agricultural drainage is an effective way to remove the excess water from the fields and promote crop growth in south china affected by monsoon conditions and topography flooding and waterlogging occur frequently wang et al 2007 climate variability increases possibility of heavy and intense precipitation which aggravates the threat of flooding and waterlogging das et al 2013 groisman et al 2005 additionally along with urbanization and increasing demand for urban construction land a large number of farmlands are occupied the problem of farmlands shortage is more and more obvious which seriously threatens food security of china li et al 2013 agricultural drainage in south china should also adapt such a problem in china open ditch and subsurface pipe drainage are main agricultural drainage patterns open ditch has obvious advantage for the removal of excess water from the land surface but it occupies much farmland subsurface pipe drainage occupies less farmland but its ability of removing surface ponding is weak due to the small soil permeability coefficient based on these characteristics tao et al 2016 had proposed an improved subsurface drainage the improved subsurface drainage used the filter consisted of high permeability materials to replace the soil between the pipe bottom and plow layer fig1 the filter width was about 0 2 0 6 m the improved subsurface drainage had been demonstrated to have larger discharge than conventional subsurface drainage based on laboratory experiment and field test tao et al 2016 2017 moreover the improved subsurface drainage also has better performance on lowering water table and decreasing the amount of soil water storage after rainfall tao et al 2017 similarly filipović et al 2014 had also demonstrated that the conventional subsurface drainage with gravel trenches performed better in reducing waterlogging and runoff than the conventional subsurface drainage hence the improved subsurface drainage may be an effective way to solve the agricultural drainage problems in south china previous studies on the performance of improved subsurface drainage were mainly based on experiment and numerical simulation data however considering large scale applications it is necessary to give the theory formula of the improved subsurface drainage discharge for the drainage planning and design the working condition of the improved subsurface drainage is affected by the filter size and soil infiltration and water holding characteristics the filter materials may be in the two states of saturation and unsaturation when filter size is small or soil permeability is large enough the filter may be saturated or close to saturation conversely the filter may be unsaturated when filter size is large or soil permeability is not large enough the latter case is more likely to happen in the field than the former case tao et al 2016 had proposed the equation of improved subsurface drainage discharge with ponded water for the conditions of saturated filter materials and deep impermeable layer when filter materials are unsaturated or impermeable layer depth is small the discharge equations need to be developed for conventional subsurface drainage without controlled drainage the discharge formulas can be divided into two categories one is for the case that land surface is not covered by ponded water and the shape of the water table is a natural curve under this case formulas of hooghoudt equation dagan equation ernst equation and hooghoudt ernst equation darzi naftchally et al 2014 hooghoudt 1940 van schilfgaarde 1963 are frequently used the other is for the case that the land surface is covered by ponded water and the shape of water table is a horizontal curve based on this case kirkham 1949 has derived the theoretical formula of the conventional subsurface drainage discharge for water saturated uniform soil and overlying an impervious layer then equations of conventional subsurface drainage discharge for the dual depth under saturated soil covered by ponded water has been also derived by kirkham et al 1997 kirkham equations for surface ponding condition have been widely used for example based on the kirkham equation swartzendruber 1962 has proposed the discharge formula for the conventional subsurface drainage in layered soil and difference between calculated discharge and actual discharge is within 8 per cent wiskow and van der ploeg 2003 have estimated the drain spacing for optimal rainstorm runoff control by using kirkham equation and hooghoudt equation to calculate the drain discharge when mid water table between drains was up to the soil surface and lower than soil surface respectively additionally kirkham equation has been also used for calculating drain discharge with surface ponding in drainmod and hydrus 1d models besides experiment data the numerical simulation could also be used for validating the reliability of proposed equations hydrus can handle flow domains delineated by irregular boundaries the flow region itself may be composed of non uniform soils having an arbitrary degree of local anisotropy šimůnek et al 2006 which is more suitable for the improved subsurface drainage tekin 2002 has successfully predicted the relationship of drainage discharge and water table depth by simulating water flow into subsurface pipe drain for a layered soil profile based on hydrus 2d model filipović et al 2014 has used hydrus to analyze discharges of three drainage types tile drains tile drains with gravel trenches tile drains with gravel trenches and mole drains jabri and youngs 2012 have compared the steady state water table height obtained by van deemter 1950 s analytical solution and engelund 1951 s analytical solution within different soil types using hydrus the numerical modeling hydrus was deemed to be a means of assessing the accuracy of the theory analysis tao et al 2017 has also proven that hydrus model could provide a good simulation of the discharge and water table under the improved subsurface drainage the main objective of this paper was to propose general simplified discharge formulas of the improved subsurface drainage with ponded water in a homogeneous and isotropic soil firstly based on the kirkham equation considering the saturated and unsaturated filter condition of the improved subsurface drainage two drainage formulas were proposed secondly the drainage formulas were examined by laboratory experiment and field test then numerical simulation was used to identify the critical boundary between the saturated and unsaturated filter condition and optimize the formulas 2 materials and methods 2 1 mathematical derivation the kirkham formulas of the conventional subsurface drainage discharge for water saturated uniform soil covered by ponded water and overlying an impervious layer are as follows 1 q con 4 π k q con 2 where q con t d r f con 3 f con m log e cosh π m a 2 h cos π r 2 h cosh π m a 2 h cos π r 2

conductivity q con is a flux coefficient and is positive for sinks and negative for sources for conventional subsurface drainage t is the thickness of ponded water d is the drain depth r is the radius of the drain pipe a is the drain spacing h is the depth of impermeable layer fig 2 in the process of deriving kirkham formulas the following assumptions had been made the soil was homogeneous drain pipe was installed by parallel and equally spaced at equally depth pipe was taken as running full with negligible back pressure impervious barrier was parallel to the soil surface at a finite depth below the soil surface groundwater flow accorded to laplace s equation in addition to the above basic hypothesis for improved subsurface drainage further assumptions were made as follows firstly it was assumed that same inflow boundary length produced equal discharge then original rectangle boundary of filter was simplified to a circle boundary with same circumference as shown in fig 2 secondly the gap of filter and soil hydraulic conductivity was considered large enough to ignore the entrance resistance of the filter moreover it was assumed that the bottom of the simplified boundary overlapped with the bottom of the drain pipe in method 1 and the center of simplified boundary located at the center of filter in method 2 fig 2 three boundaries conditions at soil surface at the surface of the drain and at the impervious layer had been used by kirkham 1949 for improved subsurface drainage the potential ϕ which was known as the hydraulic head at soil surface boundary y dim boundary 1 was as follows 4 ϕ p a γ g t d i m where pa is atmospheric pressure γ is the density of the soil water g is the acceleration of gravity pa γg t stands for the pressure head at soil surface dim is the virtual drain depth of improved subsurface drainage which stands for the elevation head at the soil surface dim d r r 0 r 0 is the radius of the simplified boundary r0 b 0 h 0 π b 0 and h 0 stand for width and height of the filter respectively fig 2 the boundary 2 was different in method 1 and method 2 in method 1 when the filter was saturated or close to saturation because of large infiltration recharge or small water holding capacities of the soil the upper point of the simplified boundary was adopted as boundary 2 at this upper surface y r 0 x 0 5 ϕ p a γ g 2 r 2 r 0 r 0 p a γ

the field experiment was conducted at xinmaqiao experiment station in huaibei plain china 117 22 e 33 09 n it consists of five plots conventional subsurface drainage improved subsurface drainage with gravel filter improved subsurface drainage with layered sand gravel filter improved subsurface drainage with mixed sand gravel filter improved subsurface drainage with straw filter each 18 m wide by 17 m long with an area of 306 m2 each plot contained three 75 mm diameter pipe drains drains were installed at 0 7625 m depth and 6 m spacing and the filter width and height of the improved subsurface drainage were 0 4 m and 0 5 m respectively the drain outflows from each plot flowed directly into observation wells and cumulative outflows were recorded using digital water meters shown in fig 3 on august 12 2015 the discharges under conditions of 7 cm and 1 cm ponded water depth were measured every 5 10 minutes the hydraulic conductivities of soil in each plot were measured by double loop infiltration experiment the average values of these soil hydraulic conductivities were shown in table 1 2 3 numerical simulation in simulated experiment hydrus model was used four factors of drain depth drain spacing filter width and filter height were considered details were shown in table 2 the depth of impermeable layer was 10 m wen et al 2000 the ponded water depth was 0 01 m 360 groups of simulated experiments were conducted the hydraulic parameters of soil and gravel used the values given by tao et al 2017 taking the improved subssurface drainage with gravel filter as example the soil hydraulic conductivity was 0 916 m d 1 details were shown in table 3 to evaluate the formula performance two statistical parameters of coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 saleh et al 2000 were selected 3 results 3 1 verification by laboratory experiment the laboratory experiment had been described by tao et al 2016 in laboratory experiment the filter could be considered to be saturated according to small filter size and large hydraulic conductivity of fine sand and large recharge additionally the depth of impermeable layer was much larger than drain depth therefore eq 21 was used to calculate the discharges the basic parameters were as follows pipe length was 18 8 cm drain spacing was 14 8 cm distance from bottom of the pipe to soil surface was 15 cm the equivalent radius r0 were 3 8 cm 4 5 cm and 5 1 cm corresponding to the filter width of 2 cm 4 cm 6 cm respectively virtual drain depth dim for the improved subsurface drainage were 11 2 cm 10 6 cm and 9 9 cm corresponding to the filter width of 2 cm 4 cm 6 cm respectively in method 1 and virtual drain depth dim was 10 cm in method 2 the hydraulic conductivities of the soil were 1 201 m d 1 1 106 m d 1 1 244 m d 1 and 1 166 m d 1 corresponding to the filter width of 0 cm 2 cm 4 cm 6 cm respectively from table 4 it could be seen that relative errors between calculated and observed discharges were kept within a reasonable range for method 2 for method 1 the calculated discharges also matched well with the observed values when filter width was 4 cm or 6 cm while for the case of 2 cm filter width the calculated discharge was smaller than observed value there might be two reasons the kirkham equation underestimates the discharge with an error of 8 1 in addition the measured soil hydraulic conductivity is smaller than the actual soil hydraulic conductivity 3 2 verification by field experiment in field experiment the basic parameters were pipe length 17 m drain spacing 6 m diameter of the pipe 0 075 m distance from bottom of the pipe to soil surface 0 8 m filter width 0 4 m filter height 0 5 m equivalent radius r0 0 287 m depth of impermeable layer 10 m wen et al 2000 the virtual drain depth dim were 0 513 m in method 1 and 0 55 m in method 2 considering the unsaturated filter in field and the small gap between drain spacing and impermeable layer depth eq 18 was used from table 5 it could be seen that relative errors between calculated and observed values were kept within a reasonable range for both method 1 and method 2 it is to say that the improved subsurface drainage discharge formulas based on the two methods were both effective for field test 3 3 analysis by numerical simulation it could be seen that the formulas based on method 1 and method 2 performed well under laboratory and field condition whether these two formulas were suitable for other cases was still worth to be discussed besides it was evident that the filter was saturated in the laboratory experiment and unsaturated in the field experiment for improved subsurface drainage working for other cases which the filter working conditions were unknown it was important for formula selection to distinguish whether the filter was saturated or not hence further numerical simulation analysis had been done based on eqs 16 and 19 the values of r were related to b 0 h 0 in method 1 and h 0 in method 2 additionally drain depth d also greatly affected the discharge hence b 0 h 0 d in method 1 and h 0 d in method 2 had been the focus of research fig 4 a and fig 5 a showed the formula errors under conditions of unsaturated and saturated filter respectively errors with the saturated filter assumption presented an increasing trend when b 0 h 0 d or h 0 d increased the errors were small when b 0 h 0 d and h 0 d were small in figs 4a and 5 a respectively furthermore when the values of b 0 h 0 d and h 0 d were larger than the certain values there would be relatively smaller errors under the unsaturated filter assumption than that under the saturated filter assumption to find the critical value the errors between 20 and 20 were taken out as shown in figs 4b and 5 b in fig 4b it could be seen that the b 0 h 0 d value of 0 6 could be regarded as a turning point clearly in method 1 similarly in fig 5 b it could be seen that the h 0 d value of 0 4 could be considered as the critical point in method 2 hence eq 16 for the method 1 could be rewritten as 23 r r 0 b 0 h 0 0 6 d r 0 2 r b 0 h 0 0 6 d eq 19 for the method 2 could be rewritten as 24 r r 0 h 0 0 4 d h 0 2 2 r h 0 0 4 d based on eqs 18 23 and 24 the pipe discharges per unit length were recalculated fig 6 showed the comparison of the calculated and simulated discharges it could be seen that the values calculated by method 1 were closer to the line of y x which meant that method 1 performed better than method 2 intuitively to further evaluate the formula performance two statistical parameters of correlation coefficient and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 saleh et al 2000 were selected the correlation coefficient and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient between calculated and simulated values were 0 9 and 0 78 respectively for method 1 and 0 66 and 0 41 respectively for method 2 in view of the statistical parameters we could easily found that the formula based on method 1 had better performance than method 2 based on comprehensive studies of laboratory and field and simulation experiments the assumption that the bottom of the simplified boundary overlapped with the bottom of the drain pipe in method 1 was more applicable than the assumption that the simplified boundary center located at filter center in method 2 in another word eqs 18 and 23 could be more effective in calculating the pipe discharge for improved subsurface drainage under surface ponding 4 discussions 4 1 formula simplification eq 18 is too complex and hard to use nevertheless the simplified eqs 21 and 22 require the precondition that the depth of impermeable layer tends toward infinity or the drain spacing tends toward infinity a critical value which could roughly distinguish the precondition of eqs 21 and 22 without affecting the calculated discharge was discussed based on the assumption of simplified boundary bottom coinciding with drain pipe bottom fig 7 showed the discharge errors between the simplified eqs 21 22 and the completed eq 18 with the value of a h increasing the errors of eq 21 increased and the errors of eq 22 decreased gradually when the drain spacing was a quarter of the impermeable layer depth the errors between eq 22 and the complete equation were about 4 to 5 fig 7a when the ratio of the drain spacing and impermeable layer depth varied from 2 to 4 the errors between eq 21 22 and the complete equation were within 0 2 which is an acceptable error to find a more accurate threshold trend lines of the two error sequences were given as shown in fig 7b it could easily be seen that when a h was 3 the errors of eqs 21 and 22 were almost equal hence the condition that the drain spacing was three times of impermeable layer depth could be regarded as a critical condition then the drainage formula for improved subsurface drainage with ponded water could be expressed as follows 25 q k t d r 1 2 π ln sinh π 2 d i m r a sinh π r a a h 3 k t d r 1 2 π ln tan π 2 d i m r 4 h tan π r 4 h a h 3 r r 0 b 0 h 0 0 6 d r 0 2 r b 0 h 0 0 6 d d i m d r r 0 4 2 discharge calculation for unknown impermeable layer depth in general the impermeable layer depth is hard to obtain so that the use of eq 22 or eq 25 is limited while the parameter of the impermeable layer depth in eq 21 is not required therefore the calculated discharge errors between eq 21 and the complete eq 18 were discussed for a much larger range of a h value as shown in fig 8 it could be seen that the errors were less than 8 which was a tolerable error when the value of a h changed from 0 to 50 hence when the impermeable layer depth is unknown eq 21 could be also used to estimate the discharge of the improved subsurface drainage roughly 5 conclusions based on the kirkham equation a general discharge formula eq 19 of the improved subsurface drainage with ponded water in a homogeneous and isotropic soil was proposed considering the saturated and unsaturated filter condition which may happen during the improved subsurface drainage working time verified by three methods of laboratory experiment and field test and numerical simulation initially discharge formulas of the improved subsurface drainage with ponded water were proposed and verified by observed data in laboratory experiment and field test the errors between calculated and observed values were acceptable then a large amount of simulation experiments were done to distinguish whether the filter was saturated or not which was important for formula selection for method 1 that b 0 h 0 d equaled 0 6 could be regarded as a turning point clearly for method 2 that h 0 d equaled 0 4 could be regarded as the critical point then it was found from further evaluation that the assumption that the bottom of the simplified boundary overlapped with the bottom of the drain pipe in method 1 was more applicable than the assumption that the simplified boundary center located at filter center in method 2 the correlation coefficient and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient between calculated and simulated values were 0 9 and 0 78 respectively for method 1 and 0 66 and 0 41 respectively for method 2 to simplify the proposed formula the relationship between the ratio of drain spacing and the impermeable layer depth and the calculated discharge had been discussed when the drain spacing was three times of impermeable layer depth the errors of eqs 21 and 22 were almost equal to 0 05 which could be regarded as a critical condition to simplify the complete formula additionally when impermeable layer depth is unknown the eq 21 could be used to estimate the discharge of the improved subsurface drainage roughly the results in this paper could provide a good technical support for drainage management furthermore in this paper the study on whether the filter was saturated or not was based on filter size when hydraulic conductivity of the soil is too small it may also affect on the filter saturated condition this is worth to do further study acknowledgments this work was supported by the crsri open

that b 0 h 0 d equaled 0 6 could be regarded as the critical boundary between filter saturated and unsaturated working condition considering the ratio of drain distance and impermeable layer depth a more simplified formula was given in this simplified formula that drain spacing was three times of impermeable layer depth was a critical condition the research results could provide scientific basis for improved subsurface drainage design and lay a good foundation for its application meanwhile it would be beneficial to enrich agricultural drainage technologies and promote development of agricultural drainage in china keywords improved subsurface drainage drainage formula laboratory experiment field test numerical simulation 1 introduction agricultural drainage is an effective way to remove the excess water from the fields and promote crop growth in south china affected by monsoon conditions and topography flooding and waterlogging occur frequently wang et al 2007 climate variability increases possibility of heavy and intense precipitation which aggravates the threat of flooding and waterlogging das et al 2013 groisman et al 2005 additionally along with urbanization and increasing demand for urban construction land a large number of farmlands are occupied the problem of farmlands shortage is more and more obvious which seriously threatens food security of china li et al 2013 agricultural drainage in south china should also adapt such a problem in china open ditch and subsurface pipe drainage are main agricultural drainage patterns open ditch has obvious advantage for the removal of excess water from the land surface but it occupies much farmland subsurface pipe drainage occupies less farmland but its ability of removing surface ponding is weak due to the small soil permeability coefficient based on these characteristics tao et al 2016 had proposed an improved subsurface drainage the improved subsurface drainage used the filter consisted of high permeability materials to replace the soil between the pipe bottom and plow layer fig1 the filter width was about 0 2 0 6 m the improved subsurface drainage had been demonstrated to have larger discharge than conventional subsurface drainage based on laboratory experiment and field test tao et al 2016 2017 moreover the improved subsurface drainage also has better performance on lowering water table and decreasing the amount of soil water storage after rainfall tao et al 2017 similarly filipović et al 2014 had also demonstrated that the conventional subsurface drainage with gravel trenches performed better in reducing waterlogging and runoff than the conventional subsurface drainage hence the improved subsurface drainage may be an effective way to solve the agricultural drainage problems in south china previous studies on the performance of improved subsurface drainage were mainly based on experiment and numerical simulation data however considering large scale applications it is necessary to give the theory formula of the improved subsurface drainage discharge for the drainage planning and design the working condition of the improved subsurface drainage is affected by the filter size and soil infiltration and water holding characteristics the filter materials may be in the two states of saturation and unsaturation when filter size is small or soil permeability is large enough the filter may be saturated or close to saturation conversely the filter may be unsaturated when filter size is large or soil permeability is not large enough the latter case is more likely to happen in the field than the former case tao et al 2016 had proposed the equation of improved subsurface drainage discharge with ponded water for the conditions of saturated filter materials and deep impermeable layer when filter materials are unsaturated or impermeable layer depth is small the discharge equations need to be developed for conventional subsurface drainage without controlled drainage the discharge formulas can be divided into two categories one is for the case that land surface is not covered by ponded water and the shape of the water table is a natural curve under this case formulas of hooghoudt equation dagan equation ernst equation and hooghoudt ernst equation darzi naftchally et al 2014 hooghoudt 1940 van schilfgaarde 1963 are frequently used the other is for the case that the land surface is covered by ponded water and the shape of water table is a horizontal curve based on this case kirkham 1949 has derived the theoretical formula of the conventional subsurface drainage discharge for water saturated uniform soil and overlying an impervious layer then equations of conventional subsurface drainage discharge for the dual depth under saturated soil covered by ponded water has been also derived by kirkham et al 1997 kirkham equations for surface ponding condition have been widely used for example based on the kirkham equation swartzendruber 1962 has proposed the discharge formula for the conventional subsurface drainage in layered soil and difference between calculated discharge and actual discharge is within 8 per cent wiskow and van der ploeg 2003 have estimated the drain spacing for optimal rainstorm runoff control by using kirkham equation and hooghoudt equation to calculate the drain discharge when mid water table between drains was up to the soil surface and lower than soil surface respectively additionally kirkham equation has been also used for calculating drain discharge with surface ponding in drainmod and hydrus 1d models besides experiment data the numerical simulation could also be used for validating the reliability of proposed equations hydrus can handle flow domains delineated by irregular boundaries the flow region itself may be composed of non uniform soils having an arbitrary degree of local anisotropy šimůnek et al 2006 which is more suitable for the improved subsurface drainage tekin 2002 has successfully predicted the relationship of drainage discharge and water table depth by simulating water flow into subsurface pipe drain for a layered soil profile based on hydrus 2d model filipović et al 2014 has used hydrus to analyze discharges of three drainage types tile drains tile drains with gravel trenches tile drains with gravel trenches and mole drains jabri and youngs 2012 have compared the steady state water table height obtained by van deemter 1950 s analytical solution and engelund 1951 s analytical solution within different soil types using hydrus the numerical modeling hydrus was deemed to be a means of assessing the accuracy of the theory analysis tao et al 2017 has also proven that hydrus model could provide a good simulation of the discharge and water table under the improved subsurface drainage the main objective of this paper was to propose general simplified discharge formulas of the improved subsurface drainage with ponded water in a homogeneous and isotropic soil firstly based on the kirkham equation considering the saturated and unsaturated filter condition of the improved subsurface drainage two drainage formulas were proposed secondly the drainage formulas were examined by laboratory experiment and field test then numerical simulation was used to identify the critical boundary between the saturated and unsaturated filter condition and optimize the formulas 2 materials and methods 2 1 mathematical derivation the kirkham formulas of the conventional subsurface drainage discharge for water saturated uniform soil covered by ponded water and overlying an impervious layer are as follows 1 q con 4 π k q con 2 where q con t d r f con 3 f con m log e cosh π m a 2 h cos π r 2 h cosh π m a 2 h cos π r 2

conductivity q con is a flux coefficient and is positive for sinks and negative for sources for conventional subsurface drainage t is the thickness of ponded water d is the drain depth r is the radius of the drain pipe a is the drain spacing h is the depth of impermeable layer fig 2 in the process of deriving kirkham formulas the following assumptions had been made the soil was homogeneous drain pipe was installed by parallel and equally spaced at equally depth pipe was taken as running full with negligible back pressure impervious barrier was parallel to the soil surface at a finite depth below the soil surface groundwater flow accorded to laplace s equation in addition to the above basic hypothesis for improved subsurface drainage further assumptions were made as follows firstly it was assumed that same inflow boundary length produced equal discharge then original rectangle boundary of filter was simplified to a circle boundary with same circumference as shown in fig 2 secondly the gap of filter and soil hydraulic conductivity was considered large enough to ignore the entrance resistance of the filter moreover it was assumed that the bottom of the simplified boundary overlapped with the bottom of the drain pipe in method 1 and the center of simplified boundary located at the center of filter in method 2 fig 2 three boundaries conditions at soil surface at the surface of the drain and at the impervious layer had been used by kirkham 1949 for improved subsurface drainage the potential ϕ which was known as the hydraulic head at soil surface boundary y dim boundary 1 was as follows 4 ϕ p a γ g t d i m where pa is atmospheric pressure γ is the density of the soil water g is the acceleration of gravity pa γg t stands for the pressure head at soil surface dim is the virtual drain depth of improved subsurface drainage which stands for the elevation head at the soil surface dim d r r 0 r 0 is the radius of the simplified boundary r0 b 0 h 0 π b 0 and h 0 stand for width and height of the filter respectively fig 2 the boundary 2 was different in method 1 and method 2 in method 1 when the filter was saturated or close to saturation because of large infiltration recharge or small water holding capacities of the soil the upper point of the simplified boundary was adopted as boundary 2 at this upper surface y r 0 x 0 5 ϕ p a γ g 2 r 2 r 0 r 0 p a γ

the field experiment was conducted at xinmaqiao experiment station in huaibei plain china 117 22 e 33 09 n it consists of five plots conventional subsurface drainage improved subsurface drainage with gravel filter improved subsurface drainage with layered sand gravel filter improved subsurface drainage with mixed sand gravel filter improved subsurface drainage with straw filter each 18 m wide by 17 m long with an area of 306 m2 each plot contained three 75 mm diameter pipe drains drains were installed at 0 7625 m depth and 6 m spacing and the filter width and height of the improved subsurface drainage were 0 4 m and 0 5 m respectively the drain outflows from each plot flowed directly into observation wells and cumulative outflows were recorded using digital water meters shown in fig 3 on august 12 2015 the discharges under conditions of 7 cm and 1 cm ponded water depth were measured every 5 10 minutes the hydraulic conductivities of soil in each plot were measured by double loop infiltration experiment the average values of these soil hydraulic conductivities were shown in table 1 2 3 numerical simulation in simulated experiment hydrus model was used four factors of drain depth drain spacing filter width and filter height were considered details were shown in table 2 the depth of impermeable layer was 10 m wen et al 2000 the ponded water depth was 0 01 m 360 groups of simulated experiments were conducted the hydraulic parameters of soil and gravel used the values given by tao et al 2017 taking the improved subssurface drainage with gravel filter as example the soil hydraulic conductivity was 0 916 m d 1 details were shown in table 3 to evaluate the formula performance two statistical parameters of coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 saleh et al 2000 were selected 3 results 3 1 verification by laboratory experiment the laboratory experiment had been described by tao et al 2016 in laboratory experiment the filter could be considered to be saturated according to small filter size and large hydraulic conductivity of fine sand and large recharge additionally the depth of impermeable layer was much larger than drain depth therefore eq 21 was used to calculate the discharges the basic parameters were as follows pipe length was 18 8 cm drain spacing was 14 8 cm distance from bottom of the pipe to soil surface was 15 cm the equivalent radius r0 were 3 8 cm 4 5 cm and 5 1 cm corresponding to the filter width of 2 cm 4 cm 6 cm respectively virtual drain depth dim for the improved subsurface drainage were 11 2 cm 10 6 cm and 9 9 cm corresponding to the filter width of 2 cm 4 cm 6 cm respectively in method 1 and virtual drain depth dim was 10 cm in method 2 the hydraulic conductivities of the soil were 1 201 m d 1 1 106 m d 1 1 244 m d 1 and 1 166 m d 1 corresponding to the filter width of 0 cm 2 cm 4 cm 6 cm respectively from table 4 it could be seen that relative errors between calculated and observed discharges were kept within a reasonable range for method 2 for method 1 the calculated discharges also matched well with the observed values when filter width was 4 cm or 6 cm while for the case of 2 cm filter width the calculated discharge was smaller than observed value there might be two reasons the kirkham equation underestimates the discharge with an error of 8 1 in addition the measured soil hydraulic conductivity is smaller than the actual soil hydraulic conductivity 3 2 verification by field experiment in field experiment the basic parameters were pipe length 17 m drain spacing 6 m diameter of the pipe 0 075 m distance from bottom of the pipe to soil surface 0 8 m filter width 0 4 m filter height 0 5 m equivalent radius r0 0 287 m depth of impermeable layer 10 m wen et al 2000 the virtual drain depth dim were 0 513 m in method 1 and 0 55 m in method 2 considering the unsaturated filter in field and the small gap between drain spacing and impermeable layer depth eq 18 was used from table 5 it could be seen that relative errors between calculated and observed values were kept within a reasonable range for both method 1 and method 2 it is to say that the improved subsurface drainage discharge formulas based on the two methods were both effective for field test 3 3 analysis by numerical simulation it could be seen that the formulas based on method 1 and method 2 performed well under laboratory and field condition whether these two formulas were suitable for other cases was still worth to be discussed besides it was evident that the filter was saturated in the laboratory experiment and unsaturated in the field experiment for improved subsurface drainage working for other cases which the filter working conditions were unknown it was important for formula selection to distinguish whether the filter was saturated or not hence further numerical simulation analysis had been done based on eqs 16 and 19 the values of r were related to b 0 h 0 in method 1 and h 0 in method 2 additionally drain depth d also greatly affected the discharge hence b 0 h 0 d in method 1 and h 0 d in method 2 had been the focus of research fig 4 a and fig 5 a showed the formula errors under conditions of unsaturated and saturated filter respectively errors with the saturated filter assumption presented an increasing trend when b 0 h 0 d or h 0 d increased the errors were small when b 0 h 0 d and h 0 d were small in figs 4a and 5 a respectively furthermore when the values of b 0 h 0 d and h 0 d were larger than the certain values there would be relatively smaller errors under the unsaturated filter assumption than that under the saturated filter assumption to find the critical value the errors between 20 and 20 were taken out as shown in figs 4b and 5 b in fig 4b it could be seen that the b 0 h 0 d value of 0 6 could be regarded as a turning point clearly in method 1 similarly in fig 5 b it could be seen that the h 0 d value of 0 4 could be considered as the critical point in method 2 hence eq 16 for the method 1 could be rewritten as 23 r r 0 b 0 h 0 0 6 d r 0 2 r b 0 h 0 0 6 d eq 19 for the method 2 could be rewritten as 24 r r 0 h 0 0 4 d h 0 2 2 r h 0 0 4 d based on eqs 18 23 and 24 the pipe discharges per unit length were recalculated fig 6 showed the comparison of the calculated and simulated discharges it could be seen that the values calculated by method 1 were closer to the line of y x which meant that method 1 performed better than method 2 intuitively to further evaluate the formula performance two statistical parameters of correlation coefficient and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 saleh et al 2000 were selected the correlation coefficient and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient between calculated and simulated values were 0 9 and 0 78 respectively for method 1 and 0 66 and 0 41 respectively for method 2 in view of the statistical parameters we could easily found that the formula based on method 1 had better performance than method 2 based on comprehensive studies of laboratory and field and simulation experiments the assumption that the bottom of the simplified boundary overlapped with the bottom of the drain pipe in method 1 was more applicable than the assumption that the simplified boundary center located at filter center in method 2 in another word eqs 18 and 23 could be more effective in calculating the pipe discharge for improved subsurface drainage under surface ponding 4 discussions 4 1 formula simplification eq 18 is too complex and hard to use nevertheless the simplified eqs 21 and 22 require the precondition that the depth of impermeable layer tends toward infinity or the drain spacing tends toward infinity a critical value which could roughly distinguish the precondition of eqs 21 and 22 without affecting the calculated discharge was discussed based on the assumption of simplified boundary bottom coinciding with drain pipe bottom fig 7 showed the discharge errors between the simplified eqs 21 22 and the completed eq 18 with the value of a h increasing the errors of eq 21 increased and the errors of eq 22 decreased gradually when the drain spacing was a quarter of the impermeable layer depth the errors between eq 22 and the complete equation were about 4 to 5 fig 7a when the ratio of the drain spacing and impermeable layer depth varied from 2 to 4 the errors between eq 21 22 and the complete equation were within 0 2 which is an acceptable error to find a more accurate threshold trend lines of the two error sequences were given as shown in fig 7b it could easily be seen that when a h was 3 the errors of eqs 21 and 22 were almost equal hence the condition that the drain spacing was three times of impermeable layer depth could be regarded as a critical condition then the drainage formula for improved subsurface drainage with ponded water could be expressed as follows 25 q k t d r 1 2 π ln sinh π 2 d i m r a sinh π r a a h 3 k t d r 1 2 π ln tan π 2 d i m r 4 h tan π r 4 h a h 3 r r 0 b 0 h 0 0 6 d r 0 2 r b 0 h 0 0 6 d d i m d r r 0 4 2 discharge calculation for unknown impermeable layer depth in general the impermeable layer depth is hard to obtain so that the use of eq 22 or eq 25 is limited while the parameter of the impermeable layer depth in eq 21 is not required therefore the calculated discharge errors between eq 21 and the complete eq 18 were discussed for a much larger range of a h value as shown in fig 8 it could be seen that the errors were less than 8 which was a tolerable error when the value of a h changed from 0 to 50 hence when the impermeable layer depth is unknown eq 21 could be also used to estimate the discharge of the improved subsurface drainage roughly 5 conclusions based on the kirkham equation a general discharge formula eq 19 of the improved subsurface drainage with ponded water in a homogeneous and isotropic soil was proposed considering the saturated and unsaturated filter condition which may happen during the improved subsurface drainage working time verified by three methods of laboratory experiment and field test and numerical simulation initially discharge formulas of the improved subsurface drainage with ponded water were proposed and verified by observed data in laboratory experiment and field test the errors between calculated and observed values were acceptable then a large amount of simulation experiments were done to distinguish whether the filter was saturated or not which was important for formula selection for method 1 that b 0 h 0 d equaled 0 6 could be regarded as a turning point clearly for method 2 that h 0 d equaled 0 4 could be regarded as the critical point then it was found from further evaluation that the assumption that the bottom of the simplified boundary overlapped with the bottom of the drain pipe in method 1 was more applicable than the assumption that the simplified boundary center located at filter center in method 2 the correlation coefficient and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient between calculated and simulated values were 0 9 and 0 78 respectively for method 1 and 0 66 and 0 41 respectively for method 2 to simplify the proposed formula the relationship between the ratio of drain spacing and the impermeable layer depth and the calculated discharge had been discussed when the drain spacing was three times of impermeable layer depth the errors of eqs 21 and 22 were almost equal to 0 05 which could be regarded as a critical condition to simplify the complete formula additionally when impermeable layer depth is unknown the eq 21 could be used to estimate the discharge of the improved subsurface drainage roughly the results in this paper could provide a good technical support for drainage management furthermore in this paper the study on whether the filter was saturated or not was based on filter size when hydraulic conductivity of the soil is too small it may also affect on the filter saturated condition this is worth to do further study acknowledgments this work was supported by the crsri open

11201,as societies confront greater levels of water scarcity conflict follows water transfers are increasing with irrigation water regularly considered in such discussions given it often comprises the bulk of water rights within a particular region especially in water scarce environments here we analyze the impacts of three widely considered and implemented strategies to purchase water from irrigated agriculture land fallowing improvements in irrigation efficiency and direct leasing our empirical application involves water transfers from colorado river water rights holders to the salton sea a critical ecological resource that has been in decline for many decades with environmental damages estimated in the tens of billions of dollars we develop a regional hydro economic model that accounts for essential field level agro hydrologic processes related to crop production irrigation and salinity to evaluate the cost effectiveness of these three programs results indicate that both fallow and direct water lease programs are capable of generating significant environmental water flows with relatively small decreases in agricultural production and no appreciable decrease in grower profits because these policies focus on a single input applied water rather than overall inflows to the sea the direct lease program which is the most cost effective approach for generating water conservation may result in less inflows into the sea than a land fallowing program keywords crop water functions salinity management water markets regional agricultural water management salton sea water transfers environmental water 1 introduction as population wealth and climate change concerns continue to increase significant attention and effort has been devoted to reducing water scarcity particularly in the agricultural environmental and urban sectors urban and agricultural users have traditionally reduced scarcity through water grabs often from faraway places schwabe and connor 2012 this approach required the development of significant and expensive storage and conveyance systems that in effect changed the spatial and temporal distribution of water with rising demand and the lack of opportunities to find untapped and unclaimed inexpensive sources of water efforts to reduce water scarcity increasingly have focused on a reallocation of water among sectors efforts to reallocate water are frequently if not always contentious involving adversarial claims about water rights and the private and public benefits of different forms of water use and consumption hanak et al 2011 these efforts almost inevitably involve irrigated agriculture due to the significant amount of water resources it withdraws for instance nearly 69 of freshwater withdrawals worldwide are withdrawn for irrigated agricultural production with percentages in california and australia s murray darling basin exceeding 80 schwabe et al 2013 from a policy perspective appropriating water from irrigated agriculture for either urban or environmental purposes is challenging much of the water use by irrigated agriculture is based on senior water rights held under prior appropriation and beneficial use doctrines governments in response have considered tried and enacted a variety of approaches to appropriate water from irrigated agriculture one approach is legislative an example of which is found in california under the central valley project improvement act cvpia of 1992 the cvpia is u s federal legislation that reallocated a portion of water away from irrigated agriculture for environmental concerns and an act that continues to face conflict and litigation today hanak et al 2011 another avenue is incentive based approaches that encourage growers to irrigate more efficiently and allow them to maintain water rights however scheierling et al 2006 and ward and pulido velazquez 2008 found that subsidies for improved irrigation were unlikely to reduce overall agricultural water consumption a third approach is fallowing programs where farmers are essentially paid for their water these programs have been used in times of drought and as long term solutions in arid regions radonic 2014 escriva bou et al 2016 lofman et al 2002 lastly water markets are being employed to reallocate water often from irrigated agricultural uses to urban and environmental uses when allocations are driven at least in part by economic markets and valuations trade offs between often higher value low water volume urban uses and lower value high water volume agricultural uses can be evaluated and have been for many years with economic optimization models booker and young 1994 colby saliba et al 1987 donohew 2009 howe et al 1986 brewer et al 2006 howitt 1994 australia provides a significant example of a water market in which trades are made for the environment with most of the water being leased purchased from irrigated agriculture wheeler et al 2013 connell 2015 for example qureshi et al 2010 found that a flexible water market was a much more cost effective means of increasing environmental flows in the murray darling basin then a less flexible irrigation subsidy scheme given the continuing interest in and use of land fallowing and irrigation efficiency programs to generate water savings for short or long term reallocations the intention of this paper is to compare these approaches with a water market and thus highlight the perceived efficiencies of these schemes such a comparison has important policy implications along two fronts first further evidence of the cost effectiveness of more flexible schemes such as water markets which are advocated by economists is important when one considers the challenges to appropriate scarce public dollars to shift water to the environment or other public benefits second a narrow focus on the costs to agriculture of reducing water use or the required payments to incentivize such reductions as the primary metric to evaluate alternative strategies may overlook potentially important externalities associated with such strategies namely the impacts on return flows which can provide significant consumption production or preservation recreational benefits to society while our focus is comparing three different water leasing schemes for environmental flows into the salton sea in southern california the structure of our analysis and comparison of alternative water saving schemes can be applied to any region worldwide and for any beneficial use of water a second intention of this paper is to illustrate the importance of hydrological modeling and maintaining water balance in hydro economic models evaluating the benefits of alternative schemes to make additional water available for sale or lease especially when it comes to environmental water water market researchers and modelers are increasingly aware of the importance of maintaining water balance in their crop water production functions rosegrant et al 2000 zaman et al 2009 yet less attention has been paid to agricultural return flows generated from drainage or runoff cai et al 2003 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 qureshi et al 2010 indeed all of the approaches mentioned above that are intended to save water require designing institutional technical and accounting measures that accurately track and economically reward reduced water conservation ward and pulido velazquez p 18 215 without such attention true savings may not be achieved due to either failure to acknowledge the loss in return flows or the additional water use that may occur via a rebound effect associated with behavioral adjustments that accompany changes in costs and or efficiencies finally we illustrate that water leasing schemes differ not only in terms of costs and return flows back to the environment but also possibly in terms of the quality of the water returning to the environment an issue that has not been illustrated in previous policy comparisons in the example evaluated here we find that the salinity of the return flows differ across schemes an outcome that can be extremely important in regions worldwide including significant parts of california and australia that confront salinity issues schwabe et al 2006 to perform our analysis we develop a regional hydro economic model to assess leasing i e year to year purchasing of water for environmental flows which could mitigate ongoing environmental damages while minimizing impacts to the local agricultural economy our programming model accounts for essential field level agro hydrologic processes including nonlinear relationships and feedback mechanisms that exist among irrigation water volume irrigation water quality evaporation soil salinity drainage water volume drainage water quality and crop yield the model and analysis are designed to provide a timely evaluation of one of the most pressing environmental and water related issues in california today the salton sea similar to other terminal lakes such as the aral sea basin the quantity and quality of flows into the sea are threatened by upstream activity very expensive and protracted restoration plans have been developed which would reduce damages to the sea under lower flow regimes california department of water resources 2007 california department of water resources and united states bureau of reclamation 2015 yet little attention has been paid to the possibility of leasing purchasing water from regional agricultural operators and the costs of alternative strategies to acquire that water while legal and water rights issues both at the state and federal levels present significant barriers to such a scheme there is precedence in the past for directing water conserved by agricultural operators with senior colorado river water rights to the salton sea qsa 2003 given the potential benefits of preserving the salton sea are enormous cohen 2014 an analysis of water leasing schemes seems warranted regardless of current regulations and policies particularly considering that these schemes could be implemented relatively quickly as they would require no physical construction while our analysis considers the costs of the different policy instruments to generate environmental water for the sea with recognition of the consequent impact on quantity and quality of return flows from drainage and runoff into the sea one could also view these strategies as generating beneficial use water for other sectors purposes including agricultural or urban uses 2 water for the environment the salton sea the salton sea california s largest lake by surface area 340 square miles is a terminal lake located in southeastern california since its formation in the early 1900s the salton sea has served as a rest stop for millions of migratory birds traveling along the pacific flyway and year round habitat for several endangered and sensitive species including the desert pupfish yuma clapper rail and burrowing owl audubon california 2016 u s fish and wildlife services 2011 in the 1950s and 1960s the salton sea was one of the most popular recreation sites in california with more visitors annually than yosemite national park schwabe et al 2008 for much of the 20th century the water level of the sea was maintained by inflows consisting mostly of drainage water traveling through the soil profile and tail waters water traveling across the soil surface emanating from farmland around the sea waters laden with salts and fertilizers that have caused significant deterioration schwabe et al 2008 as a terminal lake its salinity increased rapidly during the last century due to evapoconcentration of salts few fish species can tolerate the present salinity levels of nearly 60 ppt an outcome that also affects the bird species that rely on these fish the primary source of drainage water is from the imperial irrigation district iid directly to the south iid which provides water for 440 to 540 thousand cultivated acres king 2007 ross 2010 shields and pacheco 2016 silva 2013 has among the most senior rights and largest share of colorado river water 3 1 million acre feet maf as most of the farmland uses furrow irrigation there is significant drainage and tail water that ends up in the main drainage canals that empty into the alamo and new rivers which empty into the salton sea fig 1 in addition to salinization the sea is shrinking due to decreased inflows partly as a result of the 2003 quantification settlement agreement qsa the qsa is a federal state local agreement that allowed the transfer of a large amount of irrigation water from iid to urban users in southern california qsa 2003 because of the expected reduced inflows as a result of the qsa s out of region transfers the state of california mandated mitigation water transfers be made by iid directly to the sea to keep increases in salton sea salinity at or below levels that would have occurred without the qsa urban water transfers nevertheless flows into the sea have decreased by approximately 10 since enactment of the qsa tetra tech 2016 usbr 2000 in 2017 the mitigation transfers stopped and thus inflows will likely further decrease resulting in an acceleration of the salinization and shrinking of the sea if no other action is taken by 2021 the sea will become too saline for fish populations another 25 years will see the salinity even too high for brine shrimp to thrive leading to algal and microbial populations rising unchecked these ecological conditions will severely affect the ability of the sea to sustain migratory birds cohen and hyun 2006 the estimated public damages from allowing the sea to continue to decline are significant expected damages from lower flows are estimated at between 11 and 70 billion over the next 30 years and include health impacts from increased respiratory illnesses associated with higher concentrations of airborne particulates from exposed playa decreased property values decreased recreation and the loss of nonuse values associated with wildlife habitat cohen 2014 in response to these possible damages the state proposed a 70 year plan that included making the sea smaller and less saline diverting salts into a brine sink developing habitat and employing dust management capital and operation and maintenance costs were estimated to be about 10 6 billion initially plus 169 million annually california department of water resources 2007 with the long term plan currently lacking funding the state more recently released a lower cost interim plan that identifies proposed actions to be taken over the next ten years california natural resources agency 2017 while the ten year plan does not address the salinity of the sea nor does it alter the size of the sea it acknowledges that rising salinity will likely still render the sea unusable to many species which in turn may have repercussions for the effectiveness of the habitat created see table a1 for a comparison of the plans in the next section we discuss the model we develop to evaluate possible policy strategies to generate additional beneficial use water to help address the region s water scarcity with particular attention towards maintaining environmental inflows to the salton sea similar to the efforts under the qsa to generate mitigation water as inflows to the salton sea we evaluate an extension of those efforts under different policy strategies that incentivize water conservation by iid agricultural operators with recognition of the return flows to the sea which are tracked via imposing water balance on our model results we emphasize that while our focus is on the cost effectiveness of more flexible policies in generating environmental flows for the salton sea environmental flows are just one of multiple beneficial uses that could be considered for such conservation efforts on the part of iid 3 methods to evaluate three different possible programs to generate beneficial flows that may be used for the salton sea we developed a constrained hydro economic optimization model that simulates water flows cropping patterns crop yields and profits in iid and evaluates inflows for the salton sea 3 1 salton sea water inflows annual inflow to the salton sea from iid can be expressed as 1 s i d w t w e w where si is inflows to the sea from iid dw is agricultural drainage water that travels through the soil profile flows tw is tail water agricultural surface runoff flows and ew represents direct transfers or mitigation water of colorado river water to the sea environmental water the salton sea water budget in eq 1 neglects rainfall which is only a few inches per year and assumes that the contribution of regional groundwater to agricultural drain flows is negligible california natural resources agency 2006 kaddah and rhoades 1976 we estimated si to be equal to the combined annual reported united states geologic survey usgs flows for the new and the alamo rivers minus the flows originating from mexico plus an additional 10 percent assumed to enter the sea through direct drains from iid california natural resources agency 2006 usgs 2004 2015 the estimated historical si values are shown in fig 2 during the entire qsa period after 2003 iid flows averaged about one maf per year although for the last few years 2013 to 2015 the average was lower about 965 thousand acre feet taf 3 2 imperial irrigation district iid water budget the iid has rights to 3 1 maf per year of colorado river water which is used for irrigation iw mitigation or other direct transfers to the salton sea ew transfers sales to other southern california urban water agencies uw unneeded or unused water ow and various miscellaneous and domestic uses in the iid service area mw 2 3 1 maf iw ew uw mw ow by far the largest water budget component is iw averaging 2 523 maf from 2013 to 2015 mw represents less than one percent of water allocation shields and pacheco 2016 uw and ew have both been increasing during the qsa period from 2013 to 2015 average uw was 304 taf and the average ew was 105 taf imperial irrigation district 2016a 3 3 farm level water budget and crop yield considering eq 1 it would seem that shifting water from iw to ew would directly increase salton sea inflow however it is not that straightforward reducing iw decreases drainage dw and tail water tw so increases in ew will be partially offset by decreases in dw and tw additionally the salinity of dw will likely increase to fully account for the effects of shifting water from iw to ew it is necessary to model the relationship between the depth of irrigation water applied at the farm level w and the drainage generated d this relationship is nonlinear because of feedback mechanisms that exist between irrigation amount irrigation water salinity root zone soil salinity and crop water use or yield both drainage d and crop yield y can be expressed as functions of w that depend on a number of crop and system parameters including the potential crop transpiration rate t p the amount of direct evaporation e the salt tolerance of the crop e c 50 the salinity of the irrigation water e c i w and the fraction of applied water that runs off the field as tail water t f 3 d w d w t p e e c 50 e c i w t f 4 y w y w t p e e c 50 e c i w t f y p as shown in appendix a1 we modeled eqs 3 and 4 using the steady state analytical approach of skaggs et al 2014 the model is an explicit analytical solution to a one dimensional steady state mass conservative physical mathematical model of root zone water uptake and solute transport processes the model accounts for the effects of irrigation and soil water salinity on crop growth we expand upon the functions of skaggs et al 2014 by incorporating evaporation as shown in appendix a2 crop specific parameter values for t p e y p and e c 50 are provided in table a2 for traditional irrigation methods which in iid have been flood and furrow irrigation transpiration and evaporation calculations are described in appendix a2 tail water runoff in iid has been estimated to range from a few percent to 30 percent with an iid average of about 17 percent bali et al 2001 we assume tf 0 17 for traditional irrigation methods a graphical representation of field level flows is shown in fig 3 farms in the iid receive colorado river water for irrigation via the all american canal whereas surface runoff and tile drainage flows are conveyed to the salton sea via the new and alamo rivers the irrigation water salinity e c i w is approximately 1 2 ds m in iid 3 4 optimization model and scenario modifications our optimization model follows the general farm level framework employed in levers and schwabe 2017 but is applied at a regional level the objective function maximizes regional farm profits which depends on profit per acre for a given crop c expressed as 5 π c p c h c y c q c h c w c p w where πc is profit per acre p c is crop price y c is actual crop yield eq 4 h c is yield related harvest costs h c is non yield related harvest cost per acre q c is production costs w c is applied water depth and p w is the price of water paid by farmers costs and crop prices high middle and low estimates for specific crops are given in table a2 to validate the model we first used it to evaluate a baseline scenario that is comparable to recent years 2013 2015 under the qsa after illustrating that the model performs well in representing actual conditions and agricultural outcomes under the qsa the model is used to evaluate three possible post 2017 water transfer programs 1 a fallowing program based on an iid program already in place 2 an efficient irrigation program also based on an existing program and 3 a direct water leasing program we evaluate these three hypothetical post 2017 water transfer programs in terms of costs generation of beneficial use water impacts on the salton sea in terms of return flows and beneficial use water that could be used as environmental water and agricultural profits we then provide estimates of the benefits from the literature to highlight whether and to what extent plans pass a benefit cost test 3 4 1 baseline for the 2013 2015 baseline scenario the objective function for maximizing profits π is 6 max x w π c π c x c subject to the following constraints 7 x c m i n x c x c m a x 8 c x c 450 000 a c 9 x c a r r o t x b r o c c o l i x l e t t u c e x o n i o n 112 500 a c 10 c x c w c 2 523 m a f where xc is the acreage for crop c and x and w are vectors of the decision variables xc and wc respectively eight crops comprising about two thirds of the cultivated area were chosen to represent the most commonly grown crops in the valley including four field crops alfalfa bermuda grass sudan grass and sugar beets and four garden crops broccoli onions carrots and lettuce imperial irrigation district 2017 the bounds imposed by eq 7 ensure that the simulated baseline cropping pattern is reasonably consistent with recent actual acreages reported for iid table a2 which indicated the majority of the cultivated acreage consists of field crops eq 8 caps total available farmland at 450 k acres the approximate average of cropped acreage in 2013 2015 shields and pacheco 2016 eq 9 limits garden crop acreage to 25 percent of the available farmland in accordance with recent cropping patterns imperial irrigation district 2017 eq 10 limits total irrigation to 2 523 maf which is the average water applied to crops in the baseline time period imperial irrigation district 2016a 3 4 2 post 2017 water leasing programs we consider three hypothetical programs where beneficial use water is leased from growers that could be used for maintenance of the salton sea the model allows us to analyze how different levels of flexibility offered to growers in terms of the strategies they can adopt to lease water impact grower profits and the amount of water growers are willing to lease by evaluating grower willingness to lease for different offered prices we can identify the opportunity costs to growers from engaging in particular types of water use reduction schemes to generate additional beneficial use water that can be used as inflows to the sea under different programs while the focus of our analysis is on the opportunity costs of generating inflows into the salton sea the policies evaluated focus on a single input irrigation water to achieve a particular level of inflows even though inflows consist of both environmental flows irrigation water purchases and drainage and tailwater inflows since drainage and tailwater inflows are similar to nonpoint sources and thus difficult to assign any specific inflow quantity to any particular farm it is reasonable to expect the policy to be implemented on the more easily measurable input irrigation water as such we are in effect comparing the cost effectiveness of three second best policies baumol and oates 1988 larson et al 1996 finally given the importance of crop prices to such opportunity costs sensitivity analysis is performed over a range of price levels high medium and low for each crop as shown in table a2 3 4 2 1 fallowing program the land fallowing program we analyze is based on a current iid program imperial irrigation district 2016a in exchange for fallowing land a farmer receives a set price per acre foot of water that would have been used had the land remained in production the fallowing program introduces a water lease payment to the farmer as illustrated in eq 11 11 max x w π c π c x c x c b x c w c b p f subject to the following constraints 12 0 8 x c b x c x c b 13 w c w c b where w c b is the depth of water applied to crop c in the baseline scenario p f is the price per acre foot paid for water leased conserved and x c b is the area of crop c in the baseline output eq 12 limits the amount of land that a grower can fallow to 20 percent of their baseline acreage the purpose is to restrict the fallowing program to active productive land this percentage is supported by california department of water resources cdwr which recommends agencies not approve transfers that result in more than twenty percent of a crop being fallowed cdwr and usbr 2015 eq 13 constrains the amount of water that can be applied to non fallowed land to baseline levels thereby ensuring that water is actually conserved to the extent that growers would shift water from their fallowed acreage over to non fallowed acreage our results underestimate the opportunity costs of such programs 3 4 2 2 improved irrigation efficiency program the second possible program we analyze referred to as the irrigation efficiency program is also based on an existing iid program imperial irrigation district 2016c under this program farmers are paid for water that is conserved due to the adoption of more water efficient irrigation practices and technologies with traditional iid irrigation methods opportunities for farm level conservation could include reduced conveyance losses reduced tail water fractions and reduced evaporative water losses from improved irrigation systems or other methods given that tail water and drainage make up part of the salton sea inflows real water savings from changing irrigation methods arise from reducing evaporative losses assuming crop transpiration varies minimally across irrigation methods drip irrigation particularly subsurface drip irrigation has been touted as a means to minimize evaporative water losses due to reduced soil surface wetting ayars et al 2015 although in some instances that effect has been found to be offset by a need for more frequent irrigation burt et al 2005 nonetheless subsurface drip has been found to reduce overall water use by up to 25 percent alam et al 2009 emerging technologies for reducing evaporation include sprayable biodegradable polymer membranes that cover the soil surface adhikari et al 2015 johnston et al 2016 recognizing that most irrigation in iid is flood or furrow we develop two estimates to represent the annual costs i of improving irrigation efficiency 400 ac and 800 ac these values were chosen to show approximate yearly costs of improved irrigation the university of california cooperative extension cost and return publications indicate approximately a 400 difference in yearly cost between flood and drip irrigation for alfalfa mayberry and meister 2003a putnam et al 2014 a range of 500 to 1800 per year cost for drip irrigation on small vegetable farms is given by the university of florida extension simonne et al 2012 using data from amosson et al 2002 which estimates cost by applied water volume the additional yearly cost of subsurface drip irrigation for alfalfa would be over 600 this does not include additional investment costs of 1000 per acre all publication costs were adjusted for inflation we assume that implementation of this more efficient irrigation technology will reduce evaporative water losses by 50 percent and eliminate tail water runoff yet drainage is still estimated by eq 3 given these assumptions our optimization framework is defined as follows 14 max x w w e π c π c x c π c e x c e 15 π c e p c h c y c q c i h c w c e p w w c b w c e p r subject to the following constraints 16 x c e x c x c b 17 w c w c b 18 y c e y c b where w c e is the depth of water applied to crops with the improved irrigation system x c e is the acreage with improved irrigation and p r is the price per acre foot paid for saved water eq 18 dictates that the yield per acre in the fields with improved irrigation y c e must not be lower than the baseline yields this ensures that purchased water is truly conserved water and prevents farmers from artificially elevating water sales when a crop is less profitable which is a requirement of the current iid program as well note that if eliminated tail water is converted to environmental water no net change in modeled salton sea inflows occurs because the changes to tw and ew offset each other one for one from a volume perspective eq 1 although there will likely be water quality differences note that tail water reductions do have a farm scale economic impact since growers are not only compensated for the water savings but also purchase less water under this strategy though new environmental water is generated only through reduced evaporative losses 3 4 2 3 direct water leasing program the direct leasing program allows for water to be purchased from farmers on a year to year basis growers and our model can adopt a variety of water savings strategies including any combination of deficit irrigation improvements in irrigation efficiency changing crop mix and land fallowing the optimization framework for this strategy is represented as 19 max x w w l π c π c x c w c l p l subject to the following constraints 20 0 8 x c b x c x c b 21 w c l 0 2 w c b where p l is the amount per acre foot paid to lease water for other beneficial uses including environmental transfers similar to the fallowing program above only 20 percent of the baseline crop area can be fallowed eq 20 and only 20 percent of the baseline water can be leased eq 21 again the constraints are intended to restrict the program to farmers who continue to be active productive growers and capture elements of current programs that are implemented for these reasons as well as to reduce potential third party effects while each of these programs consists of leasing water it is useful to recall that water rights in the western u s are generally tied to specific lands and beneficial uses whereas the first two programs actively conserve water through changes in crop management under constraints that eliminate any gaming by the growers e g restricting water use on other crops the flexibility associated with this last program may result in growers applying less water yet not suffering any crop yield or revenue losses if previously the growers were operating far to the right and on the relatively flat part of their crop water production function in principle reducing water use with no adverse effect on yield may call into question the beneficial use of the water in the first place and thus create a potential challenge to the water rights themselves such a discussion while important goes beyond our focus 4 results 4 1 baseline the baseline scenario is intended to be comparable to iid water use and production during recent years 2013 2015 under the conditions of the qsa we assumed ew was equal to the average mitigation water for those years which was 105 taf the baseline results for crop acreages applied water rates relative yields and regional profits using the midrange crop prices are shown in tables 1 and 2 the estimated water flows for the baseline scenario are in reasonable agreement with available data and the optimized irrigation rates for different crops are compatible with reported irrigation rates for example the model estimated applied water of 7 8 feet for alfalfa is comparable to the value of 7 feet reported by summers and putnam 2008 and the estimate of 2 9 feet for onions is comparable to the range of 2 5 to 3 feet reported in pelter and sorensen 1999 the leaching fractions calculated for different crops varied greatly between 9 and 47 being much larger for garden crops than for field crops however the applied water for garden crops is significantly lower than that of field crops so despite the wide ranging leaching fractions the amount of water leached was relatively uniform ranging from 7 to 14 in for field crops and 7 to 16 in for garden crops the calculated area weighted average leaching fraction for iid was 20 8 percent which is compatible with the historical iid leaching fraction of 19 percent reported by gibson 2012 total profits for the region using midrange crop prices were 365 million results using low and high crop prices show no significant qualitative differences and are available from the authors upon request we do not have data for actual profits but the average revenue for field crops from 2013 to 2015 was 1559 per acre which is similar to the average revenue generated in our model for field crops 1521 per acre for garden crops the reported revenue was 6560 per acre which compares with our generated value of 5810 per acre valenzuela 2014 2016 the modeled sea inflow equal to the sum of the mitigation water and calculated drainage and tail water flows was 941 taf which compares reasonably well with the 965 taf calculated from usgs data see section 3 2 the model predicts 81 taf of the available 2 523 maf was left unused this is not necessarily unrealistic however as the imperial irrigation district has consistently underused water between 2013 and 2017 with annual underruns varying between 797 acre feet and 97 188 acre feet james 2018 with a mean of 56 taf over the 2013 2015 period imperial irrigation district 2016a besides simply not needing all the water a number of possible other reasons may explain this for example the tail water fraction we use from bali et al 2001 could be too low rerunning the baseline model with a slightly higher tail water fraction eliminates the unused water it is also possible that actual irrigation depths in iid for some or all crops were greater than the optimal level determined by the model the calculated salinity of the inflow meanwhile was 3 0 ds m while we do not have data for direct comparison we note that the salinities of the main channels for conveying water to the sea the alamo river and the new river were 3 1 ds m and 4 1 ds m respectively between 2004 and 2010 cdwr 2011 the objective of the remainder of this paper is to evaluate the opportunity costs of generating beneficial use water that can be used as environmental flows into the salton sea under different water leasing programs in the absence of mandated mitigation and while accounting for the implications on return flows to the sea in the coming years the terms of the qsa will allow iid to sell up to an additional 174 taf of conserved water to san diego county water authority sdcwa and to coachella valley water district imperial irrigation district and san diego county water authority 2003 considering that the qsa mitigation transfer requirements will cease the conservation required to generate a net increase of about 69 taf of additional transfers is largely already in place the profitability is great for these transfers san diego pays more than 600 per ac ft san diego county water authority 2016 a large sum relative to the 20 per ac ft that farmers pay imperial irrigation district 2016b consequently any profit maximizing analysis always chooses transfers not shown hence we assume that in coming years uw urban water transfers will be 174 taf more than the average sold between 2013 and 2015 that the 105 taf of mitigation water under the qsa will cease and that iid conservation programs currently in place remain including fallowing thus with these assumptions plus the assumption that mw miscellaneous iid water remains approximately 1 of the water allocations we focus on the portion of the water budget that can be allocated to iw ew and ow as follows 22 2 454 maf iw ew o rerunning the baseline model accounting for the 69 taf lower water constraint has minimal to no effect on model outputs except for the unused water ow variable which is lower by a negligible 11 taf 4 2 fallowing program since crops have different potential profits as well as different water requirements the opportunity costs of fallowing a particular crop depends on the foregone profits per acre foot of water conserved table 3 shows the average profit generated from an acre foot of water by crop and crop price this profit represents the value the water holds to the farmer from growing different crops and highlights how a farmer s willingness to participate in a water leasing program is a function of both crop type and crop price knowledge of the extent to which particular low e g sudan grass alfalfa and high revenue e g broccoli lettuce crops are being cultivated provides a rough estimate of the amount of land that might be enrolled in such a program at different water leasing prices fig 4 illustrates the relationship between the lease price p f and the regional water balance components si ew dw and tw total cost and salinity of the salton sea inflows assuming mid level crop prices note that direct transfers ew is the total water leased from the farmers as such the relationship between the ew quantity and the lease price is akin to a supply curve of water under this program the jumps in the curves indicate the price points at which it becomes profitable to fallow additional land and thus make water available for lease recall that land fallowing for a given crop is capped at 20 percent without any additional program in place following the end of the qsa s requirement that mitigation water be sent to the sea sea inflows are around 850 taf comprised entirely of water from drainage and tail water runoff in fig 4 a this is illustrated by the intersection of the si curve with the y axis as the lease price for water via land fallowing increases sea inflows increase along with the total cost while drainage tail water flows and salinity of the inflows decrease if the state wanted to achieve historic sea inflows of one maf for example the total cost of the program would be approximately 28 million which increases overall grower profits by about a third of a percent value of the water to the growers represented by lost agricultural sales is almost 27 million as shown in fig 5 a this inflow is achieved with the per acre foot lease price set at 79 ac ft compensating growers for the foregone agricultural profits from fallowing their land and results in approximately 360 taf of environmental water and 730 taf of drainage and tail water inflows salinity of the inflows drops from the baseline inflow salinity of 3 5 ds m to 3 2 ds m of course since this is a terminal lake overall salinity will increase over time but at a slower pace under the fallowing program and at a level that will require less desalination if and when such strategies are implemented as suggested in the 10 year plan cdwr 2017 as illustrated in figs 4 and 5 the low cost strategy to generate inflows for the salton sea is the fallowing program unless inflows exceeding the fallowing program s upper limit are desired in fig 5 a we show the relationship between total profits to growers from engaging in this program total profit profits from farming farming profit the profit from leasing the water which is the same as the cost of purchasing the water water profit ew cost versus price per acre foot of leased water at 79 ac ft the revenue received from leasing the water is slightly greater than the lost agricultural profits from fallowing their land i e the lease price is greater than or equal to the foregone profits for all acres enrolled this result is obtained by fallowing approximately 20 percent of the sudan grass and alfalfa acreage which constitutes about 10 percent of the total farm area while not shown for different crop price levels the opportunity cost of fallowing changes and thus so will the lease price to generate any particular level of environmental flows for instance under the high crop price scenario a lease price of 113 ac ft would be required to generate inflows of approximately one maf consisting of environmental water drainage and tail water as a point of comparison growers that participate in the existing fallowing program currently receive 175 ac ft a premium above and beyond the opportunity cost to the farmer thereby indicating a positive shadow value on the acreage constraint additional results from high and low price runs are available from the authors but do not show any significant qualitative differences 4 3 improved irrigation efficiency program fig 4 b shows results for the improved irrigation efficiency program assuming the lower cost estimate for improving irrigation efficiency 400 per acre annually similarly to fig 4 a jumps in the curves occur at prices where it becomes profitable to invest in improved irrigation technology for a particular crop crop prices are less important here in determining the jump points because the decision to switch to efficient irrigation depends on whether the additional irrigation costs can be recouped with water conservation payments a calculation that depends on the irrigation system costs as well as the amount of potential evaporation reductions thus as the lease price increases irrigation efficiency improvements will occur first on land cultivated with crops that have higher total seasonal evaporative water losses table a2 in our case irrigation improvements occur first on land cultivated with alfalfa which would require a water lease price of about 183 ac ft to trigger enrollment as shown in fig 4 b at 183 ac ft 370 taf of environmental water is generated in comparison the fallowing program generated almost the same amount of environmental water 360 taf at a much lower price of 79 ac ft note also that while environmental flows may be higher with the irrigation program overall sea inflows are lower and inflow salinity higher relative to the fallowing scenario the total expenditures at 183 ac ft shown in both fig 4 b and fig 5 b amount to approximately 68 million in environmental water costs roughly 2 5 times the expenditures required under the fallowing program with negligible effects on grower profits drainage and tail water inflows to the sea are estimated about around 560 taf 70 taf less than under the fallowing program it is important to highlight that the efficiency program costs are exorbitant because saved water ew is generated through reduced evaporation alone via improving irrigation system technologies farm profits are reduced significantly compared to fallowing which increases the value of applied water and therefore increases the cost of the program if one assumes the higher irrigation cost estimate i 800 ac the costs of this program approximately double the takeaway here is that high payments are needed to induce changes in irrigation of lucrative garden crops and that relatively little evaporative water is available for conservation from those crops however when different irrigation methods are used agricultural yields are minimally affected 4 4 direct leasing program fig 4 c shows results for the direct leasing program using midrange crop prices relative to the previous figures these curves are smoother a result of the more flexible program which allows growers a larger array of strategies to conserve water for leasing including deficit irrigation notable is how for any positive lease price growers are incentivized to conserve some amount of water which is in stark contrast to the other two strategies in effect internal margin adjustments such as lower applied water rates are a cost effective means to save water rather than relying entirely on a more extensive margin strategy such as land fallowing or changes in irrigation technology schwabe et al 2006 adamson et al 2017 in terms of external margin adjustments at the lower lease prices sudan grass is fallowed first followed by alfalfa because of its relatively low water requirement and high profit margin per unit of water lettuce is the last crop to be fallowed and at a lease price of 1400 ac ft or higher not shown under the direct lease program we estimate that a lease price of 60 ac ft would generate approximately 300 taf of environmental water and approximately 600 taf of drainage and tail water at a cost of around 18 million significantly less on a per acre unit of environmental water relative to the other two scenarios relative to the other two scenarios we see a significant reduction in drainage relative to tail water a result of less applied water arising from deficit irrigation additionally inflow salinity decreases by more relative to the irrigation scenario yet achieves only a slight salinity reduction relative to the fallowing option at 60 ac ft largely a result of the fact that at that price there is no fallowing to generate a historic inflow of around one maf the lease price would need to be 89 ac ft a value higher than the land fallowing option since the model is not being optimized to minimize the costs of generating inflows but rather to maximize grower profits given a particular lease price and the constraints identified above to illustrate the relative efficiency of the three water leasing strategies fig 5 presents total costs of supply under each of the three programs as well as farm profits and value of leased water opportunity cost to farmers however if a remediation plan called for fresh water flows not mixed inflow which consist of unpriced drainage and tail water flows the direct leasing program is the lowest cost as it can provide more environmental water at a lower cost recall that there is not a linear relationship between purchased water and inflows this is not surprising and is consistent with previous program evaluations e g fig 1 in qureshi et al 2010 given that the flexibility associated with this strategy allows growers to choose their least cost approach to generate water for leasing either through fallowing irrigation improvements deficit irrigation or crop switching also notable is the extent to which the direct leasing program can appropriate significantly more water than either the fallowing program or the efficiency improvement program with direct leasing individual crop yield is minimally affected never dropping below 97 percent again results from high and low price runs do not show any significant qualitative differences 5 discussion and conclusions the purpose of this paper was to compare three widely discussed and often used strategies to lease water in terms of the opportunity costs to generate water savings and the potential externalities associated with such savings our focus was on investigating the opportunity costs to agricultural operators in southern california to generate water for leasing under a fallowing program an irrigation efficiency program and a flexible direct lease program with the water going to the salton sea a terminal lake which is likely to shrink in the coming years under a no action policy with severe ecological and human health repercussions such a reduction in both volume and shore line has been estimated to result in damages of approximately 11 to 70 billion over the next thirty years under a no action policy cohen 2014 our model estimates that the opportunity costs of water associated with the three programs analyzed vary widely while the direct lease program is the least cost method for purchasing environmental water given the wide array of low cost strategies growers can choose from to conserve water it results in the greatest reduction in drainage flows and tail water runoff since both these and purchased environmental water contribute to the salton sea consideration of the potential externalities of programs that incorporate such flexibility e g water markets is warranted because of the high water application rates water use reductions may have limited impact on overall production a positive benefit in response to concerns over third party effects e g employment income that are often raised when such water transfers are discussed indeed our model shows that the direct water leasing program results in reduced water application rates and some land fallowing with total crop production reduced by only a few percent even at the lowest crop prices evaluated the fallowing program given the relatively smaller impacts on return flows than the other two strategies produces the greatest total inflows at the lowest costs this is an important finding given that fallowing programs often get criticized as being an inefficient means of generating beneficial use water because of their limited options especially when compared to water markets yet when one expands the scope of analysis to consider return flows and the potential external benefits associated with such flows the system efficiency of a fallowing program likely compares much more favorably with water markets of course if individual contributions to the inflows were both measurable and assignable the pricing of or market for inflows would achieve the efficient solution in terms of third party effects farm production is not substantially reduced given fallowing occurs on the low value field crops and recalling eq 12 we limit fallowing to at most 20 of the acreage even when over a million acre feet of inflows are generated only 7 of production profit is lost see fig 5 the crops that are fallowed are field crops such as sudan grass and alfalfa and not higher valued garden crops like broccoli and carrots given that much of the cultivated alfalfa and sudan grass is exported and that the fallowed field crops represent much less than one percent of the us production e g 131 million tons of hay were produced in 2017 impacts on local feed markets or global crop prices are likely to be minimal nass 2018 blake 2017 guerrero 2008 pierson 2014 lastly improving irrigation efficiencies was the most costly approach to producing inflows to the salton sea given the high costs of irrigation system upgrades and the fact that this method only generates water through reduced evaporation the irrigation program is distinct from the other two in that the cost is driven by irrigation system costs and not crop prices on the plus side irrigation efficiency improvements did not change output and thus there were no third party effects associated with this strategy as discussed in the introduction there are various entities vying for water we have focused on the salton sea as it represents an important environmental water use that is currently experiencing substantial water related damages however the colorado river delta in mexico has long been deprived of its historical colorado river flows resulting in substantial ecological changes one may argue the water could have higher value there than in the salton sea additionally there are several other agricultural and urban regions who may be interested in purchasing water were it to be made available on an open market particularly mexican and arizonan agricultural interests and municipal interests in southern california e g san diego and los angeles these players would ultimately have to be considered in any potential water transfers nonetheless these hydro economic analyses indicate that leasing programs are capable of generating significant environmental water flows for the sea with relatively small decreases in agricultural production and limited to no decrease in overall grower profits the estimated damages of doing nothing at the salton sea are in the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars per year cohen 2014 the cost of the comprehensive restoration plan is in the low hundreds of millions per year our results indicate that a great deal of water could be purchased for the sea at a fraction of the cost potentially mitigating damages and helping save a great deal money in terms of sustainability the programs described here can serve as an integral element to both a short and long term fix in the short term they can provide the necessary water nearly immediately to i keep the system from crashing by reducing the rate of salinization and sustaining current bird and fish populations and ii reduce the amount of exposed dust emitting playa and the consequent air quality related health impacts over the next 5 to 10 years as other short term mitigation efforts are implemented in the long term they can serve as a low cost means to generate inflows to the sea and free up scarce public dollars for other identified long term mitigative efforts unlike the suggestions in the restoration plans the water market solutions presented here already have the needed infrastructure in place and could theoretically be workable in short order acknowledgements the data used are listed in the references tables and appendices appendix a1 farm level crop yield and drainage we use a crop water production model derived in skaggs et al 2014 to estimate crop yield crop yield y as a function of the depth of applied water w is calculated as a1 y w y r w y p where yp is potential crop yield and yr w is

summation of both over the growing season results in the estimated potential transpiration and evaporation for crops with multiple cutting periods transpiration and evaporation are estimated for each

11201,as societies confront greater levels of water scarcity conflict follows water transfers are increasing with irrigation water regularly considered in such discussions given it often comprises the bulk of water rights within a particular region especially in water scarce environments here we analyze the impacts of three widely considered and implemented strategies to purchase water from irrigated agriculture land fallowing improvements in irrigation efficiency and direct leasing our empirical application involves water transfers from colorado river water rights holders to the salton sea a critical ecological resource that has been in decline for many decades with environmental damages estimated in the tens of billions of dollars we develop a regional hydro economic model that accounts for essential field level agro hydrologic processes related to crop production irrigation and salinity to evaluate the cost effectiveness of these three programs results indicate that both fallow and direct water lease programs are capable of generating significant environmental water flows with relatively small decreases in agricultural production and no appreciable decrease in grower profits because these policies focus on a single input applied water rather than overall inflows to the sea the direct lease program which is the most cost effective approach for generating water conservation may result in less inflows into the sea than a land fallowing program keywords crop water functions salinity management water markets regional agricultural water management salton sea water transfers environmental water 1 introduction as population wealth and climate change concerns continue to increase significant attention and effort has been devoted to reducing water scarcity particularly in the agricultural environmental and urban sectors urban and agricultural users have traditionally reduced scarcity through water grabs often from faraway places schwabe and connor 2012 this approach required the development of significant and expensive storage and conveyance systems that in effect changed the spatial and temporal distribution of water with rising demand and the lack of opportunities to find untapped and unclaimed inexpensive sources of water efforts to reduce water scarcity increasingly have focused on a reallocation of water among sectors efforts to reallocate water are frequently if not always contentious involving adversarial claims about water rights and the private and public benefits of different forms of water use and consumption hanak et al 2011 these efforts almost inevitably involve irrigated agriculture due to the significant amount of water resources it withdraws for instance nearly 69 of freshwater withdrawals worldwide are withdrawn for irrigated agricultural production with percentages in california and australia s murray darling basin exceeding 80 schwabe et al 2013 from a policy perspective appropriating water from irrigated agriculture for either urban or environmental purposes is challenging much of the water use by irrigated agriculture is based on senior water rights held under prior appropriation and beneficial use doctrines governments in response have considered tried and enacted a variety of approaches to appropriate water from irrigated agriculture one approach is legislative an example of which is found in california under the central valley project improvement act cvpia of 1992 the cvpia is u s federal legislation that reallocated a portion of water away from irrigated agriculture for environmental concerns and an act that continues to face conflict and litigation today hanak et al 2011 another avenue is incentive based approaches that encourage growers to irrigate more efficiently and allow them to maintain water rights however scheierling et al 2006 and ward and pulido velazquez 2008 found that subsidies for improved irrigation were unlikely to reduce overall agricultural water consumption a third approach is fallowing programs where farmers are essentially paid for their water these programs have been used in times of drought and as long term solutions in arid regions radonic 2014 escriva bou et al 2016 lofman et al 2002 lastly water markets are being employed to reallocate water often from irrigated agricultural uses to urban and environmental uses when allocations are driven at least in part by economic markets and valuations trade offs between often higher value low water volume urban uses and lower value high water volume agricultural uses can be evaluated and have been for many years with economic optimization models booker and young 1994 colby saliba et al 1987 donohew 2009 howe et al 1986 brewer et al 2006 howitt 1994 australia provides a significant example of a water market in which trades are made for the environment with most of the water being leased purchased from irrigated agriculture wheeler et al 2013 connell 2015 for example qureshi et al 2010 found that a flexible water market was a much more cost effective means of increasing environmental flows in the murray darling basin then a less flexible irrigation subsidy scheme given the continuing interest in and use of land fallowing and irrigation efficiency programs to generate water savings for short or long term reallocations the intention of this paper is to compare these approaches with a water market and thus highlight the perceived efficiencies of these schemes such a comparison has important policy implications along two fronts first further evidence of the cost effectiveness of more flexible schemes such as water markets which are advocated by economists is important when one considers the challenges to appropriate scarce public dollars to shift water to the environment or other public benefits second a narrow focus on the costs to agriculture of reducing water use or the required payments to incentivize such reductions as the primary metric to evaluate alternative strategies may overlook potentially important externalities associated with such strategies namely the impacts on return flows which can provide significant consumption production or preservation recreational benefits to society while our focus is comparing three different water leasing schemes for environmental flows into the salton sea in southern california the structure of our analysis and comparison of alternative water saving schemes can be applied to any region worldwide and for any beneficial use of water a second intention of this paper is to illustrate the importance of hydrological modeling and maintaining water balance in hydro economic models evaluating the benefits of alternative schemes to make additional water available for sale or lease especially when it comes to environmental water water market researchers and modelers are increasingly aware of the importance of maintaining water balance in their crop water production functions rosegrant et al 2000 zaman et al 2009 yet less attention has been paid to agricultural return flows generated from drainage or runoff cai et al 2003 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 qureshi et al 2010 indeed all of the approaches mentioned above that are intended to save water require designing institutional technical and accounting measures that accurately track and economically reward reduced water conservation ward and pulido velazquez p 18 215 without such attention true savings may not be achieved due to either failure to acknowledge the loss in return flows or the additional water use that may occur via a rebound effect associated with behavioral adjustments that accompany changes in costs and or efficiencies finally we illustrate that water leasing schemes differ not only in terms of costs and return flows back to the environment but also possibly in terms of the quality of the water returning to the environment an issue that has not been illustrated in previous policy comparisons in the example evaluated here we find that the salinity of the return flows differ across schemes an outcome that can be extremely important in regions worldwide including significant parts of california and australia that confront salinity issues schwabe et al 2006 to perform our analysis we develop a regional hydro economic model to assess leasing i e year to year purchasing of water for environmental flows which could mitigate ongoing environmental damages while minimizing impacts to the local agricultural economy our programming model accounts for essential field level agro hydrologic processes including nonlinear relationships and feedback mechanisms that exist among irrigation water volume irrigation water quality evaporation soil salinity drainage water volume drainage water quality and crop yield the model and analysis are designed to provide a timely evaluation of one of the most pressing environmental and water related issues in california today the salton sea similar to other terminal lakes such as the aral sea basin the quantity and quality of flows into the sea are threatened by upstream activity very expensive and protracted restoration plans have been developed which would reduce damages to the sea under lower flow regimes california department of water resources 2007 california department of water resources and united states bureau of reclamation 2015 yet little attention has been paid to the possibility of leasing purchasing water from regional agricultural operators and the costs of alternative strategies to acquire that water while legal and water rights issues both at the state and federal levels present significant barriers to such a scheme there is precedence in the past for directing water conserved by agricultural operators with senior colorado river water rights to the salton sea qsa 2003 given the potential benefits of preserving the salton sea are enormous cohen 2014 an analysis of water leasing schemes seems warranted regardless of current regulations and policies particularly considering that these schemes could be implemented relatively quickly as they would require no physical construction while our analysis considers the costs of the different policy instruments to generate environmental water for the sea with recognition of the consequent impact on quantity and quality of return flows from drainage and runoff into the sea one could also view these strategies as generating beneficial use water for other sectors purposes including agricultural or urban uses 2 water for the environment the salton sea the salton sea california s largest lake by surface area 340 square miles is a terminal lake located in southeastern california since its formation in the early 1900s the salton sea has served as a rest stop for millions of migratory birds traveling along the pacific flyway and year round habitat for several endangered and sensitive species including the desert pupfish yuma clapper rail and burrowing owl audubon california 2016 u s fish and wildlife services 2011 in the 1950s and 1960s the salton sea was one of the most popular recreation sites in california with more visitors annually than yosemite national park schwabe et al 2008 for much of the 20th century the water level of the sea was maintained by inflows consisting mostly of drainage water traveling through the soil profile and tail waters water traveling across the soil surface emanating from farmland around the sea waters laden with salts and fertilizers that have caused significant deterioration schwabe et al 2008 as a terminal lake its salinity increased rapidly during the last century due to evapoconcentration of salts few fish species can tolerate the present salinity levels of nearly 60 ppt an outcome that also affects the bird species that rely on these fish the primary source of drainage water is from the imperial irrigation district iid directly to the south iid which provides water for 440 to 540 thousand cultivated acres king 2007 ross 2010 shields and pacheco 2016 silva 2013 has among the most senior rights and largest share of colorado river water 3 1 million acre feet maf as most of the farmland uses furrow irrigation there is significant drainage and tail water that ends up in the main drainage canals that empty into the alamo and new rivers which empty into the salton sea fig 1 in addition to salinization the sea is shrinking due to decreased inflows partly as a result of the 2003 quantification settlement agreement qsa the qsa is a federal state local agreement that allowed the transfer of a large amount of irrigation water from iid to urban users in southern california qsa 2003 because of the expected reduced inflows as a result of the qsa s out of region transfers the state of california mandated mitigation water transfers be made by iid directly to the sea to keep increases in salton sea salinity at or below levels that would have occurred without the qsa urban water transfers nevertheless flows into the sea have decreased by approximately 10 since enactment of the qsa tetra tech 2016 usbr 2000 in 2017 the mitigation transfers stopped and thus inflows will likely further decrease resulting in an acceleration of the salinization and shrinking of the sea if no other action is taken by 2021 the sea will become too saline for fish populations another 25 years will see the salinity even too high for brine shrimp to thrive leading to algal and microbial populations rising unchecked these ecological conditions will severely affect the ability of the sea to sustain migratory birds cohen and hyun 2006 the estimated public damages from allowing the sea to continue to decline are significant expected damages from lower flows are estimated at between 11 and 70 billion over the next 30 years and include health impacts from increased respiratory illnesses associated with higher concentrations of airborne particulates from exposed playa decreased property values decreased recreation and the loss of nonuse values associated with wildlife habitat cohen 2014 in response to these possible damages the state proposed a 70 year plan that included making the sea smaller and less saline diverting salts into a brine sink developing habitat and employing dust management capital and operation and maintenance costs were estimated to be about 10 6 billion initially plus 169 million annually california department of water resources 2007 with the long term plan currently lacking funding the state more recently released a lower cost interim plan that identifies proposed actions to be taken over the next ten years california natural resources agency 2017 while the ten year plan does not address the salinity of the sea nor does it alter the size of the sea it acknowledges that rising salinity will likely still render the sea unusable to many species which in turn may have repercussions for the effectiveness of the habitat created see table a1 for a comparison of the plans in the next section we discuss the model we develop to evaluate possible policy strategies to generate additional beneficial use water to help address the region s water scarcity with particular attention towards maintaining environmental inflows to the salton sea similar to the efforts under the qsa to generate mitigation water as inflows to the salton sea we evaluate an extension of those efforts under different policy strategies that incentivize water conservation by iid agricultural operators with recognition of the return flows to the sea which are tracked via imposing water balance on our model results we emphasize that while our focus is on the cost effectiveness of more flexible policies in generating environmental flows for the salton sea environmental flows are just one of multiple beneficial uses that could be considered for such conservation efforts on the part of iid 3 methods to evaluate three different possible programs to generate beneficial flows that may be used for the salton sea we developed a constrained hydro economic optimization model that simulates water flows cropping patterns crop yields and profits in iid and evaluates inflows for the salton sea 3 1 salton sea water inflows annual inflow to the salton sea from iid can be expressed as 1 s i d w t w e w where si is inflows to the sea from iid dw is agricultural drainage water that travels through the soil profile flows tw is tail water agricultural surface runoff flows and ew represents direct transfers or mitigation water of colorado river water to the sea environmental water the salton sea water budget in eq 1 neglects rainfall which is only a few inches per year and assumes that the contribution of regional groundwater to agricultural drain flows is negligible california natural resources agency 2006 kaddah and rhoades 1976 we estimated si to be equal to the combined annual reported united states geologic survey usgs flows for the new and the alamo rivers minus the flows originating from mexico plus an additional 10 percent assumed to enter the sea through direct drains from iid california natural resources agency 2006 usgs 2004 2015 the estimated historical si values are shown in fig 2 during the entire qsa period after 2003 iid flows averaged about one maf per year although for the last few years 2013 to 2015 the average was lower about 965 thousand acre feet taf 3 2 imperial irrigation district iid water budget the iid has rights to 3 1 maf per year of colorado river water which is used for irrigation iw mitigation or other direct transfers to the salton sea ew transfers sales to other southern california urban water agencies uw unneeded or unused water ow and various miscellaneous and domestic uses in the iid service area mw 2 3 1 maf iw ew uw mw ow by far the largest water budget component is iw averaging 2 523 maf from 2013 to 2015 mw represents less than one percent of water allocation shields and pacheco 2016 uw and ew have both been increasing during the qsa period from 2013 to 2015 average uw was 304 taf and the average ew was 105 taf imperial irrigation district 2016a 3 3 farm level water budget and crop yield considering eq 1 it would seem that shifting water from iw to ew would directly increase salton sea inflow however it is not that straightforward reducing iw decreases drainage dw and tail water tw so increases in ew will be partially offset by decreases in dw and tw additionally the salinity of dw will likely increase to fully account for the effects of shifting water from iw to ew it is necessary to model the relationship between the depth of irrigation water applied at the farm level w and the drainage generated d this relationship is nonlinear because of feedback mechanisms that exist between irrigation amount irrigation water salinity root zone soil salinity and crop water use or yield both drainage d and crop yield y can be expressed as functions of w that depend on a number of crop and system parameters including the potential crop transpiration rate t p the amount of direct evaporation e the salt tolerance of the crop e c 50 the salinity of the irrigation water e c i w and the fraction of applied water that runs off the field as tail water t f 3 d w d w t p e e c 50 e c i w t f 4 y w y w t p e e c 50 e c i w t f y p as shown in appendix a1 we modeled eqs 3 and 4 using the steady state analytical approach of skaggs et al 2014 the model is an explicit analytical solution to a one dimensional steady state mass conservative physical mathematical model of root zone water uptake and solute transport processes the model accounts for the effects of irrigation and soil water salinity on crop growth we expand upon the functions of skaggs et al 2014 by incorporating evaporation as shown in appendix a2 crop specific parameter values for t p e y p and e c 50 are provided in table a2 for traditional irrigation methods which in iid have been flood and furrow irrigation transpiration and evaporation calculations are described in appendix a2 tail water runoff in iid has been estimated to range from a few percent to 30 percent with an iid average of about 17 percent bali et al 2001 we assume tf 0 17 for traditional irrigation methods a graphical representation of field level flows is shown in fig 3 farms in the iid receive colorado river water for irrigation via the all american canal whereas surface runoff and tile drainage flows are conveyed to the salton sea via the new and alamo rivers the irrigation water salinity e c i w is approximately 1 2 ds m in iid 3 4 optimization model and scenario modifications our optimization model follows the general farm level framework employed in levers and schwabe 2017 but is applied at a regional level the objective function maximizes regional farm profits which depends on profit per acre for a given crop c expressed as 5 π c p c h c y c q c h c w c p w where πc is profit per acre p c is crop price y c is actual crop yield eq 4 h c is yield related harvest costs h c is non yield related harvest cost per acre q c is production costs w c is applied water depth and p w is the price of water paid by farmers costs and crop prices high middle and low estimates for specific crops are given in table a2 to validate the model we first used it to evaluate a baseline scenario that is comparable to recent years 2013 2015 under the qsa after illustrating that the model performs well in representing actual conditions and agricultural outcomes under the qsa the model is used to evaluate three possible post 2017 water transfer programs 1 a fallowing program based on an iid program already in place 2 an efficient irrigation program also based on an existing program and 3 a direct water leasing program we evaluate these three hypothetical post 2017 water transfer programs in terms of costs generation of beneficial use water impacts on the salton sea in terms of return flows and beneficial use water that could be used as environmental water and agricultural profits we then provide estimates of the benefits from the literature to highlight whether and to what extent plans pass a benefit cost test 3 4 1 baseline for the 2013 2015 baseline scenario the objective function for maximizing profits π is 6 max x w π c π c x c subject to the following constraints 7 x c m i n x c x c m a x 8 c x c 450 000 a c 9 x c a r r o t x b r o c c o l i x l e t t u c e x o n i o n 112 500 a c 10 c x c w c 2 523 m a f where xc is the acreage for crop c and x and w are vectors of the decision variables xc and wc respectively eight crops comprising about two thirds of the cultivated area were chosen to represent the most commonly grown crops in the valley including four field crops alfalfa bermuda grass sudan grass and sugar beets and four garden crops broccoli onions carrots and lettuce imperial irrigation district 2017 the bounds imposed by eq 7 ensure that the simulated baseline cropping pattern is reasonably consistent with recent actual acreages reported for iid table a2 which indicated the majority of the cultivated acreage consists of field crops eq 8 caps total available farmland at 450 k acres the approximate average of cropped acreage in 2013 2015 shields and pacheco 2016 eq 9 limits garden crop acreage to 25 percent of the available farmland in accordance with recent cropping patterns imperial irrigation district 2017 eq 10 limits total irrigation to 2 523 maf which is the average water applied to crops in the baseline time period imperial irrigation district 2016a 3 4 2 post 2017 water leasing programs we consider three hypothetical programs where beneficial use water is leased from growers that could be used for maintenance of the salton sea the model allows us to analyze how different levels of flexibility offered to growers in terms of the strategies they can adopt to lease water impact grower profits and the amount of water growers are willing to lease by evaluating grower willingness to lease for different offered prices we can identify the opportunity costs to growers from engaging in particular types of water use reduction schemes to generate additional beneficial use water that can be used as inflows to the sea under different programs while the focus of our analysis is on the opportunity costs of generating inflows into the salton sea the policies evaluated focus on a single input irrigation water to achieve a particular level of inflows even though inflows consist of both environmental flows irrigation water purchases and drainage and tailwater inflows since drainage and tailwater inflows are similar to nonpoint sources and thus difficult to assign any specific inflow quantity to any particular farm it is reasonable to expect the policy to be implemented on the more easily measurable input irrigation water as such we are in effect comparing the cost effectiveness of three second best policies baumol and oates 1988 larson et al 1996 finally given the importance of crop prices to such opportunity costs sensitivity analysis is performed over a range of price levels high medium and low for each crop as shown in table a2 3 4 2 1 fallowing program the land fallowing program we analyze is based on a current iid program imperial irrigation district 2016a in exchange for fallowing land a farmer receives a set price per acre foot of water that would have been used had the land remained in production the fallowing program introduces a water lease payment to the farmer as illustrated in eq 11 11 max x w π c π c x c x c b x c w c b p f subject to the following constraints 12 0 8 x c b x c x c b 13 w c w c b where w c b is the depth of water applied to crop c in the baseline scenario p f is the price per acre foot paid for water leased conserved and x c b is the area of crop c in the baseline output eq 12 limits the amount of land that a grower can fallow to 20 percent of their baseline acreage the purpose is to restrict the fallowing program to active productive land this percentage is supported by california department of water resources cdwr which recommends agencies not approve transfers that result in more than twenty percent of a crop being fallowed cdwr and usbr 2015 eq 13 constrains the amount of water that can be applied to non fallowed land to baseline levels thereby ensuring that water is actually conserved to the extent that growers would shift water from their fallowed acreage over to non fallowed acreage our results underestimate the opportunity costs of such programs 3 4 2 2 improved irrigation efficiency program the second possible program we analyze referred to as the irrigation efficiency program is also based on an existing iid program imperial irrigation district 2016c under this program farmers are paid for water that is conserved due to the adoption of more water efficient irrigation practices and technologies with traditional iid irrigation methods opportunities for farm level conservation could include reduced conveyance losses reduced tail water fractions and reduced evaporative water losses from improved irrigation systems or other methods given that tail water and drainage make up part of the salton sea inflows real water savings from changing irrigation methods arise from reducing evaporative losses assuming crop transpiration varies minimally across irrigation methods drip irrigation particularly subsurface drip irrigation has been touted as a means to minimize evaporative water losses due to reduced soil surface wetting ayars et al 2015 although in some instances that effect has been found to be offset by a need for more frequent irrigation burt et al 2005 nonetheless subsurface drip has been found to reduce overall water use by up to 25 percent alam et al 2009 emerging technologies for reducing evaporation include sprayable biodegradable polymer membranes that cover the soil surface adhikari et al 2015 johnston et al 2016 recognizing that most irrigation in iid is flood or furrow we develop two estimates to represent the annual costs i of improving irrigation efficiency 400 ac and 800 ac these values were chosen to show approximate yearly costs of improved irrigation the university of california cooperative extension cost and return publications indicate approximately a 400 difference in yearly cost between flood and drip irrigation for alfalfa mayberry and meister 2003a putnam et al 2014 a range of 500 to 1800 per year cost for drip irrigation on small vegetable farms is given by the university of florida extension simonne et al 2012 using data from amosson et al 2002 which estimates cost by applied water volume the additional yearly cost of subsurface drip irrigation for alfalfa would be over 600 this does not include additional investment costs of 1000 per acre all publication costs were adjusted for inflation we assume that implementation of this more efficient irrigation technology will reduce evaporative water losses by 50 percent and eliminate tail water runoff yet drainage is still estimated by eq 3 given these assumptions our optimization framework is defined as follows 14 max x w w e π c π c x c π c e x c e 15 π c e p c h c y c q c i h c w c e p w w c b w c e p r subject to the following constraints 16 x c e x c x c b 17 w c w c b 18 y c e y c b where w c e is the depth of water applied to crops with the improved irrigation system x c e is the acreage with improved irrigation and p r is the price per acre foot paid for saved water eq 18 dictates that the yield per acre in the fields with improved irrigation y c e must not be lower than the baseline yields this ensures that purchased water is truly conserved water and prevents farmers from artificially elevating water sales when a crop is less profitable which is a requirement of the current iid program as well note that if eliminated tail water is converted to environmental water no net change in modeled salton sea inflows occurs because the changes to tw and ew offset each other one for one from a volume perspective eq 1 although there will likely be water quality differences note that tail water reductions do have a farm scale economic impact since growers are not only compensated for the water savings but also purchase less water under this strategy though new environmental water is generated only through reduced evaporative losses 3 4 2 3 direct water leasing program the direct leasing program allows for water to be purchased from farmers on a year to year basis growers and our model can adopt a variety of water savings strategies including any combination of deficit irrigation improvements in irrigation efficiency changing crop mix and land fallowing the optimization framework for this strategy is represented as 19 max x w w l π c π c x c w c l p l subject to the following constraints 20 0 8 x c b x c x c b 21 w c l 0 2 w c b where p l is the amount per acre foot paid to lease water for other beneficial uses including environmental transfers similar to the fallowing program above only 20 percent of the baseline crop area can be fallowed eq 20 and only 20 percent of the baseline water can be leased eq 21 again the constraints are intended to restrict the program to farmers who continue to be active productive growers and capture elements of current programs that are implemented for these reasons as well as to reduce potential third party effects while each of these programs consists of leasing water it is useful to recall that water rights in the western u s are generally tied to specific lands and beneficial uses whereas the first two programs actively conserve water through changes in crop management under constraints that eliminate any gaming by the growers e g restricting water use on other crops the flexibility associated with this last program may result in growers applying less water yet not suffering any crop yield or revenue losses if previously the growers were operating far to the right and on the relatively flat part of their crop water production function in principle reducing water use with no adverse effect on yield may call into question the beneficial use of the water in the first place and thus create a potential challenge to the water rights themselves such a discussion while important goes beyond our focus 4 results 4 1 baseline the baseline scenario is intended to be comparable to iid water use and production during recent years 2013 2015 under the conditions of the qsa we assumed ew was equal to the average mitigation water for those years which was 105 taf the baseline results for crop acreages applied water rates relative yields and regional profits using the midrange crop prices are shown in tables 1 and 2 the estimated water flows for the baseline scenario are in reasonable agreement with available data and the optimized irrigation rates for different crops are compatible with reported irrigation rates for example the model estimated applied water of 7 8 feet for alfalfa is comparable to the value of 7 feet reported by summers and putnam 2008 and the estimate of 2 9 feet for onions is comparable to the range of 2 5 to 3 feet reported in pelter and sorensen 1999 the leaching fractions calculated for different crops varied greatly between 9 and 47 being much larger for garden crops than for field crops however the applied water for garden crops is significantly lower than that of field crops so despite the wide ranging leaching fractions the amount of water leached was relatively uniform ranging from 7 to 14 in for field crops and 7 to 16 in for garden crops the calculated area weighted average leaching fraction for iid was 20 8 percent which is compatible with the historical iid leaching fraction of 19 percent reported by gibson 2012 total profits for the region using midrange crop prices were 365 million results using low and high crop prices show no significant qualitative differences and are available from the authors upon request we do not have data for actual profits but the average revenue for field crops from 2013 to 2015 was 1559 per acre which is similar to the average revenue generated in our model for field crops 1521 per acre for garden crops the reported revenue was 6560 per acre which compares with our generated value of 5810 per acre valenzuela 2014 2016 the modeled sea inflow equal to the sum of the mitigation water and calculated drainage and tail water flows was 941 taf which compares reasonably well with the 965 taf calculated from usgs data see section 3 2 the model predicts 81 taf of the available 2 523 maf was left unused this is not necessarily unrealistic however as the imperial irrigation district has consistently underused water between 2013 and 2017 with annual underruns varying between 797 acre feet and 97 188 acre feet james 2018 with a mean of 56 taf over the 2013 2015 period imperial irrigation district 2016a besides simply not needing all the water a number of possible other reasons may explain this for example the tail water fraction we use from bali et al 2001 could be too low rerunning the baseline model with a slightly higher tail water fraction eliminates the unused water it is also possible that actual irrigation depths in iid for some or all crops were greater than the optimal level determined by the model the calculated salinity of the inflow meanwhile was 3 0 ds m while we do not have data for direct comparison we note that the salinities of the main channels for conveying water to the sea the alamo river and the new river were 3 1 ds m and 4 1 ds m respectively between 2004 and 2010 cdwr 2011 the objective of the remainder of this paper is to evaluate the opportunity costs of generating beneficial use water that can be used as environmental flows into the salton sea under different water leasing programs in the absence of mandated mitigation and while accounting for the implications on return flows to the sea in the coming years the terms of the qsa will allow iid to sell up to an additional 174 taf of conserved water to san diego county water authority sdcwa and to coachella valley water district imperial irrigation district and san diego county water authority 2003 considering that the qsa mitigation transfer requirements will cease the conservation required to generate a net increase of about 69 taf of additional transfers is largely already in place the profitability is great for these transfers san diego pays more than 600 per ac ft san diego county water authority 2016 a large sum relative to the 20 per ac ft that farmers pay imperial irrigation district 2016b consequently any profit maximizing analysis always chooses transfers not shown hence we assume that in coming years uw urban water transfers will be 174 taf more than the average sold between 2013 and 2015 that the 105 taf of mitigation water under the qsa will cease and that iid conservation programs currently in place remain including fallowing thus with these assumptions plus the assumption that mw miscellaneous iid water remains approximately 1 of the water allocations we focus on the portion of the water budget that can be allocated to iw ew and ow as follows 22 2 454 maf iw ew o rerunning the baseline model accounting for the 69 taf lower water constraint has minimal to no effect on model outputs except for the unused water ow variable which is lower by a negligible 11 taf 4 2 fallowing program since crops have different potential profits as well as different water requirements the opportunity costs of fallowing a particular crop depends on the foregone profits per acre foot of water conserved table 3 shows the average profit generated from an acre foot of water by crop and crop price this profit represents the value the water holds to the farmer from growing different crops and highlights how a farmer s willingness to participate in a water leasing program is a function of both crop type and crop price knowledge of the extent to which particular low e g sudan grass alfalfa and high revenue e g broccoli lettuce crops are being cultivated provides a rough estimate of the amount of land that might be enrolled in such a program at different water leasing prices fig 4 illustrates the relationship between the lease price p f and the regional water balance components si ew dw and tw total cost and salinity of the salton sea inflows assuming mid level crop prices note that direct transfers ew is the total water leased from the farmers as such the relationship between the ew quantity and the lease price is akin to a supply curve of water under this program the jumps in the curves indicate the price points at which it becomes profitable to fallow additional land and thus make water available for lease recall that land fallowing for a given crop is capped at 20 percent without any additional program in place following the end of the qsa s requirement that mitigation water be sent to the sea sea inflows are around 850 taf comprised entirely of water from drainage and tail water runoff in fig 4 a this is illustrated by the intersection of the si curve with the y axis as the lease price for water via land fallowing increases sea inflows increase along with the total cost while drainage tail water flows and salinity of the inflows decrease if the state wanted to achieve historic sea inflows of one maf for example the total cost of the program would be approximately 28 million which increases overall grower profits by about a third of a percent value of the water to the growers represented by lost agricultural sales is almost 27 million as shown in fig 5 a this inflow is achieved with the per acre foot lease price set at 79 ac ft compensating growers for the foregone agricultural profits from fallowing their land and results in approximately 360 taf of environmental water and 730 taf of drainage and tail water inflows salinity of the inflows drops from the baseline inflow salinity of 3 5 ds m to 3 2 ds m of course since this is a terminal lake overall salinity will increase over time but at a slower pace under the fallowing program and at a level that will require less desalination if and when such strategies are implemented as suggested in the 10 year plan cdwr 2017 as illustrated in figs 4 and 5 the low cost strategy to generate inflows for the salton sea is the fallowing program unless inflows exceeding the fallowing program s upper limit are desired in fig 5 a we show the relationship between total profits to growers from engaging in this program total profit profits from farming farming profit the profit from leasing the water which is the same as the cost of purchasing the water water profit ew cost versus price per acre foot of leased water at 79 ac ft the revenue received from leasing the water is slightly greater than the lost agricultural profits from fallowing their land i e the lease price is greater than or equal to the foregone profits for all acres enrolled this result is obtained by fallowing approximately 20 percent of the sudan grass and alfalfa acreage which constitutes about 10 percent of the total farm area while not shown for different crop price levels the opportunity cost of fallowing changes and thus so will the lease price to generate any particular level of environmental flows for instance under the high crop price scenario a lease price of 113 ac ft would be required to generate inflows of approximately one maf consisting of environmental water drainage and tail water as a point of comparison growers that participate in the existing fallowing program currently receive 175 ac ft a premium above and beyond the opportunity cost to the farmer thereby indicating a positive shadow value on the acreage constraint additional results from high and low price runs are available from the authors but do not show any significant qualitative differences 4 3 improved irrigation efficiency program fig 4 b shows results for the improved irrigation efficiency program assuming the lower cost estimate for improving irrigation efficiency 400 per acre annually similarly to fig 4 a jumps in the curves occur at prices where it becomes profitable to invest in improved irrigation technology for a particular crop crop prices are less important here in determining the jump points because the decision to switch to efficient irrigation depends on whether the additional irrigation costs can be recouped with water conservation payments a calculation that depends on the irrigation system costs as well as the amount of potential evaporation reductions thus as the lease price increases irrigation efficiency improvements will occur first on land cultivated with crops that have higher total seasonal evaporative water losses table a2 in our case irrigation improvements occur first on land cultivated with alfalfa which would require a water lease price of about 183 ac ft to trigger enrollment as shown in fig 4 b at 183 ac ft 370 taf of environmental water is generated in comparison the fallowing program generated almost the same amount of environmental water 360 taf at a much lower price of 79 ac ft note also that while environmental flows may be higher with the irrigation program overall sea inflows are lower and inflow salinity higher relative to the fallowing scenario the total expenditures at 183 ac ft shown in both fig 4 b and fig 5 b amount to approximately 68 million in environmental water costs roughly 2 5 times the expenditures required under the fallowing program with negligible effects on grower profits drainage and tail water inflows to the sea are estimated about around 560 taf 70 taf less than under the fallowing program it is important to highlight that the efficiency program costs are exorbitant because saved water ew is generated through reduced evaporation alone via improving irrigation system technologies farm profits are reduced significantly compared to fallowing which increases the value of applied water and therefore increases the cost of the program if one assumes the higher irrigation cost estimate i 800 ac the costs of this program approximately double the takeaway here is that high payments are needed to induce changes in irrigation of lucrative garden crops and that relatively little evaporative water is available for conservation from those crops however when different irrigation methods are used agricultural yields are minimally affected 4 4 direct leasing program fig 4 c shows results for the direct leasing program using midrange crop prices relative to the previous figures these curves are smoother a result of the more flexible program which allows growers a larger array of strategies to conserve water for leasing including deficit irrigation notable is how for any positive lease price growers are incentivized to conserve some amount of water which is in stark contrast to the other two strategies in effect internal margin adjustments such as lower applied water rates are a cost effective means to save water rather than relying entirely on a more extensive margin strategy such as land fallowing or changes in irrigation technology schwabe et al 2006 adamson et al 2017 in terms of external margin adjustments at the lower lease prices sudan grass is fallowed first followed by alfalfa because of its relatively low water requirement and high profit margin per unit of water lettuce is the last crop to be fallowed and at a lease price of 1400 ac ft or higher not shown under the direct lease program we estimate that a lease price of 60 ac ft would generate approximately 300 taf of environmental water and approximately 600 taf of drainage and tail water at a cost of around 18 million significantly less on a per acre unit of environmental water relative to the other two scenarios relative to the other two scenarios we see a significant reduction in drainage relative to tail water a result of less applied water arising from deficit irrigation additionally inflow salinity decreases by more relative to the irrigation scenario yet achieves only a slight salinity reduction relative to the fallowing option at 60 ac ft largely a result of the fact that at that price there is no fallowing to generate a historic inflow of around one maf the lease price would need to be 89 ac ft a value higher than the land fallowing option since the model is not being optimized to minimize the costs of generating inflows but rather to maximize grower profits given a particular lease price and the constraints identified above to illustrate the relative efficiency of the three water leasing strategies fig 5 presents total costs of supply under each of the three programs as well as farm profits and value of leased water opportunity cost to farmers however if a remediation plan called for fresh water flows not mixed inflow which consist of unpriced drainage and tail water flows the direct leasing program is the lowest cost as it can provide more environmental water at a lower cost recall that there is not a linear relationship between purchased water and inflows this is not surprising and is consistent with previous program evaluations e g fig 1 in qureshi et al 2010 given that the flexibility associated with this strategy allows growers to choose their least cost approach to generate water for leasing either through fallowing irrigation improvements deficit irrigation or crop switching also notable is the extent to which the direct leasing program can appropriate significantly more water than either the fallowing program or the efficiency improvement program with direct leasing individual crop yield is minimally affected never dropping below 97 percent again results from high and low price runs do not show any significant qualitative differences 5 discussion and conclusions the purpose of this paper was to compare three widely discussed and often used strategies to lease water in terms of the opportunity costs to generate water savings and the potential externalities associated with such savings our focus was on investigating the opportunity costs to agricultural operators in southern california to generate water for leasing under a fallowing program an irrigation efficiency program and a flexible direct lease program with the water going to the salton sea a terminal lake which is likely to shrink in the coming years under a no action policy with severe ecological and human health repercussions such a reduction in both volume and shore line has been estimated to result in damages of approximately 11 to 70 billion over the next thirty years under a no action policy cohen 2014 our model estimates that the opportunity costs of water associated with the three programs analyzed vary widely while the direct lease program is the least cost method for purchasing environmental water given the wide array of low cost strategies growers can choose from to conserve water it results in the greatest reduction in drainage flows and tail water runoff since both these and purchased environmental water contribute to the salton sea consideration of the potential externalities of programs that incorporate such flexibility e g water markets is warranted because of the high water application rates water use reductions may have limited impact on overall production a positive benefit in response to concerns over third party effects e g employment income that are often raised when such water transfers are discussed indeed our model shows that the direct water leasing program results in reduced water application rates and some land fallowing with total crop production reduced by only a few percent even at the lowest crop prices evaluated the fallowing program given the relatively smaller impacts on return flows than the other two strategies produces the greatest total inflows at the lowest costs this is an important finding given that fallowing programs often get criticized as being an inefficient means of generating beneficial use water because of their limited options especially when compared to water markets yet when one expands the scope of analysis to consider return flows and the potential external benefits associated with such flows the system efficiency of a fallowing program likely compares much more favorably with water markets of course if individual contributions to the inflows were both measurable and assignable the pricing of or market for inflows would achieve the efficient solution in terms of third party effects farm production is not substantially reduced given fallowing occurs on the low value field crops and recalling eq 12 we limit fallowing to at most 20 of the acreage even when over a million acre feet of inflows are generated only 7 of production profit is lost see fig 5 the crops that are fallowed are field crops such as sudan grass and alfalfa and not higher valued garden crops like broccoli and carrots given that much of the cultivated alfalfa and sudan grass is exported and that the fallowed field crops represent much less than one percent of the us production e g 131 million tons of hay were produced in 2017 impacts on local feed markets or global crop prices are likely to be minimal nass 2018 blake 2017 guerrero 2008 pierson 2014 lastly improving irrigation efficiencies was the most costly approach to producing inflows to the salton sea given the high costs of irrigation system upgrades and the fact that this method only generates water through reduced evaporation the irrigation program is distinct from the other two in that the cost is driven by irrigation system costs and not crop prices on the plus side irrigation efficiency improvements did not change output and thus there were no third party effects associated with this strategy as discussed in the introduction there are various entities vying for water we have focused on the salton sea as it represents an important environmental water use that is currently experiencing substantial water related damages however the colorado river delta in mexico has long been deprived of its historical colorado river flows resulting in substantial ecological changes one may argue the water could have higher value there than in the salton sea additionally there are several other agricultural and urban regions who may be interested in purchasing water were it to be made available on an open market particularly mexican and arizonan agricultural interests and municipal interests in southern california e g san diego and los angeles these players would ultimately have to be considered in any potential water transfers nonetheless these hydro economic analyses indicate that leasing programs are capable of generating significant environmental water flows for the sea with relatively small decreases in agricultural production and limited to no decrease in overall grower profits the estimated damages of doing nothing at the salton sea are in the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars per year cohen 2014 the cost of the comprehensive restoration plan is in the low hundreds of millions per year our results indicate that a great deal of water could be purchased for the sea at a fraction of the cost potentially mitigating damages and helping save a great deal money in terms of sustainability the programs described here can serve as an integral element to both a short and long term fix in the short term they can provide the necessary water nearly immediately to i keep the system from crashing by reducing the rate of salinization and sustaining current bird and fish populations and ii reduce the amount of exposed dust emitting playa and the consequent air quality related health impacts over the next 5 to 10 years as other short term mitigation efforts are implemented in the long term they can serve as a low cost means to generate inflows to the sea and free up scarce public dollars for other identified long term mitigative efforts unlike the suggestions in the restoration plans the water market solutions presented here already have the needed infrastructure in place and could theoretically be workable in short order acknowledgements the data used are listed in the references tables and appendices appendix a1 farm level crop yield and drainage we use a crop water production model derived in skaggs et al 2014 to estimate crop yield crop yield y as a function of the depth of applied water w is calculated as a1 y w y r w y p where yp is potential crop yield and yr w is

in the plant s growing season likewise evaporation can be calculated by multiplying the respective k e values by the reference evapotranspiration for each day in the plant s growing season the summation of both over the growing season results in the estimated potential transpiration and evaporation for crops with multiple cutting periods transpiration and evaporation are estimated for each cutting period then summed together alfalfa sudan grass and bermuda were assumed to have ten cuttings per year geisseler and horwath 2016 miller 2015 
11202,cs655 water content reflectometer wcr campbell scientific inc logan ut usa is a recently developed multiparameter electromagnetic sensor measuring volumetric soil water content θ bulk soil electrical conductivity σb and temperature in this study cs655 sensor s performance was investigated through laboratory experiments using a set of liquids with known dielectric and salinity properties and soils featuring a wide range of conditions including physico chemical properties water regimes and salinity of the water solution the sensor s performance was analyzed in comparison with wet and ml2 theta probe delta t device ltd cambridge uk dielectric sensors it was found that cs655 apparent dielectric permittivity εa readings were higher than that of topp s permittivity water content relationship especially at higher soil water content values as much as 12 dimensionless permittivity units the results suggested that the relationship between experimentally measured soil water content θm and ε a was strongly linear 0 911 r2 0 997 the most accurate results were provided by the multi point calibration method moreover for the case of non conductive soils kelleners s method provides similar εa values with cs655 sensor readings for a maximum σb value of about 0 8 ds m 1 concerning the use of empirical calibration equations which include the effect of bulk electrical conductivity in εa the obtained results suggest that the equation θ a ε a b c σ b has a strong physical basis and adequate performance rmse 0 03 m3 m 3 finally the investigation of the εa σb relationship revealed that it is strongly linear and that slope mainly depends on the pore water electrical conductivity σp which is closely related to the soil solution salinity in contact with plant roots that influences plants growth the malliki walzcak model provide more reliable σp predictions as compared to the hilhorst model keywords electromagnetic sensors soil moisture cs655 sensor water content reflectometers dielectric permittivity bulk electrical conductivity 1 introduction efficient irrigation management is critical factor in order to achieve high yield and at the same time low water consumption however it is a complicated and demanding process due to the various factors that should be considered for instance irrigation system characteristics climate conditions soil characteristics crop species cultivation practices etc sezen et al 2006 soulis and elmalloglou 2016 2018 accordingly proper irrigation management requires a sound basis for making irrigation decisions such as environmental measurements evapotranspiration soil water content or plant stress soulis et al 2015 recent advances in electromagnetic em soil water content sensors i e the ability to be easily automated measurements of multiple parameters with a single sensor and low cost facilitated and promoted their use in irrigation scheduling miller et al 2014 singh et al 2018 however sensors accuracy may have a significant effect on irrigation efficiency soulis et al 2015 almost all of the recently developed soil water sensors use the soil apparent dielectric permittivity εa as the basis for determining water content this is due to the fact that water has a much larger value of apparent permittivity εa 80 compared to air εa 1 or soil solids εa 3 7 therefore dielectric permittivity of the soil is primarily a function of θ seyfried and murdock 2004 topp et al 1980 demonstrated that dielectric measurements could be used to accurately measure θ using time domain reflectometry tdr tdr is considered to be one of the most reliable methods for performing continuous nondestructive measurements of θ it is based on measuring travel time of electric pulses along a waveguide in order to estimate soil apparent permittivity εa which is directly related to the travel time soil relative complex permittivity ε r is composed of a real component i e a dielectric constant and an imaginary component eq 1 1 ε r ε r j ε r where ε r is the dielectric constant the real part of relative permittivity ε r the imaginary part of relative permittivity is the equivalent dielectric loss taking into consideration the conductive loss and j 1 soil water content is more directly related to ε r for the tdr technique the real component ε r of the relative permittivity is considered about equal with the apparent permittivity εa relative imaginary permittivity is the sum of a conduction term and a relaxation term eq 2 2 ε r σ b ω ε 0 ε r e l where σ b is the direct current bulk electrical conductivity ec ε 0 is the permittivity of the free space 8 85 10 12 f m 1 ε r e l is the frequency dependent relative dielectric loss due to relaxation and ω is the angular frequency given as 2πf with f being the frequency as can be seen in eq 2 ε r depends on bulk soil electrical conductivity and measurement frequency accordingly accurate θ determinations are unlikely when the frequency is small or when bulk soil electrical conductivity is high regalado et al 2007 this is expected to consist an important issue in many dielectric sensors due to their low operating frequency calibration equations such as the empirical equation of topp et al 1980 are widely used in coarse grained mineral soils for calculating θ from apparent permittivity data using tdr as was shown by topp and reynolds 1998 the topp et al 1980 equation is equivalent to a linear equation between the square root of apparent permittivity and θ 3 θ 0 115 ε a 0 176 as regards tdr measurements the slope of eq 3 represents the combined effects of salts and clay content while the intercept represents the effect of dry solids ferre and topp 2002 even though tdr is considered a reliable and accurate method for determining soil or substrate θ its high cost has led in the development of alternative dielectric sensors technologies capacitance impedance and transmission line oscillators which are cheaper and do not rely on complicated waveform analysis it is frequently implied that these alternative dielectric sensors which operate at lower frequencies compared to tdr have similar behavior with tdr however this suggestion is questionable especially when the bulk soil electrical conductivity σb effect on ε a θ relationship is considered since its effect on the electromagnetic field attenuation has been proven to increase as the operating frequency decreases kelleners et al 2009 in addition evett and parkin 2005 reported that the response of electromagnetic sensors often depends on soil type especially when low frequencies 200 mhz are utilized among the above referred alternative dielectric sensors technologies transmission line oscillators are of particular interest as they operate similar to the tdr but without the need of a separate pulse and sampling unit kelleners et al 2005 commercial sensors based on this technology are the cs615 cs616 cs625 and cs655 new model water content reflectometers campbell scientific inc logan ut usa seyfried and murdock 2001 in their study evaluating cs615 sensor found that a separate calibration equation was needed for each of the four studied porous media a sandy loam two loam soils and a construction sand to achieve accurate θ measurement they also investigated how the calibration was affected by changing temperature and found that the effect of temperature varied with θ and soil type chandler et al 2004 based on field experiments also reported that specific calibration according to the soil type is required kelleners et al 2005 developed a physical framework in which the cs615 sensor s output period p is related to the apparent permittivity and then the apparent permittivity is related to soil water content two step approach the results of their study show that the water content reflectometers can be calibrated accurately with this method using sensor readings in air and deionized water blonquist et al 2005 based on data for the cases of conducting relaxing and non relaxing conducting media reported that cs616 sensor overestimated apparent permittivity finally kelleners et al 2009 compared cs625 and tdr in wyoming soils and found that apparent permittivity measured with the cs625 sensor was as much as 187 higher than that of the tdr they also found that soil texture had little impact on sensor readings furthermore they proposed equations linking the slope of the linear relationship between experimentally measured volumetric soil water content θm and square root of apparent permittivity with the saturated bulk soil electrical conductivity the existence of a linear relationship between the square root of permittivity and θm has been observed for several other dielectric sensors mainly for the case of inorganic soils seyfried et al 2005 kargas and kerkides 2008 kargas et al 2011 kargas and soulis 2012 kargas et al 2013 however the parameters of the linear relationship are different between different soil types and different dielectric sensors the improvement of θ estimation by considering the effect of bulk electrical conductivity on the soil dielectric permittivity has been also attempted mainly for the case of tdr wyseure et al 1997 robinson et al 1999 schwartz et al 2013 the general expectation is that among commercial sensors those with higher measurement frequencies should experience less dependence of εα from σb with calibration relationship closer to the topp equation than sensors using lower measurement frequencies up to now two different methodologies have been developed for the calibration of dielectric sensors according to the first method the relationship between relative permittivity and θm is obtained by preparing soil samples with predetermined θm uniformly distributed in the soil mass however this method is time consuming and can provide only a limited number of experimental points of water content seyfried et al 2005 the second method proposed by young et al 1997 is the upward infiltration method which allows the user to apply a well controlled flux of water at the bottom boundary of the sample with a vertically installed dielectric sensor at the top of the soil column in this method the soil remains unchanged during the experiment but the water distribution within the soil is not uniform it is a relatively fast method and capable of obtaining several experimental points of water content seyfried et al 2005 kargas and kerkides 2009 logsdon 2009 kargas et al 2011 2013 another important issue is related to the performance of dielectric sensors under non uniform soil water patterns tdr measurements in non uniform soil water patterns was initially examined by topp et al 1982 and subsequently by several other researchers chan and knight 1999 2001 schaap et al 2003 robinson et al 2005 it should be noted that the refractive averaging scheme to determine the effective permittivity of layered wet and dry porous media seems to be the most appropriate for tdr devices except in the following two cases a when operational frequency drops below 100 mhz and b when multiple thin layers with different water contents are encountered in these cases the arithmetic averaging scheme might be more appropriate the effect of non uniform soil water patterns for the case of the new dielectric devices which commonly operate in frequencies lower than 100 mhz has been investigated in several studies seyfried et al 2005 kargas and kerkides 2009 kargas et al 2011 kargas and soulis 2012 previous studies attempted to estimate pore water electrical conductivity σp based on dielectric sensors measurements of σb and εα pore water electrical conductivity is an index of soil salinity since the plants root actually experience the solute concentration of the soil solution malicki and walczak 1999 had shown that the relationship σb f εα σp is linear for εα 6 2 and introduced an empirical linear model for the prediction of σp hilhorst 2000 also presented a model connecting εα σb and σp which can be used to calculate σp from simultaneous measurement of εα and σb it should be noted that for the sc655 sensor which is a rather new device that could be used for routine measurements of bulk soil electrical conductivity the prediction of the soil pore water electrical conductivity using the above simple linear models has not been investigated up to now a detailed independent evaluation of the cs655 device considering the above mentioned issues may lead to its better use in future field water monitoring programs and to the full exploitation of its potential this is important because by directly monitoring soil water content and soil salinity in the root zone with dielectric sensors it is possible to precisely manage agricultural water and nutrients preventing waste of water leaching of soluble chemicals and land degradation in this context the main objectives of this study are i to develop soil specific calibration equations for a wide variety of soils for the cs655 sensor using the multi point and the two point specific calibration methods to this end the calibration procedure using soil samples of predetermined water content robinson 2001 kelleners et al 2009 was used in order to achieve an in depth understanding of cs655 performance considering the porous medium properties soil texture electrical conductivity and others ii to investigate the applicability of the physical framework proposed by kelleners et al 2005 iii to investigate the response of cs655 to changes in bulk soil electrical conductivity levels and to compare the performance of the various models that incorporate bulk soil electrical conductivity in the calibration equations through the simultaneous estimation of both εa and σb for the same soil volume using cs655 sensor iv to determine the response of cs655 sensor in bi layered systems liquid air v to investigate the prediction of soil pore water electrical conductivity σp with the empirical linear models of malicki and walczak 1999 as well as the linear model of hilhorst 2000 based on the cs655 sensor measurements for a range of soil types and for various salinity levels of the moistening solutions the sensor s performance was also analyzed in comparison with two additional dielectric sensors operating in lower frequencies

around each probe rod and 4 5 cm beyond the end of the rods soil water content θ is calculated using topp et al 1980 equation for θ values ranging between 5 and 50 according to its manual the sensor s accuracy is 1 with soil specific calibration and 3 with the typical factory calibration where solution electrical conductivity ec 10 ds m 1 the accuracy of the bulk soil ec measurements is 5 of the reading for bulk electrical conductivity 8 ds m 1 the temperature measurement range is 50 to 70 c water content reflectometers measure the number of reflected voltage pulses per second the number of reflections is divided by a dimensionless scaling factor sf to facilitate recording by a datalogger the output is generally read as a period p the travel time for the reflectometer according to kelleners et al 2005 is 4 t 2 f r p s f 4 l ε a c 2 t d where f r is the number of reflections per second before scaling td is the delay time in the sensor head before the next pulse is triggered and c is the velocity of light in vacuum the scaling factor for the cs655 is 128 the rise time tr of the voltage pulse is about 2 ns and the delay time in the sensor head td is 3 4 ns campbell scientific inc personal communication the rise time of the voltage pulse can be related to the maximum frequency fm in the incident electromagnetic wave with the following equation bogart et al 2004 5 f m ln 0 9 0 1 2 π t r the resulting fm value is 175 mhz note that the fm value refer to the input signal and should be treated as approximations in this study sensors measurements were recorded using cr850 data logger campbell scientific inc the ml2 sensor delta t devices ltd 1999 consists of a waterproof housing which contains the electronics and four sharpened stainless steel rods attached to it it estimates volumetric water content by applying a 100 mhz signal via a specially designed transmission line whose impedance is changed as the impedance of the soil changes the wet sensor delta t device ltd 2005 is a multi parameter capacitance sensor consisting of the main body which contains the electronics and three sharpened stainless steel rods attached to it it measures the dielectric properties of the soil by generating a 20 mhz signal which is applied to the central rod the wet sensor also estimates volumetric water content pore water electrical conductivity and soil temperature 2 2 measurements in liquids and in water air layered systems as a first step in this evaluation measurements in liquids with known dielectric properties were carried out in order to evaluate the sensor accuracy in measuring apparent permittivity εα as well as to investigate the sensor s response in layered systems these experiments are particularly useful for the sensor calibration process due to the non conductive nature of the media furthermore by using liquids any possible problems caused by non uniform contact between the sensor s rods and the material which could occur in case of soils are eliminated the measurements were carried out in air ε α 1 in butanol ε α 16 8 in ethanol ε α 24 3 and in deionized water ε α 80 at 25 c temperature furthermore measurement at water solutions with various ec values 0 5 ds m 1 were also carried out in order to evaluate the sensor s performance in high ec conditions sensors behavior in layered systems is important for the evaluation of the sensor s performance in soils having non uniform water content patterns or in stratified soils which are common conditions in real applications in the case of layered systems the εa value provided by a sensor can be described by either the refractive index topp et al 1982 6 ε α r e f σ i 1 n l i ε α i σ i 1 n l i 2 or the simple arithmetic average 7 ε α a r i t h σ i 1 n l i ε α i σ i 1 n l i where εα ref is the apparent permittivity for the case of the refractive index averaging εα arith is the apparent permittivity for the case of the arithmetic averaging li is the thickness of the ith layer εαi the value of the permittivity of the ith layer n is the number of layers and σ i 1 n l i represents the whole depth of the layered system in order to investigate the response of cs655 sensor in layered systems a simple water air system was used the sensor was gradually inserted vertically to a sufficiently large cylindrical vessel containing water at a constant temperature 21 c at each depth of immersion d the εa readings of the sensor were recorded using the cr850 datalogger then the corresponding εa values were estimated according to both the refractive and the arithmetic averaging schemes eq 6 and 7 and were compared with the cs655 readings for each value of d 2 3 measurements in soils the experiments were conducted using ten different soil types except from the sand the rest of the examined soils were collected in the field table 1 the mechanical analysis and the bulk density of soils used are presented in table 1 these soils were selected because they exhibit a wide variety of properties i e particle size distribution bulk density in order to facilitate the exhaustive performance evaluation and the soil specific calibration of the cs655 sensor all experiments were carried out at constant temperature 21 1 c to eliminate temperature effects in this study the method of predetermined uniform soil water content regimes calibration approach was applied in all the experiments the θm ranged from oven dry to saturation in equal water content steps δθ 0 05 m3 m 3 to this end air dried soil samples were thoroughly mixed with different predetermined amounts of fresh water ec 0 28 ds m 1 taking care to get homogeneous water content the obtained soil material of various water content levels was packed in pvc columns with 30 cm height and 20 cm diameter in small portions and pressed with a 0 15 kg rubber hammer to achieve homogeneous density distribution in the soil sample the θm and dry bulk density of the soils were determined once again at the end of the experiment by weighing and oven drying in addition measurements were taken in an oven dried soil sample θ 0 m3 m 3 using the above methodology a sufficient number of εa σb period p and θ readings for all the soil types examined were provided measurements were obtained by fully inserting vertically the cs655 sensor into the soils samples the soil specific calibration of the sensor was performed using the following linear equation between the square root of εa and θm 8 θ m a ε a b where the parameters a and b depend on the soil material this equation has been widely applied for the calibration of tdr and other dielectric sensors ledieu et al 1986 white et al 1994 spaans and baker 1996 ferre and topp 2002 kargas et al 2011 kargas and soulis 2012 soil specific values for a and b parameters can be easily determined using two independent pairs of θm and εa values two point calibration cal for simplicity reasons and in order to cover the entire range of possible θ values of the studied soil material the first εa measurement is taken at an oven dried soil sample and the second εa measurement is taken at a saturated soil sample i e θ θs seyfried et al 2005 kargas and soulis 2012 optimal values for a and b can be also determined by linear regression between θm and ε α using all the measured θm values multi point calibration calal in this study soil specific calibration relationships for each soil studied were produced using both the above described methods two point calibration and multi point calibration 2 4 applicability of kelleners et al 2005 physical framework according to kelleners et al 2005 in the case of non conductive soils εa can be estimated from the measured period by solving equation 4 for εa in case that the length l of the rods and the delay time td are known however even if the physical length of the rods is known equal to 12 cm the actual length l as experienced by the voltage pulse will slightly vary the actual length l can be determined analytically using equation 4 based on the measurements in deionized water and in air by subtracting the corresponding equations for air and water an approximation of the calibrated length is obtained as follows 9 l c p w p a 4 s f ε w ε a after determining l td can be also calculated by eq 4 using the measurements in deionized water or in air in this study the applicability of kelleners et al 2005 method was evaluated in the studied soils 2 5 salinity effects in water solutions and soils in order to investigate the effect of salinity on the sensor performance several measurements in water solutions and in soils with increased ec values were carried out initially measurements in water solutions with increasing electrical conductivity values ecw prepared by adding kcl to deionized water were made in this case the electrical conductivity of the water solution ecw is considered equal with σb accordingly it was made possible to determinate the σb threshold for which the sensor is able to provide accurate εa readings furthermore the experimental setup described in section 2 3 measurements in soils was used in order to evaluate the sensor s sensitivity to salinity for three soil materials sand loam1 and clay loam1 table 1 however in this instance kcl solutions with known electrical conductivity values ecw were added to obtain the pre determined θm levels from oven dry to saturation instead of fresh water the corresponding ec values of the water solutions ecw used for the case of sand were 0 0 28 1 17 3 6 and 6 1 ds m 1 for the loam1 were 0 0 28 1 17 3 6 6 1 and 12 ds m 1 while for the clay loam1 were 0 28 3 6 and 12 ds m 1 2 6 alternative calibration equations considering the effect of σb the possible improvements of θ estimation with cs655 sensor considering σb effect on εa were also evaluated several empirical approaches have been proposed mainly for tdr taking into account the effect of bulk electrical conductivity on the soil dielectric permittivity wyseure et al 1997 robinson et al 1999 initially the applicability of wyseure et al 1997 and robinson et al 1999 empirical equations was evaluated specifically wyseure et al 1997 based on experiments using tdr in soil columns packed with 5 different porous media and saturated with solutions having various ec values proposed the following empirical correction equation for σb 2 5 ds m 1 10 ε r ε a 1 432 σ b similarly robinson et al 1999 based on experiments using three different dielectric sensors tdr surface capacitance insertion probe scip ml2 theta probe in 4 different sandy porous media found that the effect of σb to εa is small for tdr but for scip it was 3 5 times larger compared to tdr based on their observations they also proposed the following empirical correction equation for σb 2 5 ds m 1 11 ε r ε a 0 628 σ b accordingly it was evaluated if θ estimations using the ε r values obtained by eqs 10 and 11 instead of εa in topp et al 1980 equation are improved in comparison to the factory calibration equation furthermore the performance of the empirical calibration equation proposed by evett et al 2005 which directly considers the effect of σb in the determination of θ was evaluated the corresponding equation is 12 θ a ε a b c σ b where a b and c are fitting parameters 2 7 prediction of pore water electrical conductivity as a final step in this study the prediction of soil pore water electrical conductivity σp by utilizing cs655 sensor measurements has been attempted to this end the malicki and walczak 1999 and hilhorst 2000 models were used malicki and walczak 1999 had shown that the relationship σb f εα σp is linear for εα 6 2 and introduced the term of soil salinity index xs describing soil salinity status the salinity index was defined as the partial derivative of σb with respect to εa as determined by tdr specifically malicki and walczak 1999 presented the following empirical linear model 13 σ p σ b 0 08 ε a 6 2 0 0057 0 000071 s where s is the sand content in percent by weight this model seems to be free of fitting parameters when εa 6 this limitation is not considered as important since the θ values corresponding to εa 6 are below 0 1 m3 m 3 malicki and walczak 1999 suggested the use of eq 13 for θm values larger than 0 2 m3 m 3 because at this range the salinity index σ b ε a seems to be practically unaffected by θ it should be noted that this model was tested using σ b and εa values obtained using a tdr device which operates in a broad frequency band hilhorst 2000 presented a model connecting εα σb and σp in the form 14 ε a ε p σ p σ b ε 0 where εp is the dielectric permittivity of the pore water considered equal to that of pure water 80 3 at 20 c and ε0 is the y intercept of the line εa f σb using eq 14 σp can be calculated from a simultaneous measurement of εa and σb hilhorst 2000 found that ε0 was in the range of 1 9 to 7 6 although ε0 could be obtained experimentally for every soil type the value of 4 1 was proposed to be used as a standard value for all soil types it should be noted that this model must be applied for θm values greater than 0 1 m3 m 3 according to regalado et al 2007 the model of hilhorst 2000 seems to be a rather simplistic special case of the model of rhoades et al 1976 in the sense that it does not take into consideration that σ p might be affected by the surface conductance of the soil matrix 2 8 performance evaluation criteria for the evaluation of the various calibration equations and the various models investigated in this study the root mean square error rmse performance evaluation criterion and the r2 determination coefficient were used 15 r m s e σ i 1 n p r e d i o b s i 2 n 16 r 2 σ i 1 n o b s i o b s p r e d i p r e d i σ i 1 n o b s i o b s 2 σ i 1 n p r e d i p r e d i 2 where predi is the ith predicted value of the modeled parameter obsi is the corresponding observed value o b s and p r e d are the mean observed and predicted values and n is the total number of different observed predicted values pairs rmse is expressed in the same units as the estimated parameter and values close to 0 indicate better performance r2 ranges between 0 and 1 where values close to 0 indicate no correlation and values close to 1 indicate a strong correlation 3 results and discussions 3 1 measurements in liquids and in water air layered system the obtained results from the cs655 sensor measurements of εa in liquids with known dielectric properties were εa 14 1 for butanol εa 22 7 for ethanol εa 80 6 for deionized water and εa 1 for air comparing these values with the dielectric permittivity values for the same liquids and air it can be seen that the sensor provides accurate readings for the case of air and deionized water but underestimates εa for the cases of butanol and ethanol in fig 1 apparent permittivity values obtained by partially inserting the cs655 sensor in water were plotted against immersion depth d together with estimated permittivity values according to the refractive and arithmetic averaging schemes eqs 6 and 7 as can be seen permittivity values obtained by the cs655 sensor for the water air layered system deviate from the corresponding values estimated with the two averaging schemes but are closer to the arithmetic averaging scheme especially for higher εa values this is in agreement with what kargas and kerkides 2009 and kargas et al 2011 found with the ml2 and wet sensors but is in sharp contrast to those reported by young et al 1997 for tdr therefore in case that the upward infiltration calibration method is applied for the cs655 sensor in a soil with non uniform water content the determined εa will be different than that of a soil having the same water content uniformly distributed furthermore under conditions of highly contrasting soil water content such as a vertical installation at the soil surface large errors in water content measurement may result if the typical linear θm ε a relationship is used 3 2 soil specific calibration in fig 2 the εa readings obtained by cs655 sensor and εa values estimated by topp equation for each θm data point are plotted against the θm values for all the studied soils the soil water content θ estimations obtained using the multi point calal and the two point cal soil specific calibration methods are also plotted as a function of the εa readings for the same soils the corresponding a and b parameter values for both calibration methods and the r2 values concerning eq 8 as well as the σb readings obtained by cs655 sensor at saturation are presented in table 2 the corresponding rmse values for the θ predictions obtained by the two calibration methods are presented in table 3 the high r2 values indicate that the relationship θm ε a is strongly linear in all cases examined the ec value of the fresh water used to moisten the soil samples was 0 28 ds m 1 as can be seen in table 2 the slope value a eq 8 is lower than the corresponding value proposed by topp and reynolds 1998 for mineral soils measured with high frequency tdr a 0 115 for all the studied soils except of the case of sand the low a parameter values indicate that cs655 senses higher εa values in comparison with the tdr the higher difference between the cs655 εa values and the values corresponding to the topp equation is about 12 dielectric units and is more obvious in θm values higher than 0 20 0 25 m3 m 3 this can be attributed to the lower operation frequency of cs655 f 175 mhz moreover due to the relatively low operation frequency of cs655 the higher εa values can be attributed to the effect of the eq 2 term σb ωε0 topp et al 2000 as well as to the sensor design kelleners et al 2009 for instance the observed difference is higher than that observed for a silty loam soil with cs616 sensor which operates in the same frequency as cs655 kelleners et al 2005 the effect of soil texture on the soil specific calibration parameters table 2 calal is not considerable as the slope a ranges between 0 081 and 0 098 and the intercept b between 0 075 and 0 119 for all the studied soils except of the sand in the latest case the corresponding parameters values are obviously higher a 0 125 and b 0 157 as can be seen in table 2 and fig 2 eq 8 fitted very well to the measured data and the r2 values obtained were generally higher than 0 938 except from one case where r2 was equal to 0 911 this linearity between θm and ε α data has been also observed in other studies concerning tdr ferre and topp 2002 and other commercial sensors seyfried and murdock 2004 kargas and kerkides 2008 kargas and soulis 2012 when the water content is uniform in the sensed volume concerning the accuracy of the two point calibration method cal as can be seen in table 2 the slope values a and the intercept values b estimated with the two point calibration method cal are higher than that of the multi point calibration calal the observed differences are higher for the intercept for all cases except for the case of sand the calculated rmse values comparing the accuracy of the two methods are presented in table 3 as can be seen in fig 2 and table 3 the multi point calibration method calal performed better compared to the two point calibration method cal the rmse values obtained with calal table 3 range from 0 01 to 0 041 m3 m 3 in case that an acceptable accuracy level of 0 03 m3 m 3 is considered then the obtained rmse values for the calal method are lower than this level in all the examined cases except from clay2 0 041 m3 m 3 in contrast as it was expected the corresponding rmse values obtained with cal are higher in all cases and in some cases are even two times higher than that of calal e g for the sandy clay loam soil it should be also noted that the calal method gives much better rmse values compared to the manufacturer s calibration equation topp equation in all cases while the cal method gives better results in all cases except for three soils table 3 3 3 applicability of kelleners et al 2005 physical framework using measurements in deionized water and in air and based on the methodology described in the materials and methods section the actual length l of the rods was determined equal to 0 1157 m using the actual length l and delay time td values the apparent permittivity values were estimated using eq 4 solved for εa the obtained results revealed that εa values calculated with this method were almost identical to the factory calibration furthermore in case that the multi point calibration method calal is applied using the apparent permittivity values obtained by the method of kelleners instead of that measured directly by the sensor then the obtained rmse values are similar and in some cases better than that of the original calal method predictions table 3 furthermore examining the results obtained for loam1 using moistening solutions with various ecw values it seems that the εa values determined with kelleners are almost identical with the sensor s readings σb less than about 0 8 ds m 1 above this value the εa values obtained with kelleners method are much higher than the sensor readings especially in high θm values due to the detrimental effect of ionic conductivity on the period p kelleners et al 2005 data not shown it should be noted that in the latest cases of σb 0 8 ds m 1 the εa values obtained with kelleners method are even higher than that of the wet sensor which operates at 20 mhz 3 4 salinity effects in liquids solution and soils the results of the measurements conducted in water solutions with increasing ec values where ecw σb it was found that cs655 provides stable εa readings εa 80 81 for ecw 3 ds m 1 for higher ecw values the sensor does not respond data not shown accordingly the upper σb threshold for the sensor operation is about 3 ds m 1 the same σb threshold has been observed in many other sensors such as wet sensor kargas et al 2011 the hydra probe sensor seyfried and murdock 2004 and for sigma probe sensor hilhorst 2000 the results of the experiments conducted in three soil materials sand loam1 and clay loam1 for various ecw levels revealed that the θ ε a relationship is linear in all cases table 4 the values of r2 ranged between 0 982 to 0 997 for the sand between 0 938 to 0 972 for the loam1 and 0 927 to 0 97 for the clay loam1 for the loam1 soil the parameters of the linear relationship a b are almost constant for σb values lower than approximately 1 5 ds m 1 above this threshold there is a noticeable change in both parameters values specifically for maximum σb values up to 1 48 ds m 1 corresponding to ecw 6 1 ds m 1 and θ 0 416 m3 m 3 the slope a and the intercept b had a narrow variation range of 0 092 to 0 094 and 0 90 to 0 103 respectively for higher maximum σb values however corresponding to ecw 12 ds m 1 and θ 0 416 m3 m 3 there is a noticeable difference a 0 076 and b 0 067 similar observations were also made for the clay loam1 in contrast for the case of sand the opposite behavior is observed with decreasing εa readings for increasing ecw values accordingly a increases from 0 127 up to 0 172 and b from 0 157 up to 0 237 this behavior for the case of sand is really difficult to be justified at the current study concerning the comparison between the sensor s εa readings and the εa values corresponding to the θm values according to topp equation the maximum difference ranged between 4 and 12 dielectric units for ecw 0 28 ds m 1 and between 12 and 15 units for ecw 12 ds m 1 the above results reveal the effect of σb in the operation of cs655 sensor in order to better investigate the behavior of cs655 sensor with respect to soils characterized by high salt content in the soil water additional measurements were carried out for each ecw level and for the clay loam1 soil using two sensors that operate in lower frequencies wet 20 mhz and ml2 100 mhz according to the obtained results which are illustrated in fig 3 for ecw 12 ds m 1 it can be observed that for θm values up to 0 238 m3 m 3 the εa values corresponding to each θm value for each sensor follow the following pattern εtopp εcs655 εml2 εwet which is in accordance with the operation frequency of the sensors however over this θm level this pattern changes and cs655 εa readings become higher than the corresponding readings of ml2 sensor and even approach the readings of wet sensor for θm 0 388 m3 m 3 from the above results it is indicated that in higher σb values there is strong effect of the term σb ωε0 in εa in addition this effect in combination with the weakening of the electromagnetic pulse which results in delayed triggering of the next pulse and therefore higher p values may lead to higher εa values this increment seems to be larger than that of the wet sensor which operates in much lower frequency 3 5 alternative calibration equations considering the effect of σ b as a first experiment it was evaluated if θ estimations using the ε r values obtained by eqs 10 and 11 instead of εa in topp et al 1980 equation are improved in comparison to the factory calibration equation for the two soil types for which higher ecw values were tested loam1 clay loam1 the maximum differences of the corrected dielectric permittivity ε r values according to wyseure et al 1997 method from the corresponding values of dielectric permittivity according to topp equation for the loam1 soil and for the three higher ecw levels of 3 61 6 1 and 12 ds m 1 were 3 58 2 88 and 8 7 dielectric units for the clay loam1 soil the maximum differences for the ecw levels of 3 61 and 12 ds m 1 were 14 2 and 12 05 dielectric units it should be noted that the maximum differences between the dielectric permittivity values that correspond to the θm values according to topp equation and the εa readings were 4 6 4 3 and 12 6 dielectric units for the loam1 soil and 17 and 16 dielectric units for the clay loam1 soil correspondingly concerning the accuracy of the θ estimations using the corrected ε r values in the factory calibration the corresponding rmse values for the loam1 soil and the three ecw levels were 0 034 0 040 and 0 057 m3 m 3 for the clay loam1 the corresponding rmse values were 0 071 and 0 064 m3 m 3 based on the above results it can be indicated that θ estimations using the corrected ε r values are better than that of the factory calibration especially for higher σb values however the observed deviations from θm values are significant as regards to the corrected ε r values using robinson et al 1999 method the maximum differences from the values of dielectric permittivity according to topp equation for the loam1 soil for the three ecw levels were 2 67 3 85 and 2 86 dielectric units while the maximum differences for the clay loam1 soil for the two ecw levels were 4 51 and 2 49 dielectric units the corresponding rmse values concerning θ estimations for the loam1 soil were 0 035 0 053 and 0 045 m3 m 3 and for the clay loam1 soil 0 034 and 0 032 m3 m 3 for the respective ecw levels the maximum deviations are observed for θ values in the range of 0 15 to 0 2 m3 m 3 accordingly it may be concluded that robinson et al 1999 method performs better than wyseure et al 1997 method especially in the case of the clay loam1 soil therefore this method can be used in cases with increased soil salinity and when the accuracy requirements in θ measurement are low concerning the results obtained using empirical calibration equation eq 12 considering the effect of σb in θ determination the obtained results are presented in table 5 specifically in this table the estimated values of a b and c parameters as well as the corresponding rmse values for θ estimations for the various soils and ecw levels investigated are presented the obtained results indicate that using evett et al 2005 equation eq 12 a noticeable improvement on θ estimation can be achieved as can be seen in table 5 the rmse values achieved with eq 15 are much smaller than that achieved with robinson et al 1999 method however it should be noted that the performance of the two methods is not directly comparable due to the existence of three fitting parameters in eq 15 that should be determined for each soil i e it is soil specific furthermore as can be seen in table 5 the fitted c parameter values are positive in all cases contrary to the theory evett et al 2005 the fitted b parameter values significantly vary for the various cases and for some ecw levels have negative values which is an indication that this equation is not physically realistic considering the above results the following alternative modified form of eq 12 was also tested 17 θ a ε a b c σ b as can be seen in table 5 the obtained rmse values are higher than those achieved with eq 12 however they are lower than 0 03 m3 m 3 and noticeably better than that of robinson et al 1999 method and the factory calibration furthermore eq 17 seems to be more physically realistic due to the facts that the fitted values of c parameter are negative and of a parameter are positive in all cases and that a and b parameter values are close to the corresponding values proposed by topp and reynolds 1998 3 6 prediction of pore water electrical conductivity considering the results of previous studies reporting that both wet and cs655 sensors provide similar σb readings with tdr regalado et al 2007 chavez and evett 2012 a comparison between the wet and cs655 σb measurements for various ecw and θm levels and for two soils loam1 and clay loam1 was carried out the results obtained indicate that cs655 and wet sensors provide similar σb readings even if there is a big difference in the sensing volume between the two sensors schwartz et al 2018 specifically for the loam1 soil the obtained relationship was σb cs655 0 89 σb wet while for the clay loam1 soil σb cs655 1 02 σb wet following the linearity of the relationship between εa and σb for the cs655 was investigated according to hilhorst 2000 method to this end the εa measurements using cs655 and wet sensors for the various ecw levels and the three soils tested were plotted against the corresponding σb measurements fig 4 the εa σb relationship for the cs655 sensor is strongly linear for all salinity levels since the coefficient of determination r2 varies from 0 964 to 0 996 according to hilhorst 2000 in the above linear relationships ε a f σ b the slope of the line represents ε a σ b and the intercept represents ε 0 the corresponding slope and intercept values as well as the theoretical values of the slope ε p σ p are presented in table 6 as can be clearly seen in fig 4 and table 6 the slope of the line is salinity dependent and decreases when the ecw increases furthermore it seems that the value of the slope is also affected by the soil type on the other hand the value of ε0 appears to increase with increasing salinity and also to increase with increasing clay content as concerns the comparison between the two sensors there is a large difference between the ε0 intercept values table 6 the ε0 values for the wet sensor are more than double that of cs655 sensor furthermore especially for the case of the clay loam1 soil the ε0 values for the cs655 sensor are very near the value 4 1 proposed by hilhorst 2000 in contrast the values of the slope ε a σ b are similar especially for higher ecw levels table 6 it should be noted that the linearity of the relationship εa σb becomes weaker for σb values higher than 2 5 3 ds m 1 for the wet sensor while for the cs655 sensor continues to be strong fig 4 finally the predictions of soil pore water electrical conductivity σp using hilhorst 2000 and malicki and walczak 1999 models for the loam1 and clay loam1 soil were evaluated the obtained results for the loam1 soil reveal that for lower ecw levels 0 0 28 1 17 ds m 1 the two models provide similar σp values for higher ecw levels hilhorst 2000 model provides lower σp values than that of malliki and walczak 1999 model and as a result underestimates σp malicki and walczak 1999 model seems to provide more reliable σp values because the estimated σp values are higher than the corresponding ecw values except from the case that ecw 12 ds m 1 furthermore the difference between the model s predictions and the ecw levels were almost equal to the estimated σp values for ecw 0 ds m 1 similar results obtained for the case of the clay loam1 soil as well 4 conclusions in this study the performance of cs655 sensor was investigated through laboratory experiments using a set of soils featuring a wide range of properties as well as experiments using liquids with known dielectric properties the most significand findings of this study are 1 in the case of liquids with known dielectric properties cs655 sensor provides accurate apparent permittivity εa readings for the case of air and deionized water lower and upper operation limits but underestimates εa for the cases of butanol and ethanol 2 the εa values obtained by the cs655 sensor for the water air layered system are closer to the arithmetic averaging scheme especially for higher εa values for this reason the upward infiltration method which results in non uniform water content in the soil samples is not recommended for the sensor calibration furthermore under conditions of highly contrasting soil water content the vertical installation of the sensor is not recommended 3 in the case of soils the sensor s εa readings are higher than the εa values corresponding to the experimentally measured volumetric soil water content θm values according to topp equation especially for higher θm levels for all the examined soils except form the sand were εa is underestimated throughout the range of θm therefore soil specific calibration is required to achieve higher accuracy 4 the θ m ε a relationship was strongly linear in all the examined cases the multi point calibration method performed better compared to the two point calibration method however specific calibration equations obtained with both methods performed better compared to the manufacturer s calibration equation in all cases thus the two point calibration method can provide a fast and easy way to improve the estimation of θ 5 in the case of non conductive soils kelleners et al 2005 method provides almost identical results with the factory calibration accordingly in these soils cs655 sensor can be calibrated accurately with this method using sensor readings in air and deionized water 6 the obtained results for increased bulk electrical conductivity values reveal that the effect of bulk electrical conductivity in the operation of cs655 sensor is significant thus in the case of increased bulk electrical conductivity the use of alternative calibration equations considering the effect of bulk soil electrical conductivity σb is recommended 7 soil water content estimations using the corrected real part of relative permittivity ε r values are better than that of the factory calibration especially for higher σb values however the observed deviations from the θm values are significant robinson et al 1999 method performs better than wyseure et al 1997 method and can be used in cases with increased soil salinity when the accuracy requirements in volumetric soil water content θ measurement are low empirical calibration equations considering the effect of σb in θ determination provide noticeably superior performance however the determination of three fitting parameters for each soil is required 8 the εa σb relationship is strongly linear in all the examined salinity levels malliki and walczak 1999 model seems to provide more reliable pore water electrical conductivity σp values than the hilhorst 2000 model the above results provide an in depth understanding of cs655 performance as well as specific information facilitating the improved exploitation of its potential under various conditions and in various applications it should be noted that even if this research included a wide set of soil properties more laboratory and field experiments are required in order to consider the vast natural variability of soils the investigation of other calibration methods and other alternative calibration equations considering the effect of σb may also provide a better insight in the sensor performance for the case of soils with high salinity levels

11202,cs655 water content reflectometer wcr campbell scientific inc logan ut usa is a recently developed multiparameter electromagnetic sensor measuring volumetric soil water content θ bulk soil electrical conductivity σb and temperature in this study cs655 sensor s performance was investigated through laboratory experiments using a set of liquids with known dielectric and salinity properties and soils featuring a wide range of conditions including physico chemical properties water regimes and salinity of the water solution the sensor s performance was analyzed in comparison with wet and ml2 theta probe delta t device ltd cambridge uk dielectric sensors it was found that cs655 apparent dielectric permittivity εa readings were higher than that of topp s permittivity water content relationship especially at higher soil water content values as much as 12 dimensionless permittivity units the results suggested that the relationship between experimentally measured soil water content θm and ε a was strongly linear 0 911 r2 0 997 the most accurate results were provided by the multi point calibration method moreover for the case of non conductive soils kelleners s method provides similar εa values with cs655 sensor readings for a maximum σb value of about 0 8 ds m 1 concerning the use of empirical calibration equations which include the effect of bulk electrical conductivity in εa the obtained results suggest that the equation θ a ε a b c σ b has a strong physical basis and adequate performance rmse 0 03 m3 m 3 finally the investigation of the εa σb relationship revealed that it is strongly linear and that slope mainly depends on the pore water electrical conductivity σp which is closely related to the soil solution salinity in contact with plant roots that influences plants growth the malliki walzcak model provide more reliable σp predictions as compared to the hilhorst model keywords electromagnetic sensors soil moisture cs655 sensor water content reflectometers dielectric permittivity bulk electrical conductivity 1 introduction efficient irrigation management is critical factor in order to achieve high yield and at the same time low water consumption however it is a complicated and demanding process due to the various factors that should be considered for instance irrigation system characteristics climate conditions soil characteristics crop species cultivation practices etc sezen et al 2006 soulis and elmalloglou 2016 2018 accordingly proper irrigation management requires a sound basis for making irrigation decisions such as environmental measurements evapotranspiration soil water content or plant stress soulis et al 2015 recent advances in electromagnetic em soil water content sensors i e the ability to be easily automated measurements of multiple parameters with a single sensor and low cost facilitated and promoted their use in irrigation scheduling miller et al 2014 singh et al 2018 however sensors accuracy may have a significant effect on irrigation efficiency soulis et al 2015 almost all of the recently developed soil water sensors use the soil apparent dielectric permittivity εa as the basis for determining water content this is due to the fact that water has a much larger value of apparent permittivity εa 80 compared to air εa 1 or soil solids εa 3 7 therefore dielectric permittivity of the soil is primarily a function of θ seyfried and murdock 2004 topp et al 1980 demonstrated that dielectric measurements could be used to accurately measure θ using time domain reflectometry tdr tdr is considered to be one of the most reliable methods for performing continuous nondestructive measurements of θ it is based on measuring travel time of electric pulses along a waveguide in order to estimate soil apparent permittivity εa which is directly related to the travel time soil relative complex permittivity ε r is composed of a real component i e a dielectric constant and an imaginary component eq 1 1 ε r ε r j ε r where ε r is the dielectric constant the real part of relative permittivity ε r the imaginary part of relative permittivity is the equivalent dielectric loss taking into consideration the conductive loss and j 1 soil water content is more directly related to ε r for the tdr technique the real component ε r of the relative permittivity is considered about equal with the apparent permittivity εa relative imaginary permittivity is the sum of a conduction term and a relaxation term eq 2 2 ε r σ b ω ε 0 ε r e l where σ b is the direct current bulk electrical conductivity ec ε 0 is the permittivity of the free space 8 85 10 12 f m 1 ε r e l is the frequency dependent relative dielectric loss due to relaxation and ω is the angular frequency given as 2πf with f being the frequency as can be seen in eq 2 ε r depends on bulk soil electrical conductivity and measurement frequency accordingly accurate θ determinations are unlikely when the frequency is small or when bulk soil electrical conductivity is high regalado et al 2007 this is expected to consist an important issue in many dielectric sensors due to their low operating frequency calibration equations such as the empirical equation of topp et al 1980 are widely used in coarse grained mineral soils for calculating θ from apparent permittivity data using tdr as was shown by topp and reynolds 1998 the topp et al 1980 equation is equivalent to a linear equation between the square root of apparent permittivity and θ 3 θ 0 115 ε a 0 176 as regards tdr measurements the slope of eq 3 represents the combined effects of salts and clay content while the intercept represents the effect of dry solids ferre and topp 2002 even though tdr is considered a reliable and accurate method for determining soil or substrate θ its high cost has led in the development of alternative dielectric sensors technologies capacitance impedance and transmission line oscillators which are cheaper and do not rely on complicated waveform analysis it is frequently implied that these alternative dielectric sensors which operate at lower frequencies compared to tdr have similar behavior with tdr however this suggestion is questionable especially when the bulk soil electrical conductivity σb effect on ε a θ relationship is considered since its effect on the electromagnetic field attenuation has been proven to increase as the operating frequency decreases kelleners et al 2009 in addition evett and parkin 2005 reported that the response of electromagnetic sensors often depends on soil type especially when low frequencies 200 mhz are utilized among the above referred alternative dielectric sensors technologies transmission line oscillators are of particular interest as they operate similar to the tdr but without the need of a separate pulse and sampling unit kelleners et al 2005 commercial sensors based on this technology are the cs615 cs616 cs625 and cs655 new model water content reflectometers campbell scientific inc logan ut usa seyfried and murdock 2001 in their study evaluating cs615 sensor found that a separate calibration equation was needed for each of the four studied porous media a sandy loam two loam soils and a construction sand to achieve accurate θ measurement they also investigated how the calibration was affected by changing temperature and found that the effect of temperature varied with θ and soil type chandler et al 2004 based on field experiments also reported that specific calibration according to the soil type is required kelleners et al 2005 developed a physical framework in which the cs615 sensor s output period p is related to the apparent permittivity and then the apparent permittivity is related to soil water content two step approach the results of their study show that the water content reflectometers can be calibrated accurately with this method using sensor readings in air and deionized water blonquist et al 2005 based on data for the cases of conducting relaxing and non relaxing conducting media reported that cs616 sensor overestimated apparent permittivity finally kelleners et al 2009 compared cs625 and tdr in wyoming soils and found that apparent permittivity measured with the cs625 sensor was as much as 187 higher than that of the tdr they also found that soil texture had little impact on sensor readings furthermore they proposed equations linking the slope of the linear relationship between experimentally measured volumetric soil water content θm and square root of apparent permittivity with the saturated bulk soil electrical conductivity the existence of a linear relationship between the square root of permittivity and θm has been observed for several other dielectric sensors mainly for the case of inorganic soils seyfried et al 2005 kargas and kerkides 2008 kargas et al 2011 kargas and soulis 2012 kargas et al 2013 however the parameters of the linear relationship are different between different soil types and different dielectric sensors the improvement of θ estimation by considering the effect of bulk electrical conductivity on the soil dielectric permittivity has been also attempted mainly for the case of tdr wyseure et al 1997 robinson et al 1999 schwartz et al 2013 the general expectation is that among commercial sensors those with higher measurement frequencies should experience less dependence of εα from σb with calibration relationship closer to the topp equation than sensors using lower measurement frequencies up to now two different methodologies have been developed for the calibration of dielectric sensors according to the first method the relationship between relative permittivity and θm is obtained by preparing soil samples with predetermined θm uniformly distributed in the soil mass however this method is time consuming and can provide only a limited number of experimental points of water content seyfried et al 2005 the second method proposed by young et al 1997 is the upward infiltration method which allows the user to apply a well controlled flux of water at the bottom boundary of the sample with a vertically installed dielectric sensor at the top of the soil column in this method the soil remains unchanged during the experiment but the water distribution within the soil is not uniform it is a relatively fast method and capable of obtaining several experimental points of water content seyfried et al 2005 kargas and kerkides 2009 logsdon 2009 kargas et al 2011 2013 another important issue is related to the performance of dielectric sensors under non uniform soil water patterns tdr measurements in non uniform soil water patterns was initially examined by topp et al 1982 and subsequently by several other researchers chan and knight 1999 2001 schaap et al 2003 robinson et al 2005 it should be noted that the refractive averaging scheme to determine the effective permittivity of layered wet and dry porous media seems to be the most appropriate for tdr devices except in the following two cases a when operational frequency drops below 100 mhz and b when multiple thin layers with different water contents are encountered in these cases the arithmetic averaging scheme might be more appropriate the effect of non uniform soil water patterns for the case of the new dielectric devices which commonly operate in frequencies lower than 100 mhz has been investigated in several studies seyfried et al 2005 kargas and kerkides 2009 kargas et al 2011 kargas and soulis 2012 previous studies attempted to estimate pore water electrical conductivity σp based on dielectric sensors measurements of σb and εα pore water electrical conductivity is an index of soil salinity since the plants root actually experience the solute concentration of the soil solution malicki and walczak 1999 had shown that the relationship σb f εα σp is linear for εα 6 2 and introduced an empirical linear model for the prediction of σp hilhorst 2000 also presented a model connecting εα σb and σp which can be used to calculate σp from simultaneous measurement of εα and σb it should be noted that for the sc655 sensor which is a rather new device that could be used for routine measurements of bulk soil electrical conductivity the prediction of the soil pore water electrical conductivity using the above simple linear models has not been investigated up to now a detailed independent evaluation of the cs655 device considering the above mentioned issues may lead to its better use in future field water monitoring programs and to the full exploitation of its potential this is important because by directly monitoring soil water content and soil salinity in the root zone with dielectric sensors it is possible to precisely manage agricultural water and nutrients preventing waste of water leaching of soluble chemicals and land degradation in this context the main objectives of this study are i to develop soil specific calibration equations for a wide variety of soils for the cs655 sensor using the multi point and the two point specific calibration methods to this end the calibration procedure using soil samples of predetermined water content robinson 2001 kelleners et al 2009 was used in order to achieve an in depth understanding of cs655 performance considering the porous medium properties soil texture electrical conductivity and others ii to investigate the applicability of the physical framework proposed by kelleners et al 2005 iii to investigate the response of cs655 to changes in bulk soil electrical conductivity levels and to compare the performance of the various models that incorporate bulk soil electrical conductivity in the calibration equations through the simultaneous estimation of both εa and σb for the same soil volume using cs655 sensor iv to determine the response of cs655 sensor in bi layered systems liquid air v to investigate the prediction of soil pore water electrical conductivity σp with the empirical linear models of malicki and walczak 1999 as well as the linear model of hilhorst 2000 based on the cs655 sensor measurements for a range of soil types and for various salinity levels of the moistening solutions the sensor s performance was also analyzed in comparison with two additional dielectric sensors operating in lower frequencies wet and ml2 theta probe delta t device ltd cambridge uk 2 materials and methods 2 1 sensors characteristics according to its manual campbell scientific inc 2014 the cs655 sensor is configured as a water content reflectometer with the two parallel rods forming an open ended transmission line a differential oscillator circuit is connected to the rods with an oscillator state change triggered by the return of a reflected signal from one of the rods the two way travel time of the electromagnetic waves that are induced by the oscillator on the rod varies with changing dielectric permittivity it consists of two stainless steel rods connected to a printed circuit rod length diameter and spacing are respectively 12 cm 3 2 mm and 32 mm the sensing volume is approximately 3600 cm3 7 5 cm radius around each probe rod and 4 5 cm beyond the end of the rods soil water content θ is calculated using topp et al 1980 equation for θ values ranging between 5 and 50 according to its manual the sensor s accuracy is 1 with soil specific calibration and 3 with the typical factory calibration where solution electrical conductivity ec 10 ds m 1 the accuracy of the bulk soil ec measurements is 5 of the reading for bulk electrical conductivity 8 ds m 1 the temperature measurement range is 50 to 70 c water content reflectometers measure the number of reflected voltage pulses per second the number of reflections is divided by a dimensionless scaling factor sf to facilitate recording by a datalogger the output is generally read as a period p the travel time for the reflectometer according to kelleners et al 2005 is 4 t 2 f r p s f 4 l ε a c 2 t d where f r is the number of reflections per second before scaling td is the delay time in the sensor head before the next pulse is triggered and c is the velocity of light in vacuum the scaling factor for the cs655 is 128 the rise time tr of the voltage pulse is about 2 ns and the delay time in the sensor head td is 3 4 ns campbell scientific inc personal communication the rise time of the voltage pulse can be related to the maximum frequency fm in the incident electromagnetic wave with the following equation bogart et al 2004 5 f m ln 0 9 0 1 2 π t r the resulting fm value is 175 mhz note that the fm value refer to the input signal and should be treated as approximations in this study sensors measurements were recorded using cr850 data logger campbell scientific inc the ml2 sensor delta t devices ltd 1999 consists of a waterproof housing which contains the electronics and four sharpened stainless steel rods attached to it it estimates volumetric water content by applying a 100 mhz signal via a specially designed transmission line whose impedance is changed as the impedance of the soil changes the wet sensor delta t device ltd 2005 is a multi parameter capacitance sensor consisting of the main body which contains the electronics and three sharpened stainless steel rods attached to it it measures the dielectric properties of the soil by generating a 20 mhz signal which is applied to the central rod the wet sensor also estimates volumetric water content pore water electrical conductivity and soil temperature 2 2 measurements in liquids and in water air layered systems as a first step in this evaluation measurements in liquids with known dielectric properties were carried out in order to evaluate the sensor accuracy in measuring apparent permittivity εα as well as to investigate the sensor s response in layered systems these experiments are particularly useful for the sensor calibration process due to the non conductive nature of the media furthermore by using liquids any possible problems caused by non uniform contact between the sensor s rods and the material which could occur in case of soils are eliminated the measurements were carried out in air ε α 1 in butanol ε α 16 8 in ethanol ε α 24 3 and in deionized water ε α 80 at 25 c temperature furthermore measurement at water solutions with various ec values 0 5 ds m 1 were also carried out in order to evaluate the sensor s performance in high ec conditions sensors behavior in layered systems is important for the evaluation of the sensor s performance in soils having non uniform water content patterns or in stratified soils which are common conditions in real applications in the case of layered systems the εa value provided by a sensor can be described by either the refractive index topp et al 1982 6 ε α r e f σ i 1 n l i ε α i σ i 1 n l i 2 or the simple arithmetic average 7 ε α a r i t h σ i 1 n l i ε α i σ i 1 n l i where εα ref is the apparent permittivity for the case of the refractive index averaging εα arith is the apparent permittivity for the case of the arithmetic averaging li is the thickness of the ith layer εαi the value of the permittivity of the ith layer n is the number of layers and σ i 1 n l i represents the whole depth of the layered system in order to investigate the response of cs655 sensor in layered systems a simple water air system was used the sensor was gradually inserted vertically to a sufficiently large cylindrical vessel containing water at a constant temperature 21 c at each depth of immersion d the εa readings of the sensor were recorded using the cr850 datalogger then the corresponding εa values were estimated according to both the refractive and the arithmetic averaging schemes eq 6 and 7 and were compared with the cs655 readings for each value of d 2 3 measurements in soils the experiments were conducted using ten different soil types except from the sand the rest of the examined soils were collected in the field table 1 the mechanical analysis and the bulk density of soils used are presented in table 1 these soils were selected because they exhibit a wide variety of properties i e particle size distribution bulk density in order to facilitate the exhaustive performance evaluation and the soil specific calibration of the cs655 sensor all experiments were carried out at constant temperature 21 1 c to eliminate temperature effects in this study the method of predetermined uniform soil water content regimes calibration approach was applied in all the experiments the θm ranged from oven dry to saturation in equal water content steps δθ 0 05 m3 m 3 to this end air dried soil samples were thoroughly mixed with different predetermined amounts of fresh water ec 0 28 ds m 1 taking care to get homogeneous water content the obtained soil material of various water content levels was packed in pvc columns with 30 cm height and 20 cm diameter in small portions and pressed with a 0 15 kg rubber hammer to achieve homogeneous density distribution in the soil sample the θm and dry bulk density of the soils were determined once again at the end of the experiment by weighing and oven drying in addition measurements were taken in an oven dried soil sample θ 0 m3 m 3 using the above methodology a sufficient number of εa σb period p and θ readings for all the soil types examined were provided measurements were obtained by fully inserting vertically the cs655 sensor into the soils samples the soil specific calibration of the sensor was performed using the following linear equation between the square root of εa and θm 8 θ m a ε a b where the parameters a and b depend on the soil material this equation has been widely applied for the calibration of tdr and other dielectric sensors ledieu et al 1986 white et al 1994 spaans and baker 1996 ferre and topp 2002 kargas et al 2011 kargas and soulis 2012 soil specific values for a and b parameters can be easily determined using two independent pairs of θm and εa values two point calibration cal for simplicity reasons and in order to cover the entire range of possible θ values of the studied soil material the first εa measurement is taken at an oven dried soil sample and the second εa measurement is taken at a saturated soil sample i e θ θs seyfried et al 2005 kargas and soulis 2012 optimal values for a and b can be also determined by linear regression between θm and ε α using all the measured θm values multi point calibration calal in this study soil specific calibration relationships for each soil studied were produced using both the above described methods two point calibration and multi point calibration 2 4 applicability of kelleners et al 2005 physical framework according to kelleners et al 2005 in the case of non conductive soils εa can be estimated from the measured period by solving equation 4 for εa in case that the length l of the rods and the delay time td are known however even if the physical length of the rods is known equal to 12 cm the actual length l as experienced by the voltage pulse will slightly vary the actual length l can be determined analytically using equation 4 based on the measurements in deionized water and in air by subtracting the corresponding equations for air and water an approximation of the calibrated length is obtained as follows 9 l c p w p a 4 s f ε w ε a after determining l td can be also calculated by eq 4 using the measurements in deionized water or in air in this study the applicability of kelleners et al 2005 method was evaluated in the studied soils 2 5 salinity effects in water solutions and soils in order to investigate the effect of salinity on the sensor performance several measurements in water solutions and in soils with increased ec values were carried out initially measurements in water solutions with increasing electrical conductivity values ecw prepared by adding kcl to deionized water were made in this case the electrical conductivity of the water solution ecw is considered equal with σb accordingly it was made possible to determinate the σb threshold for which the sensor is able to provide accurate εa readings furthermore the experimental setup described in section 2 3 measurements in soils was used in order to evaluate the sensor s sensitivity to salinity for three soil materials sand loam1 and clay loam1 table 1 however in this instance kcl solutions with known electrical conductivity values ecw were added to obtain the pre determined θm levels from oven dry to saturation instead of fresh water the corresponding ec values of the water solutions ecw used for the case of sand were 0 0 28 1 17 3 6 and 6 1 ds m 1 for the loam1 were 0 0 28 1 17 3 6 6 1 and 12 ds m 1 while for the clay loam1 were 0 28 3 6 and 12 ds m 1 2 6 alternative calibration equations considering the effect of σb the possible improvements of θ estimation with cs655 sensor considering σb effect on εa were also evaluated several empirical approaches have been proposed mainly for tdr taking into account the effect of bulk electrical conductivity on the soil dielectric permittivity wyseure et al 1997 robinson et al 1999 initially the applicability of wyseure et al 1997 and robinson et al 1999 empirical equations was evaluated specifically wyseure et al 1997 based on experiments using tdr in soil columns packed with 5 different porous media and saturated with solutions having various ec values proposed the following empirical correction equation for σb 2 5 ds m 1 10 ε r ε a 1 432 σ b similarly robinson et al 1999 based on experiments using three different dielectric sensors tdr surface capacitance insertion probe scip ml2 theta probe in 4 different sandy porous media found that the effect of σb to εa is small for tdr but for scip it was 3 5 times larger compared to tdr based on their observations they also proposed the following empirical correction equation for σb 2 5 ds m 1 11 ε r ε a 0 628 σ b accordingly it was evaluated if θ estimations using the ε r values obtained by eqs 10 and 11 instead of εa in topp et al 1980 equation are improved in comparison to the factory calibration equation furthermore the performance of the empirical calibration equation proposed by evett et al 2005 which directly considers the effect of σb in the determination of θ was evaluated the corresponding equation is 12 θ a ε a b c σ b where a b and c are fitting parameters 2 7 prediction of pore water electrical conductivity as a final step in this study the prediction of soil pore water electrical conductivity σp by utilizing cs655 sensor measurements has been attempted to this end the malicki and walczak 1999 and hilhorst 2000 models were used malicki and walczak 1999 had shown that the relationship σb f εα σp is linear for εα 6 2 and introduced the term of soil salinity index xs describing soil salinity status the salinity index was defined as the partial derivative of σb with respect to εa as determined by tdr specifically malicki and walczak 1999 presented the following empirical linear model 13 σ p σ b 0 08 ε a 6 2 0 0057 0 000071 s where s is the sand content in percent by weight this model seems to be free of fitting parameters when εa 6 this limitation is not considered as important since the θ values corresponding to εa 6 are below 0 1 m3 m 3 malicki and walczak 1999 suggested the use of eq 13 for θm values larger than 0 2 m3 m 3 because at this range the salinity index σ b ε a seems to be practically unaffected by θ it should be noted that this model was tested using σ b and εa values obtained using a tdr device which operates in a broad frequency band hilhorst 2000 presented a model connecting εα σb and σp in the form 14 ε a ε p σ p σ b ε 0 where εp is the dielectric permittivity of the pore water considered equal to that of pure water 80 3 at 20 c and ε0 is the y intercept of the line εa f σb using eq 14 σp can be calculated from a simultaneous measurement of εa and σb hilhorst 2000 found that ε0 was in the range of 1 9 to 7 6 although ε0 could be obtained experimentally for every soil type the value of 4 1 was proposed to be used as a standard value for all soil types it should be noted that this model must be applied for θm values greater than 0 1 m3 m 3 according to regalado et al 2007 the model of hilhorst 2000 seems to be a rather simplistic special case of the model of rhoades et al 1976 in the sense that it does not take into consideration that σ p might be affected by the surface conductance of the soil matrix 2 8 performance evaluation criteria for the evaluation of the various calibration equations and the various models investigated in this study the root mean square error rmse performance evaluation criterion and the r2 determination coefficient were used 15 r m s e σ i 1 n p r e d i o b s i 2 n 16 r 2 σ i 1 n o b s i o b s p r e d i p r e d i σ i 1 n o b s i o b s 2 σ i 1 n p r e d i p r e d i 2 where predi is the ith predicted value of the modeled parameter obsi is the corresponding observed value o b s and p r e d are the mean observed and predicted values and n is the total number of different observed predicted values pairs rmse is expressed in the same units as the estimated parameter and values close to 0 indicate better performance r2 ranges between 0 and 1 where values close to 0 indicate no correlation and values close to 1 indicate a strong correlation 3 results and discussions 3 1 measurements in liquids and in water air layered system the obtained results from the cs655 sensor measurements of εa in liquids with known dielectric properties were εa 14 1 for butanol εa 22 7 for ethanol εa 80 6 for deionized water and εa 1 for air comparing these values with the dielectric permittivity values for the same liquids and air it can be seen that the sensor provides accurate readings for the case of air and deionized water but underestimates εa for the cases of butanol and ethanol in fig 1 apparent permittivity values obtained by partially inserting the cs655 sensor in water were plotted against immersion depth d together with estimated permittivity values according to the refractive and arithmetic averaging schemes eqs 6 and 7 as can be seen permittivity values obtained by the cs655 sensor for the water air layered system deviate from the corresponding values estimated with the two averaging schemes but are closer to the arithmetic averaging scheme especially for higher εa values this is in agreement with what kargas and kerkides 2009 and kargas et al 2011 found with the ml2 and wet sensors but is in sharp contrast to those reported by young et al 1997 for tdr therefore in case that the upward infiltration calibration method is applied for the cs655 sensor in a soil with non uniform water content the determined εa will be different than that of a soil having the same water content uniformly distributed furthermore under conditions of highly contrasting soil water content such as a vertical installation at the soil surface large errors in water content measurement may result if the typical linear θm ε a relationship is used 3 2 soil specific calibration in fig 2 the εa readings obtained by cs655 sensor and εa values estimated by topp equation for each θm data point are plotted against the θm values for all the studied soils the soil water content θ estimations obtained using the multi point calal and the two point cal soil specific calibration methods are also plotted as a function of the εa readings for the same soils the corresponding a and b parameter values for both calibration methods and the r2 values concerning eq 8 as well as the σb readings obtained by cs655 sensor at saturation are presented in table 2 the corresponding rmse values for the θ predictions obtained by the two calibration methods are presented in table 3 the high r2 values indicate that the relationship θm ε a is strongly linear in all cases examined the ec value of the fresh water used to moisten the soil samples was 0 28 ds m 1 as can be seen in table 2 the slope value a eq 8 is lower than the corresponding value proposed by topp and reynolds 1998 for mineral soils measured with high frequency tdr a 0 115 for all the studied soils except of the case of sand the low a parameter values indicate that cs655 senses higher εa values in comparison with the tdr the higher difference between the cs655 εa values and the values corresponding to the topp equation is about 12 dielectric units and is more obvious in θm values higher than 0 20 0 25 m3 m 3 this can be attributed to the lower operation frequency of cs655 f 175 mhz moreover due to the relatively low operation frequency of cs655 the higher εa values can be attributed to the effect of the eq 2 term σb ωε0 topp et al 2000 as well as to the sensor design kelleners et al 2009 for instance the observed difference is higher than that observed for a silty loam soil with cs616 sensor which operates in the same frequency as cs655 kelleners et al 2005 the effect of soil texture on the soil specific calibration parameters table 2 calal is not considerable as the slope a ranges between 0 081 and 0 098 and the intercept b between 0 075 and 0 119 for all the studied soils except of the sand in the latest case the corresponding parameters values are obviously higher a 0 125 and b 0 157 as can be seen in table 2 and fig 2 eq 8 fitted very well to the measured data and the r2 values obtained were generally higher than 0 938 except from one case where r2 was equal to 0 911 this linearity between θm and ε α data has been also observed in other studies concerning tdr ferre and topp 2002 and other commercial sensors seyfried and murdock 2004 kargas and kerkides 2008 kargas and soulis 2012 when the water content is uniform in the sensed volume concerning the accuracy of the two point calibration method cal as can be seen in table 2 the slope values a and the intercept values b estimated with the two point calibration method cal are higher than that of the multi point calibration calal the observed differences are higher for the intercept for all cases except for the case of sand the calculated rmse values comparing the accuracy of the two methods are presented in table 3 as can be seen in fig 2 and table 3 the multi point calibration method calal performed better compared to the two point calibration method cal the rmse values obtained with calal table 3 range from 0 01 to 0 041 m3 m 3 in case that an acceptable accuracy level of 0 03 m3 m 3 is considered then the obtained rmse values for the calal method are lower than this level in all the examined cases except from clay2 0 041 m3 m 3 in contrast as it was expected the corresponding rmse values obtained with cal are higher in all cases and in some cases are even two times higher than that of calal e g for the sandy clay loam soil it should be also noted that the calal method gives much better rmse values compared to the manufacturer s calibration equation topp equation in all cases while the cal method gives better results in all cases except for three soils table 3 3 3 applicability of kelleners et al 2005 physical framework using measurements in deionized water and in air and based on the methodology described in the materials and methods section the actual length l of the rods was determined equal to 0 1157 m using the actual length l and delay time td values the apparent permittivity values were estimated using eq 4 solved for εa the obtained results revealed that εa values calculated with this method were almost identical to the factory calibration furthermore in case that the multi point calibration method calal is applied using the apparent permittivity values obtained by the method of kelleners instead of that measured directly by the sensor then the obtained rmse values are similar and in some cases better than that of the original calal method predictions table 3 furthermore examining the results obtained for loam1 using moistening solutions with various ecw values it seems that the εa values determined with kelleners are almost identical with the sensor s readings σb less than about 0 8 ds m 1 above this value the εa values obtained with kelleners method are much higher than the sensor readings especially in high θm values due to the detrimental effect of ionic conductivity on the period p kelleners et al 2005 data not shown it should be noted that in the latest cases of σb 0 8 ds m 1 the εa values obtained with kelleners method are even higher than that of the wet sensor which operates at 20 mhz 3 4 salinity effects in liquids solution and soils the results of the measurements conducted in water solutions with increasing ec values where ecw σb it was found that cs655 provides stable εa readings εa 80 81 for ecw 3 ds m 1 for higher ecw values the sensor does not respond data not shown accordingly the upper σb threshold for the sensor operation is about 3 ds m 1 the same σb threshold has been observed in many other sensors such as wet sensor kargas et al 2011 the hydra probe sensor seyfried and murdock 2004 and for sigma probe sensor hilhorst 2000 the results of the experiments conducted in three soil materials sand loam1 and clay loam1 for various ecw levels revealed that the θ ε a relationship is linear in all cases table 4 the values of r2 ranged between 0 982 to 0 997 for the sand between 0 938 to 0 972 for the loam1 and 0 927 to 0 97 for the clay loam1 for the loam1 soil the parameters of the linear relationship a b are almost constant for σb values lower than approximately 1 5 ds m 1 above this threshold there is a noticeable change in both parameters values specifically for maximum σb values up to 1 48 ds m 1 corresponding to ecw 6 1 ds m 1 and θ 0 416 m3 m 3 the slope a and the intercept b had a narrow variation range of 0 092 to 0 094 and 0 90 to 0 103 respectively for higher maximum σb values however corresponding to ecw 12 ds m 1 and θ 0 416 m3 m 3 there is a noticeable difference a 0 076 and b 0 067 similar observations were also made for the clay loam1 in contrast for the case of sand the opposite behavior is observed with decreasing εa readings for increasing ecw values accordingly a increases from 0 127 up to 0 172 and b from 0 157 up to 0 237 this behavior for the case of sand is really difficult to be justified at the current study concerning the comparison between the sensor s εa readings and the εa values corresponding to the θm values according to topp equation the maximum difference ranged between 4 and 12 dielectric units for ecw 0 28 ds m 1 and between 12 and 15 units for ecw 12 ds m 1 the above results reveal the effect of σb in the operation of cs655 sensor in order to better investigate the behavior of cs655 sensor with respect to soils characterized by high salt content in the soil water additional measurements were carried out for each ecw level and for the clay loam1 soil using two sensors that operate in lower frequencies wet 20 mhz and ml2 100 mhz according to the obtained results which are illustrated in fig 3 for ecw 12 ds m 1 it can be observed that for θm values up to 0 238 m3 m 3 the εa values corresponding to each θm value for each sensor follow the following pattern εtopp εcs655 εml2 εwet which is in accordance with the operation frequency of the sensors however over this θm level this pattern changes and cs655 εa readings become higher than the corresponding readings of ml2 sensor and even approach the readings of wet sensor for θm 0 388 m3 m 3 from the above results it is indicated that in higher σb values there is strong effect of the term σb ωε0 in εa in addition this effect in combination with the weakening of the electromagnetic pulse which results in delayed triggering of the next pulse and therefore higher p values may lead to higher εa values this increment seems to be larger than that of the wet sensor which operates in much lower frequency 3 5 alternative calibration equations considering the effect of σ b as a first experiment it was evaluated if θ estimations using the ε r values obtained by eqs 10 and 11 instead of εa in topp et al 1980 equation are improved in comparison to the factory calibration equation for the two soil types for which higher ecw values were tested loam1 clay loam1 the maximum differences of the corrected dielectric permittivity ε r values according to wyseure et al 1997 method from the corresponding values of dielectric permittivity according to topp equation for the loam1 soil and for the three higher ecw levels of 3 61 6 1 and 12 ds m 1 were 3 58 2 88 and 8 7 dielectric units for the clay loam1 soil the maximum differences for the ecw levels of 3 61 and 12 ds m 1 were 14 2 and 12 05 dielectric units it should be noted that the maximum differences between the dielectric permittivity values that correspond to the θm values according to topp equation and the εa readings were 4 6 4 3 and 12 6 dielectric units for the loam1 soil and 17 and 16 dielectric units for the clay loam1 soil correspondingly concerning the accuracy of the θ estimations using the corrected ε r values in the factory calibration the corresponding rmse values for the loam1 soil and the three ecw levels were 0 034 0 040 and 0 057 m3 m 3 for the clay loam1 the corresponding rmse values were 0 071 and 0 064 m3 m 3 based on the above results it can be indicated that θ estimations using the corrected ε r values are better than that of the factory calibration especially for higher σb values however the observed deviations from θm values are significant as regards to the corrected ε r values using robinson et al 1999 method the maximum differences from the values of dielectric permittivity according to topp equation for the loam1 soil for the three ecw levels were 2 67 3 85 and 2 86 dielectric units while the maximum differences for the clay loam1 soil for the two ecw levels were 4 51 and 2 49 dielectric units the corresponding rmse values concerning θ estimations for the loam1 soil were 0 035 0 053 and 0 045 m3 m 3 and for the clay loam1 soil 0 034 and 0 032 m3 m 3 for the respective ecw levels the maximum deviations are observed for θ values in the range of 0 15 to 0 2 m3 m 3 accordingly it may be concluded that robinson et al 1999 method performs better than wyseure et al 1997 method especially in the case of the clay loam1 soil therefore this method can be used in cases with increased soil salinity and when the accuracy requirements in θ measurement are low concerning the results obtained using empirical calibration equation eq 12 considering the effect of σb in θ determination the obtained results are presented in table 5 specifically in this table the estimated values of a b and c parameters as well as the corresponding rmse values for θ estimations for the various soils and ecw levels investigated are presented the obtained results indicate that using evett et al 2005 equation eq 12 a noticeable improvement on θ estimation can be achieved as can be seen in table 5 the rmse values achieved with eq 15 are much smaller than that achieved with robinson et al 1999 method however it should be noted that the performance of the two methods is not directly comparable due to the existence of three fitting parameters in eq 15 that should be determined for each soil i e it is soil specific furthermore as can be seen in table 5 the fitted c parameter values are positive in all cases contrary to the theory evett et al 2005 the fitted b parameter values significantly vary for the various cases and for some ecw levels have negative values which is an indication that this equation is not physically realistic considering the above results the following alternative modified form of eq 12 was also tested 17 θ a ε a b c σ b as can be seen in table 5 the obtained rmse values are higher than those achieved with eq 12 however they are lower than 0 03 m3 m 3 and noticeably better than that of robinson et al 1999 method and the factory calibration furthermore eq 17 seems to be more physically realistic due to the facts that the fitted values of c parameter are negative and of a parameter are positive in all cases and that a and b parameter values are close to the corresponding values proposed by topp and reynolds 1998 3 6 prediction of pore water electrical conductivity considering the results of previous studies reporting that both wet and cs655 sensors provide similar σb readings with tdr regalado et al 2007 chavez and evett 2012 a comparison between the wet and cs655 σb measurements for various ecw and θm levels and for two soils loam1 and clay loam1 was carried out the results obtained indicate that cs655 and wet sensors provide similar σb readings even if there is a big difference in the sensing volume between the two sensors schwartz et al 2018 specifically for the loam1 soil the obtained relationship was σb cs655 0 89 σb wet while for the clay loam1 soil σb cs655 1 02 σb wet following the linearity of the relationship between εa and σb for the cs655 was investigated according to hilhorst 2000 method to this end the εa measurements using cs655 and wet sensors for the various ecw levels and the three soils tested were plotted against the corresponding σb measurements fig 4 the εa σb relationship for the cs655 sensor is strongly linear for all salinity levels since the coefficient of determination r2 varies from 0 964 to 0 996 according to hilhorst 2000 in the above linear relationships ε a f σ b the slope of the line represents ε a σ b and the intercept represents ε 0 the corresponding slope and intercept values as well as the theoretical values of the slope ε p σ p are presented in table 6 as can be clearly seen in fig 4 and table 6 the slope of the line is salinity dependent and decreases when the ecw increases furthermore it seems that the value of the slope is also affected by the soil type on the other hand the value of ε0 appears to increase with increasing salinity and also to increase with increasing clay content as concerns the comparison between the two sensors there is a large difference between the ε0 intercept values table 6 the ε0 values for the wet sensor are more than double that of cs655 sensor furthermore especially for the case of the clay loam1 soil the ε0 values for the cs655 sensor are very near the value 4 1 proposed by hilhorst 2000 in contrast the values of the slope ε a σ b are similar especially for higher ecw levels table 6 it should be noted that the linearity of the relationship εa σb becomes weaker for σb values higher than 2 5 3 ds m 1 for the wet sensor while for the cs655 sensor continues to be strong fig 4 finally the predictions of soil pore water electrical conductivity σp using hilhorst 2000 and malicki and walczak 1999 models for the loam1 and clay loam1 soil were evaluated the obtained results for the loam1 soil reveal that for lower ecw levels 0 0 28 1 17 ds m 1 the two models provide similar σp values for higher ecw levels hilhorst 2000 model provides lower σp values than that of malliki and walczak 1999 model and as a result underestimates σp malicki and walczak 1999 model seems to provide more reliable σp values because the estimated σp values are higher than the corresponding ecw values except from the case that ecw 12 ds m 1 furthermore the difference between the model s predictions and the ecw levels were almost equal to the estimated σp values for ecw 0 ds m 1 similar results obtained for the case of the clay loam1 soil as well 4 conclusions in this study the performance of cs655 sensor was investigated through laboratory experiments using a set of soils featuring a wide range of properties as well as experiments using liquids with known dielectric properties the most significand findings of this study are 1 in the case of liquids with known dielectric properties cs655 sensor provides accurate apparent permittivity εa readings for the case of air and deionized water lower and upper operation limits but underestimates εa for the cases of butanol and ethanol 2 the εa values obtained by the cs655 sensor for the water air layered system are closer to the arithmetic averaging scheme especially for higher εa values for this reason the upward infiltration method which results in non uniform water content in the soil samples is not recommended for the sensor calibration furthermore under conditions of highly contrasting soil water content the vertical installation of the sensor is not recommended 3 in the case of soils the sensor s εa readings are higher than the εa values corresponding to the experimentally measured volumetric soil water content θm values according to topp equation especially for higher θm levels for all the examined soils except form the sand were εa is underestimated throughout the range of θm therefore soil specific calibration is required to achieve higher accuracy 4 the θ m ε a relationship was strongly linear in all the examined cases the multi point calibration method performed better compared to the two point calibration method however specific calibration equations obtained with both methods performed better compared to the manufacturer s calibration equation in all cases thus the two point calibration method can provide a fast and easy way to improve the estimation of θ 5 in the case of non conductive soils kelleners et al 2005 method provides almost identical results with the factory calibration accordingly in these soils cs655 sensor can be calibrated accurately with this method using sensor readings in air and deionized water 6 the obtained results for increased bulk electrical conductivity values reveal that the effect of bulk electrical conductivity in the operation of cs655 sensor is significant thus in the case of increased bulk electrical conductivity the use of alternative calibration equations considering the effect of bulk soil electrical conductivity σb is recommended 7 soil water content estimations using the corrected real part of relative permittivity ε r values are better than that of the factory calibration especially for higher σb values however the observed deviations from the θm values are significant robinson et al 1999 method performs better than wyseure et al 1997 method and can be used in cases with increased soil salinity when the accuracy requirements in volumetric soil water content θ measurement are low empirical calibration equations considering the effect of σb in θ determination provide noticeably superior performance however the determination of three fitting parameters for each soil is required 8 the εa σb relationship is strongly linear in all the examined salinity levels malliki and walczak 1999 model seems to provide more reliable pore water electrical conductivity σp values than the hilhorst 2000 model the above results provide an in depth understanding of cs655 performance as well as specific information facilitating the improved exploitation of its potential under various conditions and in various applications it should be noted that even if this research included a wide set of soil properties more laboratory and field experiments are required in order to consider the vast natural variability of soils the investigation of other calibration methods and other alternative calibration equations considering the effect of σb may also provide a better insight in the sensor performance for the case of soils with high salinity levels

11203,this study attempts to estimate the spatial distribution of the soil moisture sm in south korea 99 260 km2 from january 2013 to may 2015 using a multiple linear regression mlr model with data from the korean multipurpose geostationary communication ocean and meteorological satellite coms and land surface temperature lst data the normalized distribution vegetation index ndvi from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis on board the terra satellite was used to reflect the vegetation variations observed precipitation data measured by automatic weather stations awss operated by the korea meteorological administration kma were collected and sm data were collected from 38 stations operated by various institutions the regression coefficients of the mlr model were estimated seasonally considering five days of preceding precipitation the p values of all regression coefficients were below 0 05 and all coefficients of determination r2 ranged from 0 17 to 0 63 specifically the r2 of loam in the summer was the highest at 0 63 and most of the r2 values were 0 4 or higher the results of the sm regression showed that the overall r2 was higher than 0 4 and that the root mean square error rmse was less than 5 at all but a few stations a time series analysis of the simulated sm revealed that the observed sm data ranged from 0 to 20 for sand 10 to 30 for loam 20 to 40 for clay and 30 to 50 for silt the simulated sm followed the volatility of the observed data in most of the soils the spatial distribution of the simulated sm showed the same trends with the observed data on the monthly spatial precipitation map consequently the estimated map of the soil moisture index smi can be used to better understand the severity of drought and the variability in the sm keywords coms modis ndvi multiple linear regression model spatial distribution of soil moisture remote sensing 1 introduction the soil moisture sm is an important state variable governing the partitioning of rainfall into runoff and rainwater that infiltrates into the soil although the water contained in soil constitutes only a tiny fraction of all water on the earth it influences various extreme events such as floods and droughts dai et al 2004 the sm content reflects the amount of precipitation retained locally after runoff this amount depends on many factors including the soil hydraulic properties as a function of the soil texture and depth antecedent soil conditions and precipitation frequency and intensity trenberth et al 2003 the landscape of south korea 99 260 km2 located on the korean peninsula is categorized as 64 forest and 18 agricultural area lee and miller rushing 2014 and the summer precipitation is characterized by the appearance of the first maximum period in mid july and the appearance of the second maximum period in mid september although several studies reported that the korean peninsula exhibits varying precipitation characteristics choi and moon 2008 choi et al 2008 2017 ho et al 2004 kim et al 2010 most of the precipitation is still concentrated between may and october therefore due to the geographical and climatic characteristics of the korean peninsula quantitative measurements of the sm in south korea are more important than in other countries two remote sensing methods are primarily employed to periodically obtain spatio temporal maps of the surface sm ssm direct measurement methods using microwave satellites and indirect measurement methods using land surface parameters the primary differences between these two techniques are the wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum used the source of the electromagnetic energy the response measured by the sensor and the physical relationship between the response and the sm content wang and qu 2009 active and passive microwave sensors offer the opportunity to retrieve ssm estimates from measured surface backscatter and brightness temperature signals respectively which are mainly determined by the soil dielectric constant njoku et al 2002 ulaby et al 1996 both active and passive microwave sensors have been shown to provide useful ssm datasets particularly at low frequencies bartalis et al 2007 kerr et al 2012 njoku et al 2003 with a global coverage and a daily temporal resolution hence they are suitable for ssm monitoring at a global scale de jeu et al 2008 owe et al 2008 however it is difficult to monitor drought and sm at a local or regional scale using global sm data from microwave satellites with a coarse spatial resolution 10 40 km werbylo and niemann 2014 in addition coarse resolution sm data are not very useful for local or regional applications involving agricultural and water resources because they do not provide detailed sm variations djamai et al 2016 particularly in the case of south korea where the total area is slightly more than 99 000 km2 the sm is expressed as only approximately 990 pixels even when observed at a 10 km resolution although synthetic aperture radar sar systems e g ers 1 2 radarsat 1 envisat asar and jers 1 have resolutions ranging from a few meters to the sub meter level influences due to surface roughness and vegetation cover limit sar retrievals and the repeat cycle of sar is generally irregular and longer than 15 days kang et al 2017 indirect measurements of the ssm involve the use of non microwave satellite components of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data such as the land surface temperature lst and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the lst is more frequently observed than the sm but the latter can be estimated from both the lst and the ndvi carlson et al 1994 furthermore previous studies carlson et al 1994 gillies et al 1997 nemani et al 1993 have shown that for a specific region a unique relationship exists among the sm ndvi and lst sun and pinker 2004 in addition an optical thermal infrared sensing method known as the surface temperature vegetation index method represents another promising approach for estimating the sm as the surface temperature and vegetation have been found to exhibit a complicated dependence on the sm recently many studies czajkowski et al 2000 patel et al 2009 sandholt et al 2002 schnur et al 2010 wang et al 2016 2007 yang et al 2008 have estimated the sm based on the surface temperature or the complementary temperature vegetation index to analyze the relationships between independent variables i e the lst and ndvi and a dependent variable sm many statistical methods are available including classification and regression trees cart random forests and multiple linear regression mlr among those techniques mlr which refers to the prediction of a single dependent variable from multiple independent variables can be considered the most basic form of linear regression yu et al 2017 the preference for this method can be linked to the simplicity of its application the efficiency of its computation and the ease of its interpretation thompson et al 2006 however this method can detect only linear relationships between independent and dependent variables moreover although mlr as a data driven method is well suited for addressing retrieval problems it suffers from important limitations such as difficulties when generalizing the developed retrieval model to other areas however since the sm generally shows a linear relationship with the amount of precipitation it is possible to estimate the sm using mlr through various factors for example in recent years jung et al 2017 applied mlr to modis ndvi lst and precipitation data to estimate the sm in south korea and revealed a high correlation most of the abovementioned studies regarding indirect measurements estimated the ssm by using polar orbiting satellites however while most of the products from polar orbiting satellites are provided at a higher spatial resolution at regional or global scales they are limited in expressing sequential images over short time periods the korean peninsula located in east asia is broadly categorized as a region experiencing a shortage of water that is characterized by mountainous areas composed of heterogeneous topography and vegetation kang et al 2003 nam et al 2015 park and lee 2007 the acquisition of ground based datasets used to calculate high quality and accurate ssm estimates in heterogeneous regions is more difficult than that in homogenous regions therefore remote sensing datasets which are efficient for observing a wide area are necessary to estimate the ssm the first korean multipurpose geostationary satellite namely the communication ocean and meteorological satellite coms was launched in june 2010 choi et al 2007 lee et al 2010 coms has a potential advantage with regard to its ability to provide an enhanced temporal resolution with quarter hourly estimates at a high spatial resolution baik and choi 2015 and these estimates can be flexibly used for the real time monitoring of hydrological components e g ssm and evapotranspiration nevertheless coms has not been employed to evaluate the sm until now and thus it is necessary to provide comparisons with ground based measurements accordingly the main purpose of this study is to investigate the applicability of coms lst data by estimating the daily sm prior to the application of the 15 min data modis ndvi data are used to observe vegetation changes because coms does not include the near infrared nir band utilized for constructing vegetation indices the specific objectives of this study are to 1 generate daily coms lst data from lst data collected every 15 min 2 develop an mlr model using daily coms lst and modis ndvi data in addition to interpolated precipitation pcp 3 estimate the ssm from january 2013 to may 2015 based on the mlr model and 4 compare the quality of this product with in situ measurements and the spatial distribution of the soil moisture index smi 2 materials and methods 2 1 satellite data 2 1 1 coms lst before 2010 satellite based meteorological variables for the korean peninsula were obtained from the u s and japan coms which is the first in a series of domestic multipurpose geostationary satellites was recently launched as part of the korea meteorological administration kma program on the 27th of june in 2010 park et al 2011 coms is equipped with two types of sensors a meteorological imager mi and a geostationary ocean color imager goci faure et al 2008 the mi sensor onboard coms exhibits a basic performance similar to those onboard goes 8 13 u s and mtsat 2 japan lee et al 2011a while the goci sensor which was coproduced with edas astrium of france and international telephone telegraph itt of the u s has a performance similar to that of the sea viewing wide field of view sensor the satellite images observed through the mi and goci sensors are managed in real time through the goci data processing system and the coms data processing system at the korea ocean satellite center and the national meteorological satellite center nmsc http nmsc kma go kr html homepage ko main do respectively ryu et al 2012 a detailed description of the coms mi is given in table 1 coms is located at a longitude of 128 e longitude above the equator and it covers most of asia and australia the goci sensor makes eight observations per day and the mi sensor makes observations every 15 min the main missions of coms are as follows 1 to provide continuous monitoring of meteorological products such as storms floods yellow sand sea surface temperature precipitation and clouds and 2 to provide continuous monitoring of the marine environments around the korean peninsula including fishery information and long term changes in marine ecosystems coms provides sixteen meteorological factors e g cloud analysis cloud top temperature pressure atmospheric motion vector and cloud detection from the mi and fourteen ocean environmental factors e g chlorophyll red tide and total suspended sediment from the goci additional information can be found in previous studies lee et al 2011b 2010 the coms lst data were provided by the nmsc data with a spatial resolution of 4 km taken every 15 min from 2013 to may 2015 were collected the method used to retrieve the coms lst data from the nmsc can be found in cho and suh 2013 while it is possible to merely synthesize the entire 15 min dataset for a given day to produce the daily lst profile this approach can generate a large error in the simple average because the coms conducts observations all day including dawn at 15 min intervals therefore in this study various scenarios were created and compared for the data synthesized from ground lst data measured at 11 kma stations details regarding these 11 stations are provided in section 2 2 2 2 1 2 modis ndvi terra modis satellite products were prepared for the ndvi data as coms does not contain near infrared bands with which to calculate the ndvi the terra satellite launched in december 1999 views the entire earth every 1 to 2 days the modis sensors onboard the terra satellite acquire data in 36 discrete spectral channels with a spatial resolution of 250 m for the visible bands 500 m for the near infrared band and 1000 m for the remaining thermal infrared bands http modis gsfc nasa gov to obtain the modis ndvi data among the products modis 250 m ndvi 16 day composite scenes mod13q1 from 2013 to may 2015 were retrieved from the land processes distributed active archive center lp daac https lpdaac usgs gov daily input data are generally required to calculate the daily ssm however the ndvi outputs of the terra modis satellite are not available every day furthermore if we calculated the daily ndvi from other outputs e g surface reflectance the calculated values would be difficult to use for the model due to the presence of noise consequently in this study because the vegetation gradually changes from dense to sparse and rapid changes do not often occur in the forest we determined that the 16 day ndvi data could be used to calculate the daily ssm in addition while modis products are provided in the sinusoidal sin projection coms products are provided in the geostationary satellite view geos projection therefore to minimize geometric errors arising from the different projections between the satellite datasets the modis ndvi data were re projected into the geos projection in this study 2 2 observed data 2 2 1 automatic weather stations awss the kma operates a dense surface observational network that includes 687 automatic weather stations awss in south korea to continuously monitor weather conditions fig 1 the average distance between adjacent stations is approximately 13 km and raw data are collected at 10 min intervals the dataset used in this study is archived at 24 h intervals in this study we used 687 aws precipitation data points during the simulation period first we compared minute scale precipitation data from the kma with data from the operational period second the minute scale precipitation data were converted into daily data and then interpolated using the inverse distance weighting idw method based on the spatial resolution of 4 km in the geos projection 2 2 2 sm and soil data of the stations to develop a regression model for predicting the sm observed sm data from 38 stations were prepared fig 1 and table 2 the automated agriculture observing system aaos operated by the kma provides observations of weather phenomena that are closely related to agriculture at 11 auxiliary agricultural weather observatories located throughout the country including the suwon sw meteorological observatory which is a basic agricultural meteorological observation office according to the technical regulations of the world meteorological organization wmo in this study the sm data were obtained as a percent volumetric water content vwc at a depth of 10 cm using time domain reflectometry tdr based on the relationship between the dielectric properties of the soil and the moisture levels albergel et al 2012 and the data were collected at 3 sites nos 1 through 3 in table 2 namely cheorwon cw jinju jj1 and chuncheon cc1 from among the 11 stations because the sm data from the other stations were not good however the observed lst and precipitation data from the 11 aaos stations were utilized to calculate the daily coms lst and find the optimal regression scenario the technical specifications of the kma data were previously reported choi et al 2015 stations 4 through 8 are installed in the yongdam dam watershed in the geum river basin and operated by the korea water resources corporation k water their data are measured in percent vwc using tdr at a depth of 10 cm and they are provided by the yongdam experimental catchment http www ydew or kr the other stations nos 9 through 38 are operated by the korea rural development administration rda and they are also measured in percent vwc using the tdr at a depth of 10 cm these data were provided by the agricultural meteorology information service http weather rda go kr all sm data were prepared from january 2013 to may 2015 however certain data especially the rda data were prepared for a limited period of this duration because of their short observation period december 2014 to may 2015 the soil texture data were rasterized to the 4 km spatial resolution of the geos projection from a 1 25 000 vector map supplied by the korea rda these soil texture data were then used to divide the soil into 12 classes following the u s department of agriculture usda textural classification however sufficient data were not available for a regression analysis in each soil class because of the limited number of sm stations and sm data therefore the soil texture was classified into sand loam clay and silt the soil textural triangle was employed when we reclassified the whole soil dataset because we wanted to consider the soil characteristics as much as possible in this textural triangle sand loamy sand and sandy loam with 0 20 clay and 50 100 sand were classified as sand similarly clay sandy clay silty clay and silty clay loam were reclassified as clay silty loam and silt were reclassified as silt finally sandy clay loam clay loam and loam located in the middle of the soil textural triangle were classified as loam the stations were assigned to their respective soil texture classes and regression was performed on the grouped data in table 2 stations no 8 13 34 and 38 were excluded when the regression coefficients were estimated as the verification sites for each type of soil 2 3 multiple linear regression mlr model regression analysis is one of the most commonly used methods to measure the relationship between two or more variables and predict the behavior of a dependent or endogenous variable according to one or more independent or explanatory variables mlr is frequently used as an empirical model or approximating function that allows a mathematical model to be established to describe a given real world phenomenon generally the relationship between the dependent and the independent variables is given as in eq 1 prieto et al 2017 1 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n where y is the dependent variable β i i 0 1 n indicates the regression coefficients generally estimated by least squares and x i i 0 1 n indicates the independent variables although these models are based simply on linear and additive associations among the explanatory variables they have been extensively used with satisfactory results sousa et al 2007 prior to the regression analysis we attempted to identify the optimal input data combination from eight scenarios table 3 at 9 sm kma sites from the input data coms lst terra modis ndvi and aws precipitation data detailed information on these 9 stations can be found in a previous study lee et al 2016a in this case we also investigated the influence of the antecedent precipitation from 5 days p c p n 5 to 1 day p c p n 1 2 4 soil moisture index smi the sm based drought index known as the soil moisture index smi provides a measure of the severity and duration of agricultural drought for an area of interest the available water for plants is defined as the quantity of soil water between the field capacity fc and the lower limit of extractable water known as the wilting point wp and this stored water is extracted by plant roots jensen et al 1990 the available water can therefore constitute an important measure for quantifying agricultural drought if it can be converted into an index in this study to derive the smi the available water was first calculated based on the observed or modeled sm normalized to the maximum available water for plants calculated as the difference between the fc and wp this index was classified from no drought to extreme drought to quantitatively assess the drought conditions in both space and time sridhar et al 2008 the smi was computed based on the soil characteristics and sm conditions the parameters included the fc wp and sm as noted above the soil maps were obtained from the korea rda and the values of the fc and wp were applied according to the soil properties from a previous study rawls et al 1982 rawls et al 1982 provided a statistical analysis of numerous parameters including the total porosity residual saturation and effective porosity for each type of soil from 1085 points of u s soil characteristic data from these data the fc value for each type of soil was 0 410 for sand 0 358 for loam 0 390 for clay and 0 486 for silt the wp values were applied as follows 0 061 for sand 0 154 for loam 0 242 for clay and 0 133 for silt all smis were calculated for the top layer based on the observed sm data at a depth of 10 cm and the equation is as follows 2 s m i 5 s m w p f c w p 5 this equation yields smi values ranging from less than 5 to 0 the actual sm in the soil column is normalized to the available water capacity awc of the soil column that is then used for computing the index the range was chosen in a similar fashion to that of the u s drought monitor to maintain consistency and enable us to compare the severity of drought from both methods at a later stage an smi value of 0 indicates no drought but the area could be heading toward drought or recovering from drought meanwhile an smi of 1 indicates a drought of least intensity while 5 suggests a drought of extreme intensity is present for a given site sridhar et al 2008 it is possible for the smi to exceed 0 0 during very moist conditions i e if the sm exceeds the fc however as this study focused on recognizing a drought situation due to a lack of sm any value of sm greater than 0 was set to 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimation of the daily coms lst to estimate the daily lst through the coms data the deviations between the coms lst 15 min interval and daily mean lst data from 11 kma stations were first calculated based on the data from january 2013 to may 2015 and the minimum deviation was summarized with the time at which it appeared fig 2 the bar graph in fig 2 illustrates the number of times that the minimum deviation appears at that local time during the simulation period theoretically the total sum of the minimum deviation for each time should be 911 which is the same as that for the total simulation period however in certain cases coms data do not exist for an entire day due to the existence of clouds or noise therefore the average of the total number of occurrences of the minimum deviation is approximately 850 the solid line graph shows the average of the minimum deviations at the local time lee et al 2016b an analysis of the graphs for each station reveals that the minimum deviations were commonly observed in the time window near midnight 23 00 2 00 and at certain hours in morning 7 00 10 00 except at the jinju station furthermore in the afternoon time window 12 00 22 00 the minimum deviation appeared rarely and the deviation was very high as a result the data for the afternoon time range were not suitable for calculating the daily lst through the coms data based on the data of each graph the time at which the minimum deviation appeared most at each point was calculated and table 4 summarizes the times during which the minimum deviation was most frequent for each time period by dividing the time period between the morning 0 00 12 00 and the afternoon 12 00 24 00 the minimum deviation was 23 45 at five stations andong boseong seogwipo seosan and suncheon and the next most common time was 0 00 at four stations cheongju cheorwon chuncheon and jinju as a result at 23 45 and 0 00 i e near midnight 9 out of 11 stations showed the lowest deviation from the ground lst however the mean deviation at 23 45 was analyzed as 1 25 4 72 which was slightly higher than the range of 0 29 3 57 at 0 00 an analysis of the times at which the minimum deviation appeared in the morning and afternoon reveals that the afternoon time at which the minimum deviation occurred was 23 45 at all stations therefore we selected 0 00 and 23 45 as the representative times for the morning and afternoon respectively but it is meaningless to distinguish these times between the morning and afternoon because both times are close to midnight moreover when the sm is simulated using data from a specific time there may be interference in the daily sm simulation if the day is continuously cloudy at a specific time and the lst cannot be observed additionally since the lst can vary greatly due to weather changes such as snow and precipitation it is necessary to examine the simulation of the sm using data at a specific time for this reason we added 2 time zones with minimum deviations 23 45 1 15 and 7 30 9 45 to the scenario for the daily lst calculation with the averages of the daily data for each day and the efficiency of each result was compared table 5 shows the total number of data points extracted from the pixels corresponding to the 11 kma agricultural weather stations and the coefficients of determination r2 between the ground observed lst and the daily coms lst produced in 5 scenarios from january 2013 to may 2015 the total number of ground observed lst data measurements was 911 whereas the extracted data for each scenario showed that several data values were missing due to the existence of clouds or noise the number of data points increased in the order of scenarios a b d c and e scenarios a and b included between approximately 400 and 500 measurements in the case of scenario e the number of data points was the largest between approximately 800 and 850 but the r2 value ranged from 0 68 to 0 88 with the lowest correlation when compared with all 5 scenarios scenarios a and b were highly correlated with the ground observed lst among the five scenarios but these data were inadequate for estimating the lst because of the lack of data in the cases of scenarios c and d the numbers of data points ranged from approximately 500 to 800 and their r2 values were higher than those of scenarios a and b the r2 values of scenario c ranged from 0 82 to 0 92 and those of scenario d ranged from 0 86 to 0 94 indicating that the correlation of scenario d was generally higher than that of scenario c therefore the coms daily lst data were estimated using the representative data of time zone 2 which had the highest correlation with the ground lst data more than half of the lst data exhibited missing values in the map of each day during the simulation period due to the monsoon climate the mean cloud cover was generally higher than 50 and in the summer from june to august the cloud cover often exceeded 90 lee and kim 2016 therefore to consider the spatial distribution of the data gaps in the data were filled to account for the missing values and obtain the spatial distribution of the sm fig 3 shows an example of the coms lst before and after filling the gaps on 1 january 2014 first the valid pixels were extracted and converted into point data from the satellite lst for each day to avoid any possible edge effects caused by the idw method the coms lst data were extracted from a rectangular shaped area exceeding the boundaries of korea subsequently the data were interpolated using the idw method at a spatial resolution of 4 km fig 3b 3 2 results of the optimal regression equation and regression coefficients table 6 shows the results of the simulation of the selected scenarios in table 3 by first simulating the data from cheorwon station where the observed sm data are sufficient and the number of data observations from coms is sufficiently high to enable an effective simulation in table 3 con denotes the constant term in eq 1 and the coefficient in each column indicates the regression coefficient used to calculate the sm the objective functions used to determine the suitability and correlation of each scenario according to the simulation results are as follows r2 root mean square error rmse and index of agreement ioa moriasi et al 2007 overall as the input data were utilized more heavily the value of r2 rose in the case of scenario 1 using only lst data r2 was the lowest at 0 1766 scenarios 2 and 3 which used the lst and one other type of data exhibited slightly higher r2 than scenario 1 with values of 0 2032 and 0 2072 respectively in the case of scenarios 4 which used two independent variables in addition to the lst the r2 value increased by approximately 0 02 compared with scenarios 1 through 3 when we considered additional data i e the preceding precipitation with the same input data scenarios 5 and 6 the improvement in r2 was approximately 0 06 0 07 compared with the case without considering these data this difference seemed to be due to an increase in the independent variables of the regression equation for estimating the sm in scenario 7 the correlation also increased as the number of precipitation days increased with the same input data when the regression coefficient was separately calculated for each season in scenario 8 the r2 value was 0 7993 which his twice as high as those in the previous scenarios a previous study hong et al 2010 analyzed the seasonal correlations between the sm and the terra modis ndvi in the chungju dam watershed of south korea and found that the sm and ndvi were inversely correlated in the spring and autumn as the temperature increases in the spring the vegetation increases while the water content of the soil decreases due to an increase in evapotranspiration in the autumn the leaves of vegetation fall and the ndvi decreases whereas the sm is increased by the rainy season and the occurrence of typhoons in scenario 8 the regression coefficients of ndvi were expressed as negative numbers in the spring sp and autumn a according to the inverse correlation between the sm and ndvi the same results were obtained for the cheorwon station and 8 other stations lee et al 2016a from these results the regression coefficients using mlr were calculated for each season and the preceding rainfall was considered the same as in scenario 8 at this point the preceding rainfall considered the preceding 5 days according to the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method developed by the u s department of agriculture the regression coefficients of the mlr model were estimated depending on the four soil classes sand loam clay and silt considering the preceding precipitation up to 5 days before table 7 each regression coefficient was written with the p value so that the statistical significance was verified and r2 was used for the correlation analysis overall the p values of the regression coefficients were all below 0 05 thereby indicating statistical validity except for some of the summer and autumn lst regression coefficients the lst regression coefficients in the summer and autumn exceeded 0 05 because of the use of interpolated lst data within a monsoon climate all r2 values for the 4 soil classes ranged from 0 17 to 0 63 specifically the r2 of loam in the summer was the highest at 0 63 and most of the r2 values were 0 4 or higher the seasonal r2 showed that loam clay and silt had the lowest correlation among r2 in the winter and that sand had the lowest correlation in the spring these findings occurred because the sm data of the observatory classified as sand were provided by the kma and k water and the total data were sufficient from 2013 to may 2015 in contrast the data on loam clay and silt were mostly provided by the rda and the reason for the low r2 value was that the data were insufficient data were available for a period of less than one year in table 7 the values in braces denote the variance inflation factors vifs which measure the inflation in the variances of the parameter estimates due to multicollinearity potentially caused by correlated predictors generally a vif greater than 5 or greater than 10 is suggested for detecting multicollinearity kutner et al 2004 considering that the vif values of all variables are lower than 3 it can be concluded that the influence of multicollinearity between variables is small 3 3 estimation of the sm by regression coefficients the sm was simulated using the estimated regression coefficients and the accuracy with the observed soil moisture was verified by the r2 rmse and ioa at 38 stations table 8 the r2 rmse and ioa for all soil types ranged from 0 30 to 0 65 1 77 to 6 17 and 0 48 to 0 89 respectively the r2 values exceeded 0 4 at more than two thirds of the stations thereby showing a good correlation the rmse was less than 5 for all but four stations nos 18 25 31 and 33 and the ioa was highly correlated by 0 5 or more except for one station no 31 in the cases of stations nos 18 and 31 the results of all objective functions were low due to the instability in the observed data arising from the short retention period december 2014 to may 2015 of the sm observations as was the case with the other sm data provided by the rda the results of the four stations excluded for the verification showed that r2 had a constant correlation of 0 43 for sj no 8 0 40 for jb no 13 0 34 for yb no 34 and 0 51 for sy no 38 as a result of analyzing the objective function by soil type the r2 for each soil showed a similar correlation with 0 44 for sand 0 43 for loam 0 47 for clay and 0 46 for silt the rmse for each soil was estimated to be approximately 3 ranging from 2 99 to 3 86 and the ioa ranged from 0 65 to 0 79 concerning the time series analysis of the simulated sm fig 4 the simulated sm was observed to follow the volatility of the observed data in most of the soils in general the sm data were observed in the range from 0 to 20 for sand 10 to 30 for loam 20 to 40 for clay and 30 to 50 for silt in the case of sand fig 4a b the observed sm remarkably decreased in the winter and the simulated sm also showed this tendency in the case of station bs fig 4c the observed sm decreased from january to march 2014 but the simulated sm remained at approximately 23 without decreasing this period was rainless compared with other periods during which rainfall values existed and therefore no change in the sm was considered for stations oo and yg fig 4d f the sm simulations for the period during which the observations were present december 2014 to may 2015 were almost consistent with the observed values and the sm was predicted for the other period january 2013 to november 2014 for station gb fig 4e there were notable decreases and increases in the observed sm during short periods without rainfall in the winter of 2014 however these findings were considered to represent errors in the observed values in the cases of stations bs and sj fig 4g h the seasonal variability and observation range of sm were similar in both datasets observed and simulated data 3 4 spatial distribution of estimated sm based on seasonal regression coefficients estimated for each type of soil table 7 monthly spatial distribution maps of the sm precipitation and smi were generated from april to september 2013 fig 5 at this point the monthly maps of the sm and smi were created by averaging the daily maps and the monthly map of the precipitation was calculated by summing the precipitation of each month overall the spatial distribution of the sm varies with increases and decreases in the monthly precipitation in the sm map of june fig 5a the sm in the western part of the korean peninsula was sharply reduced because there was no rainfall for three months prior to june this tendency can be observed more clearly in the smi map as the smi decreased from 2 to 5 showing a heavy drought in particular the korean peninsula had been experiencing a protracted drought since 2013 and the annual rainfall was less than 35 50 of the long term average from 1973 to 2015 for two consecutive years kwon et al 2016 this condition demonstrates the possibility that the simulated sm and the smi calculated by the sm could be used for drought monitoring the drought was resolved through large scale rainfall events in july and the smi showed a value of zero in the northern and southern regions where rainfall occurred after july the sm naturally increased and decreased according to the precipitation additionally jung et al 2017 compared the smi and standardized precipitation index spi in 2015 which was an extreme drought year in south korea both drought indices showed an increase or decrease according to the distribution of the precipitation the authors stated that coupling between the spi and smi can be utilized as a meteorological drought index in forested areas and an agricultural drought index in cultivated areas although the correlation of the regression coefficients was low the simulated spatial distribution of the sm showed the variability well according to the rainfall it also showed the applicability of the mlr model used in this study 4 conclusions this study estimated the spatial distribution of sm in south korea from january 2013 to may 2015 using an mlr model with coms satellite data the results were evaluated by observed sm data from 38 stations measured by the tdr at a depth of 10 cm first from coms lst data measured every 15 min daily coms lst data were generated and compared with the daily mean lst data of 11 aaos stations second we attempted to identify optimal scenarios for sm regression analysis using the estimated daily coms lst data modis ndvi satellite data and aws precipitation data based on the optimal regression scenario the regression coefficients were calculated and the ssm was estimated from january 2013 to may 2015 finally the smi was calculated and compared with the ssm and the utility of the model was evaluated the primary results are summarized as follows 1 comparing the 15 min coms lst data and the observed lsts from 11 aaos stations used to calculate the daily coms lst data 0 00 and 23 45 were the times with the least deviations in the morning and afternoon respectively additionally the two time windows with the smallest deviations 23 45 1 15 and 7 30 9 45 were selected and compared with the results of the total arithmetic averages among them representative time window 2 7 30 9 45 had the highest correlation with the ground observed lst and the data acquisition rate was high 2 as a result of examining the optimal scenarios after applying various scenarios for the sm regression at the cheorwon station with a sufficient amount of sm data the sm regression model showed that the correlation increased with the seasonal regression coefficients and the efficiency was higher when the preceding precipitation was considered 3 3 the above result occurred because the seasonal regression analysis considered the inverse correlation between the sm and ndvi in the spring and autumn in addition the regression analysis was more efficient when considering the preceding precipitation because of the increases in the independent variables in the regression equation used to estimate the sm 4 the regression coefficients of the mlr model were estimated depending on the four soil classes sand loam clay and silt considering the preceding precipitation for up to 5 days before overall the p values of all regression coefficients were below 0 05 except for some of the summer and autumn regression coefficients of the lst all r2 values for the 4 soil classes ranged from 0 17 to 0 63 specifically the r2 of loam in the summer was the highest at 0 63 and most of the r2 values were 0 4 or higher 5 when we simulated the sm using the estimated regression coefficients the overall r2 exceeded 0 4 at more than two thirds of the stations thereby showing a good correlation the rmse was less than 5 for all but four stations and the ioa was highly correlated by 0 5 or more except for one station the results of a few stations were low due to the instability in the observed data because of the short retention period december 2014 to may 2015 of sm observations 6 as a result of the time series analysis of the simulated sm the simulated sm followed the volatility of the observed data in most of the soils in general the sm data ranged from 0 to 20 for sand 10 to 30 for loam 20 to 40 for clay and 30 to 50 for silt especially for some stations the sm simulations for the period in which observations were present december 2014 to may 2015 were almost consistent with the observed values and the sm was also predicted for the other period january 2013 to november 2014 7 in the spatial distribution of the sm the simulated sm tended to increase and decrease with the precipitation in the june sm map the sm in the western part of the korean peninsula was sharply reduced because there was no rainfall for three months prior to june this tendency can be observed more clearly in the smi map as the smi decreases from 2 to 3 showing a weak drought this finding demonstrates the possibility that the simulated sm and the smi calculated from the sm could be used for drought monitoring in this study estimates of the sm with coms lst data and the mlr model showed a correlation with r2 values ranging from 0 43 to 0 47 for each classified soil and the ssm effectively showed a variability according to the precipitation notably this study has developed an sm estimation model with an improved spatial resolution of 4 km compared with the spatial resolutions of existing microwave satellites such as the smos 0 25 approximately 25 km amsr2 0 1 and 0 25 and smap enhanced passive level 3 products 9 km sm data with a detailed spatial resolution can be used as input data for a hydrological model in addition the daily lst data used in the study were estimated using geostationary satellite data with a 15 min time resolution and thus more detailed sm simulations are possible if other input data are available the results of this study show that the spatial resolution was improved by 60 10 km to 4 km and the r2 increased by 116 7 0 30 to 0 65 compared with the values from a previous study cho et al 2015 based on amsr2 satellite data however certain aspects need improvement for example most of the sm data used in the present regression analysis are still missing because the observed data ranged only from december 2014 to may 2015 if more samples were available the results would be better in addition four types of soil which likely does not reflect the whole range of soil types were used to simulate the sm if the sm is prepared at various points in the future a detailed sm simulation based on the usda soil classification will be possible acknowledgments this paper was supported by konkuk university in 2016 
11203,this study attempts to estimate the spatial distribution of the soil moisture sm in south korea 99 260 km2 from january 2013 to may 2015 using a multiple linear regression mlr model with data from the korean multipurpose geostationary communication ocean and meteorological satellite coms and land surface temperature lst data the normalized distribution vegetation index ndvi from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis on board the terra satellite was used to reflect the vegetation variations observed precipitation data measured by automatic weather stations awss operated by the korea meteorological administration kma were collected and sm data were collected from 38 stations operated by various institutions the regression coefficients of the mlr model were estimated seasonally considering five days of preceding precipitation the p values of all regression coefficients were below 0 05 and all coefficients of determination r2 ranged from 0 17 to 0 63 specifically the r2 of loam in the summer was the highest at 0 63 and most of the r2 values were 0 4 or higher the results of the sm regression showed that the overall r2 was higher than 0 4 and that the root mean square error rmse was less than 5 at all but a few stations a time series analysis of the simulated sm revealed that the observed sm data ranged from 0 to 20 for sand 10 to 30 for loam 20 to 40 for clay and 30 to 50 for silt the simulated sm followed the volatility of the observed data in most of the soils the spatial distribution of the simulated sm showed the same trends with the observed data on the monthly spatial precipitation map consequently the estimated map of the soil moisture index smi can be used to better understand the severity of drought and the variability in the sm keywords coms modis ndvi multiple linear regression model spatial distribution of soil moisture remote sensing 1 introduction the soil moisture sm is an important state variable governing the partitioning of rainfall into runoff and rainwater that infiltrates into the soil although the water contained in soil constitutes only a tiny fraction of all water on the earth it influences various extreme events such as floods and droughts dai et al 2004 the sm content reflects the amount of precipitation retained locally after runoff this amount depends on many factors including the soil hydraulic properties as a function of the soil texture and depth antecedent soil conditions and precipitation frequency and intensity trenberth et al 2003 the landscape of south korea 99 260 km2 located on the korean peninsula is categorized as 64 forest and 18 agricultural area lee and miller rushing 2014 and the summer precipitation is characterized by the appearance of the first maximum period in mid july and the appearance of the second maximum period in mid september although several studies reported that the korean peninsula exhibits varying precipitation characteristics choi and moon 2008 choi et al 2008 2017 ho et al 2004 kim et al 2010 most of the precipitation is still concentrated between may and october therefore due to the geographical and climatic characteristics of the korean peninsula quantitative measurements of the sm in south korea are more important than in other countries two remote sensing methods are primarily employed to periodically obtain spatio temporal maps of the surface sm ssm direct measurement methods using microwave satellites and indirect measurement methods using land surface parameters the primary differences between these two techniques are the wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum used the source of the electromagnetic energy the response measured by the sensor and the physical relationship between the response and the sm content wang and qu 2009 active and passive microwave sensors offer the opportunity to retrieve ssm estimates from measured surface backscatter and brightness temperature signals respectively which are mainly determined by the soil dielectric constant njoku et al 2002 ulaby et al 1996 both active and passive microwave sensors have been shown to provide useful ssm datasets particularly at low frequencies bartalis et al 2007 kerr et al 2012 njoku et al 2003 with a global coverage and a daily temporal resolution hence they are suitable for ssm monitoring at a global scale de jeu et al 2008 owe et al 2008 however it is difficult to monitor drought and sm at a local or regional scale using global sm data from microwave satellites with a coarse spatial resolution 10 40 km werbylo and niemann 2014 in addition coarse resolution sm data are not very useful for local or regional applications involving agricultural and water resources because they do not provide detailed sm variations djamai et al 2016 particularly in the case of south korea where the total area is slightly more than 99 000 km2 the sm is expressed as only approximately 990 pixels even when observed at a 10 km resolution although synthetic aperture radar sar systems e g ers 1 2 radarsat 1 envisat asar and jers 1 have resolutions ranging from a few meters to the sub meter level influences due to surface roughness and vegetation cover limit sar retrievals and the repeat cycle of sar is generally irregular and longer than 15 days kang et al 2017 indirect measurements of the ssm involve the use of non microwave satellite components of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data such as the land surface temperature lst and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the lst is more frequently observed than the sm but the latter can be estimated from both the lst and the ndvi carlson et al 1994 furthermore previous studies carlson et al 1994 gillies et al 1997 nemani et al 1993 have shown that for a specific region a unique relationship exists among the sm ndvi and lst sun and pinker 2004 in addition an optical thermal infrared sensing method known as the surface temperature vegetation index method represents another promising approach for estimating the sm as the surface temperature and vegetation have been found to exhibit a complicated dependence on the sm recently many studies czajkowski et al 2000 patel et al 2009 sandholt et al 2002 schnur et al 2010 wang et al 2016 2007 yang et al 2008 have estimated the sm based on the surface temperature or the complementary temperature vegetation index to analyze the relationships between independent variables i e the lst and ndvi and a dependent variable sm many statistical methods are available including classification and regression trees cart random forests and multiple linear regression mlr among those techniques mlr which refers to the prediction of a single dependent variable from multiple independent variables can be considered the most basic form of linear regression yu et al 2017 the preference for this method can be linked to the simplicity of its application the efficiency of its computation and the ease of its interpretation thompson et al 2006 however this method can detect only linear relationships between independent and dependent variables moreover although mlr as a data driven method is well suited for addressing retrieval problems it suffers from important limitations such as difficulties when generalizing the developed retrieval model to other areas however since the sm generally shows a linear relationship with the amount of precipitation it is possible to estimate the sm using mlr through various factors for example in recent years jung et al 2017 applied mlr to modis ndvi lst and precipitation data to estimate the sm in south korea and revealed a high correlation most of the abovementioned studies regarding indirect measurements estimated the ssm by using polar orbiting satellites however while most of the products from polar orbiting satellites are provided at a higher spatial resolution at regional or global scales they are limited in expressing sequential images over short time periods the korean peninsula located in east asia is broadly categorized as a region experiencing a shortage of water that is characterized by mountainous areas composed of heterogeneous topography and vegetation kang et al 2003 nam et al 2015 park and lee 2007 the acquisition of ground based datasets used to calculate high quality and accurate ssm estimates in heterogeneous regions is more difficult than that in homogenous regions therefore remote sensing datasets which are efficient for observing a wide area are necessary to estimate the ssm the first korean multipurpose geostationary satellite namely the communication ocean and meteorological satellite coms was launched in june 2010 choi et al 2007 lee et al 2010 coms has a potential advantage with regard to its ability to provide an enhanced temporal resolution with quarter hourly estimates at a high spatial resolution baik and choi 2015 and these estimates can be flexibly used for the real time monitoring of hydrological components e g ssm and evapotranspiration nevertheless coms has not been employed to evaluate the sm until now and thus it is necessary to provide comparisons with ground based measurements accordingly the main purpose of this study is to investigate the applicability of coms lst data by estimating the daily sm prior to the application of the 15 min data modis ndvi data are used to observe vegetation changes because coms does not include the near infrared nir band utilized for constructing vegetation indices the specific objectives of this study are to 1 generate daily coms lst data from lst data collected every 15 min 2 develop an mlr model using daily coms lst and modis ndvi data in addition to interpolated precipitation pcp 3 estimate the ssm from january 2013 to may 2015 based on the mlr model and 4 compare the quality of this product with in situ measurements and the spatial distribution of the soil moisture index smi 2 materials and methods 2 1 satellite data 2 1 1 coms lst before 2010 satellite based meteorological variables for the korean peninsula were obtained from the u s and japan coms which is the first in a series of domestic multipurpose geostationary satellites was recently launched as part of the korea meteorological administration kma program on the 27th of june in 2010 park et al 2011 coms is equipped with two types of sensors a meteorological imager mi and a geostationary ocean color imager goci faure et al 2008 the mi sensor onboard coms exhibits a basic performance similar to those onboard goes 8 13 u s and mtsat 2 japan lee et al 2011a while the goci sensor which was coproduced with edas astrium of france and international telephone telegraph itt of the u s has a performance similar to that of the sea viewing wide field of view sensor the satellite images observed through the mi and goci sensors are managed in real time through the goci data processing system and the coms data processing system at the korea ocean satellite center and the national meteorological satellite center nmsc http nmsc kma go kr html homepage ko main do respectively ryu et al 2012 a detailed description of the coms mi is given in table 1 coms is located at a longitude of 128 e longitude above the equator and it covers most of asia and australia the goci sensor makes eight observations per day and the mi sensor makes observations every 15 min the main missions of coms are as follows 1 to provide continuous monitoring of meteorological products such as storms floods yellow sand sea surface temperature precipitation and clouds and 2 to provide continuous monitoring of the marine environments around the korean peninsula including fishery information and long term changes in marine ecosystems coms provides sixteen meteorological factors e g cloud analysis cloud top temperature pressure atmospheric motion vector and cloud detection from the mi and fourteen ocean environmental factors e g chlorophyll red tide and total suspended sediment from the goci additional information can be found in previous studies lee et al 2011b 2010 the coms lst data were provided by the nmsc data with a spatial resolution of 4 km taken every 15 min from 2013 to may 2015 were collected the method used to retrieve the coms lst data from the nmsc can be found in cho and suh 2013 while it is possible to merely synthesize the entire 15 min dataset for a given day to produce the daily lst profile this approach can generate a large error in the simple average because the coms conducts observations all day including dawn at 15 min intervals therefore in this study various scenarios were created and compared for the data synthesized from ground lst data measured at 11 kma stations details regarding these 11 stations are provided in section 2 2 2 2 1 2 modis ndvi terra modis satellite products were prepared for the ndvi data as coms does not contain near infrared bands with which to calculate the ndvi the terra satellite launched in december 1999 views the entire earth every 1 to 2 days the modis sensors onboard the terra satellite acquire data in 36 discrete spectral channels with a spatial resolution of 250 m for the visible bands 500 m for the near infrared band and 1000 m for the remaining thermal infrared bands http modis gsfc nasa gov to obtain the modis ndvi data among the products modis 250 m ndvi 16 day composite scenes mod13q1 from 2013 to may 2015 were retrieved from the land processes distributed active archive center lp daac https lpdaac usgs gov daily input data are generally required to calculate the daily ssm however the ndvi outputs of the terra modis satellite are not available every day furthermore if we calculated the daily ndvi from other outputs e g surface reflectance the calculated values would be difficult to use for the model due to the presence of noise consequently in this study because the vegetation gradually changes from dense to sparse and rapid changes do not often occur in the forest we determined that the 16 day ndvi data could be used to calculate the daily ssm in addition while modis products are provided in the sinusoidal sin projection coms products are provided in the geostationary satellite view geos projection therefore to minimize geometric errors arising from the different projections between the satellite datasets the modis ndvi data were re projected into the geos projection in this study 2 2 observed data 2 2 1 automatic weather stations awss the kma operates a dense surface observational network that includes 687 automatic weather stations awss in south korea to continuously monitor weather conditions fig 1 the average distance between adjacent stations is approximately 13 km and raw data are collected at 10 min intervals the dataset used in this study is archived at 24 h intervals in this study we used 687 aws precipitation data points during the simulation period first we compared minute scale precipitation data from the kma with data from the operational period second the minute scale precipitation data were converted into daily data and then interpolated using the inverse distance weighting idw method based on the spatial resolution of 4 km in the geos projection 2 2 2 sm and soil data of the stations to develop a regression model for predicting the sm observed sm data from 38 stations were prepared fig 1 and table 2 the automated agriculture observing system aaos operated by the kma provides observations of weather phenomena that are closely related to agriculture at 11 auxiliary agricultural weather observatories located throughout the country including the suwon sw meteorological observatory which is a basic agricultural meteorological observation office according to the technical regulations of the world meteorological organization wmo in this study the sm data were obtained as a percent volumetric water content vwc at a depth of 10 cm using time domain reflectometry tdr based on the relationship between the dielectric properties of the soil and the moisture levels albergel et al 2012 and the data were collected at 3 sites nos 1 through 3 in table 2 namely cheorwon cw jinju jj1 and chuncheon cc1 from among the 11 stations because the sm data from the other stations were not good however the observed lst and precipitation data from the 11 aaos stations were utilized to calculate the daily coms lst and find the optimal regression scenario the technical specifications of the kma data were previously reported choi et al 2015 stations 4 through 8 are installed in the yongdam dam watershed in the geum river basin and operated by the korea water resources corporation k water their data are measured in percent vwc using tdr at a depth of 10 cm and they are provided by the yongdam experimental catchment http www ydew or kr the other stations nos 9 through 38 are operated by the korea rural development administration rda and they are also measured in percent vwc using the tdr at a depth of 10 cm these data were provided by the agricultural meteorology information service http weather rda go kr all sm data were prepared from january 2013 to may 2015 however certain data especially the rda data were prepared for a limited period of this duration because of their short observation period december 2014 to may 2015 the soil texture data were rasterized to the 4 km spatial resolution of the geos projection from a 1 25 000 vector map supplied by the korea rda these soil texture data were then used to divide the soil into 12 classes following the u s department of agriculture usda textural classification however sufficient data were not available for a regression analysis in each soil class because of the limited number of sm stations and sm data therefore the soil texture was classified into sand loam clay and silt the soil textural triangle was employed when we reclassified the whole soil dataset because we wanted to consider the soil characteristics as much as possible in this textural triangle sand loamy sand and sandy loam with 0 20 clay and 50 100 sand were classified as sand similarly clay sandy clay silty clay and silty clay loam were reclassified as clay silty loam and silt were reclassified as silt finally sandy clay loam clay loam and loam located in the middle of the soil textural triangle were classified as loam the stations were assigned to their respective soil texture classes and regression was performed on the grouped data in table 2 stations no 8 13 34 and 38 were excluded when the regression coefficients were estimated as the verification sites for each type of soil 2 3 multiple linear regression mlr model regression analysis is one of the most commonly used methods to measure the relationship between two or more variables and predict the behavior of a dependent or endogenous variable according to one or more independent or explanatory variables mlr is frequently used as an empirical model or approximating function that allows a mathematical model to be established to describe a given real world phenomenon generally the relationship between the dependent and the independent variables is given as in eq 1 prieto et al 2017 1 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n where y is the dependent variable β i i 0 1 n indicates the regression coefficients generally estimated by least squares and x i i 0 1 n indicates the independent variables although these models are based simply on linear and additive associations among the explanatory variables they have been extensively used with satisfactory results sousa et al 2007 prior to the regression analysis we attempted to identify the optimal input data combination from eight scenarios table 3 at 9 sm kma sites from the input data coms lst terra modis ndvi and aws precipitation data detailed information on these 9 stations can be found in a previous study lee et al 2016a in this case we also investigated the influence of the antecedent precipitation from 5 days p c p n 5 to 1 day p c p n 1 2 4 soil moisture index smi the sm based drought index known as the soil moisture index smi provides a measure of the severity and duration of agricultural drought for an area of interest the available water for plants is defined as the quantity of soil water between the field capacity fc and the lower limit of extractable water known as the wilting point wp and this stored water is extracted by plant roots jensen et al 1990 the available water can therefore constitute an important measure for quantifying agricultural drought if it can be converted into an index in this study to derive the smi the available water was first calculated based on the observed or modeled sm normalized to the maximum available water for plants calculated as the difference between the fc and wp this index was classified from no drought to extreme drought to quantitatively assess the drought conditions in both space and time sridhar et al 2008 the smi was computed based on the soil characteristics and sm conditions the parameters included the fc wp and sm as noted above the soil maps were obtained from the korea rda and the values of the fc and wp were applied according to the soil properties from a previous study rawls et al 1982 rawls et al 1982 provided a statistical analysis of numerous parameters including the total porosity residual saturation and effective porosity for each type of soil from 1085 points of u s soil characteristic data from these data the fc value for each type of soil was 0 410 for sand 0 358 for loam 0 390 for clay and 0 486 for silt the wp values were applied as follows 0 061 for sand 0 154 for loam 0 242 for clay and 0 133 for silt all smis were calculated for the top layer based on the observed sm data at a depth of 10 cm and the equation is as follows 2 s m i 5 s m w p f c w p 5 this equation yields smi values ranging from less than 5 to 0 the actual sm in the soil column is normalized to the available water capacity awc of the soil column that is then used for computing the index the range was chosen in a similar fashion to that of the u s drought monitor to maintain consistency and enable us to compare the severity of drought from both methods at a later stage an smi value of 0 indicates no drought but the area could be heading toward drought or recovering from drought meanwhile an smi of 1 indicates a drought of least intensity while 5 suggests a drought of extreme intensity is present for a given site sridhar et al 2008 it is possible for the smi to exceed 0 0 during very moist conditions i e if the sm exceeds the fc however as this study focused on recognizing a drought situation due to a lack of sm any value of sm greater than 0 was set to 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimation of the daily coms lst to estimate the daily lst through the coms data the deviations between the coms lst 15 min interval and daily mean lst data from 11 kma stations were first calculated based on the data from january 2013 to may 2015 and the minimum deviation was summarized with the time at which it appeared fig 2 the bar graph in fig 2 illustrates the number of times that the minimum deviation appears at that local time during the simulation period theoretically the total sum of the minimum deviation for each time should be 911 which is the same as that for the total simulation period however in certain cases coms data do not exist for an entire day due to the existence of clouds or noise therefore the average of the total number of occurrences of the minimum deviation is approximately 850 the solid line graph shows the average of the minimum deviations at the local time lee et al 2016b an analysis of the graphs for each station reveals that the minimum deviations were commonly observed in the time window near midnight 23 00 2 00 and at certain hours in morning 7 00 10 00 except at the jinju station furthermore in the afternoon time window 12 00 22 00 the minimum deviation appeared rarely and the deviation was very high as a result the data for the afternoon time range were not suitable for calculating the daily lst through the coms data based on the data of each graph the time at which the minimum deviation appeared most at each point was calculated and table 4 summarizes the times during which the minimum deviation was most frequent for each time period by dividing the time period between the morning 0 00 12 00 and the afternoon 12 00 24 00 the minimum deviation was 23 45 at five stations andong boseong seogwipo seosan and suncheon and the next most common time was 0 00 at four stations cheongju cheorwon chuncheon and jinju as a result at 23 45 and 0 00 i e near midnight 9 out of 11 stations showed the lowest deviation from the ground lst however the mean deviation at 23 45 was analyzed as 1 25 4 72 which was slightly higher than the range of 0 29 3 57 at 0 00 an analysis of the times at which the minimum deviation appeared in the morning and afternoon reveals that the afternoon time at which the minimum deviation occurred was 23 45 at all stations therefore we selected 0 00 and 23 45 as the representative times for the morning and afternoon respectively but it is meaningless to distinguish these times between the morning and afternoon because both times are close to midnight moreover when the sm is simulated using data from a specific time there may be interference in the daily sm simulation if the day is continuously cloudy at a specific time and the lst cannot be observed additionally since the lst can vary greatly due to weather changes such as snow and precipitation it is necessary to examine the simulation of the sm using data at a specific time for this reason we added 2 time zones with minimum deviations 23 45 1 15 and 7 30 9 45 to the scenario for the daily lst calculation with the averages of the daily data for each day and the efficiency of each result was compared table 5 shows the total number of data points extracted from the pixels corresponding to the 11 kma agricultural weather stations and the coefficients of determination r2 between the ground observed lst and the daily coms lst produced in 5 scenarios from january 2013 to may 2015 the total number of ground observed lst data measurements was 911 whereas the extracted data for each scenario showed that several data values were missing due to the existence of clouds or noise the number of data points increased in the order of scenarios a b d c and e scenarios a and b included between approximately 400 and 500 measurements in the case of scenario e the number of data points was the largest between approximately 800 and 850 but the r2 value ranged from 0 68 to 0 88 with the lowest correlation when compared with all 5 scenarios scenarios a and b were highly correlated with the ground observed lst among the five scenarios but these data were inadequate for estimating the lst because of the lack of data in the cases of scenarios c and d the numbers of data points ranged from approximately 500 to 800 and their r2 values were higher than those of scenarios a and b the r2 values of scenario c ranged from 0 82 to 0 92 and those of scenario d ranged from 0 86 to 0 94 indicating that the correlation of scenario d was generally higher than that of scenario c therefore the coms daily lst data were estimated using the representative data of time zone 2 which had the highest correlation with the ground lst data more than half of the lst data exhibited missing values in the map of each day during the simulation period due to the monsoon climate the mean cloud cover was generally higher than 50 and in the summer from june to august the cloud cover often exceeded 90 lee and kim 2016 therefore to consider the spatial distribution of the data gaps in the data were filled to account for the missing values and obtain the spatial distribution of the sm fig 3 shows an example of the coms lst before and after filling the gaps on 1 january 2014 first the valid pixels were extracted and converted into point data from the satellite lst for each day to avoid any possible edge effects caused by the idw method the coms lst data were extracted from a rectangular shaped area exceeding the boundaries of korea subsequently the data were interpolated using the idw method at a spatial resolution of 4 km fig 3b 3 2 results of the optimal regression equation and regression coefficients table 6 shows the results of the simulation of the selected scenarios in table 3 by first simulating the data from cheorwon station where the observed sm data are sufficient and the number of data observations from coms is sufficiently high to enable an effective simulation in table 3 con denotes the constant term in eq 1 and the coefficient in each column indicates the regression coefficient used to calculate the sm the objective functions used to determine the suitability and correlation of each scenario according to the simulation results are as follows r2 root mean square error rmse and index of agreement ioa moriasi et al 2007 overall as the input data were utilized more heavily the value of r2 rose in the case of scenario 1 using only lst data r2 was the lowest at 0 1766 scenarios 2 and 3 which used the lst and one other type of data exhibited slightly higher r2 than scenario 1 with values of 0 2032 and 0 2072 respectively in the case of scenarios 4 which used two independent variables in addition to the lst the r2 value increased by approximately 0 02 compared with scenarios 1 through 3 when we considered additional data i e the preceding precipitation with the same input data scenarios 5 and 6 the improvement in r2 was approximately 0 06 0 07 compared with the case without considering these data this difference seemed to be due to an increase in the independent variables of the regression equation for estimating the sm in scenario 7 the correlation also increased as the number of precipitation days increased with the same input data when the regression coefficient was separately calculated for each season in scenario 8 the r2 value was 0 7993 which his twice as high as those in the previous scenarios a previous study hong et al 2010 analyzed the seasonal correlations between the sm and the terra modis ndvi in the chungju dam watershed of south korea and found that the sm and ndvi were inversely correlated in the spring and autumn as the temperature increases in the spring the vegetation increases while the water content of the soil decreases due to an increase in evapotranspiration in the autumn the leaves of vegetation fall and the ndvi decreases whereas the sm is increased by the rainy season and the occurrence of typhoons in scenario 8 the regression coefficients of ndvi were expressed as negative numbers in the spring sp and autumn a according to the inverse correlation between the sm and ndvi the same results were obtained for the cheorwon station and 8 other stations lee et al 2016a from these results the regression coefficients using mlr were calculated for each season and the preceding rainfall was considered the same as in scenario 8 at this point the preceding rainfall considered the preceding 5 days according to the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method developed by the u s department of agriculture the regression coefficients of the mlr model were estimated depending on the four soil classes sand loam clay and silt considering the preceding precipitation up to 5 days before table 7 each regression coefficient was written with the p value so that the statistical significance was verified and r2 was used for the correlation analysis overall the p values of the regression coefficients were all below 0 05 thereby indicating statistical validity except for some of the summer and autumn lst regression coefficients the lst regression coefficients in the summer and autumn exceeded 0 05 because of the use of interpolated lst data within a monsoon climate all r2 values for the 4 soil classes ranged from 0 17 to 0 63 specifically the r2 of loam in the summer was the highest at 0 63 and most of the r2 values were 0 4 or higher the seasonal r2 showed that loam clay and silt had the lowest correlation among r2 in the winter and that sand had the lowest correlation in the spring these findings occurred because the sm data of the observatory classified as sand were provided by the kma and k water and the total data were sufficient from 2013 to may 2015 in contrast the data on loam clay and silt were mostly provided by the rda and the reason for the low r2 value was that the data were insufficient data were available for a period of less than one year in table 7 the values in braces denote the variance inflation factors vifs which measure the inflation in the variances of the parameter estimates due to multicollinearity potentially caused by correlated predictors generally a vif greater than 5 or greater than 10 is suggested for detecting multicollinearity kutner et al 2004 considering that the vif values of all variables are lower than 3 it can be concluded that the influence of multicollinearity between variables is small 3 3 estimation of the sm by regression coefficients the sm was simulated using the estimated regression coefficients and the accuracy with the observed soil moisture was verified by the r2 rmse and ioa at 38 stations table 8 the r2 rmse and ioa for all soil types ranged from 0 30 to 0 65 1 77 to 6 17 and 0 48 to 0 89 respectively the r2 values exceeded 0 4 at more than two thirds of the stations thereby showing a good correlation the rmse was less than 5 for all but four stations nos 18 25 31 and 33 and the ioa was highly correlated by 0 5 or more except for one station no 31 in the cases of stations nos 18 and 31 the results of all objective functions were low due to the instability in the observed data arising from the short retention period december 2014 to may 2015 of the sm observations as was the case with the other sm data provided by the rda the results of the four stations excluded for the verification showed that r2 had a constant correlation of 0 43 for sj no 8 0 40 for jb no 13 0 34 for yb no 34 and 0 51 for sy no 38 as a result of analyzing the objective function by soil type the r2 for each soil showed a similar correlation with 0 44 for sand 0 43 for loam 0 47 for clay and 0 46 for silt the rmse for each soil was estimated to be approximately 3 ranging from 2 99 to 3 86 and the ioa ranged from 0 65 to 0 79 concerning the time series analysis of the simulated sm fig 4 the simulated sm was observed to follow the volatility of the observed data in most of the soils in general the sm data were observed in the range from 0 to 20 for sand 10 to 30 for loam 20 to 40 for clay and 30 to 50 for silt in the case of sand fig 4a b the observed sm remarkably decreased in the winter and the simulated sm also showed this tendency in the case of station bs fig 4c the observed sm decreased from january to march 2014 but the simulated sm remained at approximately 23 without decreasing this period was rainless compared with other periods during which rainfall values existed and therefore no change in the sm was considered for stations oo and yg fig 4d f the sm simulations for the period during which the observations were present december 2014 to may 2015 were almost consistent with the observed values and the sm was predicted for the other period january 2013 to november 2014 for station gb fig 4e there were notable decreases and increases in the observed sm during short periods without rainfall in the winter of 2014 however these findings were considered to represent errors in the observed values in the cases of stations bs and sj fig 4g h the seasonal variability and observation range of sm were similar in both datasets observed and simulated data 3 4 spatial distribution of estimated sm based on seasonal regression coefficients estimated for each type of soil table 7 monthly spatial distribution maps of the sm precipitation and smi were generated from april to september 2013 fig 5 at this point the monthly maps of the sm and smi were created by averaging the daily maps and the monthly map of the precipitation was calculated by summing the precipitation of each month overall the spatial distribution of the sm varies with increases and decreases in the monthly precipitation in the sm map of june fig 5a the sm in the western part of the korean peninsula was sharply reduced because there was no rainfall for three months prior to june this tendency can be observed more clearly in the smi map as the smi decreased from 2 to 5 showing a heavy drought in particular the korean peninsula had been experiencing a protracted drought since 2013 and the annual rainfall was less than 35 50 of the long term average from 1973 to 2015 for two consecutive years kwon et al 2016 this condition demonstrates the possibility that the simulated sm and the smi calculated by the sm could be used for drought monitoring the drought was resolved through large scale rainfall events in july and the smi showed a value of zero in the northern and southern regions where rainfall occurred after july the sm naturally increased and decreased according to the precipitation additionally jung et al 2017 compared the smi and standardized precipitation index spi in 2015 which was an extreme drought year in south korea both drought indices showed an increase or decrease according to the distribution of the precipitation the authors stated that coupling between the spi and smi can be utilized as a meteorological drought index in forested areas and an agricultural drought index in cultivated areas although the correlation of the regression coefficients was low the simulated spatial distribution of the sm showed the variability well according to the rainfall it also showed the applicability of the mlr model used in this study 4 conclusions this study estimated the spatial distribution of sm in south korea from january 2013 to may 2015 using an mlr model with coms satellite data the results were evaluated by observed sm data from 38 stations measured by the tdr at a depth of 10 cm first from coms lst data measured every 15 min daily coms lst data were generated and compared with the daily mean lst data of 11 aaos stations second we attempted to identify optimal scenarios for sm regression analysis using the estimated daily coms lst data modis ndvi satellite data and aws precipitation data based on the optimal regression scenario the regression coefficients were calculated and the ssm was estimated from january 2013 to may 2015 finally the smi was calculated and compared with the ssm and the utility of the model was evaluated the primary results are summarized as follows 1 comparing the 15 min coms lst data and the observed lsts from 11 aaos stations used to calculate the daily coms lst data 0 00 and 23 45 were the times with the least deviations in the morning and afternoon respectively additionally the two time windows with the smallest deviations 23 45 1 15 and 7 30 9 45 were selected and compared with the results of the total arithmetic averages among them representative time window 2 7 30 9 45 had the highest correlation with the ground observed lst and the data acquisition rate was high 2 as a result of examining the optimal scenarios after applying various scenarios for the sm regression at the cheorwon station with a sufficient amount of sm data the sm regression model showed that the correlation increased with the seasonal regression coefficients and the efficiency was higher when the preceding precipitation was considered 3 3 the above result occurred because the seasonal regression analysis considered the inverse correlation between the sm and ndvi in the spring and autumn in addition the regression analysis was more efficient when considering the preceding precipitation because of the increases in the independent variables in the regression equation used to estimate the sm 4 the regression coefficients of the mlr model were estimated depending on the four soil classes sand loam clay and silt considering the preceding precipitation for up to 5 days before overall the p values of all regression coefficients were below 0 05 except for some of the summer and autumn regression coefficients of the lst all r2 values for the 4 soil classes ranged from 0 17 to 0 63 specifically the r2 of loam in the summer was the highest at 0 63 and most of the r2 values were 0 4 or higher 5 when we simulated the sm using the estimated regression coefficients the overall r2 exceeded 0 4 at more than two thirds of the stations thereby showing a good correlation the rmse was less than 5 for all but four stations and the ioa was highly correlated by 0 5 or more except for one station the results of a few stations were low due to the instability in the observed data because of the short retention period december 2014 to may 2015 of sm observations 6 as a result of the time series analysis of the simulated sm the simulated sm followed the volatility of the observed data in most of the soils in general the sm data ranged from 0 to 20 for sand 10 to 30 for loam 20 to 40 for clay and 30 to 50 for silt especially for some stations the sm simulations for the period in which observations were present december 2014 to may 2015 were almost consistent with the observed values and the sm was also predicted for the other period january 2013 to november 2014 7 in the spatial distribution of the sm the simulated sm tended to increase and decrease with the precipitation in the june sm map the sm in the western part of the korean peninsula was sharply reduced because there was no rainfall for three months prior to june this tendency can be observed more clearly in the smi map as the smi decreases from 2 to 3 showing a weak drought this finding demonstrates the possibility that the simulated sm and the smi calculated from the sm could be used for drought monitoring in this study estimates of the sm with coms lst data and the mlr model showed a correlation with r2 values ranging from 0 43 to 0 47 for each classified soil and the ssm effectively showed a variability according to the precipitation notably this study has developed an sm estimation model with an improved spatial resolution of 4 km compared with the spatial resolutions of existing microwave satellites such as the smos 0 25 approximately 25 km amsr2 0 1 and 0 25 and smap enhanced passive level 3 products 9 km sm data with a detailed spatial resolution can be used as input data for a hydrological model in addition the daily lst data used in the study were estimated using geostationary satellite data with a 15 min time resolution and thus more detailed sm simulations are possible if other input data are available the results of this study show that the spatial resolution was improved by 60 10 km to 4 km and the r2 increased by 116 7 0 30 to 0 65 compared with the values from a previous study cho et al 2015 based on amsr2 satellite data however certain aspects need improvement for example most of the sm data used in the present regression analysis are still missing because the observed data ranged only from december 2014 to may 2015 if more samples were available the results would be better in addition four types of soil which likely does not reflect the whole range of soil types were used to simulate the sm if the sm is prepared at various points in the future a detailed sm simulation based on the usda soil classification will be possible acknowledgments this paper was supported by konkuk university in 2016 
11204,northeast farming region of china nfr produces about one third of the national maize output shortage of crop irrigation water is one of the main threat to the stable level of maize production in the nfr previous studies on the sensitivity of maize production to drought are typically based on field experiments and treat the maize growing season as a whole with rare attention to the varying impacts of drought across different maize growth stages given the importance of nfr on china s food security it is crucial to optimize the irrigation schedule to mitigate the adverse effects of drought in this study we employ agro ecological zone aez model to investigate how climate change affects irrigation water requirement iwr of maize during different growth stages and under different climate change scenarios results indicate that the nfr would experience a substantial increase in the probability of extremely shortage of crop irrigation water under future climate change the ensemble simulation under future climate projections indicates more frequent demands for irrigation with substantially increased amount in the mid season stage g3 when maize is more sensitive to water deficit compared with other stages these findings indicate that earlier planning of irrigation infrastructure and development of more efficient irrigation scheme and technologies is of great importance to secure maize production in the region keywords irrigation water requirement climate change drought risk maize production china 1 introduction maize zea mays l production is critical in guaranteeing food and feed security for china gustafson et al 2014 as the famous golden maize belt the northeast farming region nfr is the largest rain fed maize producing region in china and accounted for more than one third of the nation s total production in 2016 national bureau of statistics of china http data stats gov cn however with 62 of the crop water requirements cwr being met by precipitation meng et al 2016 maize yield and production in the nfr have been vulnerable to drought due to the high sensitivity of maize to water supply and temperature as well as the spatial and temporal variability of effective rainfall in the region cook et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 in the coming decades the projected decrease in precipitation yu et al 2014 and increase in the frequency and intensity of drought episodes leng et al 2015 will further elevate the risk of maize production in the nfr xu et al 2013 meng et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 the increasing competition for water from the much more profitable non agricultural sectors will add diverting pressure on irrigation water supply and thus imposing further challenges to maize production in the region water stress caused by the shortage of irrigation water at any stage of maize growth can reduce biomass production and lead to yield loss as such extending irrigation network and optimizing irrigation scheme should be one of the most efficient adaptation measures to alleviate the negative impact of drought on maize production however only 15 of the maize growing areas in the nfr are irrigated liu et al 2005 existing assessments of drought risk in the region are mostly based on precipitation changes in the whole growth season e g kent et al 2017 without considering the varying sensitivity of maize growth to water stress at different growing stages e g vegetative silking and kernel filling growth stages for example the maize sowing season ranges from late april to mid may in the nfr spring drought can delay the sowing date changing the corresponding relationship between hydrothermal factors and exerting influence on maize grain yields osman 2015 wang et al 2017 the maximum reduction in grain yield results when the drought stress occurs at the vegetative growth stage osman 2015 it is therefore crucial to understand the distribution of irrigation water requirement iwr in different growing stages song et al 2013 yu et al 2013 such distributional information will provide a scientific base for irrigation infrastructure planning and irrigation schedule designing with the aim to mitigate the adverse effects of irrigation water shortages in the nfr under future climate change jiang et al 2017 wang et al 2016 climate change will affect water availability for crop growing and increase crop water requirements as a result of changes in the magnitude and timing of precipitation at different spatial and temporal scales gornall et al 2010 warming affects irrigation water demands in two ways first evapotranspiration increases due to the increase in radiation rise in temperature and uneven distribution of precipitation abtew and melesse 2013 second the warming climate can potentially increase the drought risk at the key growing stages this primarily occurs through increasing crop water requirements and reducing the available crop irrigation water during the growing period with an earlier planting and harvest dates on the other hand climate change can advance the start date and delay the end date of the crop growing season resulting in a longer growing season that can be utilized by farmers to increase crop yield in fact farmers in the nfr region have taken measures to adapt to the observed warming trend in the region during recent decades they have typically adopted maize cultivars with longer growing cycle which allows earlier sowing later harvesting and thus prolonging the maize growing length and leading to higher yield however such adaptation measure has significant implications for irrigation water demand because both evapotranspiration and precipitation vary seasonally zhang and cai 2013 this research will explicitly assess such implications for each growing stage of maize in the nfr sustainable agricultural production also depends on the efficient use of existing water resources for instance by increasing the efficiency of irrigation systems and adjusting crop calendar to meet the suitable climate conditions field experiments show that such adaptation measures can increase maize yield by 13 38 liu et al 2012 thus a better understanding of the cwr and iwr is of great importance for irrigation infrastructure planning irrigation scheduling and agricultural water management because of the urgent need for producing more food per unit volume of water in other words an enhanced ability in estimating evapotranspiration and predicting the cwr and iwr by crop growing stages can help improve crop water use efficiency improve crop productivity and consequently save water for other purposes fischer et al 2012b a number of process based crop models have been employed to assess changes in average productivity levels under future climate change bassu et al 2014 challinor et al 2014 nevertheless how to effectively use them to investigate the response of rainfed agriculture to the elevated drought risk especially for the crop water use is not well established yet recent studies have focused on assessing the quantity of iwr and the impact of irrigation water shortfall on maize production over the whole growing season in the nfr largely based on field experiments liu et al 2013 there has been a lack of attention to the following important question how does the irrigation water shortfall affect maize production at different growing stages across the region because the performance of process based and site specific models outside the place of observation would be biased due to insufficient data coverage and the inability to show spatial integrity tubiello and fischer 2007 we cannot directly use these process based models across a large region to simulate crop growing dynamics and quantify the iwr under different climate change scenarios in addition previous assessments of climate change impact on maize production in china e g tao and zhang 2010 xiong et al 2007 were based on special report on emission scenarios sres parry et al 2004 and has been out of date another weakness of previous assessments is the insufficient attention to adaptation measures of crops gustafson et al 2014 in this study we adopt a nested modeling procedure to better capture different key agricultural processes which influence maize growth and development across different spatial scales and to improve the spatial performance of the agro ecological zone aez model fischer et al 2012a b in terms of maize growth at regional scale at the 6 representative sites where we have detailed agro meteorological records and agronomic information we employ the decision support system for agro technology transfer dssat model to simulate the eco physiological processes at daily steps with the aim to calibrate and validate key eco physiological parameters for the aez model based on the outputs of the dssat model tian et al 2012 2014 at the regional level we employ the aez model to quantify the amounts of the iwr at the grid cell level across the nfr region and analyze the impact of irrigation water shortage on maize yield and production under current and future climate conditions in the nfr the aez model employs a powerful algorithm to simulate crop growth and provides standardized crop simulation and environmental matching programs to quantify the limitations of climate soil and agro ecological environments under specific management conditions to determine the expected yield of related planting activities fischer et al 2002 the objectives of this study are to 1 analyze the spatial temporal variations of the cwr and iwr with a focus on the maize growing season 2 estimate the spatial and temporal variation of the cwr and iwr in each key growing stage under different climate scenarios 3 investigate the risk of crop irrigation water shortage in each growing stage under different climate scenarios to our best knowledge this is the first study to characterize the impacts of future climate change on irrigation water demands at a regional scale in nfr thus providing the water demand context for regional agricultural planning and the scientific information for irrigation water resource management decision making in the nfr of china the aez model has three advantages to achieve the goals we raised above 1 the aez model contains an automatic crop calendar search for adaptation to climate change 2 the aez model estimates land suitability and productivity at the grid cell level across a large region like the nfr 3 the aez model can compute the cwr and iwr for each major crops and highlight the trade offs among crop planting options and between rain fed and irrigation uses in addition to providing a regional scale water requirement context for decision making this study also lays the foundation for future efforts that can look at water supply and requirement in conjunction and include other considerations such as competing uses and water management such as water rights curtailment and human decision making in an internally consistent manner the rest of the paper is structured as follows sections 2 provides details of the study region and datasets and presents the approach to quantify the iwr at each growth stages across grid cells in the nfr section 3 reports changes in the cwr iwr and drought risk at different growing stages under multiple climate change scenarios finally section 4 concludes and discusses the advantages and limitation of this work 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the northeast farming region nfr is located in the northeast china 118 50 135 05 e 38 43 53 24 n including provinces of heilongjiang jilin and liaoning the total area of nfr is 787 300 km2 with a population of 129 5 million in 2015 during the maize growing season

potential stem weight etc and crop management irrigation fertilization harvest etc in this study we focus on the maize growing period and divide it into four stages according to the aez model 1 from planting date to approximately 10 ground cover as the initial growth stage g1 2 from 10 ground cover to effective full cover as the crop development stage g2 3 from effective full cover to the start of maturity as the mid season stage g3 4 and from the start of maturity to harvest or full senescence as the late season stage g4 fischer et al 2012a meteorological data 1981 2010 are from the data center of cma including daily observations of sunshine hours maximum and minimum temperature precipitation relative humidity and wind speed the monthly maximum and minimum air temperature precipitation relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours are required in the aez model because solar radiation is not available at the six sites but is required by the dssat model we calculated it from the recorded daily sunshine hours using the empirical global radiation model pohlert 2004 other daily weather observations can be used directly in the dssat model climate projections are taken

down welling surface wind speed surface air pressure surface relative humidity warszawski et al 2014 soil properties such as soil texture and organic matter content play significant roles on soil water status and crop growth and thus affect crop yield and water productivity the harmonized world soil database hwsd is employed as the base for soil data hwsd is also the base for the global agro ecological zones model the hwsd is developed by the land use change and agriculture program of international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa and the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations it provides reliable and harmonized soil information at the pixel level for the world fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2009 soil properties soil texture clay content slit content sand content ph in water cation exchange capacity organic carbon bulk density required by the aez model can be extracted directly from the hwsd soil database the spatial distribution of cultivated land area is derived from the 2010 land use database 100 m 100 m which is developed by the chinese academy of sciences cas the primary data source for developing this land use database is landsat tm images with the china brazil earth resources satellite cbers as a supplementary for places where the landsat images do not cover the original land use data is classified into 25 types and we further group them into six categories cropland woodland grassland water body built up area and unused land these databases have been widely used in previous studies liu et al 2012 2010 in this study we extracted the cropland data from the land use dataset for the regional simulation finally all the input data for the aez are bilinear interpolated into the same spatial resolution of 10 km 10 km 2 2 the aez model and the estimation of irrigation water requirement iwr the iwr of maize growth in the nfr of china is estimated using the agro ecological zone aez model fischer et al 2007 the aez model is jointly developed by the international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa and the food and agricultural organization fao of the united nations the aez model employs simple and robust crop submodules and provides standardized crop modeling and environmental matching procedure to identify crop specific limitations of prevailing climate soil and terrain resources under assumed levels of management inputs e g low medium and high the standardized crop modeling and environmental matching procedure in the aez makes it well suited for crop productivity assessment at regional national and global scales fan et al 2017 fischer et al 2012a 2005 fischer and sun 2001 fischer et al 2002 tian et al 2014 2012 zhong et al 2017 the iwr in the aez is mainly determined by the availability of effective rainfall radiation and temperature the soil data are used to calculate the soil water balance which is then used to determine the potential and actual evapotranspiration for a reference crop and the duration of its growing period in this research we run the aez model at a daily time step for a 30 year time frame corresponding to historical climate 1981 2010 and two 30 year time frames corresponding to future climate in the 2050s 2041 2070 and the 2080s 2071 2100 respectively to understand the direct impacts of climate change on water deficit and crop iwr at different growing stages of maize in the nfr of china the crop water requirement cwr is the total amount of water required for compensating evapotranspiration loss from the cropped field under the well managed condition i e without water nutrient or pest stress drought occurring at any maize growth stage would reduce biomass production and cause yield loss due to insufficient water to meet the cwr effects of water stress on maize include the visible symptoms of reduced growth delayed maturity and reduced crop yield for instance water stress may reduce maize canopy height leaf area index and root growth the crop specific water requirement is calculated by multiplying the crop and crop stage specific parameters kc with the reference evapotranspiration et 0 at different maize growing stages c w r k c e t 0 the calculation of the cwr for a reference crop is based on the assumption that sufficient water is available for uptake in the rooting zone cwr is linked to et 0 through the crop coefficients for water requirements kc the kc factors for different growing stages early development middle and late stages are determined by phenological development and leaf area which are obtained from previous studies allen et al 1998 kang et al 2003 zhao et al 2013 the et 0 represents the evapotranspiration from a defined reference surface which is similar to an extensive surface of green and well watered grass of uniform height 0 12 m the et 0 was calculated according to the penman monteith equation using the driving meteorological variables as inputs monteith 1981 1965 the iwr is the amount of water required to meet the cwr beyond that supplied by effective rainfall it can be calculated using the following equation i w r c w r e t a the actual uptake of water for the reference crop is characterized by the actual evapotranspiration eta calculation of eta is differentiated between two possible cases depending on the availability of water for plant extraction i adequate soil water availability eta cwr and ii limited soil water availability eta etm i e maximum reference evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 for limited water conditions the eta can be calculated as the product of cwr and the variable ρ e t a m i n p r e ρ c w r c w r here pre represents the effective precipitation and ρ is the quotient of the current water balance wb and the readily available soil water wread ρ w b w r e a d the volume of water available for plant uptake is calculated using a daily soil water balance wb the wb accounts for the accumulated daily water inflow from precipitation pre mm day or snowmelt snm and the outflow from actual evapotranspiration eta and excess water loss due to runoff and deep percolation w b j m i n w b j 1 p r e s n m e t a w m a x where j is the day of the year and wmax is the maximum soil water storage capacity 2 3 calibration of dssat and validation of maize cultivars for the aez model although the standardized crop modeling and environmental matching procedure in the aez makes it well suited for crop productivity assessment and the iwr estimation at the regional scale a disadvantage of the aez model is the lack of mechanisms to update the key ecophysiological parameters in its input database the updating procedure of the aez is largely depedent on trial and error method the observed warming in the last several decades in the nfr has caused the original parameters in aez model to be unrepresentative and outdated because farmers in the region have made innovative adaptation efforts by adopting new caltivars to update key aez eco physiological parameters in a systematic way we adopt the model couping procedure developed in tian et al 2012 2014 which can be summarized as follows firstly we employ the dssat model jones et al 2003 to calibrate the phenological and physiological parameters of maize using detailed observations of maize growth development and management data from six agro meteorological stations in the nfr the dssat model is developed by the international benchmark sites network for argo technology transfer project ibsnat and it simulates the growth and development of crops within a homogeneous plot in a daily time step the dssat model uses genotype coefficients to describe the genotype by environment interactions and simulate performance of diverse cultivars under different conditions penning de vries et al 1992 each cultivar of a crop has specific parameters to describe the genotypic information of the cultivar within the parameter ranges of the crop our calibration and validation of the dssat is based on the attainable yield under ideal crop management conditions no water nutrien and pest stress in this way the calibration and validation can approximate field experiment conditions the maximum attainable yield is calculated from optimum yield components including the maximum grain number per tiller and the correspondent grain weight maximum tiller number per plant and the optimum plant density tian et al 2014 2018 present the technical details of this calibration and validation procedure secondly we convert these genotype coefficients obtained from the above calibration and validation process to the eco physiological parameters of the aez to enrich and update its cultivar parameters set 2 4 calculation of the probability of extreme iwr under climate change in this study we also investigate how the probability of exceeding a critical threshold xc of iwr will be altered under climate change scenarios compared to the historical period different from the traditional analysis focusing on the climatological mean we are interested in the extreme case of iwr because extreme cases are useful and often provide significant insights into the particular phenomenon being studied which also have important implications to crop yield xc is chosen so that the average occurrence of iwr which exceeds xc is only 10 for both future 2041 2070 and historical 1981 2010 period in a 30 year window we then calculated the normalized difference of this probability as follows p x 2 x c p x 1 x c p x x c where x2 refers to iwr during the future period 2041 2070 and x1 refers to iwr during the historical period 1981 2010 the shift is normalized by p x xc where x refers to values during the both time periods of 1981 2010 and 2041 2070 and xc is chosen so that p x xc is 10 the results are based on 20 ensemble members for each of the five models gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem noresm1 m each model s values are first standardized to have zero mean and unit variance 3 results 3 1 changes in precipitation and temperature table 1 reports the changes in daily mean precipitation and temperature in each growth stages of maize between the baseline of 1981 2010 and the 2050s at the six stations we can see from the precipitation panel that there is no statistically significant reduction of daily mean precipitation in stages g3 and g4 with the only exception of jiamusi station for g3 however the statistically significant increases in daily mean temperature are present in stages g3 with the only exception of haicheng and the extent of the significant increase will be 2 12 dunhua to 9 73 haerbing similar significant temperature increases are present in four of the six stations with the extent of significant change being 5 03 shuangcheng to 7 36 jiamusi significant increase in temperature combined with the more or less unchanged precipitation means significant increase in evapotranspiration and thus irrigation water requirement in these two growth stages the cases for g1 and g2 are sharply different for example at jiamusi station although reduction in daily mean precipitation is statistically significant the decrease in daily mean temperature is also statistically significant and therefore we would not expect a significant increase in the iwr at this station by the 2050 3 2 spatial temporal distribution of the cwr the estimated annual averaged cwr of rainfed maize for the entire nfr in the historical period 1981 2010 is 415 mm with western liaoning having the highest cwr and northern and eastern heilongjiang province having the lowest fig 1 this is due to the fact that precipitation in the nfr is unevenly distributed both seasonally and spatially with a decreasing temperature gradient from south to north under future climate scenarios cwr increases significantly over the nfr by the 2050s compared to the baseline 1981 2010 with the largest increase in the middle part of liaoning province and parts of western jilin province fig 1 more specifically under rcp2 6 the cwr of rainfed maize decreases in western jilin and southwestern heilongjiang in the medium emission pathways rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 we observe a reduced spatial extent of the decreased cwr in southwestern heilongjiang province compared to rcp2 6 however with the high emissions pathway rcp8 5 the cwr increases in most parts of the nfr especially in the middle parts of jilin province and decreased only in very small part of the southwestern heilongjiang province 3 3 field scale iwr under climate change table 2 reports the best attainable yield from observations and model simulations including the minimum mean and maximum and the average relative absolute error rae at the six stations in the historical period 1981 2010 it shows that the observed yield lies within the uncertainty range of the simulated yields for all six station with average raes between 4 54 and 7 63 these results demonstrate that the simulated attainable yield matches observations relatively well indicating that the aez model with our enriched value set of cultivar parameters is capable to simulate maize production level with relatively good accuracy fig 2 presents the box plots of the simulated iwr in each growth stage under the 20 gcm rcp combine scenarios with reference to the historical mean of 1981 2010 although there is no consistent iwr increases in the growth stages g1 and g2 across all six stations uniform increases of the iwr are present in the growth stages g3 and g4 we employ the t test to check the statistical significance of such iwr increase in stage g3 as crop growth in this stage is most sensitive to water stress five out of six stations except jiamusi will experience statistically significant increase of iwr in g3 at the 5 or 10 level for both the 2050s and 2080s 3 4 estimation of regional iwr during the maize growth season under climate change fig 3 depicts the spatial distributions of the average changes in the iwr over 5 gcms for each rcp between the baseline 1981 2010 and the 2050s a general increasing iwr is observed in the nfr for five gcms two regions are further distinguished according to the magnitude of irrigation water shortage 1 a large region concentrated in west liaoning province where iwr shortage can be very severe and would exert a greater negative impact on yield by the 2050s and 2 west jilin province and some southwest parts of heilongjiang province where shortage of the iwr would become severe as well implying a negative impact on maize yields by the 2050s under rcp2 6 scenario the ensemble averaged iwr over western jilin province and southwest part of heilongjiang province will decrease compared with the baseline scenario under rcp6 0 scenario the ensemble averaged iwr over the southwest part of heilongjiang province will increase compared to the baseline under rcp8 5 scenario the ensemble averaged iwr show a significant and similar increase of the iwr with rcp6 0 by the 2050s 3 5 the iwr in different growth stages under climate change assessment of the iwr at different growth stages is crucial because different maize cultivars have different growth length and because climate change may alter the seasonal variability of precipitation the spatial variation of the iwr at different growth stages of maize in the nfr is shown in fig 4 the change of iwr in the early maize growth stage g1 ranges from 30 to 10 mm with a general decreasing iwr across the nfr under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 and more or less unchanged level under rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 fig 4 a the range of iwr change is from 30 to 40 mm in development stage g2 with the most significant increase in western liaoning and southwest jilin fig 4 b consistent with the station level findings water deficit becomes the highest in the middle stage g3 with a gap of up to 100 mm in the maize belt under rcp8 5 fig 4 c during g3 maize is at the critical stage of plant development and the composition of evapotranspiration is dominated by crop transpiration therefore such water shortfall during g3 would have significant negative consequences to maize production in the region by the 2050s in the later stage g4 the extent of change in the iwr becomes very moderate similar to the case in g1 fig 4 d 3 6 shift in the probability of extreme iwr under climate change during the growth season and different growing stages fig 5 depicts a clear shift in the probabilities of extreme iwr for the whole growing period both in terms of the mean value and the shape of the distribution the median values in fig 5 indicate that there is 50 chance that the extreme iwr will become 1 1 8 times of the climatological probability of 10 by the 2050s the results show the probability distribution functions from pooling all grid boxes from the periods 1981 2010 and 2041 2070 in all cases the distribution between the two periods are shown to be statistically significantly different from each other of exceeding a particular critical value xc during the whole growing season because we are focusing on extreme years xc is chosen to be the 10 value based on all years in regard to the iwr the results from the aez model indicate that much of the nfr has experienced an increase in the probability of extreme water shortfall under climate change during whole growing season while the asymmetry appears to have increased between the two periods results indicate that the distribution in the future has become worse compared to the iwr for the whole growing season results in different growing stages are more homogenous with an increase in the probability of extreme iwr under climate change compared with the baseline the pdf characterizing the iwr in the nfr shows lower in the peak so that the changes in the pdf occur primarily in the peak and tails while it is true that extreme iwr become more likely with future warming due to the asymmetric effect of even small shifts to rare events it has also been implied that the iwr is becoming more variable in the sense of each year drawing from a broadening probability distribution fig 6 4 conclusions and discussions in this study we combined outputs from a wide range of gcm rcp combinations to produce detailed projections suitable for assessing the impact of climate change on irrigation water requirement iwr in different growth stages of maize in the northeast farming region nfr of china a region which produces about one third of the national maize output we employ an updated aez model to analyze the impact of irrigation water shortfall on maize yield and production under current and future climate conditions in the nfr main findings of this study are as follows 1 significant increase in the iwr is expected in the mid season stage g3 the critical development stage of maize growth under future climate change scenarios the increase is highest in the rcp8 5 scenario followed by the rcp6 0 rcp4 5 and rpc2 6 scenarios 2 current results indicate that significantly higher mean temperature and moderate change in rainfall during g3 would have a significant negative impact on maize yield in the future therefore earlier planning of irrigation infrastructure and development of more efficient irrigation technologies is of great importance to secure maize production level of the region 3 the nfr will exhibit a substantial increase in the probability of extremely high level of the iwr under future climate there is 50 chance that the extreme iwr will become 1 1 8 times of the climatological probability of 10 by the 2050s for different growing stages the increase in iwr is most significant in the mid season stage g3 in which maize growth is most sensitive to water shortfall the increase in the probability of extremely high level of the iwr in g3 largely results from broaden probability distribution and shift in the mean anticipatory water management planning at regional and national level coping with future climate change should include suitable measures related to future iwr to deal with climate change uncertainties in particular the spatial and temporal variations in the irrigation water requirement of maize for the upcoming periods should be taken into account in agricultural water resources management despite the above important findings some limitations are worth mentioning first improvements can be achieved with respect to the climate model selection this paper uses the gcm rcps scenario data proposed in the ipcc ar5 which shows improvements compared to cmip3 in mode resolution and experimental design however large uncertainties still remain in the model simulations and further analysis of the uncertainty is still needed second because the hydrogeology observations of groundwater resources in a large part of nfr are not available macdonald et al 2012 irrigation from the groundwater is not considered in this study which might have an impact on the current estimation of maize production third compounding weather extremes i e drought and high temperatures rainstorms freezing and fog may have adverse effects on maize production but these factors are not fully considered in our study fourth it is worth highlighting that the adoption of crop cultivar variety is often determined by farmers economic calculations and such calculation may not be consistent with the suitability consideration of agronomists future work is needed to quantify the uncertainty caused by the changing inter annual variability and will benefit from an extended analysis based on multiple crop models

11204,northeast farming region of china nfr produces about one third of the national maize output shortage of crop irrigation water is one of the main threat to the stable level of maize production in the nfr previous studies on the sensitivity of maize production to drought are typically based on field experiments and treat the maize growing season as a whole with rare attention to the varying impacts of drought across different maize growth stages given the importance of nfr on china s food security it is crucial to optimize the irrigation schedule to mitigate the adverse effects of drought in this study we employ agro ecological zone aez model to investigate how climate change affects irrigation water requirement iwr of maize during different growth stages and under different climate change scenarios results indicate that the nfr would experience a substantial increase in the probability of extremely shortage of crop irrigation water under future climate change the ensemble simulation under future climate projections indicates more frequent demands for irrigation with substantially increased amount in the mid season stage g3 when maize is more sensitive to water deficit compared with other stages these findings indicate that earlier planning of irrigation infrastructure and development of more efficient irrigation scheme and technologies is of great importance to secure maize production in the region keywords irrigation water requirement climate change drought risk maize production china 1 introduction maize zea mays l production is critical in guaranteeing food and feed security for china gustafson et al 2014 as the famous golden maize belt the northeast farming region nfr is the largest rain fed maize producing region in china and accounted for more than one third of the nation s total production in 2016 national bureau of statistics of china http data stats gov cn however with 62 of the crop water requirements cwr being met by precipitation meng et al 2016 maize yield and production in the nfr have been vulnerable to drought due to the high sensitivity of maize to water supply and temperature as well as the spatial and temporal variability of effective rainfall in the region cook et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 in the coming decades the projected decrease in precipitation yu et al 2014 and increase in the frequency and intensity of drought episodes leng et al 2015 will further elevate the risk of maize production in the nfr xu et al 2013 meng et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 the increasing competition for water from the much more profitable non agricultural sectors will add diverting pressure on irrigation water supply and thus imposing further challenges to maize production in the region water stress caused by the shortage of irrigation water at any stage of maize growth can reduce biomass production and lead to yield loss as such extending irrigation network and optimizing irrigation scheme should be one of the most efficient adaptation measures to alleviate the negative impact of drought on maize production however only 15 of the maize growing areas in the nfr are irrigated liu et al 2005 existing assessments of drought risk in the region are mostly based on precipitation changes in the whole growth season e g kent et al 2017 without considering the varying sensitivity of maize growth to water stress at different growing stages e g vegetative silking and kernel filling growth stages for example the maize sowing season ranges from late april to mid may in the nfr spring drought can delay the sowing date changing the corresponding relationship between hydrothermal factors and exerting influence on maize grain yields osman 2015 wang et al 2017 the maximum reduction in grain yield results when the drought stress occurs at the vegetative growth stage osman 2015 it is therefore crucial to understand the distribution of irrigation water requirement iwr in different growing stages song et

effects of irrigation water shortages in the nfr under future climate change jiang et al 2017 wang et al 2016 climate change will affect water availability for crop growing and increase crop water requirements as a result of changes in the magnitude and timing of precipitation at different spatial and temporal scales gornall et al 2010 warming affects irrigation water demands in two ways first evapotranspiration increases due to the increase in radiation rise in temperature and uneven distribution of precipitation abtew and melesse 2013 second the warming climate can potentially increase the drought risk at the key growing stages this primarily occurs through increasing crop water requirements and reducing the available crop irrigation water during the growing period with an earlier planting and harvest dates on the other hand climate change can advance the start date and delay the end date of the crop growing season resulting in a longer growing season that can be utilized by farmers to increase crop yield in fact farmers in the nfr region have taken measures to adapt to the observed warming trend in the region during recent decades they have typically adopted maize cultivars with longer growing cycle which allows earlier sowing later harvesting and thus prolonging the maize growing length and leading to higher yield however such adaptation measure has significant implications for irrigation water demand because both evapotranspiration and precipitation vary seasonally zhang and cai 2013 this research will explicitly assess such implications for each growing stage of maize in the nfr sustainable agricultural production also depends on the efficient use of existing water resources for instance by increasing the efficiency of irrigation systems and adjusting crop calendar to meet the suitable climate conditions field experiments show that such adaptation measures can increase maize yield by 13 38 liu et al 2012 thus a better understanding of the cwr and iwr is of great importance for irrigation infrastructure planning irrigation scheduling and agricultural water management because of the urgent need for producing more food per unit volume of water in other words an enhanced ability in estimating evapotranspiration and predicting the cwr and iwr by crop growing stages can help improve crop water use efficiency improve crop productivity and consequently save water for other purposes fischer et al 2012b a number of process based crop models have been employed to assess changes in average productivity levels under future climate change bassu et al 2014 challinor et al 2014 nevertheless how to effectively use them to investigate the response of rainfed agriculture to the elevated drought risk especially for the crop water use is not well established yet recent studies have focused on assessing the quantity of iwr and the impact of irrigation water shortfall on maize production over the whole growing season in the nfr largely based on field experiments liu et al 2013 there has been a lack of attention to the following important question how does the irrigation water shortfall affect maize production at different growing stages across the region because the performance of process based and site specific models outside the place of observation would be biased due to insufficient data coverage and the inability to show spatial integrity tubiello and fischer 2007 we cannot directly use these process based models across a large region to simulate crop growing dynamics and quantify the iwr under different climate change scenarios in addition previous assessments of climate change impact on maize production in china e g tao and zhang 2010 xiong et al 2007 were based on special report on emission scenarios sres parry et al 2004 and has been out of date another weakness of previous assessments is the insufficient attention to adaptation measures of crops gustafson et al 2014 in this study we adopt a nested modeling procedure to better capture different key agricultural processes which influence maize growth and development across different spatial scales and to improve the spatial performance of the agro ecological zone aez model fischer et al 2012a b in terms of maize growth at regional scale at the 6 representative sites where we have detailed agro meteorological records and agronomic information we employ the decision support system for agro technology transfer dssat model to simulate the eco physiological processes at daily steps with the aim to calibrate and validate key eco physiological parameters for the aez model based on the outputs of the dssat model tian et al 2012 2014 at the regional level we employ the aez model to quantify the amounts of the iwr at the grid cell level across the nfr region and analyze the impact of irrigation water shortage on maize yield and production under current and future climate conditions in the nfr the aez model employs a powerful algorithm to simulate crop growth and provides standardized crop simulation and environmental matching programs to quantify the limitations of climate soil and agro ecological environments under specific management conditions to determine the expected yield of related planting activities fischer et al 2002 the objectives of this study are to 1 analyze the spatial temporal variations of the cwr and iwr with a focus on the maize growing season 2 estimate the spatial and temporal variation of the cwr and iwr in each key growing stage under different climate scenarios 3 investigate the risk of crop irrigation water shortage in each growing stage under different climate scenarios to our best knowledge this is the first study to characterize the impacts of future climate change on irrigation water demands at a regional scale in nfr thus providing the water demand context for regional agricultural planning and the scientific information for irrigation water resource management decision making in the nfr of china the aez model has three advantages to achieve the goals we raised above 1 the aez model contains an automatic crop calendar search for adaptation to climate change 2 the aez model estimates land suitability and productivity at the grid cell level across a large region like the nfr 3 the aez model can compute the cwr and iwr for each major crops and highlight the trade offs among crop planting options and between rain fed and irrigation uses in addition to providing a regional scale water requirement context for decision making this study also lays the foundation for future efforts that can look at water supply and requirement in conjunction and include other considerations such as competing uses and water management such as water rights curtailment and human decision making in an internally consistent manner the rest of the paper is structured as follows sections 2 provides details of the study region and datasets and presents the approach to quantify the iwr at each growth stages across grid cells in the nfr section 3 reports changes in the cwr iwr and drought risk at different growing stages under multiple climate change scenarios finally section 4 concludes and discusses the advantages and limitation of this work 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the northeast farming region nfr is located in the northeast china 118 50 135 05 e 38 43 53 24 n including provinces of heilongjiang jilin and liaoning the total area of nfr is 787 300 km2 with a population of 129 5 million in 2015 during the maize growing season from april to october the average precipitation ranges from 308 to 657 mm and the 10 c accumulative temperature ranges from 2200 to 3600 c the input data for this study includes observations of maize

potential stem weight etc and crop management irrigation fertilization harvest etc in this study we focus on the maize growing period and divide it into four stages according to the aez model 1 from planting date to approximately 10 ground cover as the initial growth stage g1 2 from 10 ground cover to effective full cover as the crop development stage g2 3 from effective full cover to the start of maturity as the mid season stage g3 4 and from the start of maturity to harvest or full senescence as the late season stage g4 fischer et al 2012a meteorological data 1981 2010 are from the data center of cma including daily observations of sunshine hours maximum and minimum temperature precipitation relative humidity and wind speed the monthly maximum and minimum air temperature precipitation relative humidity wind speed and sunshine hours are required in the aez model because solar radiation is not available at the six sites but is required by the dssat model we calculated it from the recorded daily sunshine hours using the empirical global radiation model pohlert 2004 other daily weather observations can be used directly in the dssat model climate projections are taken

2010 taylor et al 2012 future climate change data from the above 20 gcm rcp combinations are used in this study including surface air temperatures precipitation surface radiation short and long wave down welling surface wind speed surface air pressure surface relative humidity warszawski et al 2014 soil properties such as soil texture and organic matter content play significant roles on soil water status and crop growth and thus affect crop yield and water productivity the harmonized world soil database hwsd is employed as the base for soil data hwsd is also the base for the global agro ecological zones model the hwsd is developed by the land use change and agriculture program of international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa and the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations it provides reliable and harmonized soil information at the pixel level for the world fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2009 soil properties soil texture clay content slit content sand content ph in water cation exchange capacity organic carbon bulk density required by the aez model can be extracted directly from the hwsd soil database the spatial distribution of cultivated land area is derived from the 2010 land use database 100 m 100 m which is developed by the chinese academy of sciences cas the primary data source for developing this land use database is landsat tm images with the china brazil earth resources satellite cbers as a supplementary for places where the landsat images do not cover the original land use data is classified into 25 types and we further group them into six categories cropland woodland grassland water body built up area and unused land these databases have been widely used in previous studies liu et al 2012 2010 in this study we extracted the cropland data from the land use dataset for the regional simulation finally all the input data for the aez are bilinear interpolated into the same spatial resolution of 10 km 10 km 2 2 the aez model and the estimation of irrigation water requirement iwr the iwr of maize growth in the nfr of china is estimated using the agro ecological zone aez model fischer et al 2007 the aez model is jointly developed by the international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa and the food and agricultural organization fao of the united nations the aez model employs simple and robust crop submodules and provides standardized crop modeling and environmental matching procedure to identify crop specific limitations of prevailing climate soil and terrain resources under assumed levels of management inputs e g low medium and high the standardized crop modeling and environmental matching procedure in the aez makes it well suited for crop productivity assessment at regional national and global scales fan et al 2017 fischer et al 2012a 2005 fischer and sun 2001 fischer et al 2002 tian et al 2014 2012 zhong et al 2017 the iwr in the aez is mainly determined by the availability of effective rainfall radiation and temperature the soil data are used to calculate the soil water balance which is then used to determine the potential and actual evapotranspiration for a reference crop and the duration of its growing period in this research we run the aez model at a daily time step for a 30 year time frame corresponding to historical climate 1981 2010 and two 30 year time frames corresponding to future climate in the 2050s 2041 2070 and the 2080s 2071 2100 respectively to understand the direct impacts of climate change on water deficit and crop iwr at different growing stages of maize in the nfr of china the crop water requirement cwr is the total amount of water required for compensating evapotranspiration loss from the cropped field under the well managed condition i e without water nutrient or pest stress drought occurring at any maize growth stage would reduce biomass production and cause yield loss due to insufficient water to meet the cwr effects of water stress on maize include the visible symptoms of reduced growth delayed maturity and reduced crop yield for instance water stress may reduce maize canopy height leaf area index and root growth the crop specific water requirement is calculated by multiplying the crop and crop stage specific parameters kc with the reference evapotranspiration et 0 at different maize growing stages c w r k c e t 0 the calculation of the cwr for a reference crop is based on the assumption that sufficient water is available for uptake in the rooting zone cwr is linked to et 0 through the crop coefficients for water requirements kc the kc factors for different growing stages early development middle and late stages are determined by phenological development and leaf area which are obtained from previous studies allen et al 1998 kang et al 2003 zhao et al 2013 the et 0 represents the evapotranspiration from a defined reference surface which is similar to an extensive surface of green and well watered grass of uniform height 0 12 m the et 0 was calculated according to the penman monteith equation using the driving meteorological variables as inputs monteith 1981 1965 the iwr is the amount of water required to meet the cwr beyond that supplied by effective rainfall it can be calculated using the following equation i w r c w r e t a the actual uptake of water for the reference crop is characterized by the actual evapotranspiration eta calculation of eta is differentiated between two possible cases depending on the availability of water for plant extraction i adequate soil water availability eta cwr and ii limited soil water availability eta etm i e maximum reference evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 for limited water conditions the eta can be calculated as the product of cwr and the variable ρ e t a m i n p r e ρ c w r c w r here pre represents the effective precipitation and ρ is the quotient of the current water balance wb and the readily available soil water wread ρ w b w r e a d the volume of water available for plant uptake is calculated using a daily soil water balance wb the wb accounts for the accumulated daily water inflow from precipitation pre mm day or snowmelt snm and the outflow from actual evapotranspiration eta and excess water loss due to runoff and deep percolation w b j m i n w b j 1 p r e s n m e t a w m a x where j is the day of the year and wmax is the maximum soil water storage capacity 2 3 calibration of dssat and validation of maize cultivars for the aez model although the standardized crop modeling and environmental matching procedure in the aez makes it well suited for crop productivity assessment and the iwr estimation at the regional scale a disadvantage of the aez model is the lack of mechanisms to update the key ecophysiological parameters in its input database the updating procedure of the aez is largely depedent on trial and error method the observed warming in the last several decades in the nfr has caused the original parameters in aez model to be unrepresentative and outdated because farmers in the region have made innovative adaptation efforts by adopting new caltivars to update key aez eco physiological parameters in a systematic way we adopt the model couping procedure developed in tian et al 2012 2014 which can be summarized as follows firstly we employ the dssat model jones et al 2003 to calibrate the phenological and physiological parameters of maize using detailed observations of maize growth development and management data from six agro meteorological stations in the nfr the dssat model is developed by the international benchmark sites network for argo technology transfer project ibsnat and it simulates the growth and development of crops within a homogeneous plot in a daily time step the dssat model uses genotype coefficients to describe the genotype by environment interactions and simulate performance of diverse cultivars under different conditions penning de vries et al 1992 each cultivar of a crop has specific parameters to describe the genotypic information of the cultivar within the parameter ranges of the crop our calibration and validation of the dssat is based on the attainable yield under ideal crop management conditions no water nutrien and pest stress in this way the calibration and validation can approximate field experiment conditions the maximum attainable yield is calculated from optimum yield components including the maximum grain number per tiller and the correspondent grain weight maximum tiller number per plant and the optimum plant density tian et al 2014 2018 present the technical details of this calibration and validation procedure secondly we convert these genotype coefficients obtained from the above calibration and validation process to the eco physiological parameters of the aez to enrich and update its cultivar parameters set 2 4 calculation of the probability of extreme iwr under climate change in this study we also investigate how the probability of exceeding a critical threshold xc of iwr will be altered under climate change scenarios compared to the historical period different from the traditional analysis focusing on the climatological mean we are interested in the extreme case of iwr because extreme cases are useful and often provide significant insights into the particular phenomenon being studied which also have important implications to crop yield xc is chosen so that the average occurrence of iwr which exceeds xc is only 10 for both future 2041 2070 and historical 1981 2010 period in a 30 year window we then calculated the normalized difference of this probability as follows p x 2 x c p x 1 x c p x x c where x2 refers to iwr during the future period 2041 2070 and x1 refers to iwr during the historical period 1981 2010 the shift is normalized by p x xc where x refers to values during the both time periods of 1981 2010 and 2041 2070 and xc is chosen so that p x xc is 10 the results are based on 20 ensemble members for each of the five models gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem noresm1 m each model s values are first standardized to have zero mean and unit variance 3 results 3 1 changes in precipitation and temperature table 1 reports the changes in daily mean precipitation and temperature in each growth stages of maize between the baseline of 1981 2010 and the 2050s at the six stations we can see from the precipitation panel that there is no statistically significant reduction of daily mean precipitation in stages g3 and g4 with the only exception of jiamusi station for g3 however the statistically significant increases in daily mean temperature are present in stages g3 with the only exception of haicheng and the extent of the significant increase will be 2 12 dunhua to 9 73 haerbing similar significant temperature increases are present in four of the six stations with the extent of significant change being 5 03 shuangcheng to 7 36 jiamusi significant increase in temperature combined with the more or less unchanged precipitation means significant increase in evapotranspiration and thus irrigation water requirement in these two growth stages the cases for g1 and g2 are sharply different for example at jiamusi station although reduction in daily mean precipitation is statistically significant the decrease in daily mean temperature is also statistically significant and therefore we would not expect a significant increase in the iwr at this station by the 2050 3 2 spatial temporal distribution of the cwr the estimated annual averaged cwr of rainfed maize for the entire nfr in the historical period 1981 2010 is 415 mm with western liaoning having the highest cwr and northern and eastern heilongjiang province having the lowest fig 1 this is due to the fact that precipitation in the nfr is unevenly distributed both seasonally and spatially with a decreasing temperature gradient from south to north under future climate scenarios cwr increases significantly over the nfr by the 2050s compared to the baseline 1981 2010 with the largest increase in the middle part of liaoning province and parts of western jilin province fig 1 more specifically under rcp2 6 the cwr of rainfed maize decreases in western jilin and southwestern heilongjiang in the medium emission pathways rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 we observe a reduced spatial extent of the decreased cwr in southwestern heilongjiang province compared to rcp2 6 however with the high emissions pathway rcp8 5 the cwr increases in most parts of the nfr especially in the middle parts of jilin province and decreased only in very small part of the southwestern heilongjiang province 3 3 field scale iwr under climate change table 2 reports the best attainable yield from observations and model simulations including the minimum mean and maximum and the average relative absolute error rae at the six stations in the historical period 1981 2010 it shows that the observed yield lies within the uncertainty range of the simulated yields for all six station with average raes between 4 54 and 7 63 these results demonstrate that the simulated attainable yield matches observations relatively well indicating that the aez model with our enriched value set of cultivar parameters is capable to simulate maize production level with relatively good accuracy fig 2 presents the box plots of the simulated iwr in each growth stage under the 20 gcm rcp combine scenarios with reference to the historical mean of 1981 2010 although there is no consistent iwr increases in the growth stages g1 and g2 across all six stations uniform increases of the iwr are present in the growth stages g3 and g4 we employ the t test to check the statistical significance of such iwr increase in stage g3 as crop growth in this stage is most sensitive to water stress five out of six stations except jiamusi will experience statistically significant increase of iwr in g3 at the 5 or 10 level for both the 2050s and 2080s 3 4 estimation of regional iwr during the maize growth season under climate change fig 3 depicts the spatial distributions of the average changes in the iwr over 5 gcms for each rcp between the baseline 1981 2010 and the 2050s a general increasing iwr is observed in the nfr for five gcms two regions are further distinguished according to the magnitude of irrigation water shortage 1 a large region concentrated in west liaoning province where iwr shortage can be very severe and would exert a greater negative impact on yield by the 2050s and 2 west jilin province and some southwest parts of heilongjiang province where shortage of the iwr would become severe as well implying a negative impact on maize yields by the 2050s under rcp2 6 scenario the ensemble averaged iwr over western jilin province and southwest part of heilongjiang province will decrease compared with the baseline scenario under rcp6 0 scenario the ensemble averaged iwr over the southwest part of heilongjiang province will increase compared to the baseline under rcp8 5 scenario the ensemble averaged iwr show a significant and similar increase of the iwr with rcp6 0 by the 2050s 3 5 the iwr in different growth stages under climate change assessment of the iwr at different growth stages is crucial because different maize cultivars have different growth length and because climate change may alter the seasonal variability of precipitation the spatial variation of the iwr at different growth stages of maize in the nfr is shown in fig 4 the change of iwr in the early maize growth stage g1 ranges from 30 to 10 mm with a general decreasing iwr across the nfr under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 and more or less unchanged level under rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 fig 4 a the range of iwr change is from 30 to 40 mm in development stage g2 with the most significant increase in western liaoning and southwest jilin fig 4 b consistent with the station level findings water deficit becomes the highest in the middle stage g3 with a gap of up to 100 mm in the maize belt under rcp8 5 fig 4 c during g3 maize is at the critical stage of plant development and the composition of evapotranspiration is dominated by crop transpiration therefore such water shortfall during g3 would have significant negative consequences to maize production in the region by the 2050s in the later stage g4 the extent of change in the iwr becomes very moderate similar to the case in g1 fig 4 d 3 6 shift in the probability of extreme iwr under climate change during the growth season and different growing stages fig 5 depicts a clear shift in the probabilities of extreme iwr for the whole growing period both in terms of the mean value and the shape of the distribution the median values in fig 5 indicate that there is 50 chance that the extreme iwr will become 1 1 8 times of the climatological probability of 10 by the 2050s the results show the probability distribution functions from pooling all grid boxes from the periods 1981 2010 and 2041 2070 in all cases the distribution between the two periods are shown to be statistically significantly different from each other of exceeding a particular critical value xc during the whole growing season because we are focusing on extreme years xc is chosen to be the 10 value based on all years in regard to the iwr the results from the aez model indicate that much of the nfr has experienced an increase in the probability of extreme water shortfall under climate change during whole growing season while the asymmetry appears to have increased between the two periods results indicate that the distribution in the future has become worse compared to the iwr for the whole growing season results in different growing stages are more homogenous with an increase in the probability of extreme iwr under climate change compared with the baseline the pdf characterizing the iwr in the nfr shows lower in the peak so that the changes in the pdf occur primarily in the peak and tails while it is true that extreme iwr become more likely with future warming due to the asymmetric effect of even small shifts to rare events it has also been implied that the iwr is becoming more variable in the sense of each year drawing from a broadening probability distribution fig 6 4 conclusions and discussions in this study we combined outputs from a wide range of gcm rcp combinations to produce detailed projections suitable for assessing the impact of climate change on irrigation water requirement iwr in different growth stages of maize in the northeast farming region nfr of china a region which produces about one third of the national maize output we employ an updated aez model to analyze the impact of irrigation water shortfall on maize yield and production under current and future climate conditions in the nfr main findings of this study are as follows 1 significant increase in the iwr is expected in the mid season stage g3 the critical development stage of maize growth under future climate change scenarios the increase is highest in the rcp8 5 scenario followed by the rcp6 0 rcp4 5 and rpc2 6 scenarios 2 current results indicate that significantly higher mean temperature and moderate change in rainfall during g3 would have a significant negative impact on maize yield in the future therefore earlier planning of irrigation infrastructure and development of more efficient irrigation technologies is of great importance to secure maize production level of the region 3 the nfr will exhibit a substantial increase in the probability of extremely high level of the iwr under future climate there is 50 chance that the extreme iwr will become 1 1 8 times of the climatological probability of 10 by the 2050s for different growing stages the increase in iwr is most significant in the mid season stage g3 in which maize growth is most sensitive to water shortfall the increase in the probability of extremely high level of the iwr in g3 largely results from broaden probability distribution and shift in the mean anticipatory water management planning at regional and national level coping with future climate change should include suitable measures related to future iwr to deal with climate change uncertainties in particular the spatial and temporal variations in the irrigation water requirement of maize for the upcoming periods should be taken into account in agricultural water resources management despite the above important findings some limitations are worth mentioning first improvements can be achieved with respect to the climate model selection this paper uses the gcm rcps scenario data proposed in the ipcc ar5 which shows improvements compared to cmip3 in mode resolution and experimental design however large uncertainties still remain in the model simulations and further analysis of the uncertainty is still needed second because the hydrogeology observations of groundwater resources in a large part of nfr are not available macdonald et al 2012 irrigation from the groundwater is not considered in this study which might have an impact on the current estimation of maize production third compounding weather extremes i e drought and high temperatures rainstorms freezing and fog may have adverse effects on maize production but these factors are not fully considered in our study fourth it is worth highlighting that the adoption of crop cultivar variety is often determined by farmers economic calculations and such calculation may not be consistent with the suitability consideration of agronomists future work is needed to quantify the uncertainty caused by the changing inter annual variability and will benefit from an extended analysis based on multiple crop models
