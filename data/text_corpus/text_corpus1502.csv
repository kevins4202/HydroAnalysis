7510,cost benefit analysis and flood frequency analysis have been integrated into a comprehensive framework to estimate cost effective design values however previous cost benefit based extreme flood estimation is based on stationary assumptions and analyze dependent flood variables separately a non stationary cost benefit based bivariate design flood estimation nscobe approach is developed in this study to investigate influence of non stationarities in both the dependence of flood variables and the marginal distributions on extreme flood estimation the dependence is modeled utilizing copula functions previous design flood selection criteria are not suitable for nscobe since they ignore time changing dependence of flood variables therefore a risk calculation approach is proposed based on non stationarities in both marginal probability distributions and copula functions a case study with 54 year observed data is utilized to illustrate the application of nscobe results show nscobe can effectively integrate non stationarities in both copula functions and marginal distributions into cost benefit based design flood estimation it is also found that there is a trade off between maximum probability of exceedance calculated from copula functions and marginal distributions this study for the first time provides a new approach towards a better understanding of influence of non stationarities in both copula functions and marginal distributions on extreme flood estimation and could be beneficial to cost benefit based non stationary bivariate design flood estimation across the world keywords copula flood frequency non stationarity nscobe risk 1 introduction extreme floods could be devastating and can cause huge socio economic impacts and have received much attention globally perron et al 2016 wells et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 blöschl et al 2017 song et al 2017 in recent years extreme flood estimation obtained from cost benefit analysis has been proved to be equivalent to estimates from conventional flood frequency analysis ffa method with assumptions of linear damage and cost functions new approaches have been developed by incorporating cost benefit analysis into ffa to estimate cost effective design flood values botto et al 2014 qi et al 2016a qi 2017 non stationarity and dependence in design variables such as flood peaks and flood volumes are two key issues in design flood estimation milly et al 2008 strupczewski et al 2009 bender et al 2014 in ffa influence of non stationarity on extreme flood estimation has been investigated by many studies olsen et al 1998 villarini et al 2009 bender et al 2014 qi et al 2016b read and vogel 2016 regarding dependence in design variables efforts have been made to investigate its influence for example return period definition salvadori and de michele 2010 salvadori et al 2011 salvadori et al 2013 design hydrograph estimation gräler et al 2013 candela et al 2014 mojca et al 2015 hydrologic dam design klein et al 2010 requena et al 2013 structure based framework for hydraulic design volpi and fiori 2014 salvadori et al 2015 flow distribution estimation from climatic variables xiong et al 2014 modelling uncertainty of flood quantiles in ungauged sites santillán et al 2014 grimaldi et al 2016 and non stationary design flood estimation bender et al 2014 cong et al 2015 copula functions were commonly utilized in the prior studies to represent dependence between design variables salvadori and de michele 2004 genest and favre 2007 salvadori and de michele 2010 salvadori et al 2011 gräler et al 2013 salvadori et al 2013 fu and butler 2014 in cost benefit based extreme flood estimation approaches previous studies have been based on stationary approaches botto et al 2014 qi et al 2016a recently qi 2017 developed a non stationary cost benefit based extreme flood estimation method however this new non stationary method is based on univariate analysis the univariate approach is adequate when only one variable is significant in a design process but cannot provide a complete assessment of occurrence probabilities of design floods callau poduje et al 2014 even worse the use of a number of variables viz a multivariate approach where possible dependencies are not correctly assessed e g the variables are considered as independent when they are not may yield fake estimates of the design values see e g the case study presented in salvadori et al 2015 hydraulic structure design is usually based on full hydrograph which is characterized by flood peak and volume renard and lang 2007 callau poduje et al 2014 parent et al 2014 and these two variables are usually dependent salvadori and de michele 2004 thus it is necessary to develop a non stationary cost benefit based bivariate extreme flood estimation approach however to the best of the authors knowledge such an approach has not been developed the overall objective of this paper is to develop a non stationary cost benefit based bivariate design flood estimation nscobe approach this approach can consider non stationaries in both copula functions and marginal distributions in a framework integrating cost benefit analysis and copula functions a river basin with 54 year discharge data is used to illustrate applications of nscobe six copula functions are tested to select the best one based on the cramér von mises statistic and the cross validation copula information criterion xv cic gronneberg and hjort 2014 these copula functions are gumbel clayton survival gumbel survival clayton frank and t student in this paper there are three advancements from the present state of knowledge first a non stationary cost benefit based bivariate design flood estimation approach is developed second a risk calculation approach is proposed based on non stationarities in both copula functions and marginal distributions third trade offs are found in risk estimation between copula functions and marginal distributions here the risk refers to the probability of exceedance not potential damage which has also been utilized in previous research e g rootzén and katz 2013 aghakouchak et al 2014 condon et al 2015 sarhadi et al 2016a this study provides a new approach towards a better understanding of the influence of non stationarity on design flood estimation involving multiple design flood variables 2 the nscobe approach fig 1 shows the flowchart of the nscobe approach it includes three main steps 1 test significance of non stationarity of observed data and select copula and marginal distribution functions if non stationarity is significant 2 calculate expected total cost criterion values on the basis of a return period of interest which includes the expected flood damage cost and construction cost 3 select design variables on the basis of calculated risk and the maximum probability criterion fig 1 shows the flowchart of the developed nscobe approach details of the proposed new approach are explained in the remainder of this section 2 1 selecting copula functions when there are two dependent variables joint cumulative distributions f is defined based on marginal distributions u f x x and v f y y and a copula c via sklar theorem for a theoretical introduction to copulas see nelsen 2006 joe 2014 durante and sempi 2015 for a practical approach see salvadori et al 2007 in this study x and y represent flood peaks and flood volumes the link between f c and marginal distributions is provided by eq 1 if f x x and f y y are continuous then c is unique 1 f x y c θ n u v c θ n f x η n x x f y η n y y where θ n η n x and η n y are parameters of copula functions and marginal distribution functions in a service year n within a design life period n many approaches are available to select an appropriate copula function for example the cramér von mises statistic and the xv cic criterion the p value for cramér von mises statistic can be estimated using a bootstrapping method berg 2009 genest et al 2009 many copula functions should be tested to select the best one if p values of tested copula functions are higher than a significance level of interest the copula functions are not admissible after selections of admissible ones other criteria such as the xv cic criterion can be used to select the best one 2 2 expected total cost in a bivariate case an event can be defined as critical if either one of two flood variables exceeds a design flood threshold or if both flood variables are larger than design flood thresholds for a general approach formulation and discussion of multivariate hazard scenarios see salvadori et al 2016 in this work a kendall approach is adopted salvadori and de michele 2010 salvadori et al 2011 gräler et al 2013 the kendall function is defined as follows 2 k t θ n p c θ n u v t and a bivariate return period is defined as 3 t 1 λ 1 k t θ n 1 λ 1 p c θ n u v t where λ is the average number of extreme floods per year the return periods based on the kendall function give a mean inter arrival time estimate of events occurring in a dangerous region identified by a probability level t thus it provides a consistent notion of multivariate return periods analogous to the one used in univariate cases gräler et al 2013 salvadori et al 2016 it is assumed that construction cost cc and damage cost dc functions are linear botto et al 2014 qi et al 2016a and proportionally increase with a probability level t 4 cc m t 5 dc d 0 d t t if t t dc 0 if t t where m d 0 and d are parameters t represents a probability level of design floods in eq 4 cc equals 0 when t 0 eq 5 indicates dc equals 0 when t is smaller than a design flood probability level t d 0 represents a constant value and is the minimum damage cost for all probability levels t t as suggested by botto et al 2014 d 0 can be set to be 0 when calculating expected bivariate total cost as it is not affected by a probability level t t and d is obtained through linearly fitting the damage function to damage data using levels of copula isolines more complex non linear damage functions can be transformed to linear functions through truncating the first order in a taylor series botto et al 2014 expected non stationary bivariate total cost is defined by summing up cc and expected damage cost δ dc t θ n d as below 6 δ c total t θ n m d m t θ n δ dc t θ n d m t θ n λ t θ n 1 d t θ n t θ n k t θ n d t where k t θ n is the probability density function of the kendall function k t θ n δ dc t d is decreasing with an increase in design flood values the larger the design flood values the smaller the expected damage values caused by floods with magnitudes higher than design floods botto et al 2014 qi et al 2016a the derivative of the expected bivariate total cost with respect to t θ n is expressed as 7 d δ c total t θ n m d d t θ n m d λ t θ n k t θ n d λ t θ n k t θ n 1 t θ n k t θ n d t θ n the following equation can be obtained by setting eq 7 to 0 8 m d λ t θ n 1 k t θ n d t θ n m d λ k 1 k t θ n m d λ 1 k t θ n 0 further simplifying eq 8 using eq 3 a deterministic relationship among m d and a bivariate return period t t θ n under the linear cost and damage assumptions can be obtained 9 d m 1 λ 1 k t θ n t t θ n when annual maximum am data is used λ equals one year in eq 9 as t t θ n is known either m or d can be calculated when one is known 2 3 selecting design floods the t t year design variables correspond to the minimum values of δ c total in eq 6 which is a function of t and service year n thus the minimum values of δ c total can be a criterion to select t t year design variables 10 t n t arg min t 0 1 δ c total t θ n m d to uniquely select a design variable pair the maximum probability density criterion salvadori et al 2011 gräler et al 2013 which corresponds to the most likely design realization could be used 11 u v n arg max u v ζ t n t c θ n f θ n u v where f θ n is the density of c θ n ζ t n t c θ n represents an isoline where c θ n t n t with a predefined design life period n e g 100 years the extreme flood values with a return period t can be calculated based on inversions of the marginal distribution functions 12 x n t f x η n x 1 u y n t f y η n y 1 v therefore the t year design floods within a design life period n can be represented as 13 q t x 1 t y 1 t x 2 t y 2 t x n 1 t y n 1 t x n t y n t the design floods within n have equal weights therefore empirical copula values of t year flood pairs within q t can be calculated as follows 14 r n t number of pairs x t y t with x t x n t y t y n t n 1 where x n t and y n t represent t year flood peak and volume values in ascending order the total risk of a design flood pair is defined as the maximum probability of exceedance as below acknowledging the fact that the calculations of copula probability are not dependent on marginal probability distributions 15 risk n 1 t n t 1 r n t where 1 t n t terms copula risk since it is based on copula functions 1 r n t terms marginal risk since it is based on t year flood pairs there are four types of relationships between risk and expected total cost based on eq 15 as show in fig 2 fig 2a and c correspond to cases that marginal risk and copula risk have different changing tendencies and fig 2b and d represent cases that they have the same changing tendencies as a result three criteria t n t u v n and risk n have to be used together to uniquely select a design flood peak and volume pair the design floods with minimum risk calculated using eq 15 which refers to the maximum probability of exceedance can be calculated as below 16 n arg min 1 n n risk n q t x n t y n t in the cases of fig 2b and d the design flood selection approach is similar to the method developed by rootzén and katz 2013 since copula risk and marginal risk have the same changing tendencies 3 study area and data the biliu basin in northeast china is used to illustrate application of the proposed new approach biliu is a medium sized basin with a catchment area of 2814 km2 and is characterized by a temperate monsoon marine climate the daily flow records are from 1958 to 2011 54 years at the biliu gauge of the biliu basin the annual maximum am data including flood peak data and 3 day flood volume data were used in this study the flood peaks and 3 day flood volumes do not necessarily belong to the same flood events according to the chinese hydraulic design code water resources and hydropower planning and design institute 1993 the use of the data is because the biliu reservoir was designed on the basis of flood peaks and 3 day flood volumes 4 results and discussion 4 1 non stationarity of observed data fig 3 shows time series plots of am peaks and 3 day flood volumes the green lines represent linear trends p values are also shown for mann kendall tests of rejecting the linear trends at a significance level of 05 decreasing trends are observed in the biliu basin with p values being 8 09 10 4 and 2 88 10 4 for peaks and 3 day flood volumes respectively therefore the trends are significant and the non stationary cost benefit based bivariate extreme flood estimation approach has to be implemented 4 2 non stationarity of probability distribution parameters it is difficult to ensure data within a moving time window is stationary if too much data is included and if data in a time window is too little estimated parameter values may have large uncertainties hansen et al 2012 used 30 year time moving window to analysis changes in global temperatures donat and alexander 2012 implemented two 30 year periods to study probability changes of global daytime and night time temperatures fischer et al 2013 implemented a 30 year period to project extreme temperatures and heavy precipitation intensity seidou et al 2006 suggested 30 40 years data could be enough to estimate flood frequency with a fair precision on the basis of these previous studies 40 year moving time windows are used in this study there are a few approaches to select an appropriate probability distribution for annual maximum data for example the anderson darling a d test and the kolmogorov smirnov ks test palynchuk and guo 2008 calenda et al 2009 haddad and rahman 2010 the null hypothesis is that data follows a specified distribution this hypothesis is rejected at a chosen significance level if test statistics are greater than relevant critical values in this study the non stationary generalized extreme value gev distribution is selected as it has been commonly implemented in extreme flood estimation 17 f q exp 1 k z 1 k k t 0 exp exp z k t 0 z q μ t σ t where k σ t 0 and μ t are shape scale and location parameters respectively the a d and ks test results are shown in fig 4 for the non stationary gev distribution the x axis represents the last year of each 40 year moving time window the maximum likelihood ml method was used to estimate distribution parameter values it should be noted that critical values of the a d test vary with probability distribution types distribution parameters and significance levels d agostino and stephens 1986 table 4 32 introduced two approaches to calculate the critical values empirical distribution function based approach stephens 1974 1976 1977 1979 ahmad et al 1988 and normalized spacing based approach lockhart et al 1986b it is argued that the latter is better than the former as it does not depend on a specific parameter estimation method lockhart et al 1986a according to d agostino and stephens 1986 table 4 32 the critical value for gev based on the normalized spacing approach is 1 957 at a significance level of 05 for the ks test the critical value is 0 18 at a significance level of 05 these critical values are used as other statistics available for three parameter distributions are not reliable laio 2004 it can be seen that the gev distribution pass the tests in every 40 year moving time window there are uncertainties in distribution parameter value estimation because of limited length of the am data for considering the parameter uncertainties parameter uncertainty bounds should be calculated in this study 95 confidence intervals of the gev parameters are estimated along with application of the ml method to parameter value estimation in addition to extrapolate the parameter values to future a function is needed to fit the changing trends cheng and aghakouchak 2014 used a linear function to represent changes of gev location parameter with time mudersbach and jensen 2010 and sarhadi et al 2016b also implemented linear functions to study non stationary extreme coastal water levels and drought with gev location parameter linearly changing with time adlouni et al 2007 implemented exponential and linear distributions to represent changes of scale and location parameters with time similar to these studies in this research exponential and linear functions are implemented to fit the trends of scale and location parameters and to extrapolate to future time within a design life period e g 100 years in this study fig 5 shows time dependent parameter values of the non stationary gev distribution the green lines the red dashed lines show 95 confidence intervals and changing trends are represented using the solid red lines the mann kendall approach is used to test significance of the changing trends at a significance level of 05 for the scale parameter fig 5a there is a decreasing trend which is significant according to the mann kendall test result similarly the location parameter of flood peaks and the scale and location parameters of 3 day flood volumes also show significant decreasing trends in addition it can be seen that the estimated uncertainty intervals are acceptable with most of the parameter values being bracketed these parameter intervals are employed to interpolate to future to represent parameter estimation uncertainties table 1 shows p values of six copula functions in each 40 year moving time window at a significance level of 05 for the gumbel copula it can be seen that most of the p values are not larger than 05 except for 2004 and 2005 moving windows therefore the gumbel copula should not be implemented similarly survival clayton is not admissible as well however the clayton survival gumbel t student and frank copulas are admissible the xv cic values are shown in table 2 it can be seen that the clayton copula has the highest values thus the clayton copula is selected in this study fig 6 a and b shows the kendall s τ coefficients tau and corresponding p values for each of the 40 year moving time window at a significance level of 05 fig 6a shows tau values are increasing implying the dependence between flood peaks and 3 day flood volumes becomes stronger fig 6b shows the p values are smaller than 05 fig 6c shows time dependent parameter values of the clayton copula and the parameter values range from 11 76 to 14 40 it can be seen that there is an increasing trend for the copula parameter values in addition the estimated 95 confidence interval is acceptable bracketing most of the parameter values the parameter interval is interpolated to future within a design life period to represent the copula parameter uncertainty 4 3 non stationary cost benefit analysis approach for extreme flood estimation fig 7 shows results of the non stationary cost benefit analysis approach for 500 year return period flood estimation and comparison with results of stationary approaches the filled circles represent 500 year return period flood estimation to consider influences of parameter sampling numbers two settings are shown for example 40 2000 represents the moving time window is 40 year and 2000 parameter sets are sampled within the parameter uncertain intervals the latin hypercube sampling approach is implemented in this study to sample parameter values from their uncertain bounds tang et al 2007 fu et al 2011 2012 zhang et al 2013 the posterior probability is calculated according to the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue approach beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 which is equivalent to an importance sampling approach nott et al 2012 fig 7a shows expected total cost is increasing with an increase in the service time in contrast the stationary approach generates only one expected total cost curve and therefore only one 500 year isoline is obtained 0 9811 the differences result from non stationarity of the observed discharges indicating that non stationarity can lead to very different estimation results thus it is necessary to consider non stationarity in the cost benefit based extreme flood estimation compared with fig 7a fig 7b shows similar results even though the parameter sampling number is different fig 7b uses a larger parameter sampling number i e 4000 than fig 7a indicating that the used 2000 parameter sets in fig 7a are enough the increasing expected total cost may result from the consideration of the dependence between flood peaks and 3 day flood volumes when service year increases the dependence is increasing recall fig 6c and therefore the 500 year extreme flood peaks and 3 day flood volumes tend to happen together their negative influence tends to overlap fig 8 shows 500 year floods calculated using the non stationary approach within a 100 year design life period it can be seen that non stationary results using 2000 parameter value samples show a decreasing trend fig 8a and b similarly results using 4000 parameter value samples also show a decreasing trend the 500 year floods of the two cases are the same compared with the non stationary results the stationary approach generates a constant value within the design life period resulting from the only one expected total cost curve fig 7 and cannot represent the trends shown in fig 2 thus the non stationary approach is much more appropriate and can provide changing design values in various service time which enables a better understanding of changing flood magnitudes and more flexible decision makings to adapt to the non stationarity fig 9 shows the changes of risk with expected total cost of the 500 year floods for the 40 2000 case it can be seen that the copula risk is decreasing with increased service time whereas marginal risk is increasing the total risk is decreasing with increased expected total cost first and then increasing this result is due to the different changing patterns of copula isolines and estimated design floods expected total cost is increasing with increased service year fig 7 levels of copula isolines are increasing with increased expected total cost which indicates risk is decreasing design flood estimation is decreasing with increased service year fig 8 which indicates risk is increasing thus the overall risk calculated using eq 15 has a u shape the design flood estimation corresponding to the minimum risk should be selected i e the filled triangles there are two steps to obtain the 500 year design flood values first obtain the design life period corresponding to the filled triangles in fig 9 second from the results in fig 8 select the design flood values corresponding to the obtained design life period compared with fig 9a the 40 4000 case shows the same results implying the used 2000 parameter samples are enough table 3 shows the 500 year flood estimation using different approaches maximum represents the maximum values shown in fig 8 using an approach developed by rootzén and katz 2013 constant copula represents results that the maximum design flood values within design life periods are selected when non stationarity of marginal distribution parameter values are considered and copula parameter values are considered stationary ffa represents results of traditional stationary flood frequency analysis approach analyzing flood peaks and flood volumes separately uncode represents stationary cost benefit based design flood estimation approach without considering the dependence of flood peaks and volumes botto et al 2014 qi et al 2016a compared with stationary approaches i e ffa and uncode design flood estimation of nscobe is at least 70 1 and 69 7 smaller for flood peaks and flood volumes respectively compared with other non stationary approaches that only consider risk calculating from marginal distributions i e maximum and constant copula nscobe results are also smaller at least 43 3 and 50 4 smaller for flood peaks and flood volumes these results indicate that the stationary approaches and semi nonstationary methods i e maximum and constant copula approaches could result in very different design flood estimation from nscobe and therefore non stationaries in both copula functions and marginal distributions should be considered 4 4 discussion compared with previous research on cost benefit based flood frequency analysis botto et al 2014 qi et al 2016a qi 2017 the developed approach in this study can consider non stationarities in both the dependence of flood variables and the parameter values of marginal distributions specifically the developed approach by qi 2017 is applicable to cost benefit based univariant flood frequency analysis i e only considering the non stationarity of marginal probability distribution parameters the developed approach in this study provides service time dependent design flood estimation and expected total cost estimation which are beyond the information that can be shown in the previous studies the developed new approach in this paper represents a state of the art progress in flood frequency analysis in a cost benefit framework considering non stationarities in both flood variable dependence and marginal distributions in recent years a design life criterion is proposed by combining maximum probability of exceedance and maximum flood magnitudes rootzén and katz 2013 however this criterion is not suitable to nscobe since it ignores time changing dependence of flood variables in this paper the risk is calculated on the basis of both marginal probability distributions and copula functions considering their non stationarities and selects design floods with minimum risk within a design life period the developed nscobe approach extends the univariate cost benefit analysis approaches developed by botto et al 2014 qi et al 2016a and qi 2017 and it provides a new dimension to the current efforts on developing multi variate approaches on the basis of flood frequency analysis e g salvadori et al 2011 by integrating the multi variate analysis into the cost benefit analysis framework as cost benefit analysis is widely used for engineering planning and design problems in practice the new approach could be easily accepted and adopted by practical engineers for design flood estimation research has suggested that kendall function represents a multivariate approach because it is a multidimensional probability integral transform genest et al 2006 salvadori and de michele 2010 and is a basic tool for copula based definition of return periods for multivariate cases salvadori 2004 salvadori and de michele 2004 salvadori et al 2007 durante and salvadori 2010 salvadori et al 2011 thus this research is a multivariate analog of univariate cost benefit analysis and furthers the research by botto et al 2014 qi et al 2016a and qi 2017 to multivariate cases which represents a progress in cost benefit based flood frequency analysis because the design flood selection approach is similar to the method developed by rootzén and katz 2013 in the cases of fig 2b and d this study is carried out in the cases of fig 2a and d copula risk and marginal risk have different changing tendencies although in this study the proposed approach is illustrated with an analysis of flood peak and flood volume data in a river basin with decreasing runoff magnitude the application of the developed approach is not restricted to bivariate cases the proposed approach is applicable to multivariate cases as well for example in a case of three variables flood peaks flood volumes and flood duration in addition although 40 year moving time windows are used to illustrate the application in this study the application of nscobe is not limited to 40 year moving time windows the comparison among stationary semi stationary and nscobe in this study may not be identical in other regions for example the results may be changed when trends of observed discharges are different however the proposed nscobe approach is applicable when different datasets are used the aim of this paper to introduce the nscobe approach and therefore the uncertainties in the moving time windows are not considered it should be noted that a univariate approach should not be used when multiple deign variables are strongly related and required in a hydraulic infrastructure design although the used case study data has a kendall s τ coefficient of 0 88 the results from the bivariate approach are very different from the univariate approach recall the results in table 3 therefore the application of nscobe to the study region in this paper is acceptable it should be noted that the changing trends of observed runoff are assumed to continue in the future in this study in practical applications to reduce the influence of this assumption design floods need to be reevaluated regularly after initial estimation and measures should be taken if design floods change for example increasing the height of a dam if initial estimation of design floods are smaller than reevaluation results for the developed nscobe approach to reduce the influence nscobe also needs to be re applied regularly to estimate design floods and measures should be taken to reinforce hydraulic infrastructures if design flood magnitudes increase although gev is used to illustrate the developed approach nscobe is not restricted to gev distribution and other probability distributions can be utilized as well the biliu reservoir in the study area is a medium sized reservoir and is designed on the basis of 500 year return period floods considering the size of the reservoir and the high design standard of the reservoir a 100 year design life period was utilized in this study however the developed approach does not depend on design life periods used and is applicable for various design life periods the flood damage data is provided by the biliu reservoir administration the data was obtained based on survey results in the downstream with a damage value up to 889 89 104 which corresponds to an extreme flood with a 50 year return period although six copula functions are considered in this study and the clayton copula is implemented in the application in biliu basin the nscobe approach is applicable even when utilized copula functions are changed and other copula functions could be utilized as well such as the non parametric copula functions developed by bedford et al 2016 5 conclusions this paper presents a state of the art progress to investigate impacts of non stationarity of dependent flood variables on estimated extreme flood values with a return period of interest the major contributions of this study are presented as follows first a non stationary cost benefit based bivariate design flood estimation approach nscobe is developed this approach considers non stationarities in both marginal probability distributions and copula functions in a cost benefit framework and therefore influence of the non stationarities on design flood estimation can be quantified second risk is calculated based on non stationarities in both the dependence of flood variables quantified using copula functions and the marginal distributions therefore the risk calculations are more comprehensive considering the varying changing patterns in copula functions and marginal distributions third trade offs are found in risk estimation between copula functions and marginal distributions this result implies copula risk may be decreasing increasing with increasing decreasing marginal risk thus it is necessary to calculate copula risk and marginal risk separately uncertainties in flood data selection probability distributions and distribution parameter estimation have influence on design flood estimation and therefore future research is encouraged to consider the uncertainties in the new approach acknowledgements this study was supported by the national key research and development program

7510,cost benefit analysis and flood frequency analysis have been integrated into a comprehensive framework to estimate cost effective design values however previous cost benefit based extreme flood estimation is based on stationary assumptions and analyze dependent flood variables separately a non stationary cost benefit based bivariate design flood estimation nscobe approach is developed in this study to investigate influence of non stationarities in both the dependence of flood variables and the marginal distributions on extreme flood estimation the dependence is modeled utilizing copula functions previous design flood selection criteria are not suitable for nscobe since they ignore time changing dependence of flood variables therefore a risk calculation approach is proposed based on non stationarities in both marginal probability distributions and copula functions a case study with 54 year observed data is utilized to illustrate the application of nscobe results show nscobe can effectively integrate non stationarities in both copula functions and marginal distributions into cost benefit based design flood estimation it is also found that there is a trade off between maximum probability of exceedance calculated from copula functions and marginal distributions this study for the first time provides a new approach towards a better understanding of influence of non stationarities in both copula functions and marginal distributions on extreme flood estimation and could be beneficial to cost benefit based non stationary bivariate design flood estimation

two key issues in design flood estimation milly et al 2008 strupczewski et al 2009 bender et al 2014 in ffa influence of non stationarity on extreme flood estimation has been investigated by many studies olsen et al 1998 villarini et al 2009 bender et al 2014 qi et al 2016b read and vogel 2016 regarding dependence in design variables efforts have been made to investigate its influence for example return period definition salvadori and de michele 2010 salvadori et al 2011 salvadori et al 2013 design hydrograph estimation gräler et al 2013 candela et al 2014 mojca et al 2015 hydrologic dam design klein et al 2010 requena et al 2013 structure based framework for hydraulic design volpi and fiori 2014 salvadori et al 2015 flow distribution estimation from climatic variables xiong et al 2014 modelling uncertainty of flood quantiles in ungauged sites santillán et al 2014 grimaldi et al 2016 and non stationary design flood estimation bender et al 2014 cong et al 2015 copula functions were commonly utilized in the prior studies to represent dependence between design variables salvadori and de michele 2004 genest and favre 2007 salvadori and de michele 2010 salvadori et al 2011 gräler et al 2013 salvadori et al 2013 fu and butler 2014 in cost benefit based extreme flood estimation approaches previous studies have been based on stationary approaches botto et al 2014 qi et al 2016a recently qi 2017 developed a non stationary cost benefit based extreme flood estimation method however this new non stationary method is based on univariate analysis the univariate approach is adequate when only one variable is significant in a design process but cannot provide a complete assessment of occurrence probabilities of design floods callau poduje et al 2014 even worse the use of a number of variables viz a multivariate approach where possible dependencies are not correctly assessed e g the variables are considered as independent when they are not may yield fake estimates of the design values see e g the case study presented in salvadori et al 2015 hydraulic structure design is usually based on full hydrograph which is characterized by flood peak and volume renard and lang 2007 callau poduje et al 2014 parent et al 2014 and these two variables are usually dependent salvadori and de michele 2004 thus it is necessary to develop a non stationary cost benefit based bivariate extreme flood estimation approach however to the best of the authors knowledge such an approach has not been developed the overall objective of this paper is to develop a non stationary cost benefit based bivariate design flood estimation nscobe approach this approach can consider non stationaries in both copula functions and marginal distributions in a framework integrating cost benefit analysis and copula functions a river basin with 54 year discharge data is used to illustrate applications of nscobe six copula functions are tested to select the best one based on the cramér von mises statistic and the cross validation copula information criterion xv cic gronneberg and hjort 2014 these copula functions are gumbel clayton survival gumbel survival clayton frank and t student in this paper there are three advancements from the present state of knowledge first a non stationary cost benefit based bivariate design flood estimation approach is developed second a risk calculation approach is proposed based on non stationarities in both copula functions and marginal distributions third trade offs are found in risk estimation between copula functions and marginal distributions here the risk refers to the probability of exceedance not potential damage which has also been utilized in previous research e g rootzén and katz 2013 aghakouchak et al 2014 condon et al 2015 sarhadi et al 2016a this study provides a new approach towards a better understanding of the influence of non stationarity on design flood estimation involving multiple design flood variables 2 the nscobe approach fig 1 shows the flowchart of the nscobe approach it includes three main steps 1 test significance of non stationarity of observed data and select copula and marginal distribution functions if non stationarity is significant 2 calculate expected total cost criterion values on the basis of a return period of interest which includes the expected flood damage cost and construction cost 3 select design variables on the basis of calculated risk and the maximum probability criterion fig 1 shows the flowchart of the developed nscobe approach details of the proposed new approach are explained in the remainder of this section 2 1 selecting copula functions when there are two dependent variables joint cumulative distributions f is defined based on marginal distributions u f x x and v f y y and a copula c via sklar theorem for a theoretical introduction to copulas see nelsen 2006 joe 2014 durante and sempi 2015 for a practical approach see salvadori et al 2007 in this study x and y represent flood peaks and flood volumes the link between f c and marginal distributions is provided by eq 1 if f x x and f y y are continuous then c is unique 1 f x y c θ n u v c θ n f x η n x x f y η n y y where θ n η n x and η n y are parameters of copula functions and marginal distribution functions in a service year n within a design life period n many approaches are available to select an appropriate copula function for example the cramér von mises statistic and the xv cic criterion the p value for cramér von mises statistic can be estimated using a bootstrapping method berg 2009 genest et al 2009 many copula functions should be tested to select the best one if p values of tested copula functions are higher than a significance level of interest the copula functions are not admissible after selections of admissible ones other criteria such as the xv cic criterion can be used to select the best one 2 2 expected total cost in a bivariate case an event can be defined as critical if either one of two flood variables exceeds a design flood threshold or if both flood variables are larger than design flood thresholds for a general approach formulation and discussion of multivariate hazard scenarios see salvadori et al 2016 in this work a kendall approach is adopted salvadori and de michele 2010 salvadori et al 2011 gräler et al 2013 the kendall function is defined as follows 2 k t θ n p c θ n u v t and a bivariate return period is defined as 3 t 1 λ 1 k t θ n 1 λ 1 p c θ n u v t where λ is the average number of extreme floods per year the return periods based on the kendall function give a mean inter arrival time estimate of events occurring in a dangerous region identified by a probability level t thus it provides a consistent notion of multivariate return periods analogous to the one used in univariate cases gräler et al 2013 salvadori et al 2016 it is assumed that construction cost cc and damage cost dc functions are linear botto et al 2014 qi et al 2016a and proportionally increase with a probability level t 4 cc m t 5 dc d 0 d t t if t t dc 0 if t t where m d 0 and d are parameters t represents a probability level of design floods in eq 4 cc equals 0 when t 0 eq 5 indicates dc equals 0 when t is smaller than a design flood probability level t d 0 represents a constant value and is the minimum damage cost for all probability levels t t as suggested by botto et al 2014 d 0 can be set to be 0 when calculating expected bivariate total cost as it is not affected by a probability level t t and d is obtained through linearly fitting the damage function to damage data using levels of copula isolines more complex non linear damage functions can be transformed to linear functions through truncating the first order in a taylor series botto et al 2014 expected non stationary bivariate total cost is defined by summing up cc and expected damage cost δ dc t θ n d as below 6 δ c total t θ n m d m t θ n δ dc t θ n d m t θ n λ t θ n 1 d t θ n t θ n k t θ n d t where k t θ n is the probability density function of the kendall function k t θ n δ dc t d is decreasing with an increase in design flood values the larger the design flood values the smaller the expected damage values caused by floods with magnitudes higher than design floods botto et al 2014 qi et al 2016a the derivative of the expected bivariate total cost with respect to t θ n is expressed as 7 d δ c total t θ n m d d t θ n m d λ t θ n k t θ n d λ t θ n k t θ n 1 t θ n k t θ n d t θ n the following equation can be obtained by setting eq 7 to 0 8 m d λ t θ n 1 k t θ n d t θ n m d λ k 1 k t θ n m d λ 1 k t θ n 0 further simplifying eq 8 using eq 3 a deterministic relationship among m d and a bivariate return period t t θ n under the linear cost and damage assumptions can be obtained 9 d m 1 λ 1 k t θ n t t θ n when annual maximum am data is used λ equals one year in eq 9 as t t θ n is known either m or d can be calculated when one is known 2 3 selecting design floods the t t year design variables correspond to the minimum values of δ c total in eq 6 which is a function of t and service year n thus the minimum values of δ c total can be a criterion to select t t year design variables 10 t n t arg min t 0 1 δ c total t θ n m d to uniquely select a design variable pair the maximum probability density criterion salvadori et al 2011 gräler et al 2013 which corresponds to the most likely design realization could be used 11 u v n arg max u v ζ t n t c θ n f θ n u v where f θ n is the density of c θ n ζ t n t c θ n represents an isoline where c θ n t n t with a predefined design life period n e g 100 years the extreme flood values with a return period t can be calculated based on inversions of the marginal distribution functions 12 x n t f x η n x 1 u y n t f y η n y 1 v therefore the t year design floods within a design life period n can be represented as 13 q t x 1 t y 1 t x 2 t y 2 t x n 1 t y n 1 t x n t y n t the design floods within n have equal weights therefore empirical copula values of t year flood pairs within q t can be calculated as follows 14 r n t number of pairs x t y t with x t x n t y t y n t n 1 where x n t and y n t represent t year flood peak and volume values in ascending order the total risk of a design flood pair is defined as the maximum probability of exceedance as below acknowledging the fact that the calculations of copula probability are not dependent on marginal probability distributions 15 risk n 1 t n t 1 r n t where 1 t n t terms copula risk since it is based on copula functions 1 r n t terms marginal risk since it is based on t year flood pairs there are four types of relationships between risk and expected total cost based on eq 15 as show in fig 2 fig 2a and c correspond to cases that marginal risk and copula risk have different changing tendencies and fig 2b and d represent cases that they have the same changing tendencies as a result three criteria t n t u v n and risk n have to be used together to uniquely select a design flood peak and volume pair the design floods with minimum risk calculated using eq 15 which refers to the maximum probability of exceedance can be calculated as below 16 n arg min 1 n n risk n q t x n t y n t in the cases of fig 2b and d the design flood selection approach is similar to the method developed by rootzén and katz 2013 since copula risk and marginal risk have the same changing tendencies 3 study area and data the biliu basin in northeast china is used to illustrate application of the proposed new approach biliu is a medium sized basin with a catchment area of 2814 km2 and is characterized by a temperate monsoon marine climate the daily flow records are from 1958 to 2011 54 years at the biliu gauge of the biliu basin the annual maximum am data including flood peak data and 3 day flood volume data were used in this study the flood peaks and 3 day flood volumes do not necessarily belong to the same flood events according to the chinese hydraulic design code water resources and hydropower planning and design institute 1993 the use of the data is because the biliu reservoir was designed on the basis of flood peaks and 3 day flood volumes 4 results and discussion 4 1 non stationarity of observed data fig 3 shows time series plots of am peaks and 3 day flood volumes the green lines represent linear trends p values are also shown for mann kendall tests of rejecting the linear trends at a significance level of 05 decreasing trends are observed in the biliu basin with p values being 8 09 10 4 and 2 88 10 4 for peaks and 3 day flood volumes respectively therefore the trends are significant and the non stationary cost benefit based bivariate extreme flood estimation approach has to be implemented 4 2 non stationarity of probability distribution parameters it is difficult to ensure data within a moving time window is stationary if too much data is included and if data in a time window is too little estimated parameter values may have large uncertainties hansen et al 2012 used 30 year time moving window to analysis changes in global temperatures donat and alexander 2012 implemented two 30 year periods to study probability changes of global daytime and night time temperatures fischer et al 2013 implemented a 30 year period to project extreme temperatures and heavy precipitation intensity seidou et al 2006 suggested 30 40 years data could be enough to estimate flood frequency with a fair precision on the basis of these previous studies 40 year moving time windows are used in this study there are a few approaches to select an appropriate probability distribution for annual maximum data for example the anderson darling a d test and the kolmogorov smirnov ks test palynchuk and guo 2008 calenda et al 2009 haddad and rahman 2010 the null hypothesis is that data follows a specified distribution this hypothesis is rejected at a chosen significance level if test statistics are greater than relevant critical values in this study the non stationary generalized extreme value gev distribution is selected as it has been commonly implemented in extreme flood estimation 17 f q exp 1 k z 1 k k t 0 exp exp z k t 0 z q μ t σ t where k σ t 0 and μ t are shape scale and location parameters respectively the a d and ks test results are shown in fig 4 for the non stationary gev distribution the x axis represents the last year of each 40 year moving time window the maximum likelihood ml method was used to estimate distribution parameter values it should be noted that critical values of the a d test vary with probability distribution types distribution parameters and significance levels d agostino and stephens 1986 table 4 32 introduced two approaches to calculate the critical values empirical distribution function based approach stephens 1974 1976 1977 1979 ahmad et al 1988 and normalized spacing based approach lockhart et al 1986b it is argued that the latter is better than the former as it does not depend on a specific parameter estimation method lockhart et al 1986a according to d agostino and stephens 1986 table 4 32 the critical value for gev based on the normalized spacing approach is 1 957 at a significance level of 05 for the ks test the critical value is 0 18 at a significance level of 05 these critical values are used as other statistics available for three parameter distributions are not reliable laio 2004 it can be seen that the gev distribution pass the tests in every 40 year moving time window there are uncertainties in distribution parameter value estimation because of limited length of the am data for considering the parameter uncertainties parameter uncertainty bounds should be calculated in this study 95 confidence intervals of the gev parameters are estimated along with application of the ml method to parameter value estimation in addition to extrapolate the parameter values to future a function is needed to fit the changing trends cheng and aghakouchak 2014 used a linear function to represent changes of gev location parameter with time mudersbach and jensen 2010 and sarhadi et al 2016b also implemented linear functions to study non stationary extreme coastal water levels and drought with gev location parameter linearly changing with time adlouni et al 2007 implemented exponential and linear distributions to represent changes of scale and location parameters with time similar to these studies in this research exponential and linear functions are implemented to fit the trends of scale and location parameters and to extrapolate to future time within a design life period e g 100 years in this study fig 5 shows time dependent parameter values of the non stationary gev distribution the green lines the red dashed lines show 95 confidence intervals and changing trends are represented using the solid red lines the mann kendall approach is used to test significance of the changing trends at a significance level of 05 for the scale parameter fig 5a there is a decreasing trend which is significant according to the mann kendall test result similarly the location parameter of flood peaks and the scale and location parameters of 3 day flood volumes also show significant decreasing trends in addition it can be seen that the estimated uncertainty intervals are acceptable with most of the parameter values being bracketed these parameter intervals are employed to interpolate to future to represent parameter estimation uncertainties table 1 shows p values of six copula functions in each 40 year moving time window at a significance level of 05 for the gumbel copula it can be seen that most of the p values are not larger than 05 except for 2004 and 2005 moving windows therefore the gumbel copula should not be implemented similarly survival clayton is not admissible as well however the clayton survival gumbel t student and frank copulas are admissible the xv cic values are shown in table 2 it can be seen that the clayton copula has the highest values thus the clayton copula is selected in this study fig 6 a and b shows the kendall s τ coefficients tau and corresponding p values for each of the 40 year moving time window at a significance level of 05 fig 6a shows tau values are increasing implying the dependence between flood peaks and 3 day flood volumes becomes stronger fig 6b shows the p values are smaller than 05 fig 6c shows time dependent parameter values of the clayton copula and the parameter values range from 11 76 to 14 40 it can be seen that there is an increasing trend for the copula parameter values in addition the estimated 95 confidence interval is acceptable bracketing most of the parameter values the parameter interval is interpolated to future within a design life period to represent the copula parameter uncertainty 4 3 non stationary cost benefit analysis approach for extreme flood estimation fig 7 shows results of the non stationary cost benefit analysis approach for 500 year return period flood estimation and comparison with results of stationary approaches the filled circles represent 500 year return period flood estimation to consider influences of parameter sampling numbers two settings are shown for example 40 2000 represents the moving time window is 40 year and 2000 parameter sets are sampled within the parameter uncertain intervals the latin hypercube sampling approach is implemented in this study to sample parameter values from their uncertain bounds tang et al 2007 fu et al 2011 2012 zhang et al 2013 the posterior probability is calculated according to the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue approach beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 which is equivalent to an importance sampling approach nott et al 2012 fig 7a shows expected total cost is increasing with an increase in the service time in contrast the stationary approach generates only one expected total cost curve and therefore only one 500 year isoline is obtained 0 9811 the differences result from non stationarity of the observed discharges indicating that non stationarity can lead to very different estimation results thus it is necessary to consider non stationarity in the cost benefit based extreme flood estimation compared with fig 7a fig 7b shows similar results even though the parameter sampling number is different fig 7b uses a larger parameter sampling number i e 4000 than fig 7a indicating that the used 2000 parameter sets in fig 7a are enough the increasing expected total cost may result from the consideration of the dependence between flood peaks and 3 day flood volumes when service year increases the dependence is increasing recall fig 6c and therefore the 500 year extreme flood peaks and 3 day flood volumes tend to happen together their negative influence tends to overlap fig 8 shows 500 year floods calculated using the non stationary approach within a 100 year design life period it can be seen that non stationary results using 2000 parameter value samples show a decreasing trend fig 8a and b similarly results using 4000 parameter value samples also show a decreasing trend the 500 year floods of the two cases are the same compared with the non stationary results the stationary approach generates a constant value within the design life period resulting from the only one expected total cost curve fig 7 and cannot represent the trends shown in fig 2 thus the non stationary approach is much more appropriate and can provide changing design values in various service time which enables a better understanding of changing flood magnitudes and more flexible decision makings to adapt to the non stationarity fig 9 shows the changes of risk with expected total cost of the 500 year floods for the 40 2000 case it can be seen that the copula risk is decreasing with increased service time whereas marginal risk is increasing the total risk is decreasing with increased expected total cost first and then increasing this result is due to the different changing patterns of copula isolines and estimated design floods expected total cost is increasing with increased service year fig 7 levels of copula isolines are increasing with increased expected total cost which indicates risk is decreasing design flood estimation is decreasing with increased service year fig 8 which indicates risk is increasing thus the overall risk calculated using eq 15 has a u shape the design flood estimation corresponding to the minimum risk should be selected i e the filled triangles there are two steps to obtain the 500 year design flood values first obtain the design life period corresponding to the filled triangles in fig 9 second from the results in fig 8 select the design flood values corresponding to the obtained design life period compared with fig 9a the 40 4000 case shows the same results implying the used 2000 parameter samples are enough table 3 shows the 500 year flood estimation using different approaches maximum represents the maximum values shown in fig 8 using an approach developed by rootzén and katz 2013 constant copula represents results that the maximum design flood values within design life periods are selected when non stationarity of marginal distribution parameter values are considered and copula parameter values are considered stationary ffa represents results of traditional stationary flood frequency analysis approach analyzing flood peaks and flood volumes separately uncode represents stationary cost benefit based design flood estimation approach without considering the dependence of flood peaks and volumes botto et al 2014 qi et al 2016a compared with stationary approaches i e ffa and uncode design flood estimation of nscobe is at least 70 1 and 69 7 smaller for flood peaks and flood volumes respectively compared with other non stationary approaches that only consider risk calculating from marginal distributions i e maximum and constant copula nscobe results are also smaller at least 43 3 and 50 4 smaller for flood peaks and flood volumes these results indicate that the stationary approaches and semi nonstationary methods i e maximum and constant copula approaches could result in very different design flood estimation from nscobe and therefore non stationaries in both copula functions and marginal distributions should be considered 4 4 discussion compared with previous research on cost benefit based flood frequency analysis botto et al 2014 qi et al 2016a qi 2017 the developed approach in this study can consider non stationarities in both the dependence of flood variables and the parameter values of marginal distributions specifically the developed approach by qi 2017 is applicable to cost benefit based univariant flood frequency analysis i e only considering the non stationarity of marginal probability distribution parameters the developed approach in this study provides service time dependent design flood estimation and expected total cost estimation which are beyond the information that can be shown in the previous studies the developed new approach in this paper represents a state of the art progress in flood frequency analysis in a cost benefit framework considering non stationarities in both flood variable dependence and marginal distributions in recent years a design life criterion is proposed by combining maximum probability of exceedance and maximum flood magnitudes rootzén and katz 2013 however this criterion is not suitable to nscobe since it ignores time changing dependence of flood variables in this paper the risk is calculated on the basis of both marginal probability distributions and copula functions considering their non stationarities and selects design floods with minimum risk within a design life period the developed nscobe approach extends the univariate cost benefit analysis approaches developed by botto et al 2014 qi et al 2016a and qi 2017 and it provides a new dimension to the current efforts on developing multi variate approaches on the basis of flood frequency analysis e g salvadori et al 2011 by integrating the multi variate analysis into the cost benefit analysis framework as cost benefit analysis is widely used for engineering planning and design problems in practice the new approach could be easily accepted and adopted by practical engineers for design flood estimation research has suggested that kendall function represents a multivariate approach because it is a multidimensional probability integral transform genest et al 2006 salvadori and de michele 2010 and is a basic tool for copula based definition of return periods for multivariate cases salvadori 2004 salvadori and de michele 2004 salvadori et al 2007 durante and salvadori 2010 salvadori et al 2011 thus this research is a multivariate analog of univariate cost benefit analysis and furthers the research by botto et al 2014 qi et al 2016a and qi 2017 to multivariate cases which represents a progress in cost benefit based flood frequency analysis because the design flood selection approach is similar to the method developed by rootzén and katz 2013 in the cases of fig 2b and d this study is carried out in the cases of fig 2a and d copula risk and marginal risk have different changing tendencies although in this study the proposed approach is illustrated with an analysis of flood peak and flood volume data in a river basin with decreasing runoff magnitude the application of the developed approach is not restricted to bivariate cases the proposed approach is applicable to multivariate cases as well for example in a case of three variables flood peaks flood volumes and flood duration in addition although 40 year moving time windows are used to illustrate the application in this study the application of nscobe is not limited to 40 year moving time windows the comparison among stationary semi stationary and nscobe in this study may not be identical in other regions for example the results may be changed when trends of observed discharges are different however the proposed nscobe approach is applicable when different datasets are used the aim of this paper to introduce the nscobe approach and therefore the uncertainties in the moving time windows are not considered it should be noted that a univariate approach should not be used when multiple deign variables are strongly related and required in a hydraulic infrastructure design although the used case study data has a kendall s τ coefficient of 0 88 the results from the bivariate approach are very different from the univariate approach recall the results in table 3 therefore the application of nscobe to the study region in this paper is acceptable it should be noted that the changing trends of observed runoff are assumed to continue in the future in this study in practical applications to reduce the influence of this assumption design floods need to be reevaluated regularly after initial estimation and measures should be taken if design floods change for example increasing the height of a dam if initial estimation of design floods are smaller than reevaluation results for the developed nscobe approach to reduce the influence nscobe also needs to be re applied regularly to estimate design floods and measures should be taken to reinforce hydraulic infrastructures if design flood magnitudes increase although gev is used to illustrate the developed approach nscobe is not restricted to gev distribution and other probability distributions can be utilized as well the biliu reservoir in the study area is a medium sized reservoir and is designed on the basis of 500 year return period floods considering the size of the reservoir and the high design standard of the reservoir a 100 year design life period was utilized in this study however the developed approach does not depend on design life periods used and is applicable for various design life periods the flood damage data is provided by the biliu reservoir administration the data was obtained based on survey results in the downstream with a damage value up to 889 89 104 which corresponds to an extreme flood with a 50 year return period although six copula functions are considered in this study and the clayton copula is implemented in the application in biliu basin the nscobe approach is applicable even when utilized copula functions are changed and other copula functions could be utilized as well such as the non parametric copula functions developed by bedford et al 2016 5 conclusions this paper presents a state of the art progress to investigate impacts of non stationarity of dependent flood variables on estimated extreme flood values with a return period of interest the major contributions of this study are presented as follows first a non stationary cost benefit based bivariate design flood estimation approach nscobe is developed this approach considers non stationarities in both marginal probability distributions and copula functions in a cost benefit framework and therefore influence of the non stationarities on design flood estimation can be quantified second risk is calculated based on non stationarities in both the dependence of flood variables quantified using copula functions and the marginal distributions therefore the risk calculations are more comprehensive considering the varying changing patterns in copula functions and marginal distributions third trade offs are found in risk estimation between copula functions and marginal distributions this result implies copula risk may be decreasing increasing with increasing decreasing marginal risk thus it is necessary to calculate copula risk and marginal risk separately uncertainties in flood data selection probability distributions and distribution parameter estimation have influence on design flood estimation and therefore future research is encouraged to consider the uncertainties in the new approach acknowledgements this study was supported by the national key research and development program

corn and soybean for example in fact nebraska boasts the largest total of irrigated land within the coterminous united states surpassing the two largest states by area texas and california usda 2012

between irrigation and the resulting summer streamflow rate increase a long distance away has only been detected recently can partially be attributed to the about 50 increase from 23 000 to 34 000 km2 usda 2012 in irrigated land area within nebraska over the 1979 2015 period for which meteorological data exist for the present study note that any approach that requires surface flux measurements

spectroradiometer modis b not continuous e g the snap shots of landsat and land use cover maps c lead to a mismatch of scales like flux data that are valid at the plot scale and not at the regional

al 2017 this study is rather based on the latest advances crago et al 2016 szilagyi et al 2017 of the complementary relationship cr bouchet 1963 of evaporation the szilagyi et al 2017 formulation of the cr has the distinct advantage that it only requires widely available atmospheric radiation variables and it is calibration free the latter is especially valuable when the modeling period over which environmental parameters such as related to land use land cover that typically serve as boundary conditions for the model may change significantly is long thus requiring repeated recalibration or readjustment of the parameters during the model run finally the results of the present study are to be evaluated by a long term water balance approach and also compared to the widely available north american regional reanalysis narr et rates provided by the land surface model lsm mesinger et al 2006 of narr besides long term averages reliability of the annual values is to be tested with the

or longer the lower atmosphere will adjust to the moisture status of the homogeneous land crago et al 2017 the latter regulating actual et rates which then can be derived solely from atmospheric and

value of 1 15 which was kept for the present study 3 study area and data the state of nebraska lies in the central great plains with a strong gradient in mean annual precipitation from the sub humid south eastern border of more than 850 mm to less than 350 mm in the panhandle from the continental climate of the state follows the hot summers with july mean daily temperatures of 23 6 c and cold winters of 5 5 c in january frankson et al 2017 precipitation is highly variable from year to year with the statewide annual average ranging from a low of 340 mm in 2012 to a high of 900 mm in 1915 frankson et al 2017 most of the precipitation falls during the spring and summer months but seasonal precipitation varies widely frankson et al 2017 2012 was nebraska s driest year on record statewide summer precipitation averaged only 95 mm well below the historical average of 240 mm by the end of september over 75 of the state was experiencing exceptional drought conditions putting extremely high demand for irrigation water the drought combined with the extreme summer heat had significant negative impacts on non irrigated crop yields and pasture conditions frankson et al 2017 the continuous estimation of the state wide et rates via 1 7 require air ta and dew point td temperatures surface net radiation rn and 2 m wind u2 data the averages of which were supplied at a monthly time step over the 37 year period of 1979 2015 at the 4 km spatial resolution of the ta and td values coming from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 1994 the 32 km spatial resolution monthly narr lsm rn 10 m wind u10 and et for comparison only values available since 1979 were downloaded from the noaa website www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data narr html see mesinger et al 2006 for a detailed description of how the et rates were derived by the narr lsm the rn u10 and et values were further interpolated linearly onto the prism grid employing a power transformation brutsaert 1982 of the u10 values into u2 u10 2 10 1 7 required by 2 and 5 the obtained long term et rates and their linear trends are to be validated as the difference in long term prism precipitation p and united states geological survey s usgs 8 level hydrologic unit code huc8 fig 2 streamflow q values waterwatch usgs gov i e p q here it is assumed that changes in groundwater and soil moisture δs between the end and start of the 37 years of the model period are negligible in comparison with the incoming p and outgoing q fluxes for each huc8 watershed the et p q estimation further assumes that inter basin water transfers are also negligible and that the net lateral groundwater flux is zero for each catchment this latter assumption is probably the most problematic considering the layout of the high plains aquifer korus et al 2013 where the continuous unconfined groundwater table has an east ward general slope of about 1 500 fig 2 under nebraska creating a complex flow net for the groundwater first described by toth 1963 the regional west to east slope of the terrain may lead to discrepancies in watershed boundaries between surface and subsurface water making the watersheds similar to flow through lakes gaining water on one side and losing on the other without any guarantee that the difference is zero consequently validation of the modeled et rates and their trends will eventually be performed for the entire state of nebraska by spatial averaging of the huc8 watershed fluxes the long term water balance equation for the entire state thus becomes 8 et p q g in g out p q where g is the lateral regional groundwater flux in and out of the state and the sharp brackets denote state wide averages for 1979 2015 here again long term storage change in the groundwater was assumed negligible so was any vertical flux exchange between the unconfined high plains and the underlying confined aquifers a rough estimate of the magnitude of g can be obtained from state wide maps of transmissivity and elevation of the groundwater table korus et al 2013 using darcy s law yielding a value of about a few mm annually which is negligible and even more so the difference in gin and gout in comparison with the 548 mm yr 1 mean annual state wide et rate reported by szilagyi 2017a for the 1981 2010 period at the smaller scale of the huc8 watersheds hydraulic gradients and especially transmissivity values in the sand hills korus et al 2013 may be much larger and more spatially variable due to a much increased saturated hydraulic conductivity value of the sand and the largest saturated thickness of the entire high plains aquifer than what is found at the eastern or western boundary of the state producing potentially non negligible g values there to further test the reliability of the state wide annual et values annual changes in the grace derived terrestrial water storage sg values tapley et al 2004 for nebraska over the available 2002 2015 time period are also to be compared with water balance derived similar changes δs as note that at the annual scale δs may not be negligible 9 δ s p q et the sg values obtained by nasa s jet propulsion laboratory can be downloaded from http ccar colorado edu grace jpl html the state of nebraska is covered by six so called grace mascons therefore the state wide sg values are obtained by weighting the individual mascon values with their shared areas with nebraska for obtaining annual changes the original sg values available for certain days of the year are interpolated by a spline method to yield a value for each day of the 2002 2015 period the annual changes δs g then result by taking the difference in the sg values for january 1 in each consecutive years for 2002 the first available published value is used in lieu of the january 1 value 4 results and discussion 4 1 mean annual averages eqs 1 7 employed with monthly prism ta td and narr rn and u10 values yield actual monthly et rates at the 4 km spatial resolution of prism for the 1979 2015 time period fig 3 et rates largely follow the spatial distribution of precipitation fig 4 the largest values are found in the moist south eastern corner of the state where precipitation is most abundant while the smallest rates can be observed in the dry north western corner along with the scarcest precipitation the state wide mean et ratio i e et p 1 from the two spatial averages i e 538 mm yr 1 for et and 597 mm yr 1 for p becomes 90 fig 5 displays the spatial distribution of the mean annual et ratios as expected the et ratios are the smallest in the eastern part of the state where precipitation is the highest since more abundant precipitation typically generates more runoff as soil moisture is kept closer to saturation thus leaving relatively less but in absolute terms more of course for et budyko 1974 with the decrease in precipitation by going west the et ratios increase in certain areas well above 100 these areas in bluish color generally correspond to irrigated land fig 1 or marshlands of the sand hills fig 5 but only when precipitation is less than 400 mm yr 1 roughly west of the 100th meridian which crosses the state just to the right of the eastern border of its largest county i e cherry in north central nebraska as was previously found by szilagyi et al 2017 for the entire coterminous us with very few exceptions naturally small marshlands lakes or heavily irrigated crops can evaporate locally at a rate exceeding even 700 mm yr 1 in nebraska szilagyi et al 2011b but it will not necessarily show up in the 4 km spatial resolution of the prism data especially when one further considers the spatial density of the ta and td stations displayed in fig 5 that serve the basis of the prism grid values intensive irrigation certainly corresponds to elevated et ratios in south central nebraska south of the sand hills green colors in fig 5 but elevated air temperatures fig 6 also play a role leaving less to runoff even though precipitation rates fig 4 are about the same as in the sand hills modeling results were validated by simplified water balances written for the huc8 catchments as et p q displayed in fig 7 while the general increasing tendency from north west to south east is present in the p q values similar to fig 3 the largest catchment wide et rates surpassing the cr derived maximum do not occur in the wettest south easternmost tip of the state but north of it in an area with negligible irrigation fig 1 next to a catchment with an et rate 100 mm yr 1 less for the whole state the two estimates 538 vs 547 mm yr 1 differ by less than 2 which is remarkable considering that cr derived et rates were obtained without any calibration or explicit information about precipitation soil type irrigation moisture conditions or vegetation fig 8 displays the regression plot between the two et estimates obtained for the huc8 catchments in nebraska while the cr model explains 94 r 2 in percentages of the variation a remarkably high value found in the mean annual water balance et rates with a root mean squared error rmse of 31 4 mm yr 1 it underestimates water balance et by 7 at the p q value of 700 mm and overestimates it by 6 at 400 mm the two largest p q values of the dark blue catchments of fig 7 with q values of about 38 mm yr 1 only in a neighborhood of 93 129 150 and 172 mm yr 1 runoff values are clear outliers and were left out from the line fitting and performance analysis in order to test the reliability of the modeled annual et values on which the ensuing trend analysis is based the state wide annual δs estimates of 9 were compared to the grace obtained values of similar annual water storage changes δs g for the available 2002 2015 time period fig 9 and yielded a statistically significant linear correlation coefficient r value of 0 74 it is remarkable again how accurately the maximum and minimum values of δsg are captured by δs in the second wettest i e 2007 and the driest i e 2012 years respectively as defined by precipitation amount without any kind of model calibration and by considering that the δsg values are just a fraction of the modeled et rates 4 2 linear trend analysis with 37 years of data it is possible to check if annual et rates in nebraska have expressed any long term tendencies over the course of the 1979 2015 time period in the light of increasing air temperatures e g cox et al 2000 held and soden 2006 globally and significant increases in irrigated area regionally dai et al 2016 found a 0 15 c per decade air temperature increase among the midwest states including nebraska during the growing seasons of 1980 2013 mahmood et al 2008 found that growing season td can be 1 56 c higher over irrigated land than over rain fed crops in nebraska a clear indication that large scale irrigation affects the moisture content of the air at a regional scale analysis of the prism air temperature data indeed yields an overall increase in annual air temperatures across nebraska fig 10 over the 1979 2015 period the trend in each prism grid point was obtained as the slope of the best fit first order polynomial curve over the 37 annual mean values in general the eastern part east of the 100th meridian of the state has cooled somewhat while the rest warmed up the td values express double the warming trend of ta fig 11 practically with stagnating or rising values everywhere interestingly the largest increase is found in north central nebraska around the town of valentine in cherry county seemingly not connected to any large scale irrigation project not only temperatures increased in the 1979 2015 period but the amount of annual precipitation as well fig 12 although spatially unevenly over the cooling eastern part of the state fig 10 with the most abundant irrigation fig 1 precipitation has generally decreased fig 12 possibly due to the cooling effect of irrigation enhanced evaporation over expanding irrigation projects which then stabilizes the atmosphere over these extensive irrigated areas similar to what is known over the great lakes where summer precipitation is reduced by as much as 20 30 changnon and jones 1972 bates et al 1993 by the cold water surface in the most heavily irrigated cells marked below in fig 14 p on average decreased by as much as 4 4 mm decade 1 to the best knowledge of the author this is the first report of the possibility of a link between expanding irrigated areas and reduced precipitation rates locally within the us direct comparison of precipitation rates over irrigated and non irrigated areas is hindered by the strong east to west gradient in precipitation and the uneven distribution of irrigated land across the state as one would expect with increases in state wide precipitation air and dew point temperatures et rates have also increased in general fig 13 at an average rate of 5 47 mm decade 1 more than doubling the rate of the precipitation increase 2 44 mm decade 1 the modeled 5 47 mm decade 1 state wide et trend value is within 4 2 of the water balance derived trend i e the difference in trends of the state wide annual p and q values see table 1 of 5 25 mm decade 1 which is again a remarkable achievement similar to that of the state wide mean annual et estimate considering that no model calibration whatsoever was performed over the heavily irrigated cells of fig 14 et rates on average have increased by 7 mm decade 1 with a simultaneous 4 4 mm decade 1 decline in precipitation rates only the panhandle region of nebraska and the republican river basin in the south west have displayed declining et rates exactly in the regions where dew point temperatures remained stagnant overall fig 11 despite a warming trend note that a decreasing et trend does not necessarily translate into a declining td trend and vice versa this is so because how much moisture the air contains at a given distance from the ground depends not only on the et flux but simultaneously on the wind characteristics annual mean wind velocities stayed constant over nebraska which not only affect the moisture profile but also the residence time of moisture in the air with increasing air but steady dew point temperatures and wind speed in the two areas figs 10 and 11 the relative humidity has declined favoring longer residence time for water vapor which means that the same moisture level may be maintained by lower et rates kukal et al 2017 using calibrated crop coefficients found a similar spatial pattern of growing season et trends for corn and soybean in nebraska over the 1982 2013 period with overall increases across the state except in the panhandle region and in the middle of the state near the south east corner of cherry county exactly where in fig 13 the greenish yellow patch is found their data however does not show declining trends in the republican river basin i e in the south western part of nebraska the downloadable narr lsm et data however not only overestimates the statewide water balance derived mean annual et rate of 547 mm yr 1 by 73 mm yr 1 a 15 error and even the precipitation rate by 23 mm yr 1 but also yields a declining state wide et trend of 2 6 mm decade 1 instead of the here derived more than double i e 5 47 mm decade 1 positive trend in perfect match with the observed state wide precipitation and streamflow trends for more details on the us wide narr et rate validations please refer to szilagyi 2017b the cr based et rates are not only more accurate than the narr values but they require only generally available atmospheric air and dew point temperature wind velocity and radiation data without additional information of land and vegetation properties required by the narr lsm another interesting finding beside a possible causality between declining precipitation rates and expanding irrigation projects is that with increasing precipitation rates overall the et ratios should have declined as a larger proportion of precipitation is expected to run off over wetter soils than dry ones but instead the et ratios increased over the large majority of the state s area at a state wide average rate of 0 76 decade 1 from the grid point trends of the annual et ratios fig 14 and at a rate of 0 54 decade 1 from the 5 47 mm decade 1 et and 2 44 mm decade 1 precipitation trends table 1 this latter rate of et ratio was obtained as 10 100 δ et p 3 7 100 δ 538 0 547 18 5 597 0 244 18 5 3 7 91 89 3 7 0 54 decade indicating that the et ratio has increased by at least 2 and by 2 8 from the 0 76 decade 1 value of fig 14 from a rate of 89 to 91 during the study period when fitting a linear trend function over the state wide annual et ratio values fig 16 table 1 then this increase becomes even larger i e 0 86 decade 1 the budyko curve 1974 relates the long term et ratio of a region to its maximum possible value assumed when the region is wet i e et ew porporato et al 2004 gerrits et al 2009 where the latter is mainly a function of the available energy rn at the surface in dry climates almost all the precipitation re emerges as et thus the ratio is close to unity the curve predicts a decline in the regionally representative et ratio under increasing precipitation as the role of runoff becomes more significant the ratio of ew and p is called an index f of aridity the budyko curve thus is given by the equation budyko 1974 11 et p f tan h f 1 1 e f 0 5 yielding et ratios as a monotonically increasing function of aridity f starting at et p 1 0 at f 0 i e super humid conditions and approaching unity et p 1 1 as f i e super arid conditions ew has indeed remained constant 652 mm yr 1 in nebraska over the 1979 2015 period with an imperceptible slope of 0 026 mm yr 1 decade 1 thus with the sole increase in the state wide p value the state wide et ratio should have declined but it did not it did the opposite even if not at a statistically significant rate see table 1 the exact rate of decline predicted by 11 is not that important 0 14 decade 1 because there are several alternative expressions for the budyko curve of 11 see e g szilagyi and jozsa 2009 yielding different rates of decline but with the shared property that all of them are monotonically increasing functions of f as fig 14 illustrates the majority of the largest wide spread et ratio increases in excess of 2 decade 1 have taken place over the most extensive irrigated regions of nebraska where precipitation rates have actually declined fig 12 the observed et ratio increase is much larger than what could be expected from the budyko curve i e 0 5 decade 1 due to declining p values alone ew stayed constant over irrigated land too and clearly the result of large scale expanding irrigation the budyko curve predicts a decrease in et rates with decreasing p rates contrary to what is observed even though the et ratio increases in both cases this unusual et ratio increase over irrigated areas is the main reason that the et ratio of the whole state has increased under an overall precipitation increase contrary to predictions of the budyko type curves note that in the sand hills the et ratio remained constant as p increased by 8 1 mm decade 1 ew remained constant and et by 6 mm decade 1 again contrary to the budyko curve the sand hills however has the unique property that surface runoff is practically zero due to the highly porous grass covered sandy soils and dune formations as a result more abundant precipitation just infiltrated into the root zone instead of having run off on the surface to a stream and by doing so boosting et rates and yielding a constant et ratio which thus could not counter balance the strong et ratio boosting behavior of the irrigated crops on a state wide basis fig 15 displays the result of the modified for possible autocorrelation of the time series mann kendall hamed and rao 1998 linear trend test at each grid point the smaller the p value i e the bluer the color the more significant the linear trend is as seen the dew point td trends predominantly increasing are the most significant overall across the state followed by the et rates the latter however are significant mostly for the increasing and not so much for the declining trends the trends in the et ratios in the other hand can be significant for both increases in areal extent corresponding to the largest increases in fig 14 and decreases as well finally fig 16 and table 1 summarize the observed state wide trends of the variables discussed ew u2 and rn are not included as they stayed constant during the study period the strongest trend is found in the et values significant at the 5 level followed by td as the two variables with statistically significant trends at the typical 5 10 level 5 conclusions with recent advances in evaporation research brutsaert 2015 crago et al 2016 szilagyi et al 2017 it is possible to obtain regional et estimates with an accuracy never seen before and all this with the application of basic meteorological air and dew point temperature wind velocity net radiation variables without information of land surface properties or the need of any kind of parameter calibration here the latest calibration free version szilagyi et al 2017 of the general nonlinear complementary relationship of evaporation was employed for estimating monthly et trends across nebraska over the 1979 2015 time period it was found that et rates have increased over ¾ of the area of the state at a state wide average of 5 47 mm decade 1 in accordance with a similar but more moderate 2 44 mm decade 1 state wide increase in precipitation and an opposite 2 81 mm decade 1 decline in state wide streamflow rates the estimated et trend is within 5 of the difference in the precipitation and streamflow trends the state wide et increase surpassing the concurrent increase in precipitation is the direct result of the about 50 expansion of irrigated land during the model period making the state the most intensively irrigated one within the us over the most heavily irrigated croplands et has increased by 7 mm decade 1 despite a 4 4 mm decade 1 drop in precipitation it is suspected here that such a suppression of precipitation over irrigated land with a regional extent is not coincidental but a direct result of the regional scale irrigation process which creates a more stable air stratification over the cooler irrigated crop surfaces while a teleconnection of large scale irrigation and increased precipitation downwind has already been reported barnston and schickedanz 1984 moore and rojstaczer 2002 deangelis et al 2010 kustu et al 2011 harding and snyder 2012 lo and famiglietti 2013 huber et al 2014 for the coterminous us the simultaneous local suppression of total precipitation has not to the best knowledge of the author yet been recognized to take place within the us however it has recently been reported for the monsoon region of northern india zeng et al 2017 the backward trajectory analysis study of harding and snyder 2012 has come the closest with its conclusion to the present findings by identifying a suppression of advected moisture over the extensive irrigated fields of nebraska they also found that increasing convective available potential energy coming from irrigation enhanced low level moisture typically overwhelms simultaneous surface cooling boosted inhibition of vertical convections yielding a net local increase in precipitation in contrast to our finding this suppression of advected precipitation even without leading to decreasing total precipitation rates may exacerbate depletion of the groundwater and or decline of streamflow rates by not only boosting the total moisture export out of the area via these extensive irrigated areas but simultaneously hindering the import of advective moisture supply thus creating a positive feedback harding and snyder 2012 loop for increased irrigation demand irrigation boosted et rates have also reversed the trajectory of the state wide et ratio which should have been dropping budyko curve due to an increase in state wide precipitation and constant surface net radiation but instead it has increased at a rate of 0 54 0 86 decade 1 depending on which method it is calculated by the freely available land surface model lsm et rates of the north american regional reanalysis have completely failed to capture the observed regionally increasing et trend by yielding a declining trend half the magnitude of the observed increase while at the same time overestimating the period averaged state wide et rate by 15 yielding an et rate in excess of precipitation the complementary relationship model here captured the state wide et rate within 2 this study took advantage of the latest developments in evaporation research to investigate how wide spread land use change can affect the hydrological cycle and demonstrated the capability of the recently advanced complementary relationship of evaporation for estimating regional scale evapotranspiration rates using widely available meteorological variables only and all that in a calibration free manner it is strongly believed that this approach could prove useful in defining regional continental and global scale latent heat fluxes on its own and or assist the calibration verification of the presently employed lsms of the general circulation models for an improved understanding of the hydrological cycle and the related

curve water balance high plains aquifer grace data 1 introduction irrigation worldwide is responsible for more than 85 of the global freshwater consumption gleick 2003 as the population of the world is expected to grow steadily in the coming decades so is the demand for improved crop yields which translates to a continual expansion of irrigated land area gleick 2003 the crop fields of nebraska usa represent one of the world s most important agricultural lands due not the least to intensive irrigation mainly via groundwater pumping center pivot systems producing consistently high yields of corn and soybean for example in fact nebraska boasts the largest total of irrigated land within the coterminous united states surpassing the two largest states by area texas and california usda 2012 this continued success in high crop yields over the past several decades is partly due to the fact that the high plains aquifer spreading under eight states is the thickest and most extensive under nebraska where groundwater recharge rates are naturally enhanced szilagyi et al 2011 szilagyi and jozsa 2013 by the loose and porous soils of the sand hills comprising about 1 3 of the state s area fig 1 the hydrological effect of long term large scale irrigation however is felt not only locally in dropping streamflow rates szilagyi 1999 2001 2014a and or groundwater levels korus et al 2013 but also in areas as far as illinois and indiana a distance of about 600 1000 km in the form of increased summer streamflow due to irrigation enhanced evaporation over nebraska and the resulting summer

rojstaczer 2002 and huber et al 2014 as a result the question arises if indeed sustained large scale irrigation has increased regional evapotranspiration et rates over nebraska noticeably and if so whether it can be detected by taking advantage of the latest developments in evaporation research utilizing available large scale and long term meteorological data the fact that such a teleconnection between irrigation and the resulting summer streamflow rate increase a long distance away has only been detected recently can partially be attributed to the about 50 increase from 23 000 to 34 000 km2 usda 2012 in irrigated land area within nebraska over the 1979 2015 period for which meteorological data exist for the present study note that any approach that requires surface flux measurements remote sensing and or land use cover data was deliberately excluded for the present analysis this is so because such data a are not available on a long term basis e g moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis b not continuous e g the snap shots of landsat and land use cover maps c lead to a mismatch of scales like flux data that are valid at the plot scale and not at the regional

al 2017 this study is rather based on the latest advances crago et al 2016 szilagyi et al 2017 of the complementary relationship cr bouchet 1963 of evaporation the szilagyi et al 2017 formulation of the cr has the distinct advantage that it only requires widely available atmospheric radiation variables and it is calibration free the latter is especially valuable when the modeling period over which environmental parameters such as related to land use land cover that typically serve as boundary conditions for the model may change significantly is long thus requiring repeated recalibration or readjustment of the parameters during the model run finally the results of the present study are to be evaluated by a long term water balance approach and also compared to the widely available north american regional reanalysis narr et rates provided by the land surface model lsm mesinger et al 2006 of narr besides long term averages reliability of the annual values is to be tested with the help of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data tapley et al 2004 2 methods the complementary relationship cr of evaporation recognizes that at a suitable time scale typically one day or longer the lower atmosphere will adjust to the moisture status of the homogeneous land crago et al 2017 the latter regulating actual et rates which then can be derived solely from atmospheric and

value of 1 15 which was kept for the present study 3 study area and data the state of nebraska lies in the central great plains with a strong gradient in mean annual precipitation from the sub humid south eastern border of more than 850 mm to less than 350 mm in the panhandle from the continental climate of the state follows the hot summers with july mean daily temperatures of 23 6 c and cold winters of 5 5 c in january frankson et al 2017 precipitation is highly variable from year to year with the statewide annual average ranging from a low of 340 mm in 2012 to a high of 900 mm in 1915 frankson et al 2017 most of the precipitation falls during the spring and summer months but seasonal precipitation varies widely frankson et al 2017 2012 was nebraska s driest year on record statewide summer precipitation averaged only 95 mm well below the historical average of 240 mm by the end of september over 75 of the state was experiencing exceptional drought conditions putting extremely high demand for irrigation water the drought combined with the extreme summer heat had significant negative impacts on non irrigated crop yields and pasture conditions frankson et al 2017 the continuous estimation of the state wide et rates via 1 7 require air ta and dew point td temperatures surface net radiation rn and 2 m wind u2 data the averages of which were supplied at a monthly time step over the 37 year period of 1979 2015 at the 4 km spatial resolution of the ta and td values coming from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 1994 the 32 km spatial resolution monthly narr lsm rn 10 m wind u10 and et for comparison only values available since 1979 were downloaded from the noaa website www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data narr html see mesinger et al 2006 for a detailed description of how the et rates were derived by the narr lsm the rn u10 and et values were further interpolated linearly onto the prism grid employing a power transformation brutsaert 1982 of the u10 values into u2 u10 2 10 1 7 required by 2 and 5 the obtained long term et rates and their linear trends are to be validated as the difference in long term prism precipitation p and united states geological survey s usgs 8 level hydrologic unit code huc8 fig 2 streamflow q values waterwatch usgs gov i e p q here it is assumed that changes in groundwater and soil moisture δs between the end and start of the 37 years of the model period are negligible in comparison with the incoming p and outgoing q fluxes for each huc8 watershed the et p q estimation further assumes that inter basin water transfers are also negligible and that the net lateral groundwater flux is zero for each catchment this latter assumption is probably the most problematic considering the layout of the high plains aquifer korus et al 2013 where the continuous unconfined groundwater table has an east ward general slope of about 1 500 fig 2 under nebraska creating a complex flow net for the groundwater first described by toth 1963 the regional west to east slope of the terrain may lead to discrepancies in watershed boundaries between surface and subsurface water making the watersheds similar to flow through lakes gaining water on one side and losing on the other without any guarantee that the difference is zero consequently validation of the modeled et rates and their trends will eventually be performed for the entire state of nebraska by spatial averaging of the huc8 watershed fluxes the long term water balance equation for the entire state thus becomes 8 et p q g in g out p q where g is the lateral regional groundwater flux in and out of the state and the sharp brackets denote state wide averages for 1979 2015 here again long term storage change in the groundwater was assumed negligible so was any vertical flux exchange between the unconfined high plains and the underlying confined aquifers a rough estimate of the magnitude of g can be obtained from state wide maps of transmissivity and elevation of the groundwater table korus et al 2013 using darcy s law yielding a value of about a few mm annually which is negligible and even more so the difference in gin and gout in comparison with the 548 mm yr 1 mean annual state wide et rate reported by szilagyi 2017a for the 1981 2010 period at the smaller scale of the huc8 watersheds hydraulic gradients and especially transmissivity values in the sand hills korus et al 2013 may be much larger and more spatially variable due to a much increased saturated hydraulic conductivity value of the sand and the largest saturated thickness of the entire high plains aquifer than what is found at the eastern or western boundary of the state producing potentially non negligible g values there to further test the reliability of the state wide annual et values annual changes in the grace derived terrestrial water storage sg values tapley et al 2004 for nebraska over the available 2002 2015 time period are also to be compared with water balance derived similar changes δs as note that at the annual scale δs may not be negligible 9 δ s p q et the sg values obtained by nasa s jet propulsion laboratory can be downloaded from http ccar colorado edu grace jpl html the state of nebraska is covered by six so called grace mascons therefore the state wide sg values are obtained by weighting the individual mascon values with their shared areas with nebraska for obtaining annual changes the original sg values available for certain days of the year are interpolated by a spline method to yield a value for each day of the 2002 2015 period the annual changes δs g then result by taking the difference in the sg values for january 1 in each consecutive years for 2002 the first available published value is used in lieu of the january 1 value 4 results and discussion 4 1 mean annual averages eqs 1 7 employed with monthly prism ta td and narr rn and u10 values yield actual monthly et rates at the 4 km spatial resolution of prism for the 1979 2015 time period fig 3 et rates largely follow the spatial distribution of precipitation fig 4 the largest values are found in the moist south eastern corner of the state where precipitation is most abundant while the smallest rates can be observed in the dry north western corner along with the scarcest precipitation the state wide mean et ratio i e et p 1 from the two spatial averages i e 538 mm yr 1 for et and 597 mm yr 1 for p becomes 90 fig 5 displays the spatial distribution of the mean annual et ratios as expected the et ratios are the smallest in the eastern part of the state where precipitation is the highest since more abundant precipitation typically generates more runoff as soil moisture is kept closer to saturation thus leaving relatively less but in absolute terms more of course for et budyko 1974 with the decrease in precipitation by going west the et ratios increase in certain areas well above 100 these areas in bluish color generally correspond to irrigated land fig 1 or marshlands of the sand hills fig 5 but only when precipitation is less than 400 mm yr 1 roughly west of the 100th meridian which crosses the state just to the right of the eastern border of its largest county i e cherry in north central nebraska as was previously found by szilagyi et al 2017 for the entire coterminous us with very few exceptions naturally small marshlands lakes or heavily irrigated crops can evaporate locally at a rate exceeding even 700 mm yr 1 in nebraska szilagyi et al 2011b but it will not necessarily show up in the 4 km spatial resolution of the prism data especially when one further considers the spatial density of the ta and td stations displayed in fig 5 that serve the basis of the prism grid values intensive irrigation certainly corresponds to elevated et ratios in south central nebraska south of the sand hills green colors in fig 5 but elevated air temperatures fig 6 also play a role leaving less to runoff even though precipitation rates fig 4 are about the same as in the sand hills modeling results were validated by simplified water balances written for the huc8 catchments as et p q displayed in fig 7 while the general increasing tendency from north west to south east is present in the p q values similar to fig 3 the largest catchment wide et rates surpassing the cr derived maximum do not occur in the wettest south easternmost tip of the state but north of it in an area with negligible irrigation fig 1 next to a catchment with an et rate 100 mm yr 1 less for the whole state the two estimates 538 vs 547 mm yr 1 differ by less than 2 which is remarkable considering that cr derived et rates were obtained without any calibration or explicit information about precipitation soil type irrigation moisture conditions or vegetation fig 8 displays the regression plot between the two et estimates obtained for the huc8 catchments in nebraska while the cr model explains 94 r 2 in percentages of the variation a remarkably high value found in the mean annual water balance et rates with a root mean squared error rmse of 31 4 mm yr 1 it underestimates water balance et by 7 at the p q value of 700 mm and overestimates it by 6 at 400 mm the two largest p q values of the dark blue catchments of fig 7 with q values of about 38 mm yr 1 only in a neighborhood of 93 129 150 and 172 mm yr 1 runoff values are clear outliers and were left out from the line fitting and performance analysis in order to test the reliability of the modeled annual et values on which the ensuing trend analysis is based the state wide annual δs estimates of 9 were compared to the grace obtained values of similar annual water storage changes δs g for the available 2002 2015 time period fig 9 and yielded a statistically significant linear correlation coefficient r value of 0 74 it is remarkable again how accurately the maximum and minimum values of δsg are captured by δs in the second wettest i e 2007 and the driest i e 2012 years respectively as defined by precipitation amount without any kind of model calibration and by considering that the δsg values are just a fraction of the modeled et rates 4 2 linear trend analysis with 37 years of data it is possible to check if annual et rates in nebraska have expressed any long term tendencies over the course of the 1979 2015 time period in the light of increasing air temperatures e g cox et al 2000 held and soden 2006 globally and significant increases in irrigated area regionally dai et al 2016 found a 0 15 c per decade air temperature increase among the midwest states including nebraska during the growing seasons of 1980 2013 mahmood et al 2008 found that growing season td can be 1 56 c higher over irrigated land than over rain fed crops in nebraska a clear indication that large scale irrigation affects the moisture content of the air at a regional scale analysis of the prism air temperature data indeed yields an overall increase in annual air temperatures across nebraska fig 10 over the 1979 2015 period the trend in each prism grid point was obtained as the slope of the best fit first order polynomial curve over the 37 annual mean values in general the eastern part east of the 100th meridian of the state has cooled somewhat while the rest warmed up the td values express double the warming trend of ta fig 11 practically with stagnating or rising values everywhere interestingly the largest increase is found in north central nebraska around the town of valentine in cherry county seemingly not connected to any large scale irrigation project not only temperatures increased in the 1979 2015 period but the amount of annual precipitation as well fig 12 although spatially unevenly over the cooling eastern part of the state fig 10 with the most abundant irrigation fig 1 precipitation has generally decreased fig 12 possibly due to the cooling effect of irrigation enhanced evaporation over expanding irrigation projects which then stabilizes the atmosphere over these extensive irrigated areas similar to what is known over the great lakes where summer precipitation is reduced by as much as 20 30 changnon and jones 1972 bates et al 1993 by the cold water surface in the most heavily irrigated cells marked below in fig 14 p on average decreased by as much as 4 4 mm decade 1 to the best knowledge of the author this is the first report of the possibility of a link between expanding irrigated areas and reduced precipitation rates locally within the us direct comparison of precipitation rates over irrigated and non irrigated areas is hindered by the strong east to west gradient in precipitation and the uneven distribution of irrigated land across the state as one would expect with increases in state wide precipitation air and dew point temperatures et rates have also increased in general fig 13 at an average rate of 5 47 mm decade 1 more than doubling the rate of the precipitation increase 2 44 mm decade 1 the modeled 5 47 mm decade 1 state wide et trend value is within 4 2 of the water balance derived trend i e the difference in trends of the state wide annual p and q values see table 1 of 5 25 mm decade 1 which is again a remarkable achievement similar to that of the state wide mean annual et estimate considering that no model calibration whatsoever was performed over the heavily irrigated cells of fig 14 et rates on average have increased by 7 mm decade 1 with a simultaneous 4 4 mm decade 1 decline in precipitation rates only the panhandle region of nebraska and the republican river basin in the south west have displayed declining et rates exactly in the regions where dew point temperatures remained stagnant overall fig 11 despite a warming trend note that a decreasing et trend does not necessarily translate into a declining td trend and vice versa this is so because how much moisture the air contains at a given distance from the ground depends not only on the et flux but simultaneously on the wind characteristics annual mean wind velocities stayed constant over nebraska which not only affect the moisture profile but also the residence time of moisture in the air with increasing air but steady dew point temperatures and wind speed in the two areas figs 10 and 11 the relative humidity has declined favoring longer residence time for water vapor which means that the same moisture level may be maintained by lower et rates kukal et al 2017 using calibrated crop coefficients found a similar spatial pattern of growing season et trends for corn and soybean in nebraska over the 1982 2013 period with overall increases across the state except in the panhandle region and in the middle of the state near the south east corner of cherry county exactly where in fig 13 the greenish yellow patch is found their data however does not show declining trends in the republican river basin i e in the south western part of nebraska the downloadable narr lsm et data however not only overestimates the statewide water balance derived mean annual et rate of 547 mm yr 1 by 73 mm yr 1 a 15 error and even the precipitation rate by 23 mm yr 1 but also yields a declining state wide et trend of 2 6 mm decade 1 instead of the here derived more than double i e 5 47 mm decade 1 positive trend in perfect match with the observed state wide precipitation and streamflow trends for more details on the us wide narr et rate validations please refer to szilagyi 2017b the cr based et rates are not only more accurate than the narr values but they require only generally available atmospheric air and dew point temperature wind velocity and radiation data without additional information of land and vegetation properties required by the narr lsm another interesting finding beside a possible causality between declining precipitation rates and expanding irrigation projects is that with increasing precipitation rates overall the et ratios should have declined as a larger proportion of precipitation is expected to run off over wetter soils than dry ones but instead the et ratios increased over the large majority of the state s area at a state wide average rate of 0 76 decade 1 from the grid point trends of the annual et ratios fig 14 and at a rate of 0 54 decade 1 from the 5 47 mm decade 1 et and 2 44 mm decade 1 precipitation trends table 1 this latter rate of et ratio was obtained as 10 100 δ et p 3 7 100 δ 538 0 547 18 5 597 0 244 18 5 3 7 91 89 3 7 0 54 decade indicating that the et ratio has increased by at least 2 and by 2 8 from the 0 76 decade 1 value of fig 14 from a rate of 89 to 91 during the study period when fitting a linear trend function over the state wide annual et ratio values fig 16 table 1 then this increase becomes even larger i e 0 86 decade 1 the budyko curve 1974 relates the long term et ratio of a region to its maximum possible value assumed when the region is wet i e et ew porporato et al 2004 gerrits et al 2009 where the latter is mainly a function of the available energy rn at the surface in dry climates almost all the precipitation re emerges as et thus the ratio is close to unity the curve predicts a decline in the regionally representative et ratio under increasing precipitation as the role of runoff becomes more significant the ratio of ew and p is called an index f of aridity the budyko curve thus is given by the equation budyko 1974 11 et p f tan h f 1 1 e f 0 5 yielding et ratios as a monotonically increasing function of aridity f starting at et p 1 0 at f 0 i e super humid conditions and approaching unity et p 1 1 as f i e super arid conditions ew has indeed remained constant 652 mm yr 1 in nebraska over the 1979 2015 period with an imperceptible slope of 0 026 mm yr 1 decade 1 thus with the sole increase in the state wide p value the state wide et ratio should have declined but it did not it did the opposite even if not at a statistically significant rate see table 1 the exact rate of decline predicted by 11 is not that important 0 14 decade 1 because there are several alternative expressions for the budyko curve of 11 see e g szilagyi and jozsa 2009 yielding different rates of decline but with the shared property that all of them are monotonically increasing functions of f as fig 14 illustrates the majority of the largest wide spread et ratio increases in excess of 2 decade 1 have taken place over the most extensive irrigated regions of nebraska where precipitation rates have actually declined fig 12 the observed et ratio increase is much larger than what could be expected from the budyko curve i e 0 5 decade 1 due to declining p values alone ew stayed constant over irrigated land too and clearly the result of large scale expanding irrigation the budyko curve predicts a decrease in et rates with decreasing p rates contrary to what is observed even though the et ratio increases in both cases this unusual et ratio increase over irrigated areas is the main reason that the et ratio of the whole state has increased under an overall precipitation increase contrary to predictions of the budyko type curves note that in the sand hills the et ratio remained constant as p increased by 8 1 mm decade 1 ew remained constant and et by 6 mm decade 1 again contrary to the budyko curve the sand hills however has the unique property that surface runoff is practically zero due to the highly porous grass covered sandy soils and dune formations as a result more abundant precipitation just infiltrated into the root zone instead of having run off on the surface to a stream and by doing so boosting et rates and yielding a constant et ratio which thus could not counter balance the strong et ratio boosting behavior of the irrigated crops on a state wide basis fig 15 displays the result of the modified for possible autocorrelation of the time series mann kendall hamed and rao 1998 linear trend test at each grid point the smaller the p value i e the bluer the color the more significant the linear trend is as seen the dew point td trends predominantly increasing are the most significant overall across the state followed by the et rates the latter however are significant mostly for the increasing and not so much for the declining trends the trends in the et ratios in the other hand can be significant for both increases in areal extent corresponding to the largest increases in fig 14 and decreases as well finally fig 16 and table 1 summarize the observed state wide trends of the variables discussed ew u2 and rn are not included as they stayed constant during the study period the strongest trend is found in the et values significant at the 5 level followed by td as the two variables with statistically significant trends at the typical 5 10 level 5 conclusions with recent advances in evaporation research brutsaert 2015 crago et al 2016 szilagyi et al 2017 it is possible to obtain regional et estimates with an accuracy never seen before and all this with the application of basic meteorological air and dew point temperature wind velocity net radiation variables without information of land surface properties or the need of any kind of parameter calibration here the latest calibration free version szilagyi et al 2017 of the general nonlinear complementary relationship of evaporation was employed for estimating monthly et trends across nebraska over the 1979 2015 time period it was found that et rates have increased over ¾ of the area of the state at a state wide average of 5 47 mm decade 1 in accordance with a similar but more moderate 2 44 mm decade 1 state wide increase in precipitation and an opposite 2 81 mm decade 1 decline in state wide streamflow rates the estimated et trend is within 5 of the difference in the precipitation and streamflow trends the state wide et increase surpassing the concurrent increase in precipitation is the direct result of the about 50 expansion of irrigated land during the model period making the state the most intensively irrigated one within the us over the most heavily irrigated croplands et has increased by 7 mm decade 1 despite a 4 4 mm decade 1 drop in precipitation it is suspected here that such a suppression of precipitation over irrigated land with a regional extent is not coincidental but a direct result of the regional scale irrigation process which creates a more stable air stratification over the cooler irrigated crop surfaces while a teleconnection of large scale irrigation and increased precipitation downwind has already been reported barnston and schickedanz 1984 moore and rojstaczer 2002 deangelis et al 2010 kustu et al 2011 harding and snyder 2012 lo and famiglietti 2013 huber et al 2014 for the coterminous us the simultaneous local suppression of total precipitation has not to the best knowledge of the author yet been recognized to take place within the us however it has recently been reported for the monsoon region of northern india zeng et al 2017 the backward trajectory analysis study of harding and snyder 2012 has come the closest with its conclusion to the present findings by identifying a suppression of advected moisture over the extensive irrigated fields of nebraska they also found that increasing convective available potential energy coming from irrigation enhanced low level moisture typically overwhelms simultaneous surface cooling boosted inhibition of vertical convections yielding a net local increase in precipitation in contrast to our finding this suppression of advected precipitation even without leading to decreasing total precipitation rates may exacerbate depletion of the groundwater and or decline of streamflow rates by not only boosting the total moisture export out of the area via these extensive irrigated areas but simultaneously hindering the import of advective moisture supply thus creating a positive feedback harding and snyder 2012 loop for increased irrigation demand irrigation boosted et rates have also reversed the trajectory of the state wide et ratio which should have been dropping budyko curve due to an increase in state wide precipitation and constant surface net radiation but instead it has increased at a rate of 0 54 0 86 decade 1 depending on which method it is calculated by the freely available land surface model lsm et rates of the north american regional reanalysis have completely failed to capture the observed regionally increasing et trend by yielding a declining trend half the magnitude of the observed increase while at the same time overestimating the period averaged state wide et rate by 15 yielding an et rate in excess of precipitation the complementary relationship model here captured the state wide et rate within 2 this study took advantage of the latest developments in evaporation research to investigate how wide spread land use change can affect the hydrological cycle and demonstrated the capability of the recently advanced complementary relationship of evaporation for estimating regional scale evapotranspiration rates using widely available meteorological variables only and all that in a calibration free manner it is strongly believed that this approach could prove useful in defining regional continental and global scale latent heat fluxes on its own and or assist the calibration verification of the presently employed lsms of the general circulation models for an improved understanding of the hydrological cycle and the related

7512,reliable runoff estimation is important for design of water infrastructure and flood risk management in urban catchments we developed a spatially distributed precipitation runoff p r model that

agreement with the observed volumes qobs p the lowest percentage of precipitation volume that is transformed to the total simulated runoff in the catchment qt is 79 77 computation of evapotranspiration et indicated that the et p is less than 3 for the events and snow influenced seasons while it is about 18 for the summer autumn season the subsurface flow contribution to the sewer pipes are markedly higher than the total surface runoff volume for some events and the summer autumn season the peakiest flow rates correspond to the winter spring season therefore urban runoff

understanding of the changes which urbanization bring to urban catchments and to facilitate the development of planning strategies to minimize the negative impacts of future urban growth reliable estimation of runoff is required for design of stormwater systems and end to pipe and source control freni et al 2010 stormwater management techniques fletcher et al 2013 studied the considerable impacts of urban hydrology on receiving waters and noted that the variability and complexity of rainfall runoff response in urban areas needs further research therefore distributed urban p r models are useful tools for improved decision support in design and management of urban water infrastructure in terms of both water quality and quantity through better understanding of the hydrological processes prevailing in extreme runoff generation how the quantity of generated runoff in urban catchments is affected by precipitation characteristics rainfall and snowmelt events catchment soil moisture groundwater storage performances of different source control stormwater management strategies assessment of the impacts of land use and climate change two way interactions between sewer networks and subsurface flows etc however calibration and validation of urban p r models is challenging and require thorough studies in different urban setting and climate regimes mainly due to i urban catchments and urban water cycle are highly complex and heterogeneous due to the anthropogenic impacts such as modification in land cover soil properties flow paths etc and hence urban p r modelling require high resolution spatial information in order to consider the spatial variability of pluviometric and physiographic characteristics ii increase in runoff response or flashiness of urban catchments resulting from marked increase of impervious surfaces and alteration from the natural hydrological pathways to hydraulically efficient artificial drainage require simulation of rainfall runoff dynamics in urban catchments from high temporal resolution and good quality hydro climatic records iii lack of complete knowledge on the effects of various urban hydrological processes on the generated runoff volume such as snowmelt evapotranspiration and two way interactions between the subsurface runoff and flow in the sewer pipes several urban hydrological models have been developed for simulation of runoff quantity and water quality in urban catchments see a review by elliott and trowsdale 2007 the vast majority of urban precipitation runoff models used simplified algorithms for computations of runoff from the catchments and mainly focused on hydraulic computations e g flow routing through the pipe network probably being open source and its suitability for a wide ranges of applications the semi distributed storm water management model swmm huber and dickinson 1988 rossman 2004 is widely applied see rossman et al 2005 for event or continuous runoff simulation e g denault et al 2006 krebs et al 2014 guan et al 2015 guan et al 2016 however the swmm model is a semi distributed sub catchment based model that computes the generated runoff based on identifying percent of sub catchment areas that are impervious despite the model is capable of performing detailed sewer hydraulic calculations it has limitations that it cannot adequately capture the spatial distribution of runoff contributing areas i e exact locations in the sub catchments that generate urban runoff are not known for the inherently spatially heterogeneous urban catchments e g balascio et al 1998 similarly some 1d 2d hydro dynamically coupled urban models which allows for detailed hydraulic calculations and flow routing e g paz et al 2011 used a lumped rainfall runoff model for runoff computation which cannot adequately capture the spatial distribution of runoff contributing areas domingo et al 2010 applied a distributed 3d hydrologic model mike she coupled to a 1d hydrodynamic pipe flow model mouse however the authors considered the precipitation evaporation and infiltration processes in the distributed hydrologic model only for the previous areas while they considered rainfall runoff processes from the impervious areas in the pipe flow model using simplified approaches there are also commercial software that can perform 1d pipe flow and 2d grid cells distributed overland flow modelling for instance tuflow flood modeller pro mike urban mike flood infoworks and xp swmm see phillips et al 2005 syme 2008 despite their wide functionality for decision support in planning design and management of urban water infrastructure these models do not compute contributions of subsurface flow to the urban flooding they are not freely available and they probably lack flexibility of allowing researchers for modification of codes for instance to investigate the performance of different model structures equations etc therefore there is a need for study based on distributed modelling of the dominant surface and subsurface precipitation runoff processes for different land cover classes since hydrologic processes are also important factors affecting the urban flooding such study is expected to provide reliable computations of runoff generation than the semi distributed and lumped computations and distributed runoff computations that neglect contributions of the subsurface runoff to flow in the stormwater pipes in addition distributed models allow for explicit representation of the spatial distribution of low impact development lid urban stormwater drainage systems zoppou 2001 reviewed urban storm water models and noted that the spatial and temporal variability in rainfall is not adequately considered in the urban stormwater models elga et al 2015 suggested that future urban models should consider spatial temporal variability process interactions flexibility and uncertainty reduction the authors reported that only about 36 of the analyzed modelling approaches are spatially distributed with spatial resolution ranging from 3 m to 10 km however fully distributed models where the model parameters and runoff routing are distributed would entail more complexity and overparameterization such models may be useful for special research purposes but may not be useful for practical application for design and management purposes e g see grayson et al 1992 brooks et al 2007 spatially distributed models would allow explicit representation of the grid to grid variability of land cover information opposed to the semi distributed models which represent the spatial variability of the land cover in terms of percentages of impervious and pervious areas of the sub catchments or the homogeneous units hu because of the spatially heterogeneous nature of urbanized watersheds where the land cover are varying at a fine spatial scale distributed models are required to characterize the distribution of hydrologic processes easton et al 2007 the spatially distributed models are more responsive to changes in catchment characteristics and are useful for scenario studies like the impacts of land cover and climate change on urban runoff generation and on the urban water cycle in general cuo et al 2008 applied a physical based distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm for urban catchment and reported that the model facilitate prediction and or reconstruction of a range of historic and future changes in land cover due to urbanization or other factors rodriguez et al 2000 evaluated a distributed model for urban catchments using a 7 year continuous data series and found that the model provides a correct description of the temporal variations in the runoff coefficient mejía and moglen 2010 and jacobson 2011 illustrated the influential effects of the spatial distribution of imperviousness on the hydrologic response of an urbanized basin and the need for detailed characterization of urban areas petrucci and bonhomme 2014 based on simulation of runoff quantity and quality using the semi distributed swmm model and different representation of spatial variability by increasing use of geographical information found that the land use classification provides the highest benefit to improve model performances the spatially distributed models are also suitable for using spatially distributed rainfall input like radar rainfall data e g pan et al 2012 a review paper by thorndahl et al 2017 or for spatial interpolation of climate forcing from point gauge measurements the models also allow for distributed simulations of urban water storage states such as surface depression storage soil moisture and groundwater and fluxes such as infiltration evapotranspiration and runoff for instance for modelling of runoff and pollutant production from variable source areas e g easton et al 2007 the spatial variability of both rainfall and catchment soil moisture state affect urban runoff generation and hence studying the effects of antecedent soil moisture on urban runoff generation is important in addition spatially distributed simulations of snow accumulation and melt processes is useful for urban p r modelling in cold regions urban p r modelling based on high temporal resolution is also important due to quick runoff response of urban catchments related to modification of land cover e g increase in imperviousness relatively small catchment size high velocity of flow in conduits and high spatial variability of precipitation excess a review by elga et al 2015 identified that the most time steps used for urban runoff simulation are 1 h 25 and 1 day 20 which limit the models from accurately characterizing the fast components of urban fluxes however schilling 1991 recommended rainfall data requirements for urban hydrology application for proof evaluation analysis and operation of sewers at a temporal resolution of less than 5 min and spatial resolution of 1 km2 per gauge for a mediterranean climate berne et al 2004 suggested that the required resolution for rainfall measurements is about 1 min and 1 5 km and about 2 min and 2 km respectively for catchments smaller than 10 ha and the order of 20 ha bruni et al 2015 noted that temporal resolution aggregation of rainfall inputs resulted in time shift in modelled flow peaks by several minutes but the sensitivity to temporal resolution of rainfall inputs was low compared to that of the spatial resolution ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 found that for drainage areas between 1 ha and about 100 ha rainfall inputs at a spatial resolution of 500 m appear to be sufficient while acceptable hydraulic performance is still obtained for rainfall estimates at 1 km and 1 min resolution therefore hydro climatic input data and runoff simulation at high temporal resolution e g less than the time of concentration of the catchment and response times of the sub catchments is very important for better understanding and prediction of the runoff response in urban catchments in addition to the infiltration process processes such as surface depression storage evapotranspiration and snow accumulation and melt also influence the urban water cycle previous studies e g marsalek et al 2007 fassman beck et al 2013 found that there is a variability in the amount of surface depression water storage capacity and the process of depressing filling in natural surfaces and impervious surfaces including roofs several studies e g grimmond and oke 1991 rodriguez et al 2008 fletcher et al 2013 illustrated that there is a need for better estimation of hydrological fluxes from the surface to the atmosphere or evapotranspiration in urban areas ragab et al 2003 found that 21 24 of the annual rainfall over the study catchment in wallingford city united kingdom evaporated for urban catchment in france ramier et al 2011 found that evaporation losses represent 20 of the total rainfall several studies e g valeo and ho 2004 bengtsson and semádeni davies 2011 moghadas et al 2015 have discussed the importance of modelling the snow accumulation and melt processes in urban catchments in cold regions on their critical review of the evolution of the design storm event concept watt and marsalek 2013 suggested that there might be two drainage design events for pipe and storage sizing a storm rainfall event and a snowmelt plus rainfall event however the authors noted that there are several factors affecting the snow modelling in urban catchments related to non uniformity of snow distribution in urban environments due to urban snow management practices e g the effect of snow ploughing and piling on snow accumulation and melt the effect of road salt applications on snowmelt from impervious areas spatial heterogeneities in surface albedo in urban areas temporal variations in solar radiation effects of buildings on wind and solar exposure and hence on atmospheric heat exchange and snowmelt rates including these processes in an urban snow model would require several input data and lead to a more complex urban snow model therefore evaluation of simplified parameterizations for the spatially distributed modelling of the dominant hydrological processes e g surface depression storage evapotranspiration and snow accumulation and melt is important for improved runoff generation in urban catchments fletcher et al 2013 noted that integrated urban water cycle models that represent feedback mechanisms between all aspects of urban water cycle e g water supply wastewater and stormwater systems and precipitation water cycle remain an important research challenge some studies e g joss et al 2008 dirckx et al 2009 weiß et al 2002 zhu et al 2016 found that it is important to model at least the entire urban precipitation water cycle by including the subsurface hydrological processes joss et al 2008 found that there is marked feedbacks between the sewer systems and subsurface media or streams related to sewer leakage dirckx et al 2009 and weiß et al 2002 found that there is considerable 50 70 contribution to the dry weather combined sewer flow dwf from groundwater infiltration zhu et al 2016 found that there are feedbacks between the sewer systems and waterways berthier et al 2004 found that the soil contributes an average of 14 of the total per event runoff volume domingo et al 2010 found that simulated volumes of surface floods and inflows to the pipe network obtained from a physically based distributed 3d hydrologic model coupled to a 1d drainage network model are higher than those obtained from the traditional 1d 2d procedure berg and byrne 1998 reported that basements were flooded in residential urban areas due to subsurface flow and percolation into the pervious surfaces karpf and krebs 2011 developed a methodology to quantify groundwater infiltration and surface water inflow into the sewer pipes however the authors noted that the method require data which are not commonly available for instance the groundwater data rodriguez et al 2008 and coutu et al 2012 illustrated the importance of modelling the exchanges between the sewer system and the soil infiltration into the sewers and noted that the exchange with the saturated zone deserves detailed investigation the authors conceptualized that the total generated subsurface runoff from the catchments draining into the stormwater drainage network contributes to the flow in the sewer pipes however only fractions of the generated subsurface runoff from a catchment connected to a stormwater network would contribute to the flow in the artificial sewer network through cracked pipes since the subsurface runoff would mainly contribute to the natural subsurface drainage and storages based on a review of models for low impact urban stormwater drainage elliott and trowsdale 2007 concluded that half of the models include a groundwater component which is relevant for assessing effects of the lid on baseflow but the representation of groundwater is simplified and generally untested however simplified modelling of urban subsurface runoff process would be useful to shed lights on the total magnitudes of subsurface runoff and interactions between the subsurface runoff and sewer pipes there is a marked effect of runoff routing on the hydrological response of a catchment to storm events due to the quick rainfall runoff response in urbanized catchments e g see lhomme et al 2004 rodriguez et al 2003 2005a miller et al 2014 several overland flow and sewer flow routing methods of different complexity have been developed for urban catchments such as non linear reservoir method xiong and melching 2005 travel time based methods e g urban unit hydrographs rodriguez et al 2003 urban morpho climatic instantaneous unit hydrograph gironás et al 2009 hydraulic routing based on approximate analytical solutions of the diffusive wave model e g muskingum cunge method rodriguez et al 2008 flow path response function based mejía and moglen 2010 cantone and schmidt 2011 and coupled 1d sewer hydraulics and 2d overland flow hydrodynamic routing see barnard et al 2007 paz et al 2011 an explicit grid cell to grid cell flow routing method e g wigmosta et al 1994 wigmosta lettenmaier 1999 is also available in literature but the methods was applied mainly for natural watersheds rather than for urbanized catchments mays 2001 describes the diffusive wave model as the most useful among the approximations of the dynamic wave equation because it offers a balance between accuracy and simplicity for a large number of field situations borah 2011 suggested that models using approximate equations with analytical solutions may provide a balance between complexity and accuracy therefore evaluation of the performances of a spatially distributed p r model for simulation of integrated surface and subsurface hydrological processes for different land cover classes would be possible based on coupling to a simple runoff routing algorithm without including detailed sewer hydraulics contingent on availability of long hydro climatic records continuous hydrologic simulation based on seasonal long term or several concomitant extreme precipitation and runoff events are necessary for temporal validation of models better understanding of the precipitation runoff processes and the impacts of urbanization on the components of the urban hydrological cycle hydrological regime and water quality and for improved decision making in design and management of urban water infrastructure e g see fletcher et al 2013 however literature on temporal validation of urban p r models or tests for parameter transferability in time are not common and hence needs to be conducted the main objectives of the present study are i development calibration and validation of the performance of a high resolution spatially distributed model based on integrated surface and sub surface hydrological processes which dominate the urban precipitation water cycle e g surface depression storage infiltration infiltration excess surface runoff evapotranspiration snow accumulation and melt subsurface runoff etc using ground based observations of hydro climatic variables in a small urban stormwater catchment ii to estimate the effects of soil moisture and groundwater states pertinent to net contributions of subsurface runoff to peak flows in sewer pipes based on calibration of the p r model and iii to investigate the impacts of snowmelt in generating peak flows in sewer pipes during winter and spring ws seasons 2 study catchment and data the study site is a risvollan research catchment which is located at about 4 km southeast of the center of the city of trondheim in mid norway and established by the norwegian university of science and technology ntnu fig 1 the catchment drains a separate stormwater catchment of about 21 255 ha urban residential area located at ground elevations ranging from 85 to 134 masl in the present study we found that a spatial resolution of 5 m 5 m grid size is sufficient to represent the spatial variability of land use or land cover into 14 roofs or buildings 8 5 paved roads 41 open areas including grassland 35 built up areas e g lawns walkways parking spots playgrounds etc and 1 5 vegetation or trees fig 1 hence the discretization would also allow for spatially distributed simulation of state variables runoff and other fluxes accordingly in the present study we considered 22 5 of the catchment area including roofs or buildings and paved roads as impervious surfaces we considered the remaining 77 5 including open areas such as grassland built up areas and vegetation or trees as pervious surfaces the risvollan residential area was developed mainly in the 1970s based on aerial photographs of different periods there is very small land use change indicating that the land use map used in the present study is valid for our study period 1993 1998 we subdivided the catchment into 54 sub catchments ranging in size from 0 07 ha to 1 56 ha average 0 39 ha that are linked by a sewer drainage network containing 78 manholes and 78 stormwater pipes conduits conveying the flow to the outlet fig 1 the catchment has one gauging station near the outlet measuring precipitation p mm air temperature ta c solar radiation srin w m2 wind speed m s and relative humidity rhp fig 1 the precipitation gauge is an unshielded lambrecth tipping bucket having a heater when air temperature drops below freezing it records 0 1 mm of precipitation per tip the catchment receives precipitation mainly in the form of rainfall during may to september and mainly in the form of snowfall during november to march the mean annual precipitation for the catchment is about 985 mm we used climate data that are available at a temporal resolution of 2 min which agrees with the suggestions by schilling 1991 and berne et al 2004 for catchments with an order of 20 ha the available discharge data of 1 min resolution was converted to 2 min resolution to match with the climate data we used a simulation time step of 2 min for parameter calibration and validation we selected data from 1993 to 1998 which have no missing records of climate data and relatively low missing concurrent flow records and comprise four events e1 e4 summer autumn season sa1 and two winter spring snow influenced seasons ws1 and ws2 the percentages of missing flow records during the calibration periods ranges from 0 23 ws2 to 11 2 e4 the maximum 2 min observed precipitation volume ranges from 0 3 mm e3 and ws2 to 1 5 mm e1 the maximum precipitation intensities ranges from 9 mmh 1 ws2 to 45 mmh 1 e1 and the average precipitation intensities ranges from 0 08 mmh 1 sa1 to 1 56 mmh 1 e1 the ranges of observed air temperature are 2 9 28 9 c for the summer autumn seasons and from 20 7 c to 9 3 c for the winter spring seasons the peak observed flow in the sewer pipes ranges from are 130 3 ls 1 e4 to 432 34 ls 1 ws1 the spatially distributed p r model developed in the present study is applicable to any catchment size spatial and temporal resolutions and number of sub catchments 3 methods the spatially distributed p r model developed in the present study comprises of various sub models which are coded in the c programming language built to dynamic link libraries dlls and linked together in the enki see kolberg and bruland 2012 hydrological modelling platform the sub models include a model for computation of gridded fields of climate forcing from point gauge measurement gcf snow accumulation and melt model snow potential evapotranspiration pet model runoff response model rr and a runoff routing model based on the source to sink sts algorithm a flowchart depicting the connections among various sub models and the model structure for the runoff generation are respectively given in fig 2 a and b 3 1 gridded climate forcing gcf model the stormwater model developed in the present study has a separate sub model that is capable of modelling spatial variability of climate forcing by computing gridded climate forcing from several point gauge measurements based on advanced spatial interpolations however due to the availability of only one climate station in the catchment in the present study we used a simple algorithm that replicate the gauge measured values for each grid cell in the catchment in order to avoid unnecessary computational cost therefore in the present study there are uniform homogeneous fields of precipitation and other climate variables over the catchment which are valid for the small sized catchment of the present study for instance the station fulfills the requirement of gauge densities of 1 km2 per gauge and 2 km spatial resolution that was suggested appropriate respectively by schilling 1991 and berne et al 2004 3 2 snow accumulation and melt model snow there are three main snowmelt models in literature namely temperature index or degree day model energy balance models having one or more snowpack layer and combination of the two as hybrid models see a review by moghadas et al 2015 some p r models e g hspf model bicknell et al 2001 hbv light model seibert 2002 used the simplest snow model known as the temperature index model in the present study we used the degree day based model that includes parameterization of sub grid heterogeneity of snow cover by a statistical distribution tøfte and kolberg 2016 the method is similar to the snow routine of the hydrologiska byråns vattenballansavdelning or hbv model bergström 1976 but does not involve elevation zones within each grid cell rather the snow cover percentages of the spatial grid cell is defined by a statistical distribution described by five quantiles 00 25 50 75 and 100 which makes the snow cover in a grid cell to vary between 0 and 100 each quartile has three state variables namely snow water equivalent swe liquid water content of the snow pack and the sca the model requires inputs of precipitation and temperature time series simulates refreezing and melting and provides distributed water release from snowpack snowmelt rainfall as an output there are 10 calibrated parameters in the snow model including five snow redistribution weights for each quartile table 1 3 3 potential evapotranspiration pet model several urban surface energy balance models of different complexity and data requirements e g climate forcing data urban morphology surface properties anthropogenic heat sources etc are available in literature see a review by grimmond et al 2009 in the present study we used a simple approach based on the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 for the calculation of potential evapotranspiration pet mm the method uses solar radiation air temperature and relative humidity climate forcings and considers surface properties including albedo emissivity

s the net radiation rn w m2 is the sum of net shortwave radiation srn srin srout and the net longwave radiation lrn lrin lrout we estimated the reflected shortwave radiation srout based on albedos of the snow or land surface albs l we computed the lrin and lrout respectively based on sicart et al 2006 and stefan boltzmann equation by considering the atmospheric snow surface and land surface emissivity the δ pa k 1 is the slope of saturation vapor pressure of air esa curve we computed the esa pa and the psychrometric constant γ pa k 1 respectively based on koutsoyiannis 2012 and fao 56 method allen et al 1998 the priestley taylor constant α and albedo for the land surface albl are set by calibration the snow albedo is set as a state variable which varies with snow age and decays slowly during cold conditions ta 0 and decays fast during melt ta 0 respectively modified from baker et al 1990 and verseghy 1991 for instance as implemented in the gamma distributed snow depletion curve model see hegdahl et al 2016 2 alb s t 1 alb s t 0 5 alb max alb min δ t d dc s t a 0 alb s t alb min 2 δ t d dc f alb min t a 0 where albmax is maximum snow albedo 0 93 was used albmin is

in days d the snow albedo was set to increase during snowfall sn 0 by alb range albres d where albrange albmax albmin and albresd is a snowfall depth after which the snow albedo is reset to a fresh snow albedo and was determined by calibration we partitioned the precipitation p mm into snowfall sn mm and rainfall r mm based on the air temperature ta threshold temperature for 100 precipitation falling as rainfall tr and threshold temperature for 100 precipitation falling as snowfall ts following tarboton et al 1994 the tr and ts are determined by calibration the qg wm 2 is the ground heat

for the heat transfer and tsur is the surface temperature c the kth and dsoil are determined by calibration the surface temperature tsur is defined as a snow surface temperature tsn when the snow covered area sca 0 and by a land surface temperature tl when the sca 0 using empirical linear regression relationships the snow surface temperature was estimated from the dew temperature following raleigh et al 2013 and the land surface and soil temperatures were estimated from an air temperature following gallo et al 2011 to reduce the numbers of calibrated parameters the values of slope parameters are set to one while the intercept parameters are determined by calibration there are 12 calibrated parameters in the pet model table 1 3 4 runoff response model rr 3 4 1 surface depression storage evapotranspiration infiltration and infiltration excess surface runoff in the present study we conceptualized the catchment as three storage reservoirs surface depression soil moisture and groundwater each characterized by a state variable representing their respective water storage we considered the roofs or buildings and paved roads as impervious surfaces assuming a negligible infiltration following petrucci and bonhomme 2014 even if ragab et al 2003 reported that 6 9 of rainfall infiltrates through paved road surfaces and rodriguez et al 2008 reported that 11 6 of precipitation infiltrates through streets in the present study for the impervious surfaces only the surface runoff generation processes i e surface depression storage actual evaporation from the surface depression storage snow processes and infiltration excess surface runoff are modelled while the subsurface runoff processes are neglected and hence there is only one state variable namely the surface depression storage we updated the surface depression storage h after consecutively updating fluxes of snow outflow sof actual evaporation from the surface depression storage ae infiltration to the unsaturated soil i for pervious areas and infiltration excess surface runoff iexcsf 4 h t h t 1 s of ae i i exssf the actual evaporation from the surface depression storage was computed from the potential evapotranspiration and surface depression storage e g rutter et al 1971 rodriguez et al 2008 by parameterizing with a maximum surface depression storage parameter after which the actual evaporation occurs at a potential rate hmaxpet several algorithms are available to estimate infiltration rates for instance the green ampt method e g green and ampt 1911 camici et al 2011 horton s infiltration flux e g horton 1940 coutu et al 2012 philip s infiltration equation e g philip 1957 stewart et al 2013 and based on parameterizing by the maximum infiltration capacity in the present study we limited the infiltration flux from pervious areas either by the soil maximum infiltration capacity ic mm h parameter or by the surface depression storage h the ic was calibrated separately for open areas and vegetation or trees icp and built up areas icb several algorithms are available for computation of the infiltration excess surface flow iexssf for instance based on the manning s equation singh and aravamuthan 1996 du et al 2009 linear reservoir flow from surface depression storage e g coutu et al 2012 and threshold capacity for surface depression storage e g rodriguez et al 2008 in the present study we computed the iexssf based on a threshold maximum depression storage capacity parameter hmax after which the infiltration excess surface flow occurs following rodriguez et al 2008 the hmax was calibrated separately for open areas and trees or vegetation hmaxper built up areas hmaxbu and impervious areas hmaximp we neglected processes related to interception due to only small proportion 1 5 of the vegetation or trees in the catchment and lower magnitudes of fluxes associated to these processes in urban catchments e g see rodriguez et al 2008 3 4 2 subsurface runoff and saturation excess surface runoff we modelled the interflow runoff from the soil moisture percolation from soil moisture to groundwater perc and groundwater flow gf we updated the soil moisture storage ss and ground water storage gs state variables by consecutively updating the fluxes based on the following water balance equations 5 ss t ss t 1 i perc aet if 6 gs t gs t 1 perc gf we computed the actual evapotranspiration from the soil zone aet mm as 7 aet pet ae s r s r θ θ r n θ r where the sr is the degree of soil saturation θ is the initial volumetric soil water content θr is residual soil moisture content and n is soil porosity the θr and n are parameters determined by calibration to compute the percolation we used the van genuchten soil moisture characteristics functions van genuchten 1980 which is based on the sr saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and the soil pore size index m we computed the interflow from soil moisture if and groundwater flow gf based on conceptualizing the soil moisture storage and groundwater storage as linear reservoirs e g coutu et al 2012 8 if k soil ss δ t gf k gw gs δ t we parametrized net fractions of the interflow and groundwater flow entering the sewer pipes through cracks as effective calibrated parameters respectively denoted as pin and pdr we used the term net fraction since two way interaction i e both infiltration to the pipes and exfiltration from the pipes may occur however we assumed that infiltration to the pipes is higher than exfiltration from the pipes we computed the total runoff from the grid cell entering the stormwater sewer tf in mm as 9 t f i exssf s exssf ifsewer gfsewer ifsewer p in if gfsewer p dr gf where the ksoil s 1 kgw s 1 are parameters determined by calibration saturation excess surface flow sexssf from pervious grids occur when the ss ssmax or the total subsurface storage ts ss gs tsmax ssmax gsmax the gsmax and tsmax respectively are the maximum ground water storage and total subsurface storage capacities which are set as effective parameters and determined by calibration there are 16 calibrated parameters in the rr model table 1 3 5 source to sink runoff routing model sts we used the flow path response function based on an analytical solution to the diffusion wave equation hayami 1951 nauman 1981 to route the generated runoff from the grid cells or sources to the outlet or sink following the flow path response function and the source to sink sts routing algorithm e g olivera and maidment 1999 the total flow travel length for the grid cells is the sum of flow length over the surface before entering the manholes or flow travel length outside the pipes flop and the flow length inside the pipes to the outlet flp the flop was computed based on sub catchment area asc and a shape factor sf parameter following guo and urbonas 2009 10 fl op a sc sf 0 5 where the sf was set as an effective calibrated parameter used for all sub catchments the size of the sub catchment and an effective calibrated shape factor parameter would determine flop for each sub catchment therefore the flop for the sub catchments were used for all grid cells in the sub catchments i e the same entry time or inlet time to the conduits is assumed for all grid cells within the sub catchment owing to the small sized sub catchments ranging from 0 07 ha to 1 56 ha average 0 39 ha the assumption of the same entry time or inlet time for all grid cells within the sub catchment is plausible in the present study as it would have only a slight effect on the total travel time and the flow path response function in the source to sink runoff routing used in the present study the flop was computed based on areas of the sub catchments and parameterization by an effective or calibrated shape factor parameter while the effects of roads and buildings were considered in delineation of areas of the sub catchments in the cases of 1d 2d modelling of surface runoff or flood inundation and computation of the flop by tracing the flow paths from grid cells to the outlet of their respective sub catchments or manholes by using the explicit grid cell to grid cell flow routing method e g wigmosta et al 1994 wigmosta lettenmaier 1999 the effects of buildings and roads on the flow direction and hence the flop need to be considered the total flow travel time for each grid cell to the outlet ti was obtained by summing the travel time for the surface flow the entry time or inlet time and flow travel time inside the sewer pipes if spatially and temporally invariant celerity and dispersion coefficient are assumed the instantaneous runoff generated at the source are related to the outlet response by a unit flow path response function or ui t 1 t see

flow travel lengths over the surface and inside the pipes the vop and vp respectively are velocities of surface flow and pipe flow and the dop and dp respectively are dispersion coefficients for surface and pipe flows the flow path response function for a grid cell i represents the probability distribution of flow travel time t from the source grid cell to the sink outlet with a mean value of ti the flow path peclet number πi is a representative measure of the relative importance of advection with respect to dispersion where the flow dispersion coefficients represent the effects of storage and spreading in the present study all the grid cells in a sub catchment j have the same flow path response function due to assuming the same entry time for all grid cells in a sub catchment j and hence the numbers of response functions are equal to the number of sub catchments the assumption is also computationally feasible compared to computing distributed flow path response functions for each grid cell i by computing the flop for each grid cell using flow direction maps which leads to 8502 flow path response functions in the present study the velocities of flow and dispersion coefficients are effective parameters determined by calibration for a spatially distributed linear system subdivided into uniform non overlapping sub areas e g olivera and maidment 1999 the runoff routing can be performed by the following convolution 12 q sim t 1000 δ t i 1 n t fvol u i t where qsim t l s is a sts routed simulated discharge n is the total number of grid cells in the catchment tfvol m3 is the total generated runoff volume during the time step for the grid cell and is the convolution operator there are 5 calibrated parameters in the sts flow routing model table 1 4 parameter identification for parameter calibration we used a random monte carlo mc procedure based on sampling of each parameter from uniform distributions defined by minimum and maximum values of respective parameters to identify parameter sets that provide the best performance measure the focus of the urban stormwater modelling in the present study is better simulation of peak flows for estimation of urban flood and flood risk management therefore we used the nash sutcliffe efficiency or nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 performance measure which is based on the sum of squared residuals and hence gives more weights to peak flows the nse defines an aggregated measure of how well the simulated flow at the outlet of the sewer network qsim reproduces the corresponding observed flow time series qobs 13 nse 1 i 1 n q obsi q simi 2 i 1 n q obsi q obsavg 2 descriptions of the calibrated parameters and their minimum and maximum values for the mc sampling are given in table 1 5 results 5 1 calibration and validation performance of the model in terms of the nse during calibration and validation periods are given in table 2 the calibration provided good nse values ranging from 0 65 to 0 94 performance of the model are varying among the validation periods table 2 the validation performance is good for some events and the seasonal calibration during the summer autumn season the validation results for the snow influenced seasons ws1 and ws2 are better than the other periods the results indicate that simulation of snowmelt dominated runoff and or longer records are more validated than runoff occurring from shorter rainfall events the event e3 09 06 1995 11 06 1995 and the seasonal sa1 01 06 1995 01 10 1995 found to be better recipients of the transferred parameters than the other periods which probably show that the 1995 data may exhibit a better quality plots of hydrographs of observed flow qobs and routed simulated flow qsim and some unrouted generated runoff fluxes for the event based calibrations are given in fig 3 a d respectively for e1 e2 e3 and e4 plots of the simulated and observed flow hydrographs along with other variables related to the snow model for ws1 and ws2 for the seasonal calibrations sa1 ws1 and ws2 respectively are given in fig 4 a c plots of the dominant generated runoff fluxes unrouted for sa1 ws1 and ws2 are given respectively in fig 5 a c the observed and simulated hydrographs exhibit good agreement the hydrographs indicate that the urban catchment responds quickly to rainfall or snowmelt events and the infiltration excess surface runoff iexssf is the main runoff generating mechanism contributing to the peak flows the results also indicate that a subsurface flow from the soil moisture zone or the interflow if is contributing to the sewer flow ifsewer and augments the peak flows and sustains base flows while the contribution to the peak flows is more relevant to design flood and flood risk management in urban catchments for instance the calibrated values of the pin implies that 19 40 23 7 19 30 and 47 of the if contributes to the flow in the sewer pipes ifsewer respectively for e1 e2 e3 e4 sa1 ws1 and ws2 while the remaining interflow would contribute to the natural subsurface drainage or storage system calibration results for the snow seasons ws1 and ws2 fig 4b and c show that when the observed air temperature is well above freezing 0 c there are generally higher values of the snowoutflow sof the swe recedes and the sca decreases the temperature index based snow model underestimates the peak flows for the ws2 the simulated peak flow rate qsimpeak 149 9 ls 1 and the observed peak flow rate qobspeak 206 5 ls 1 while it overestimates the peakiest flow during the present study very slightly which corresponds to the ws1 qsimpeak 462 8 ls 1 and qobspeak 432 3 ls 1 the results indicated that the performance of the snow model used in the present study is generally good 5 2 fluxes and water balance the total observed precipitation and flow and total simulated volumes of the different fluxes and change in total catchment storage all expressed in mm over the catchment and ratios of the different fluxes and the precipitation falling over the catchment during the calibration periods are given in table 3 the total observed precipitation p ranges from 16 7 mm e4 to 566 8 mm ws1 the simulated runoff at the outlet of sewer pipes qsim ranges from 3 95 mm e4 to 320 24 mm ws1 in the present study we used the linear interpolation for filling of the missing records for the calibration periods with small proportion of missing flow records i e e1 e2 e3 and ws2 in order to estimate the total volume of observed runoff qobs at the outlet of the sewer network for these calibration periods the qsim qobs ranges from 78 83 ws2 to 91 92 e1 indicating that the model underestimates the runoff volume by up to 20 probably the underestimation is mainly attributed to the peak flows for instance the qobspeak qsimpeak indicated that the peak flow rate is underestimated by up to 38 the qobspeak qsimpeak for the calibration periods e4 sa1 and ws1 for which no filling of missing observations were performed and hence the peak flow observations are probably missing are respectively 0 82 1 04 and 0 93 the simulated total runoff qt ranges from 13 32 mm e4 to 565 06 mm ws1 the differences between the p and qt represent the loss by the total evapotranspiration et and or contribution to an increase in total storage volume or δtots for e1 e3 e4 and ws2 however for e2 sa1 and ws1 there is a decrease in δtots which contributed to the qt and the et demand the total simulated surface runoff qtsurface enters the sewer pipes through the manholes and the calibration provided values ranging from 1 29 mm e1 to 208 55 mm ws1 the total simulated subsurface runoff qtsubsurface volume ranges from 10 08 mm e4 to 356 5 mm ws1 while the volume of subsurface runoff contribution to the sewer flow qtsubsurfacesewer ranges only from 0 71 mm e4 to 107 08 mm ws1 the calibration provided no saturation excess surface flow satexssf and negligible groundwater flow gf and hence there is no contribution of the satexssf and there is negligible contribution of the gfsewer to the flow in the sewer pipes during all calibration periods the percentages of precipitation volume that is transformed to total runoff volume and other fluxes are varying among the calibration periods the higher percentage of precipitation occurring as qtsurface corresponds to the ws1 36 79 while the lower corresponds to the sa1 3 16 considerable percentages of precipitation p infiltrates and contributes to the qtsubsurface for instance the lower is 60 38 for e4 and the higher is 78 83 for sa1 the infiltrated runoff volume contributes mainly to the interflow from the soil moisture unsaturated zone and negligible amount is percolating to the ground water zone resulting in negligible gf and gfsewer the percentage of precipitation that is transformed to the qt is high for instance ranges from 79 77 for e4 and nearly 100 for ws1 the lower value for e4 is related to high contribution of the precipitation volume to the increase in the δtots and the higher value for the ws1 is because of the low evapotranspiration demand during the snow season and runoff contribution from the decrease in the δtots that is dominated by the snow water equivalent the percentage of precipitation lost to the total evapotranspiration is less than 3 for the events e1 e4 and for snow seasons ws1 and ws2 while it amounts to about 18 during the summer and autumn seasons sa1 the percentage of precipitation volume contributing to the flow in the sewer pipes qsim p ranges from 17 83 sa1 to 56 50 ws1 while the ratios of observed flow and precipitation volumes qobs p ranges from 23 32 e1 to 67 43 ws2 table 3 these qobs p results are slightly higher than their corresponding qsim p the higher qsim p values are mainly related to the snow seasons due to low evapotranspiration demand and relatively higher contributions to the sewer pipes from both surface and subsurface runoff while the lower value of qsim p is related to the warmer summer autumn season having high evapotranspiration loss and low surface runoff contribution the results indicate that considering the snow evapotranspiration and surface depression storage processes would be important in sizing of sewer pipes the qsim p values for e1 and sa1 are found to be less than the precipitation volume falling on the impervious surfaces since the percentage of impervious surfaces in the catchment is 22 5 and infiltration was not allowed on the impervious surfaces this is due to a large actual evaporation loss ae from surface depression storage for the sa1 and the precipitation volume contributes to an increase in surface depression storage volume for the e1 indicating that the impact of depression storage on the runoff volume is high in event based runoff simulation and the impact of evaporation loss on the runoff volume is high for long term simulation during warmer seasons the percentage of total simulated runoff qt contributing to the qsim ranges from 21 75 sa1 to 58 49 ws2 while the higher percentage is related to higher contribution of the qtsubsurfacesewer to the qsim for most of the calibration periods for instance for e1 e2 e3 sa1 and ws2 the percentage contributions of subsurface runoff to the flow in the sewer pipes are found to be higher than the contributions from the surface runoff 5 3 runoff routing plots of mean flow travel times to the outlet for the subcatchments or ti which was obtained from the calibrated parameters of velocity of flow outside sewer pipes vop and velocity of flow inside sewer pipes vp are given in fig 6 a the calibration resulted in different values of the mean flow travel time for the sub catchments with e3 having the largest travel time slow runoff response ranging from 3 3 min to 29 28 min and e4 having the smallest flow travel time quick runoff response ranging from 1 74 min to 7 03 min the quick runoff response for e4 may be related to the higher average rainfall intensity for e4 but no general trend is observed between either of the maximum or average precipitation intensities and the flow travel time catchments with larger flow travel lengths to the outlet over the surface and inside the pipes exhibit higher mean flow travel time due to parameterizing the flow velocities as effective parameters and hence the same values are applied to all sub catchments and sewer pipes the calibration periods also exhibit different runoff delay since the sts response function is dependent on the ti and the flow path peclet number πi which are found to be different among the calibration periods plots of typical sts response functions for the ws1 calibration for some subcatchments are given in fig 6b 6 discussion 6 1 calibration and validation the nse performance measure for the event and seasonal calibration periods of 0 65 0 94 that are obtained in the present study table 2 are better than or within the ranges of the performance measures obtained from calibration of p r models in urban catchments using flow as a target variable in previous studies e g berthier et al 2004 nse 0 77 valeo and ho 2004 nse 0 12 0 74 rodriguez et al 2005b nse 0 54 easton et al 2007 nse for the full urban model 0 71 0 85 rodriguez et al 2008 nse 0 51 and 0 54 gironás et al 2009 modified coefficient of efficiency or mce 0 52 0 82 mejía and moglen 2010 nse 0 42 0 96 and coutu et al 2012 nse 0 73 thorough temporal validation of urban p r models are not common in previous studies however some studies which conducted validation tests reported acceptable validation performance e g coutu et al 2012 nse 0 73 gironás et al 2009 mce 0 52 to 0 82 mejía and moglen 2010 nse 0 57 0 74 in the present study the validation performance vary among the parameter transfer between the different periods while generally the nse for the validation periods are good for the snow influenced ws seasons and for long term seasonal calibration than the event based periods table 2 therefore the present study indicated that parameter calibration and validation of the p r models based on long records spanning the entire range of rainfall and runoff in the catchment peak flow medium flow low flow rainfall dominated runoff snowmelt dominated runoff etc or continuous simulation are necessary for reliable model evaluation and decision making therefore longer hydro climatic measurements are important for urban catchments 6 2 fluxes and water balance the observed flow and precipitation records and the corresponding simulations indicated that lower for instance as low as 23 32 for e1 and 17 83 for sa1 of precipitation volumes are transformed respectively to observed and simulated flow volumes at the outlet of sewer drainage network table 3 the simulation indicated that the differences are because of only a lower proportion of the total subsurface runoff qtsubsurface contributes to the flow in the sewer pipes qtsubsurfacesewer the precipitation contributes to a marked increase in the water storage volume in the catchment e g for e1 and satisfies the marked evaporation demand during the warm season sa1 the lowest percentage of precipitation volume that is transformed to the total simulated runoff volume qt in the catchment of 79 77 corresponding to the e4 table 3 indicate that the maximum percentage loss to evaporation and increase in catchment storage is only about 20 therefore the lower volume of qsim compared to p is mainly attributed to the lower proportion of the total subsurface runoff volume qtsubsurface contributing to the qtsubsurfacesewer through cracked pipes the results of the present study agrees with berthier et al 2004 who found that the soil contributes an average of 14 of the total per event runoff volume rodriguez et al 2008 who found that 29 1 of the precipitation volume contributes to stormwater and wastewater sewer systems and dirckx et al 2009 and weiß et al 2002 who found that there is 50 70 contribution to the dry weather combined sewer flow from groundwater infiltration the results of the present study illustrated that subsurface runoff contribution to flow in sewer drainage network should not be conceptualized in a way that the whole generated subsurface runoff in the stormwater catchment drains to the sewer pipes since only part of the subsurface runoff contribute to the flow in the artificial stormwater sewer network through cracks or joints while the higher proportion of subsurface runoff would drain to the natural drainage or storage system parameter calibration of the urban p r models based on conceptualizing that the total generated subsurface runoff from catchments draining to the stormwater sewer network would contribute to flow in the sewer pipes e g rodriguez et al 2008 coutu et al 2012 may result in overestimation of evapotranspiration loss and simulated flow volumes and flow rates despite only partial contribution of the generated subsurface flow to the sewer pipes was allowed in the present study there are higher contributions of subsurface runoff to the sewer pipes compared to the surface runoff for most of the calibration periods table 3 this indicate that it is important to model the entire urban precipitation water cycle by including the subsurface hydrological processes as suggested in previous studies e g joss et al 2008 dirckx et al 2009 weiß et al 2002 zhu et al 2016 to determine the contributions from subsurface runoff to peak flows in sewer pipes for sizing the capacity of sewer pipes and urban flood risk management rather than based on only contribution from the surface runoff in the present study the p r model underestimated the qsim by up to 20 and the peak flow rate by about 38 ws2 the highest underestimations are related to winter spring seasons that are dominated by the snow processes which is probably due to low performance of the snow model which is based only on air temperature however the snow model slightly i e by 7 overestimated the peakiest flow rate of the present study which is associated to the ws1 calibration period qsimpeak 462 8 ls 1 and qobspeak 432 3 ls 1 several studies valeo and ho 2004 bengtsson and semádeni davies 2011 moghadas et al 2015 noted that there are several factors affecting the snow processes in urban catchments related to the effects of snow ploughing and piling on snow accumulation and melt the effects of road salt applications on snowmelt from impervious areas spatial heterogeneities in surface albedo temporal variations in solar radiation effects of buildings on wind and solar exposure and hence on atmospheric heat exchange and snowmelt rates the peakiest observed flow rate of 432 3 ls 1 for the ws1 in the present study indicate that snowmelt or rainfall on snowmelt induced urban runoff during the winter spring ws seasons may result in the peakiest flow rates in the catchment that could be important for reliable determination of the capacity of sewer pipes therefore determination of design floods by including simulation of urban floods during snow influenced seasons would be required for cold climate regions as suggested by watt and marsalek 2013 hence improved simulation of snowmelt influenced runoff through comparative evaluation of the performances of the simple to more complex urban snow models would be necessary the slight underestimation of peak flows in the present study may also be related to spatial variability of precipitation within the catchment that could not be captured by the single climate station located near the outlet of the catchment despite the spatially distributed model developed in the present study is capable of modelling the spatial variability of climate forcing it was utilized mainly for representation of the spatial distribution of imperviousness e g see mejía and moglen 2010 by classifying the land use or land cover into roofs buildings paved roads built up areas and open areas and then to model the hydrological processes accordingly the precipitation records from the single station should provide reasonable results for the small size catchment used in the present study based on recommendations from previous studies e g schilling 1991 berne et al 2004 bruni et al 2015 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 however parameter calibration and investigation of the urban hydrological processes using dense precipitation gauges would be important for better representation of the spatial variability of precipitation in medium to large urban catchments in the present study there is no saturation excess surface runoff which agrees with previous studies that neglect this runoff generating mechanism in urban catchments e g rodriguez et al 2008 coutu et al 2012 the catchment soil moisture state never reached the full saturation level i e ss ssmax during the calibration periods therefore the infiltration process from the previous surfaces was found to be governed by the infiltration capacity of the surfaces and not by the soil moisture state from below however the infiltration modelling used in the present study is based on parametrizing by the infiltration capacity parameters for pervious surfaces and hence dominant influence of the infiltration capacity of the surface is expected the infiltrated water volume resulting in the qtsubsurface qtsubsurface p 60 38 78 83 agree with rodriguez et al 2008 who found that the i p of 60 1 for natural surfaces and 71 7 for the total catchment by allowing infiltration on roofs and street surfaces based on their urban hydrological elements uhe based distributed model in the present study the interaction between the groundwater flow and the sewer pipes was found to be negligible due to the negligible percolation even if the percolation was computed before computation of the interflow from soil moisture storage the p r model in the present study is not capable of simulating the groundwater levels moreover it is not easy to know the exact locations of the two way interactions between the subsurface runoff and cracked sewer pipes therefore the subsurface model structure of the present study can be simplified to a single subsurface storage and subsurface runoff component interacting with the flow in the sewer pipes that would also allow reducing the number of calibrated parameters in the runoff response routine in the present study the total evapotranspiration is dominated by actual evaporation from surface depression storage ae rather than the evapotranspiration from the soil moisture aet which does not agree with rodriguez et al 2008 who found that there is marked transpiration t from the vadose zone from natural surfaces t p 43 5 while the surface evaporation is relatively low the difference occurred due to the low evapotranspiration from the soil moisture storage for the cold climate region of the present study and probably due to the conceptualization that the total generated subsurface runoff contribute to flow in the sewer pipes in rodriguez et al 2008 and hence the calibration had to overestimate the transpiration loss from the vadose zone to provide better performance measure the present study indicated that there is a marked total evapotranspiration loss only for the warm seasons calibration i e et p 18 18 for sa1 which agrees with ragab et al 2003 who found for an urban catchment in wallingford united kingdom that 21 24 of annual rainfall evaporates and ramier et al 2011 who found for urban catchment in france that evaporation losses represent 20 of the total rainfall the present study indicated that the effects of surface depression storage on generated runoff volume is high for the event based calibration than the long term seasonal calibrations while the effect of surface water storage in terms of the snow water equivalent swe is obviously high for the snow influenced seasons 6 3 runoff routing for runoff routing the flow travel length estimated for the sub catchments were used for all grid cells in the sub catchments assuming the same entry time to the conduits for all grid cells within each sub catchment in addition an effective calibrated shape factor sf parameter was used for all sub catchments and hence the flow travel length outside the pipes for the sub catchments are dependent only on the areas of the sub catchments despite these simplifications the flow path response function based on an analytical solution to the diffusion wave equation and the source to sink sts used in the present study was found to provide an acceptable runoff delay in the stormwater network and hence reliable simulation of peak flows which agrees with mays 2001 and borah 2011 who suggested the diffusion wave equation and its analytical solutions as a balance between complexity and accuracy and mejía and moglen 2010 and cantone and schmidt 2011 who reported good performances of the runoff routing algorithm for urban catchments however the calibration resulted in different values of the runoff routing parameters for the calibration periods which resulted in different mean flow travel times peclet numbers and hence the sts response functions for the sub catchments among the calibration periods this may affect the temporal validation transferability of calibrated parameters of the routing model among the calibration periods which may require investigation of the effects on the validation of the transferability of runoff generation and runoff routing parameters separately 7 conclusions the present study presented a high spatial temporal resolution spatially distributed precipitation runoff p r modelling in cold climate region by modelling the interaction between the surface depression storage and soil storage with the atmosphere in terms of evapotranspiration flux the calibration indicated that the impact of surface depression storage on the simulated runoff volume in the sewer pipes is high for event based simulation while the impact of evapotranspiration is high only for the long term seasonal simulation during warmer summer autumn seasons there is marked proportion of infiltrated water contributing to generation of subsurface runoff parameterization of a two way interaction between the subsurface runoff and the flow in the sewer pipes indicated that there is considerable contribution of subsurface runoff to the flow in the artificial sewer drainage system the present study indicated that in most of the cases the contribution of the subsurface runoff to the flow in the sewer pipes is higher than the contribution of surface runoff and hence runoff simulation for estimation of floods for design and management of water infrastructure need to be based on an integrated modelling of surface runoff and subsurface runoff components of the urban precipitation water cycle the study for the snow influenced winter spring periods indicated that the peakiest flow rate in cold climates may be associated to the snowmelt or rainfall on snowmelt events and hence estimation of urban floods need to include simulation of urban runoff during snow influenced seasons the high spatial temporal resolution distributed urban p r model is important for better representation of the spatial distribution of precipitation and land use land cover in the catchment for better simulation of runoff response and hence for estimation of design flood for evaluation of performances of different stormwater management techniques e g the lid and for assessment of the impacts of land use and climate change the contribution of the present study is a high resolution distributed p r modelling for better representation of spatial heterogeneity of the land cover information and integrated modelling of the surface and subsurface components of the urban precipitation water cycle however there are several urban hydrological hydraulic conditions and uncertainties associated to the p r modelling that need further investigation contingent on further data availability or data acquisition i the effects of feedback mechanisms between all aspects of urban water cycle including leakages from water supply systems and faulty or illegal connections between the wastewater and stormwater systems ii the parameterization for a two way interaction between the subsurface runoff and sewer pipes of the present study do not involve information on the elevations of the sewer pipes and groundwater level and actual locations of the interactions while the latter is practically not easy to identify in a field iii there are large numbers of calibrated parameters in the present study related to the issues of parameter uncertainty and identifiability which were not objectives of the present study and hence efforts for model parsimony by reducing the numbers of calibrated parameters based on parameter sensitivity analyses and assessment of parameter uncertainty are important and iv the routing algorithm of the present study does not involve detailed analyses of hydraulics of sewer and surface inundation hence coupling of the spatially distributed runoff generation model to models that can perform detailed hydraulics like the swmm runoff routing engine may be important for detailed hydraulic studies including sewer surcharge combined sewer overflows surface inundation

7512,reliable runoff estimation is important for design of water infrastructure and flood risk management in urban catchments we developed a spatially distributed precipitation runoff p r model that explicitly represents the land cover information performs integrated modelling of surface and subsurface components of the urban precipitation water cycle and flow routing we conducted parameter calibration and validation for a small 21 255 ha stormwater catchment in trondheim city during summer autumn events and season and snow influenced winter spring seasons at high spatial and temporal resolutions of respectively 5 m 5 m grid size and 2 min the calibration resulted in good performance measures nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 65 0 94 and acceptable validation nse for the seasonal and snow influenced periods the infiltration excess surface runoff dominates the peak flows while the contribution of subsurface flow to the sewer pipes also augments the peak flows based on the total volumes of simulated flow in sewer pipes qsim and precipitation p during the calibration periods the qsim p ranges from 21 44 for an event to 56 50 for the winter spring season which are in close agreement with the observed volumes qobs p the lowest percentage of precipitation volume that is transformed to the total simulated runoff in the catchment qt is 79 77 computation of evapotranspiration et indicated that the et p is less than 3 for the events and snow influenced seasons while it is about 18 for the summer autumn season the subsurface flow contribution to the sewer pipes are markedly higher than the total surface runoff volume for some events and the summer autumn season the peakiest flow rates correspond to the winter spring season therefore urban runoff simulation for design and management purposes should include two way interactions between the subsurface runoff and flow in sewer pipes and snow influenced seasons the developed urban p r model is useful for better computation of runoff generated from different land cover for assessments of stormwater management techniques e g the low impact development or lid and the impacts of land cover and climate change there are some simplifications or limitations such as the runoff routing does not involve detailed sewer hydraulics effects of leakages from water supply systems and faulty illegal

distributed precipitation runoff modelling stormwater sewer risvollan source to sink flow routing calibration and validation 1 introduction increasing trends of world population e g united nations 2010 and hence land use modification due to urbanization e g defries and eshleman 2004 indicate that there is a need for sustainable design and management of urban water infrastructure urbanization affects the hydrology of urban catchments and hence water management related to flooding and safety of humans and infrastructure risks of pollution of ground water and receiving surface water bodies from leakage and overflow of sewer systems however the impacts of urbanization on the different components of urban hydrologic cycle is complex see delleur 2003 several studies investigated the major impacts of urbanization on runoff such as increase in runoff peaks runoff volume and runoff ratio e g cheng and wang 2002 shuster et al 2005 burns et al 2005 dietz and clausen 2008 valtanen et al 2014 guan et al 2016 change in hydrological regimes e g braud et al 2013 decrease in runoff response time burns et al 2005 effects on the long term groundwater recharge and water balance haase 2009 barron et al 2013 decrease in base flow lee et al 2008 hamel et al 2013 alteration in water quality of receiving water bodies due to runoff from paved surfaces stormwater plumes and combined sewer overflows e g water temperature herb et al 2009 nutrients and toxicants owens and walling 2002 walsh et al 2005 jacobson 2011 suggested that integration of current fields of research are needed to enhance our understanding of the changes which urbanization bring to urban catchments and to facilitate the development of planning strategies to minimize the negative impacts of future urban growth reliable estimation of runoff is required for design of stormwater systems and end to pipe and source control freni et al 2010 stormwater management techniques fletcher et al 2013 studied the considerable impacts of urban hydrology on receiving waters and noted that the variability and complexity of rainfall runoff response in urban areas needs further research therefore distributed urban p r models are useful tools for improved decision support in design and management of urban water infrastructure in terms of both water quality and quantity through better understanding of the hydrological processes prevailing in extreme runoff generation how the quantity of generated runoff in urban catchments is affected by precipitation characteristics rainfall and snowmelt events catchment soil moisture groundwater storage performances of different source control stormwater management strategies assessment of the impacts of land use and climate change two way interactions between sewer networks and subsurface flows etc however calibration and validation of urban p r models is challenging and require thorough studies in different urban setting and climate regimes mainly due to i urban catchments and urban water cycle are highly complex and heterogeneous due to the anthropogenic impacts such as modification in land cover soil properties flow paths etc and hence urban p r modelling require high resolution spatial information in order to consider the spatial variability of pluviometric and physiographic characteristics ii increase in runoff response or flashiness of urban catchments resulting from marked increase of impervious surfaces and alteration from the natural hydrological pathways to hydraulically efficient artificial drainage require simulation of rainfall runoff dynamics in urban catchments from high temporal resolution and good quality hydro climatic records iii lack of complete knowledge on the effects of various urban hydrological processes on the generated runoff volume such as snowmelt evapotranspiration and two way interactions between the subsurface runoff and flow in the sewer pipes several urban hydrological models have been developed for simulation of runoff quantity and water quality in urban catchments see a review by elliott and trowsdale 2007 the vast majority of urban precipitation runoff models used simplified algorithms for computations of runoff from the catchments and mainly focused on hydraulic computations e g flow routing through the pipe network probably being open source and its suitability for a wide ranges of applications the semi distributed storm water management model swmm huber and dickinson 1988 rossman 2004 is widely applied see rossman et al 2005 for event or continuous runoff simulation e g denault et al 2006 krebs et al 2014 guan et al 2015 guan et al 2016 however the swmm model is a semi distributed sub catchment based model that computes the generated runoff based on identifying percent of sub catchment areas that are impervious despite the model is capable of performing detailed sewer hydraulic calculations it has limitations that it cannot adequately capture the spatial distribution of runoff contributing areas i e exact locations in the sub catchments that generate urban runoff are not known for the inherently spatially heterogeneous urban catchments e g balascio et al 1998 similarly some 1d 2d hydro dynamically coupled urban models which allows for detailed hydraulic calculations and flow routing e g paz et al 2011 used a lumped rainfall runoff model for runoff computation which cannot adequately capture the spatial distribution of runoff contributing areas domingo et al 2010 applied a distributed 3d hydrologic model mike she coupled to a 1d hydrodynamic pipe flow model mouse however the authors considered the precipitation evaporation and infiltration processes in the distributed hydrologic model only for the previous areas while they considered rainfall runoff processes from the impervious areas in the pipe flow model using simplified approaches there are also commercial software that can perform 1d pipe flow and 2d grid cells distributed overland flow modelling for instance tuflow flood modeller pro mike urban mike flood infoworks and xp swmm see phillips et al 2005 syme 2008 despite their wide functionality for decision support in planning design and management of urban water infrastructure these models do not compute contributions of subsurface flow to the urban flooding they are not freely available and they probably lack flexibility of allowing researchers for modification of codes for instance to investigate the performance of different model structures equations etc therefore there is a need for study based on distributed modelling of the dominant surface and subsurface precipitation runoff processes for different land cover classes since hydrologic processes are also important factors affecting the urban flooding such study is expected to provide reliable computations of runoff generation than the semi distributed and lumped computations and distributed runoff computations that neglect contributions of the subsurface runoff to flow in the stormwater pipes in addition distributed models allow for explicit representation of the spatial distribution of low impact development lid urban stormwater drainage systems zoppou 2001 reviewed urban storm water models and noted that the spatial and temporal variability in rainfall is not adequately considered in the urban stormwater models elga et al 2015 suggested that future urban models should consider spatial temporal variability process interactions flexibility and uncertainty reduction the authors reported that only about 36 of the analyzed modelling approaches are spatially distributed with spatial resolution ranging from 3 m to 10 km however fully distributed models where the model parameters and runoff routing are distributed would entail more complexity and overparameterization such models may be useful for special research purposes but may not be useful for practical application for design and management purposes e g see grayson et al 1992 brooks et al 2007 spatially distributed models would allow explicit representation of the grid to grid variability of land cover information opposed to the semi distributed models which represent the spatial variability of the land cover in terms of percentages of impervious and pervious areas of the sub catchments or the homogeneous units hu because of the spatially heterogeneous nature of urbanized watersheds where the land cover are varying at a fine spatial scale distributed models are required to characterize the distribution of hydrologic processes easton et al 2007 the spatially distributed models are more responsive to changes in catchment characteristics and are useful for scenario studies like the impacts of land cover and climate change on urban runoff generation and on the urban water cycle in general cuo et al 2008 applied a physical based distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm for urban catchment and reported that the model facilitate prediction and or reconstruction of a range of historic and future changes in land cover due to urbanization or other factors rodriguez et al 2000 evaluated a distributed model for urban catchments using a 7 year continuous data series and found that the model provides a correct description of the temporal variations in the runoff coefficient mejía and moglen 2010 and jacobson 2011 illustrated the influential effects of the spatial distribution of imperviousness on the hydrologic response of an urbanized basin and the need for detailed characterization of urban areas petrucci and bonhomme 2014 based on simulation of runoff quantity and quality using the semi distributed swmm model and different representation of spatial variability by increasing use of geographical information found that the land use classification provides the highest benefit to improve model performances the spatially distributed models are also suitable for using spatially distributed rainfall input like radar rainfall data e g pan et al 2012 a review paper by thorndahl et al 2017 or for spatial interpolation of climate forcing from point gauge measurements the models also allow for distributed simulations of urban water storage states such as surface depression storage soil moisture and groundwater and fluxes such as infiltration evapotranspiration and runoff for instance for modelling of runoff and pollutant production from variable source areas e g easton et al 2007 the spatial variability of both rainfall and catchment soil moisture state affect urban runoff generation and hence studying the effects of antecedent soil moisture on urban runoff generation is important in addition spatially distributed simulations of snow accumulation and melt processes is useful for urban p r modelling in cold regions urban p r modelling based on high temporal resolution is also important due to quick runoff response of urban catchments related to modification of land cover e g increase in imperviousness relatively small catchment size high velocity of flow in conduits and high spatial variability of precipitation excess a review by elga et al 2015 identified that the most time steps used for urban runoff simulation are 1 h 25 and 1 day 20 which limit the models from accurately characterizing the fast components of urban fluxes however schilling 1991 recommended rainfall data requirements for urban hydrology application for proof evaluation analysis and operation of sewers at a temporal resolution of less than 5 min and spatial resolution of 1 km2 per gauge for a mediterranean climate berne et al 2004 suggested that the required resolution for rainfall measurements is about 1 min and 1 5 km and about 2 min and 2 km respectively for catchments smaller than 10 ha and the order of 20 ha bruni et al 2015 noted that temporal resolution aggregation of rainfall inputs resulted in time shift in modelled flow peaks by several minutes but the sensitivity to temporal resolution of rainfall inputs was low compared to that of the spatial resolution ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 found that for drainage areas between 1 ha and about 100 ha rainfall inputs at a spatial resolution of 500 m appear to be sufficient while acceptable hydraulic performance is still obtained for rainfall estimates at 1 km and 1 min resolution therefore hydro climatic input data and runoff simulation at high temporal resolution e g less than the time of concentration of the catchment and response times of the sub catchments is very important for better understanding and prediction of the runoff response in urban catchments in addition to the infiltration process processes such as surface depression storage evapotranspiration and snow accumulation and melt also influence the urban water cycle previous studies e g marsalek et al 2007 fassman beck et al 2013 found that there is a variability in the amount of surface depression water storage capacity and the process of depressing filling in natural surfaces and impervious surfaces including roofs several studies e g grimmond and oke 1991 rodriguez et al 2008 fletcher et al 2013 illustrated that there is a need for better estimation of hydrological fluxes from the surface to the atmosphere or evapotranspiration in urban areas ragab et al 2003 found that 21 24 of the annual rainfall over the study catchment in wallingford city united kingdom evaporated for urban catchment in france ramier et al 2011 found that evaporation losses represent 20 of the total rainfall several studies e g valeo and ho 2004 bengtsson and semádeni davies 2011 moghadas et al 2015 have discussed the importance of modelling the snow accumulation and melt processes in urban catchments in cold regions on their critical review of the evolution of the design storm event concept watt and marsalek 2013 suggested that there might be two drainage design events for pipe and storage sizing a storm rainfall event and a snowmelt plus rainfall event however the authors noted that there are several factors affecting the snow modelling in urban catchments related to non uniformity of snow distribution in urban environments due to urban snow management practices e g the effect of snow ploughing and piling on snow accumulation and melt the effect of road salt applications on snowmelt from impervious areas spatial heterogeneities in surface albedo in urban areas temporal variations in solar radiation effects of buildings on wind and solar exposure and hence on atmospheric heat exchange and snowmelt rates including these processes in an urban snow model would require several input data and lead to a more complex urban snow model therefore evaluation of simplified parameterizations for the spatially distributed modelling of the dominant hydrological processes e g surface depression storage evapotranspiration and snow accumulation and melt is important for improved runoff generation in urban catchments fletcher et al 2013 noted that integrated urban water cycle models that represent feedback mechanisms between all aspects of urban water cycle e g water supply wastewater and stormwater systems and precipitation water cycle remain an important research challenge some studies e g joss et al 2008 dirckx et al 2009 weiß et al 2002 zhu et al 2016 found that it is important to model at least the entire urban precipitation water cycle by including the subsurface hydrological processes joss et al 2008 found that there is marked feedbacks between the sewer systems and subsurface media or streams related to sewer leakage dirckx et al 2009 and weiß et al 2002 found that there is considerable 50 70 contribution to the dry weather combined sewer flow dwf from groundwater infiltration zhu et al 2016 found that there are feedbacks between the sewer systems and waterways berthier et al 2004 found that the soil contributes an average of 14 of the total per event runoff volume domingo et al 2010 found that simulated volumes of surface floods and inflows to the pipe network obtained from a physically based distributed 3d hydrologic model coupled to a 1d drainage network model are higher than those obtained from the traditional 1d 2d procedure berg and byrne 1998 reported that basements were flooded in residential urban areas due to subsurface flow and percolation into the pervious surfaces karpf and krebs 2011 developed a methodology to quantify groundwater infiltration and surface water inflow into the sewer pipes however the authors noted that the method require data which are not commonly available for instance the groundwater data rodriguez et al 2008 and coutu et al 2012 illustrated the importance of modelling the exchanges between the sewer system and the soil infiltration into the sewers and noted that the exchange with the saturated zone deserves detailed investigation the authors conceptualized that the total generated subsurface runoff from the catchments draining into the stormwater drainage network contributes to the flow in the sewer pipes however only fractions of the generated subsurface runoff from a catchment connected to a stormwater network would contribute to the flow in the artificial sewer network through cracked pipes since the subsurface runoff would mainly contribute to the natural subsurface drainage and storages based on a review of models for low impact urban stormwater drainage elliott and trowsdale 2007 concluded that half of the models include a groundwater component which is relevant for assessing effects of the lid on baseflow but the representation of groundwater is simplified and generally untested however simplified modelling of urban subsurface runoff process would be useful to shed lights on the total magnitudes of subsurface runoff and interactions between the subsurface runoff and sewer pipes there is a marked effect of runoff routing on the hydrological response of a catchment to storm events due to the quick rainfall runoff response in urbanized catchments e g see lhomme et al 2004 rodriguez et al 2003 2005a miller et al 2014 several overland flow and sewer flow routing methods of different complexity have been developed for urban catchments such as non linear reservoir method xiong and melching 2005 travel time based methods e g urban unit hydrographs rodriguez et al 2003 urban morpho climatic instantaneous unit hydrograph gironás et al 2009 hydraulic routing based on approximate analytical solutions of the diffusive wave model e g muskingum cunge method rodriguez et al 2008 flow path response function based mejía and moglen 2010 cantone and schmidt 2011 and coupled 1d sewer hydraulics and 2d overland flow hydrodynamic routing see barnard et al 2007 paz et al 2011 an explicit grid cell to grid cell flow routing method e g wigmosta et al 1994 wigmosta lettenmaier 1999 is also available in literature but the methods was applied mainly for natural watersheds rather than for urbanized catchments mays 2001 describes the diffusive wave model as the most useful among the approximations of the dynamic wave equation because it offers a balance between accuracy and simplicity for a large number of field situations borah 2011 suggested that models using approximate equations with analytical solutions may provide a balance between complexity and accuracy therefore evaluation of the performances of a spatially distributed p r model for simulation of integrated surface and subsurface hydrological processes for different land cover classes would be possible based on coupling to a simple runoff routing algorithm without including detailed sewer hydraulics contingent on availability of long hydro climatic records continuous hydrologic simulation based on seasonal long term or several concomitant extreme precipitation and runoff events are necessary for temporal validation of models better understanding of the precipitation runoff processes and the impacts of urbanization on the components of the urban hydrological cycle hydrological regime and water quality and for improved decision making in design and management of urban water infrastructure e g see fletcher et al 2013 however literature on temporal validation of urban p r models or tests for parameter transferability in time are not common and hence needs to be conducted the main objectives of the present study are i development calibration and validation of the performance of a high resolution spatially distributed model based on integrated surface and sub surface hydrological processes which dominate the urban precipitation water cycle e g surface depression storage infiltration infiltration excess surface runoff evapotranspiration snow accumulation and melt subsurface runoff etc using ground based observations of hydro climatic variables in a small urban stormwater catchment ii to estimate the effects of soil moisture and groundwater states pertinent to net contributions of subsurface runoff to peak flows in sewer pipes based on calibration of the p r model and iii to investigate the impacts of snowmelt in generating peak flows in sewer pipes during winter and spring ws seasons 2 study catchment and data the study site is a risvollan research catchment which is located at about 4 km southeast of the center of the city of trondheim in mid norway and established by the norwegian university of science and technology ntnu fig 1 the catchment drains a separate stormwater catchment of about 21 255 ha urban residential area located at ground elevations ranging from 85 to 134 masl in the present study we found that a spatial resolution of 5 m 5 m grid size is sufficient to represent the spatial variability of land use or land cover into 14 roofs or buildings 8 5 paved roads 41 open areas including grassland 35 built up areas e g lawns walkways parking spots playgrounds etc and 1 5 vegetation or trees fig 1 hence the discretization would also allow for spatially distributed simulation of state variables runoff and other fluxes accordingly in the present study we considered 22 5 of the catchment area including roofs or buildings and paved roads as impervious surfaces we considered the remaining 77 5 including open areas such as grassland built up areas and vegetation or trees as pervious surfaces the risvollan residential area was developed mainly in the 1970s based on aerial photographs of different periods there is very small land use change indicating that the land use map used in the present study is valid for our study period 1993 1998 we subdivided the catchment into 54 sub catchments ranging in size from 0 07 ha to 1 56 ha average 0 39 ha that are linked by a sewer drainage network containing 78 manholes and 78 stormwater pipes conduits conveying the flow to the outlet fig 1 the catchment has one gauging station near the outlet measuring precipitation p mm air temperature ta c solar radiation srin w m2 wind speed m s and relative humidity rhp fig 1 the precipitation gauge is an unshielded lambrecth tipping bucket having a heater when air temperature drops below freezing it records 0 1 mm of precipitation per tip the catchment receives precipitation mainly in the form of rainfall during may to september and mainly in the form of snowfall during november to march the mean annual precipitation for the catchment is about 985 mm we used climate data that are available at a temporal resolution of 2 min which agrees with the suggestions by schilling 1991 and berne et al 2004 for catchments with an order of 20 ha the available discharge data of 1 min resolution was converted to 2 min resolution to match with the climate data we used a simulation time step of 2 min for parameter calibration and validation we selected data from 1993 to 1998 which have no missing records of climate data and relatively low missing concurrent flow records and comprise four events e1 e4 summer autumn season sa1 and two winter spring snow influenced seasons ws1 and ws2 the percentages of missing flow records during the calibration periods ranges from 0 23 ws2 to 11 2 e4 the maximum 2 min observed precipitation volume ranges from 0 3 mm e3 and ws2 to 1 5 mm e1 the maximum precipitation intensities ranges from 9 mmh 1 ws2 to 45 mmh 1 e1 and the average precipitation intensities ranges from 0 08 mmh 1 sa1 to 1 56 mmh 1 e1 the ranges of observed air temperature are 2 9 28 9 c for the summer autumn seasons and from 20 7 c to 9 3 c for the winter spring seasons the peak observed flow in the sewer pipes ranges from are 130 3 ls 1 e4 to 432 34 ls 1 ws1 the spatially distributed p r model developed in the present study is applicable to any catchment size spatial and temporal resolutions and number of sub catchments 3 methods the spatially distributed p r model developed in the present study comprises of various sub models which are coded in the c programming language built to dynamic link libraries dlls and linked together in the enki see kolberg and bruland 2012 hydrological modelling platform the sub models include a model for computation of gridded fields of climate forcing from point gauge measurement gcf snow accumulation and melt model snow potential evapotranspiration pet model runoff response model rr and a runoff routing model based on the source to sink sts algorithm a flowchart depicting the connections among various sub models and the model structure for the runoff generation are respectively given in fig 2 a and b 3 1 gridded climate forcing gcf model the stormwater model developed in the present study has a separate sub model that is capable of modelling spatial variability of climate forcing by computing gridded climate forcing from several point gauge measurements based on advanced spatial interpolations however due to the availability of only one climate station in the catchment in the present study we used a simple algorithm that replicate the gauge measured values for each grid cell in the catchment in order to avoid unnecessary computational cost therefore in the present study there are uniform homogeneous fields of precipitation and other climate variables over the catchment which are valid for the small sized catchment of the present study for instance the station fulfills the requirement of gauge densities of 1 km2 per gauge and 2 km spatial resolution that was suggested appropriate respectively by schilling 1991 and berne et al 2004 3 2 snow accumulation and melt model snow there are three main snowmelt models in literature namely temperature index or degree day model energy balance models having one or more snowpack layer and combination of the two as hybrid models see a review by moghadas et al 2015 some p r models e g hspf model bicknell et al 2001 hbv light model seibert 2002 used the simplest snow model known as the temperature index model in the present study we used the degree day based model that includes parameterization of sub grid heterogeneity of snow cover by a statistical distribution tøfte and kolberg 2016 the method is similar to the snow routine of the hydrologiska byråns vattenballansavdelning or hbv model bergström 1976 but does not involve elevation zones within each grid cell rather the snow cover percentages of the spatial grid cell is defined by a statistical distribution described by five quantiles 00 25 50 75 and 100 which makes the snow cover in a grid cell to vary between 0 and 100 each quartile has three state variables namely snow water equivalent swe liquid water content of the snow pack and the sca the model requires inputs of precipitation and temperature time series simulates refreezing and melting and provides distributed water release from snowpack snowmelt rainfall as an output there are 10 calibrated parameters in the snow model including five snow redistribution weights for each quartile table 1 3 3 potential evapotranspiration pet model several urban surface energy balance models of different complexity and data requirements e g climate forcing data urban morphology surface properties anthropogenic heat sources etc are available in literature see a review by grimmond et al 2009 in the present study we used a simple approach based on the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 for the calculation of potential evapotranspiration pet mm the method uses solar radiation air temperature and relative humidity climate forcings and considers surface properties including albedo emissivity

s the net radiation rn w m2 is the sum of net shortwave radiation srn srin srout and the net longwave radiation lrn lrin lrout we estimated the reflected shortwave radiation srout based on albedos of the snow or land surface albs l we computed the lrin and lrout respectively based on sicart et al 2006 and stefan boltzmann equation by considering the atmospheric snow surface and land surface emissivity the δ pa k 1 is the slope of saturation vapor pressure of air esa curve we computed the esa pa and the psychrometric constant γ pa k 1 respectively based on koutsoyiannis 2012 and fao 56 method allen et al 1998 the priestley taylor constant α and albedo for the land surface albl are set by calibration the snow albedo is set as a state variable which varies with snow age and decays slowly during cold conditions ta 0 and decays fast during melt ta 0 respectively modified from baker et al 1990 and verseghy 1991 for instance as implemented in the gamma distributed snow depletion

in days d the snow albedo was set to increase during snowfall sn 0 by alb range albres d where albrange albmax albmin and albresd is a snowfall depth after which the snow albedo is reset to a fresh snow albedo and was determined by calibration we partitioned the precipitation p mm into snowfall sn mm and rainfall r mm based on the air temperature ta threshold temperature for 100 precipitation falling as rainfall tr and threshold temperature for 100 precipitation falling as snowfall ts following tarboton et al 1994 the tr and ts are determined by calibration the qg wm 2 is the ground heat

for the heat transfer and tsur is the surface temperature c the kth and dsoil are determined by calibration the surface temperature tsur is defined as a snow surface temperature tsn when the snow covered area sca 0 and by a land surface temperature tl when the sca 0 using empirical linear regression relationships the snow surface temperature was estimated from the dew temperature following raleigh et al 2013 and the land surface and soil temperatures were estimated from an air temperature following gallo et al 2011 to reduce the numbers of calibrated parameters the values of slope parameters are set to one while the intercept parameters are determined by calibration there are 12 calibrated parameters in the pet model table 1 3 4 runoff response model rr 3 4 1 surface depression storage evapotranspiration infiltration and infiltration excess surface runoff in the present study we conceptualized the catchment as three storage reservoirs surface depression soil moisture and groundwater each characterized by a state variable representing their respective water storage we considered the roofs or buildings and paved roads as impervious surfaces assuming a negligible infiltration following petrucci and bonhomme 2014 even if ragab et al 2003 reported that 6 9 of rainfall infiltrates through paved road surfaces and rodriguez et al 2008 reported that 11 6 of precipitation infiltrates through streets in the present study for the impervious surfaces only the surface runoff generation processes i e surface depression storage actual evaporation from the surface depression storage snow processes and infiltration excess surface runoff are modelled while the subsurface runoff processes are neglected and hence there is only one state variable namely the surface depression storage we updated the surface depression storage h after consecutively updating fluxes of snow outflow sof actual evaporation from the surface depression storage ae infiltration to the unsaturated soil i for pervious areas and infiltration excess surface runoff iexcsf 4 h t h t 1 s of ae i i exssf the actual evaporation from the surface depression storage was computed from the potential evapotranspiration and surface depression storage e g rutter et al 1971 rodriguez et al 2008 by parameterizing with a maximum surface depression storage parameter after which the actual evaporation occurs at a potential rate hmaxpet several algorithms are available to estimate infiltration rates for instance the green ampt method e g green and ampt 1911 camici et al 2011 horton s infiltration flux e g horton 1940 coutu et al 2012 philip s infiltration equation e g philip 1957 stewart et al 2013 and based on parameterizing by the maximum infiltration capacity in the present study we limited the infiltration flux from pervious areas either by the soil maximum infiltration capacity ic mm h parameter or by the surface depression storage h the ic was calibrated separately for open areas and vegetation or trees icp and built up areas icb several algorithms are available for computation of the infiltration excess surface flow iexssf for instance based on the manning s equation singh and aravamuthan 1996 du et al 2009 linear reservoir flow from surface depression storage e g coutu et al 2012 and threshold capacity for surface depression storage e g rodriguez et al 2008 in the present study we computed the iexssf based on a threshold maximum depression storage capacity parameter hmax after which the infiltration excess surface flow occurs following rodriguez et al 2008 the hmax was calibrated separately for open areas and trees or vegetation hmaxper built up areas hmaxbu and impervious areas hmaximp we neglected processes related to interception due to only small proportion 1 5 of the vegetation or trees in the catchment and lower magnitudes of fluxes associated to these processes in urban catchments e g see rodriguez et al 2008 3 4 2 subsurface runoff and saturation excess surface runoff we modelled the interflow runoff from the soil moisture percolation from soil moisture to groundwater perc and groundwater flow gf we updated the soil moisture storage ss and ground water storage gs state variables by consecutively updating the fluxes based on the following water balance equations 5 ss t ss t 1 i perc aet if 6 gs t gs t 1 perc gf we computed the actual evapotranspiration from the soil zone aet mm as 7 aet pet ae s r s r θ θ r n θ r where the sr is the degree of soil saturation θ is the initial volumetric soil water content θr is residual soil moisture content and n is soil porosity the θr and n are parameters determined by calibration to compute the percolation we used the van genuchten soil moisture characteristics functions van genuchten 1980 which is based on the sr saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and the soil pore size index m we computed the interflow from soil moisture if and groundwater flow gf based on conceptualizing the soil moisture storage and groundwater storage as linear reservoirs e g coutu et al 2012 8 if k soil ss δ t gf k gw gs δ t we parametrized net fractions of the interflow and groundwater flow entering the sewer pipes through cracks as effective calibrated parameters respectively denoted as pin and pdr we used the term net fraction since two way interaction i e both infiltration to the pipes and exfiltration from the pipes may occur however we assumed that infiltration to the pipes is higher than exfiltration from the pipes we computed the total runoff from the grid cell entering the stormwater sewer tf in mm as 9 t f i exssf s exssf ifsewer gfsewer ifsewer p in if gfsewer p dr gf where the ksoil s 1 kgw s 1 are parameters determined by calibration saturation excess surface flow sexssf from pervious grids occur when the ss ssmax or the total subsurface storage ts ss gs tsmax ssmax gsmax the gsmax and tsmax respectively are the maximum ground water storage and total subsurface storage capacities which are set as effective parameters and determined by calibration there are 16 calibrated parameters in the rr model table 1 3 5 source to sink runoff routing model sts we used the flow path response function based on an analytical solution to the diffusion wave equation hayami 1951 nauman 1981 to route the generated runoff from the grid cells or sources to the outlet or sink following the flow path response function and the source to sink sts routing algorithm e g olivera and maidment 1999 the total flow travel length for the grid cells is the sum of flow length over the surface before entering the manholes or flow travel length outside the pipes flop and the flow length inside the pipes to the outlet flp the flop was computed based on sub catchment area asc and a shape factor sf parameter following guo and urbonas 2009 10 fl op a sc sf 0 5 where the sf was set as an effective calibrated parameter used for all sub catchments the size of the sub catchment and an effective calibrated shape factor parameter would determine flop for each sub catchment therefore the flop for the sub catchments were used for all grid cells in the sub catchments i e the same entry time or inlet time to the conduits is assumed for all grid cells within the sub catchment owing to the small sized sub catchments ranging from 0 07 ha to 1 56 ha average 0 39 ha the assumption of the same entry time or inlet time for all grid cells within the sub catchment is plausible in the present study as it would have only a slight effect on the total travel time and the flow path response function in the source to sink runoff routing used in the present study the flop was computed based on areas of the sub catchments and parameterization by an effective or calibrated shape factor parameter while the effects of roads and buildings were considered in delineation of areas of the sub catchments in the cases of 1d 2d modelling of surface runoff or flood inundation and computation of the flop by tracing the flow paths from grid cells to the outlet of their respective sub catchments or manholes by using the explicit grid cell to grid cell flow routing method e g wigmosta et al 1994 wigmosta lettenmaier 1999 the effects of buildings and roads on the flow direction and hence the flop need to be considered the total flow travel time for each grid cell to the outlet ti was obtained by summing the travel time for the surface flow the entry time or inlet time and flow travel time inside the sewer pipes if spatially and temporally invariant celerity and dispersion coefficient are assumed the instantaneous runoff generated at the source are related to the outlet response by a unit flow path response function or ui t 1 t see olivera and maidment 1999 hailegeorgis et al 2015 11 u i t 1 2 t π t t i π i exp 1 t t i 2 4 t t i π i t i fl op v op fl p v p π i fl op v op d op fl p v p d p where the lop and lp respectively are flow travel lengths over the surface and inside the pipes the vop and vp respectively are velocities of surface flow and pipe flow and the dop and dp respectively are dispersion coefficients for surface and pipe flows the flow path response function for a grid cell i represents the probability distribution of flow travel time t from the source grid cell to the sink outlet with a mean value of ti the flow path peclet number πi is a representative measure of the relative importance of advection with respect to dispersion where the flow dispersion coefficients represent the effects of storage and spreading in the present study all the grid cells in a sub catchment j have the same flow path response function due to assuming the same entry time for all grid cells in a sub catchment j and hence the numbers of response functions are equal to the number of sub catchments the assumption is also computationally feasible compared to computing distributed flow path response functions for each grid cell i by computing the flop for each grid cell using flow direction maps which leads to 8502 flow path response functions in the present study the velocities of flow and dispersion coefficients are effective parameters determined by calibration for a spatially distributed linear system subdivided into uniform non overlapping sub areas e g olivera and maidment 1999 the runoff routing can be performed by the following convolution 12 q sim t 1000 δ t i 1 n t fvol u i t where qsim t l s is a sts routed simulated discharge n is the total number of grid cells in the catchment tfvol m3 is the total generated runoff volume during the time step for the grid cell and is the convolution operator there are 5 calibrated parameters in the sts flow routing model table 1 4 parameter identification for parameter calibration we used a random monte carlo mc procedure based on sampling of each parameter from uniform distributions defined by minimum and maximum values of respective parameters to identify parameter sets that provide the best performance measure the focus of the urban stormwater modelling in the present study is better simulation of peak flows for estimation of urban flood and flood risk management therefore we used the nash sutcliffe efficiency or nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 performance measure which is based on the sum of squared residuals and hence gives more weights to peak flows the nse defines an aggregated measure of how well the simulated flow at the outlet of the sewer network qsim reproduces the corresponding observed flow time series qobs 13 nse 1 i 1 n q obsi q simi 2 i 1 n q obsi q obsavg 2 descriptions of the calibrated parameters and their minimum and maximum values for the mc sampling are given in table 1 5 results 5 1 calibration and validation performance of the model in terms of the nse during calibration and validation periods are given in table 2 the calibration provided good nse values ranging from 0 65 to 0 94 performance of the model are varying among the validation periods table 2 the validation performance is good for some events and the seasonal calibration during the summer autumn season the validation results for the snow influenced seasons ws1 and ws2 are better than the other periods the results indicate that simulation of snowmelt dominated runoff and or longer records are more validated than runoff occurring from shorter rainfall events the event e3 09 06 1995 11 06 1995 and the seasonal sa1 01 06 1995 01 10 1995 found to be better recipients of the transferred parameters than the other periods which probably show that the 1995 data may exhibit a better quality plots of hydrographs of observed flow qobs and routed simulated flow qsim and some unrouted generated runoff fluxes for the event based calibrations are given in fig 3 a d respectively for e1 e2 e3 and e4 plots of the simulated and observed flow hydrographs along with other variables related to the snow model for ws1 and ws2 for the seasonal calibrations sa1 ws1 and ws2 respectively are given in fig 4 a c plots of the dominant generated runoff fluxes unrouted for sa1 ws1 and ws2 are given respectively in fig 5 a c the observed and simulated hydrographs exhibit good agreement the hydrographs indicate that the urban catchment responds quickly to rainfall or snowmelt events and the infiltration excess surface runoff iexssf is the main runoff generating mechanism contributing to the peak flows the results also indicate that a subsurface flow from the soil moisture zone or the interflow if is contributing to the sewer flow ifsewer and augments the peak flows and sustains base flows while the contribution to the peak flows is more relevant to design flood and flood risk management in urban catchments for instance the calibrated values of the pin implies that 19 40 23 7 19 30 and 47 of the if contributes to the flow in the sewer pipes ifsewer respectively for e1 e2 e3 e4 sa1 ws1 and ws2 while the remaining interflow would contribute to the natural subsurface drainage or storage system calibration results for the snow seasons ws1 and ws2 fig 4b and c show that when the observed air temperature is well above freezing 0 c there are generally higher values of the snowoutflow sof the swe recedes and the sca decreases the temperature index based snow model underestimates the peak flows for the ws2 the simulated peak flow rate qsimpeak 149 9 ls 1 and the observed peak flow rate qobspeak 206 5 ls 1 while it overestimates the peakiest flow during the present study very slightly which corresponds to the ws1 qsimpeak 462 8 ls 1 and qobspeak 432 3 ls 1 the results indicated that the performance of the snow model used in the present study is generally good 5 2 fluxes and water balance

fluxes and the precipitation falling over the catchment during the calibration periods are given in table 3 the total observed precipitation p ranges from 16 7 mm e4 to 566 8 mm ws1 the simulated runoff at the outlet of sewer pipes qsim ranges from 3 95 mm e4 to 320 24 mm ws1 in the present study we used the linear interpolation for filling of the missing records for the calibration periods with small proportion of missing flow records i e e1 e2 e3 and ws2 in order to estimate the total volume of observed runoff qobs at the outlet of the sewer network for these calibration periods the qsim qobs ranges from 78 83 ws2 to 91 92 e1 indicating that the model underestimates the runoff volume by up to 20 probably the underestimation is mainly attributed to the peak flows for instance the qobspeak qsimpeak indicated that the peak flow rate is underestimated by up to 38 the qobspeak qsimpeak for the calibration periods e4 sa1 and ws1 for which no filling of missing observations were performed and hence the peak flow observations are probably missing are respectively 0 82 1 04 and 0 93 the simulated total runoff qt ranges from 13 32 mm e4 to 565 06 mm ws1 the differences between the p and qt represent the loss by the total evapotranspiration et and or contribution to an increase in total storage volume or δtots for e1 e3 e4 and ws2 however for e2 sa1 and ws1 there is a decrease in δtots which contributed to the qt and the et demand the total simulated surface runoff qtsurface enters the sewer pipes through the manholes and the calibration provided values ranging from 1 29 mm e1 to 208 55 mm ws1 the total simulated subsurface runoff qtsubsurface volume ranges from 10 08 mm e4 to 356 5 mm ws1 while the volume of subsurface runoff contribution to the sewer flow qtsubsurfacesewer ranges only from 0 71 mm e4 to 107 08 mm ws1 the calibration provided no saturation excess surface flow satexssf and negligible groundwater flow gf and hence there is no contribution of the satexssf and there is negligible contribution of the gfsewer to the flow in the sewer pipes during all calibration periods the percentages of precipitation volume that is transformed to total runoff volume and other fluxes are varying among the calibration periods the higher percentage of precipitation occurring as qtsurface corresponds to the ws1 36 79 while the lower corresponds to the sa1 3 16 considerable percentages of precipitation p infiltrates and contributes to the qtsubsurface for instance the lower is 60 38 for e4 and the higher is 78 83 for sa1 the infiltrated runoff volume contributes mainly to the interflow from the soil moisture unsaturated zone and negligible amount is percolating to the ground water zone resulting in negligible gf and gfsewer the percentage of precipitation that is transformed to the qt is high for instance ranges from 79 77 for e4 and nearly 100 for ws1 the lower value for e4 is related to high contribution of the precipitation volume to the increase in the δtots and the higher value for the ws1 is because of the low evapotranspiration demand during the snow season and runoff contribution from the decrease in the δtots that is dominated by the snow water equivalent the percentage of precipitation lost to the total evapotranspiration is less than 3 for the events e1 e4 and for snow seasons ws1 and ws2 while it amounts to about 18 during the summer and autumn seasons sa1 the percentage of precipitation volume contributing to the flow in the sewer pipes qsim p ranges from 17 83 sa1 to 56 50 ws1 while the ratios of observed flow and precipitation volumes qobs p ranges from 23 32 e1 to 67 43 ws2 table 3 these qobs p results are slightly higher than their corresponding qsim p the higher qsim p values are mainly related to the snow seasons due to low evapotranspiration demand and relatively higher contributions to the sewer pipes from both surface and subsurface runoff while the lower value of qsim p is related to the warmer summer autumn season having high evapotranspiration loss and low surface runoff contribution the results indicate that considering the snow evapotranspiration and surface depression storage processes would be important in sizing of sewer pipes the qsim p values for e1 and sa1 are found to be less than the precipitation volume falling on the impervious surfaces since the percentage of impervious surfaces in the catchment is 22 5 and infiltration was not allowed on the impervious surfaces this is due to a large actual evaporation loss ae from surface depression storage for the sa1 and the precipitation volume contributes to an increase in surface depression storage volume for the e1 indicating that the impact of depression storage on the runoff volume is high in event based runoff simulation and the impact of evaporation loss on the runoff volume is high for long term simulation during warmer seasons the percentage of total simulated runoff qt contributing to the qsim ranges from 21 75 sa1 to 58 49 ws2 while the higher percentage is related to higher contribution of the qtsubsurfacesewer to the qsim for most of the calibration periods for instance for e1 e2 e3 sa1 and ws2 the percentage contributions of subsurface runoff to the flow in the sewer pipes are found to be higher than the contributions from the surface runoff 5 3 runoff routing plots of mean flow travel times to the outlet for the subcatchments or ti which was obtained from the calibrated parameters of velocity of flow outside sewer pipes vop and velocity of flow inside sewer pipes vp are given in fig 6 a the calibration resulted in different values of the mean flow travel time for the sub catchments with e3 having the largest travel time slow runoff response ranging from 3 3 min to 29 28 min and e4 having the smallest flow travel time quick runoff response ranging from 1 74 min to 7 03 min the quick runoff response for e4 may be related to the higher average rainfall intensity for e4 but no general trend is observed between either of the maximum or average precipitation intensities and the flow travel time catchments with larger flow travel lengths to the outlet over the surface and inside the pipes exhibit higher mean flow travel time due to parameterizing the flow velocities as effective parameters and hence the same values are applied to all sub catchments and sewer pipes the calibration periods also exhibit different runoff delay since the sts response function is dependent on the ti and the flow path peclet number πi which are found to be different among the calibration periods plots of typical sts response functions for the ws1 calibration for some subcatchments are given in fig 6b 6 discussion 6 1 calibration and validation the nse performance measure for the event and seasonal calibration periods of 0 65 0 94 that are obtained in the present study table 2 are better than or within the ranges of the performance measures obtained from calibration of p r models in urban catchments using flow as a target variable in previous studies e g berthier et al 2004 nse 0 77 valeo and ho 2004 nse 0 12 0 74 rodriguez et al 2005b nse 0 54 easton et al 2007 nse for the full urban model 0 71 0 85 rodriguez et al 2008 nse 0 51 and 0 54 gironás et al 2009 modified coefficient of efficiency or mce 0 52 0 82 mejía and moglen 2010 nse 0 42 0 96 and coutu et al 2012 nse 0 73 thorough temporal validation of urban p r models are not common in previous studies however some studies which conducted validation tests reported acceptable validation performance e g coutu et al 2012 nse 0 73 gironás et al 2009 mce 0 52 to 0 82 mejía and moglen 2010 nse 0 57 0 74 in the present study the validation performance vary among the parameter transfer between the different periods while generally the nse for the validation periods are good for the snow influenced ws seasons and for long term seasonal calibration than the event based periods table 2 therefore the present study indicated that parameter calibration and validation of the p r models based on long records spanning the entire range of rainfall and runoff in the catchment peak flow medium flow low flow rainfall dominated runoff snowmelt dominated runoff etc or continuous simulation are necessary for reliable model evaluation and decision making therefore longer hydro climatic measurements are important for urban catchments 6 2 fluxes and water balance the observed flow and precipitation records and the corresponding simulations indicated that lower for instance as low as 23 32 for e1 and 17 83 for sa1 of precipitation volumes are transformed respectively to observed and simulated flow volumes at the outlet of sewer drainage network table 3 the simulation indicated that the differences are because of only a lower proportion of the total subsurface runoff qtsubsurface contributes to the flow in the sewer pipes qtsubsurfacesewer the precipitation contributes to a marked increase in the water storage volume in the catchment e g for e1 and satisfies the marked evaporation demand during the warm season sa1 the lowest percentage of precipitation volume that is transformed to the total simulated runoff volume qt in the catchment of 79 77 corresponding to the e4 table 3 indicate that the maximum percentage loss to evaporation and increase in catchment storage is only about 20 therefore the lower volume of qsim compared to p is mainly attributed to the lower proportion of the total subsurface runoff volume qtsubsurface contributing to the qtsubsurfacesewer through cracked pipes the results of the present study agrees with berthier et al 2004 who found that the soil contributes an average of 14 of the total per event runoff volume rodriguez et al 2008 who found that 29 1 of the precipitation volume contributes to stormwater and wastewater sewer systems and dirckx et al 2009 and weiß et al 2002 who found that there is 50 70 contribution to the dry weather combined sewer flow from groundwater infiltration the results of the present study illustrated that subsurface runoff contribution to flow in sewer drainage network should not be conceptualized in a way that the whole generated subsurface runoff in the stormwater catchment drains to the sewer pipes since only part of the subsurface runoff contribute to the flow in the artificial stormwater sewer network through cracks or joints while the higher proportion of subsurface runoff would drain to the natural drainage or storage system parameter calibration of the urban p r models based on conceptualizing that the total generated subsurface runoff from catchments draining to the stormwater sewer network would contribute to flow in the sewer pipes e g rodriguez et al 2008 coutu et al 2012 may result in overestimation of evapotranspiration loss and simulated flow volumes and flow rates despite only partial contribution of the generated subsurface flow to the sewer pipes was allowed in the present study there are higher contributions of subsurface runoff to the sewer pipes compared to the surface runoff for most of the calibration periods table 3 this indicate that it is important to model the entire urban precipitation water cycle by including the subsurface hydrological processes as suggested in previous studies e g joss et al 2008 dirckx et al 2009 weiß et al 2002 zhu et al 2016 to determine the contributions from subsurface runoff to peak flows in sewer pipes for sizing the capacity of sewer pipes and urban flood risk management rather than based on only contribution from the surface runoff in the present study the p r model underestimated the qsim by up to 20 and the peak flow rate by about 38 ws2 the highest underestimations are related to winter spring seasons that are dominated by the snow processes which is probably due to low performance of the snow model which is based only on air temperature however the snow model slightly i e by 7 overestimated the peakiest flow rate of the present study which is associated to the ws1 calibration period qsimpeak 462 8 ls 1 and qobspeak 432 3 ls 1 several studies valeo and ho 2004 bengtsson and semádeni davies 2011 moghadas et al 2015 noted that there are several factors affecting the snow processes in urban catchments related to the effects of snow ploughing and piling on snow accumulation and melt the effects of road salt applications on snowmelt from impervious areas spatial heterogeneities in surface albedo temporal variations in solar radiation effects of buildings on wind and solar exposure and hence on atmospheric heat exchange and snowmelt rates the peakiest observed flow rate of 432 3 ls 1 for the ws1 in the present study indicate that snowmelt or rainfall on snowmelt induced urban runoff during the winter spring ws seasons may result in the peakiest flow rates in the catchment that could be important for reliable determination of the capacity of sewer pipes therefore determination of design floods by including simulation of urban floods during snow influenced seasons would be required for cold climate regions as suggested by watt and marsalek 2013 hence improved simulation of snowmelt influenced runoff through comparative evaluation of the performances of the simple to more complex urban snow models would be necessary the slight underestimation of peak flows in the present study may also be related to spatial variability of precipitation within the catchment that could not be captured by the single climate station located near the outlet of the catchment despite the spatially distributed model developed in the present study is capable of modelling the spatial variability of climate forcing it was utilized mainly for representation of the spatial distribution of imperviousness e g see mejía and moglen 2010 by classifying the land use or land cover into roofs buildings paved roads built up areas and open areas and then to model the hydrological processes accordingly the precipitation records from the single station should provide reasonable results for the small size catchment used in the present study based on recommendations from previous studies e g schilling 1991 berne et al 2004 bruni et al 2015 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 however parameter calibration and investigation of the urban hydrological processes using dense precipitation gauges would be important for better representation of the spatial variability of precipitation in medium to large urban catchments in the present study there is no saturation excess surface runoff which agrees with previous studies that neglect this runoff generating mechanism in urban catchments e g rodriguez et al 2008 coutu et al 2012 the catchment soil moisture state never reached the full saturation level i e ss ssmax during the calibration periods therefore the infiltration process from the previous surfaces was found to be governed by the infiltration capacity of the surfaces and not by the soil moisture state from below however the infiltration modelling used in the present study is based on parametrizing by the infiltration capacity parameters for pervious surfaces and hence dominant influence of the infiltration capacity of the surface is expected the infiltrated water volume resulting in the qtsubsurface qtsubsurface p 60 38 78 83 agree with rodriguez et al 2008 who found that the i p of 60 1 for natural surfaces and 71 7 for the total catchment by allowing infiltration on roofs and street surfaces based on their urban hydrological elements uhe based distributed model in the present study the interaction between the groundwater flow and the sewer pipes was found to be negligible due to the negligible percolation even if the percolation was computed before computation of the interflow from soil moisture storage the p r model in the present study is not capable of simulating the groundwater levels moreover it is not easy to know the exact locations of the two way interactions between the subsurface runoff and cracked sewer pipes therefore the subsurface model structure of the present study can be simplified to a single subsurface storage and subsurface runoff component interacting with the flow in the sewer pipes that would also allow reducing the number of calibrated parameters in the runoff response routine in the present study the total evapotranspiration is dominated by actual evaporation from surface depression storage ae rather than the evapotranspiration from the soil moisture aet which does not agree with rodriguez et al 2008 who found that there is marked transpiration t from the vadose zone from natural surfaces t p 43 5 while the surface evaporation is relatively low the difference occurred due to the low evapotranspiration from the soil moisture storage for the cold climate region of the present study and probably due to the conceptualization that the total generated subsurface runoff contribute to flow in the sewer pipes in rodriguez et al 2008 and hence the calibration had to overestimate the transpiration loss from the vadose zone to provide better performance measure the present study indicated that there is a marked total evapotranspiration loss only for the warm seasons calibration i e et p 18 18 for sa1 which agrees with ragab et al 2003 who found for an urban catchment in wallingford united kingdom that 21 24 of annual rainfall evaporates and ramier et al 2011 who found for urban catchment in france that evaporation losses represent 20 of the total rainfall the present study indicated that the effects of surface depression storage on generated runoff volume is high for the event based calibration than the long term seasonal calibrations while the effect of surface water storage in terms of the snow water equivalent swe is obviously high for the snow influenced seasons 6 3 runoff routing for runoff routing the flow travel length estimated for the sub catchments were used for all grid cells in the sub catchments assuming the same entry time to the conduits for all grid cells within each sub catchment in addition an effective calibrated shape factor sf parameter was used for all sub catchments and hence the flow travel length outside the pipes for the sub catchments are dependent only on the areas of the sub catchments despite these simplifications the flow path response function based on an analytical solution to the diffusion wave equation and the source to sink sts used in the present study was found to provide an acceptable runoff delay in the stormwater network and hence reliable simulation of peak flows which agrees with mays 2001 and borah 2011 who suggested the diffusion wave equation and its analytical solutions as a balance between complexity and accuracy and mejía and moglen 2010 and cantone and schmidt 2011 who reported good performances of the runoff routing algorithm for urban catchments however the calibration resulted in different values of the runoff routing parameters for the calibration periods which resulted in different mean flow travel times peclet numbers and hence the sts response functions for the sub catchments among the calibration periods this may affect the temporal validation transferability of calibrated parameters of the routing model among the calibration periods which may require investigation of the effects on the validation of the transferability of runoff generation and runoff routing parameters separately 7 conclusions the present study presented a high spatial temporal resolution spatially distributed precipitation runoff p r modelling in cold climate region by modelling the interaction between the surface depression storage and soil storage with the atmosphere in terms of evapotranspiration flux the calibration indicated that the impact of surface depression storage on the simulated runoff volume in the sewer pipes is high for event based simulation while the impact of evapotranspiration is high only for the long term seasonal simulation during warmer summer autumn seasons there is marked proportion of infiltrated water contributing to generation of subsurface runoff parameterization of a two way interaction between the subsurface runoff and the flow in the sewer pipes indicated that there is considerable contribution of subsurface runoff to the flow in the artificial sewer drainage system the present study indicated that in most of the cases the contribution of the subsurface runoff to the flow in the sewer pipes is higher than the contribution of surface runoff and hence runoff simulation for estimation of floods for design and management of water infrastructure need to be based on an integrated modelling of surface runoff and subsurface runoff components of the urban precipitation water cycle the study for the snow influenced winter spring periods indicated that the peakiest flow rate in cold climates may be associated to the snowmelt or rainfall on snowmelt events and hence estimation of urban floods need to include simulation of urban runoff during snow influenced seasons the high spatial temporal resolution distributed urban p r model is important for better representation of the spatial distribution of precipitation and land use land cover in the catchment for better simulation of runoff response and hence for estimation of design flood for evaluation of performances of different stormwater management techniques e g the lid and for assessment of the impacts of land use and climate change the contribution of the present study is a high resolution distributed p r modelling for better representation of spatial heterogeneity of the land cover information and integrated modelling of the surface and subsurface components of the urban precipitation water cycle however there are several urban hydrological hydraulic conditions and uncertainties associated to the p r modelling that need further investigation contingent on further data availability or data acquisition i the effects of feedback mechanisms between all aspects of urban water cycle including leakages from water supply systems and faulty or illegal connections between the wastewater and stormwater systems ii the parameterization for a two way interaction between the subsurface runoff and sewer pipes of the present study do not involve information on the elevations of the sewer pipes and groundwater level and actual locations of the interactions while the latter is practically not easy to identify in a field iii there are large numbers of calibrated parameters in the present study related to the issues of parameter uncertainty and identifiability which were not objectives of the present study and hence efforts for model parsimony by reducing the numbers of calibrated parameters based on parameter sensitivity analyses and assessment of parameter uncertainty are important and iv the routing algorithm of the present study does not involve detailed analyses of hydraulics of sewer and surface inundation hence coupling of the spatially distributed runoff generation model to models that can perform detailed hydraulics like the swmm runoff routing engine may be important for detailed hydraulic studies including sewer surcharge combined sewer overflows surface inundation

7513,europe has experienced a series of major floods in the past years which suggests that flood magnitudes may have increased land degradation due to soil compaction from crop farming or grazing intensification is one of the potential drivers of this increase a literature review suggests that most of the experimental evidence was generated at plot and hillslope scales at larger scales most studies are based on models there are three ways in which soil compaction affects floods at the catchment scale i through an increase in the area affected by soil compaction ii by exacerbating the effects of changes in rainfall especially for highly degraded soils and iii when soil compaction coincides with soils characterized by a fine texture and a low infiltration capacity we suggest that future research should focus on better synthesising past research on soil compaction and runoff tailored field experiments to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the coupled mechanical and hydraulic processes new mapping methods of soil compaction that combine mechanical and remote sensing approaches and an effort to bridge all disciplines relevant to soil compaction effects on floods keywords soil compaction floods land use changes soil hydrology upscaling flow processes 1 introduction europe has experienced a series of major floods in the past years which may suggest that flooding is becoming more frequent and severe e g hall et al 2014 destructive floods occurred in several european countries like germany and poland in august 2002 in western austria in 2005 in italy in november 1994 october 2000 and autumn 2011 the uk in october 2000 summer 2007 and the winters of 2013 14 and 2015 16 in central europe in july 1997 summer 2010 and june 2013 the balkan region in may 2014 and most recently in germany france and belgium in june 2016 kundzewicz et al 2017 in order to project any changes into the future it is important to understand the drivers that have triggered flood changes in the past there are three potential drivers climate change hydraulic structures and land use change viglione et al 2016 hall et al 2014 blöschl et al 2017 among these land use change effects are probably the least well understood e g peña et al 2016 rogger et al 2017 humans have interfered with landscapes over millennia at an ever increasing rate in the last centuries global rain fed cropland and pastureland have increased by 460 and 560 respectively scanlon et al 2007 land use change tends to follow a set pattern from the restoration of natural vegetation to boundary clearing then to subsistence agriculture and small scale farms and as a final point to intensive agriculture urban areas and protected recreational lands foley et al 2005 these land use changes are often associated with soil degradation particularly if heavy machinery is used but grazing intensification may also lead to major modifications of the soils carroll et al 2004 o connell et al 2004 some 33 million hectares are affected by soil compaction in europe oldeman et al 1991 cited by birkas 2008 of these 20 million hectares are in eastern europe which amounts to 37 5 of the agricultural land birkas 2008 batey 2009 soil compaction can cause a number of environmental and agronomic problems including increased leaching of agrochemicals to the recipient waters emission of greenhouse gases crop yield losses erosion and flooding holman et al 2003 doerner and horn 2006 singh and hadda 2014 while soil compaction effects on surface runoff are relatively well understood at the local scale rogger et al 2017 the larger scale effects are rather elusive and the literature is rather fragmented to the best of the authors knowledge no literature review has been published on the impacts of soil compaction on flood processes at the catchment scale the main aim of this review is to summarise current knowledge on the subject in an organised way identify gaps and propose new avenues to better understanding soil compaction effects on floods while the focus is on soil compaction effects on floods we refer to land use instead of soil compaction in cases where the degree of compaction is not specifically quantified in the literature 2 soil compaction processes 2 1 types and causes of soil compaction compaction is defined as an increase in soil bulk density and reduction in soil porosity boone 1988 da silva et al 1994 in contrast soil shearing does not necessarily reduce soil porosity but does destroy the continuity of macropores e g horn et al 1995 alaoui et al 2011a together they are referred to as soil deformation e g alaoui et al 2011a the ability of a soil to resist non recoverable deformation during loading the soil strength is influenced by several factors such as texture structure organic matter content and in particular the soil water content gill and vanden berg 1967 horn 1988 the behaviour of a soil during loading is therefore usually examined as a function of soil water content young and warkentin 1966 soil strength can be estimated from stress strain relationships obtained from laboratory experiments casagrande 1936 or from pedo transfer functions van den akker 2004 horn and fleige 2003 the vulnerability to compaction may be assessed by comparing soil strength with the vertical loading soil compaction may affect the surface and the subsurface surface topsoil compaction compaction at the soil surface down to the depth reached by tillage may result from stock grazing trampling and traffic loading table 1 trampling effects depend on stock density animal weight hoof size soil moisture soil type plant type and field slope e g zhao et al 2010 krümmelbein et al 2006 it mainly affects the pore geometry at the soil surface nie et al 2001 vzzotto et al 2000 and the topsoil matrix alaoui and helbling 2006 it may reduce the number of earthworms resulting in an additional reduction in infiltration e g hills 1971 the compaction depth does not usually exceed 10 cm greenwood and mckenzie 2001 surface compaction may result from traffic loading especially from tractors with mounted or trailed implements below the contact surface between soil and tire the soil deforms under normal and shear stresses e g horn and rostek 2000 the shear stress rises sharply with an increase in traction force and wheel slip which may lead to the detachment of a weak topsoil layer vulnerable to erosion and surface runoff battiato et al 2013 tractor passes can form an anisotropic soil pore system due to the simultaneous movement of particles forward and downwards and to wheel slippage pagliai et al 2003 peng and horn 2008 the changes can form a platy structure in the upper few centimetres with elongated pores that are oriented parallel to the soil surface these pores are not vertically continuous and induce mainly horizontal water fluxes horn et al 2003 pagliai et al 2003 subsurface subsoil compaction the mechanical strength of structured characterized by the matrix and macropore domains soils mainly depends on aggregation actual and maximum pre drying and the composition and arrangement of the pore system horn and rostek 2000 the more negative the pore water pressure the more pronounced is the strength increase thus under humid climatic conditions soils usually get weaker with depth subsoil compaction risks increase with farm size machine weight e g harvester and the drive for greater productivity once subsoil damage occurs it can be extremely difficult and expensive to alleviate jones et al 2003 usually the first pass of a wheel causes a major portion of the total topsoil compaction bakker and davis 1995 botta et al 2006 silva et al 2008 whereas repeated traffic with low axle loads can affect the subsoil balbuena et al 2000 hamza and anderson 2005 2 2 soil properties 2 2 1 soil structure laboratory experiments have shown that the inter aggregate structure of soils is more susceptible to compaction than the soil aggregates themselves li and zhang 2009 macroporosity is therefore more sensitive to compaction than total porosity alakukku 1996 jégou et al 2002 showed that soil compaction decreases the continuity of burrow systems soils with mainly horizontal pores are more susceptible to compaction than those with vertical pores hartge and bohne 1983 schäffer et al 2008 2 2 2 soil texture the degree of compaction actual bulk density expressed as a percentage of the reference compaction state of a given soil håkansson and lipiec 2000 also depends on soil texture for example silt loam soils with low colloid contents are more susceptible than medium or fine textured loamy and clayey soils at low water contents while sandy soils are only slightly susceptible to soil compaction horn et al 1995 smith et al 1997 showed that a loamy soil subjected to varied pressures and moisture contents was resistant to compaction when dried and susceptible to compaction when wet while a loamy sand soil showed smaller increases in compaction with increasing load and moisture content 2 2 3 organic matter increases in soil organic matter may reduce compactibility by increasing resistance to deformation and or by increasing elasticity rebound effects soane 1990 high organic carbon contents can even reduce soil compaction at high moisture levels in clay and silty clay soils smith et al 1997 nawaz et al 2013 hamza and anderson 2005 smith et al 1997 2 2 4 water content soil water content is usually the most important factor influencing soil compaction soane and van ouwerkerk 1994 hamza and anderson 2005 traffic experiments on arable land with heavy excavators weighing up to 47 tons showed a decrease in the frequency and volume of macropores down to depths of 0 65 m and 1 0 m for dry and wet soils respectively dumbeck 1984 wet conditions in autumn winter and spring exacerbate the effect of heavy machinery on compaction arvidsson et al 2001 showed that the risk of soil compaction with commonly used machinery in southern sweden is 100 for spring slurry application and more than 60 after october in sugar beet harvesting yung et al 2010 found that high compaction was due to the footslope staying wetter for a longer period during the spring and early summer because of cover crop residues 2 3 time scales of soil compaction environmental and management related factors tend to interact on different time scales in driving the temporal dynamics of the structure related soil hydraulic properties mapa et al 1986 kay 1990 bodner et al 2013 for example kohl and markart 2002 showed that compaction effects are usually largest in autumn after the grazing period but soils may recover during winter and spring due to freezing thawing processes plant root activity and microbial activity soils which are wet during critical times of land management operations such as ploughing and harvesting can be prone to compaction and structural damage earl 1997 holman et al 2003 and can result in long term effects that are mainly observed where a plough pan a compacted layer that tends to form just below the ploughing depth develops a stable natural soil structure may only be achieved after several years when changing practices from regular soil loosening to no tillage wright et al 1999 soils under long term no tillage with low self mulching potential low clay and organic matter content may tend towards high bulk density and low water permeability munkholm et al 2003 persistent compaction effects are often observed for the subsoil of agriculturally used fields even after their abandonment soil compaction may be persistent over decades kellner and hubbart 2016 indicating a long memory effect potential factors controlling this memory are land use soil type topography and climate cambi et al 2015 rogger et al 2017 for some soils the compaction may be measurable even after 14 years berisso et al 2012 etana et al 2013 and may persist over 30 years if underground pipelines have been installed or the landscape remodelled using heavy machinery batey 2009 the impact of 13 years of cattle grazing was still measurable in a secondary teak forest after 10 years of growth zimmermann et al 2006 and former agricultural plots showed increased runoff 30 years after afforestation hümann et al 2011 while some forest soils tend to recover in a few years mace 1971 shoulders and terry 1978 others take 10 20 years to recover from shallow compaction dickerson 1976 froehlich 1979 jakobsen 1983 compaction of deep layers can persist over 100 years greacen and sands 1980 2 4 macropore flow surface runoff relationship macropores i e biopores represent only 0 23 2 00 of the total soil volume but may account for about 74 100 of the total water flux alaoui and helbling 2006 they are the most sensitive pores to compaction their volume reduction may significantly reduce vertical infiltration and thus increase surface runoff e g gerke 2006 hendrickx and flury 2001 alaoui 2015 severing their connectivity between the top few centimetres and the underlying macropores additionally reduces infiltration alaoui et al 2011b jégou et al 2002 alaoui 2015 the flow through macropores depends on the initial and boundary conditions and the exchange between the matrix and macropore domains which in turn depends on soil moisture texture degree of compaction and organic matter kluitenberg and horton 1990 zehe and blöschl 2004 mcgrath et al 2009 larsbo 2011 since these variables are rarely known at the field scale jarvis et al 2012 one usually resorts to quantifying their spatially integrated effects as effective hydraulic properties blöschl and sivapalan 1995 one possibility is to classify these properties into pedons or spatial units addiscott and mirza 1998 seyfried and wilcox 1995 an interesting observation is that of structural hierarchy brewer 1964 hadas 1987 dexter 1988 dexter et al 2008 the mean sizes of the pores separating the soil aggregates at progressively higher levels are themselves progressively bigger e g dexter et al 2008 this structural hierarchy can be extended to the hillslope scale in humid climates lateral preferential flow can dominate stream response in catchments with steep slopes and permeable soils on low permeability rocks weiler and mcdonnell 2007 anderson et al 2009 cammeraat and kooijman 2009 compaction can affect this hierarchy possibly resulting in a more heterogeneous spatial distribution of flow processes 2 5 mapping soil compaction when assessing the effects of soil compaction on floods one would ideally like to know the spatial distribution and extent of soil compaction or at least the soil compaction risk a number of approaches have been developed for assessing the soil compaction risk although invariably they have focused on agricultural applications rather than floods van den akker 1988 1994 computed soil stresses due to tractor wheels based on the relationships of söhne 1958 by dividing the contact area into small units and aggregating the stresses from point loads of all units lebert 2010 estimated the soil compaction risk for the arable land in germany using results of houšková 2008 while troldborg et al 2013 used bayesian belief networks by combining data from standard soil surveys land use and expert judgement d or and destain 2014 computed the preconsolidation stress determined based on the stress strain relationship of soil obtained during laboratory compression according to casagrande 1936 from pedotransfer functions horn and fleige 2003 based on pedological mechanical and hydraulic characteristics within a geostatistical framework recently geophysical techniques for investigating subsurface compaction in agricultural soils have been advanced such as ground penetrating radar lane et al 2016 wang et al 2016 andré et al 2012 although these are usually limited to rather small scales mapping methods can be assisted by gps based modelling of spatial patterns of field traffic intensity duttmann et al 2013 3 experimental evidence of soil compaction effects on floods 3 1 plot scale compaction of the topsoil due to tillage practices results in a reduced infiltration capacity and increases the probability of surface runoff formation during heavy precipitation e g byrd et al 2002 furthermore the spatial variability of compaction due to the trafficked rows and non trafficked interrows tends to enhance the spatial variability of surface and subsurface flow paths liebig et al 1993 mohanty et al 1996 kim et al 2010 conducted field experiments on mexico silt loam with field treatments of uniformly compacted and non compacted plots they found an increase in the bulk density of the compacted plot of 8 and a decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity of 69 respectively which would translate into increased surface runoff battiato et al 2015 studied the effect of slipping driving wheels of agricultural equipment on surface runoff generation during sprinkling experiments they found that the runoff coefficient increased from 0 79 with a minimum slip of 1 to 1 00 with a maximum slip of 27 indicating that all the rainwater would be transformed into surface runoff at high slip the formation of a plough pan in the subsoil changes the direction of water percolation by impeding vertical infiltration and enhancing interflow bertolino et al 2010 for instance found that soils in south eastern brasilia with a plough pan at about 20 cm depth stay longer saturated after rainfall events and favour surface runoff during intense rainy periods singh and hadda 2014 reported a decrease in the infiltration rate with increasing subsoil compaction they observed a decrease in infiltration rate by a factor of 2 0 2 3 under two different treatments of their sandy loam soil the decrease in infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration was due to a decrease in total porosity under higher subsoil compaction using infiltration and dye tracer experiments supplemented by soil textural and structural data alaoui et al 2012 investigated flow pathways on grassland and forest hillslopes in order to identify the controls of surface runoff generation they showed that the two types of land use lead to different flow processes mainly vertical infiltration for the forest soil and mainly surface runoff for the grassland soil fig 1 this is due to the larger root water uptake by trees and thus lower soil moisture and the larger unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of forest soils as compared to compacted grassland soils the low efficiency of grassland soil macropores in transporting water vertically downward can be explained by i the fine and dense topsoil layers caused by the land use that limits water fluxes into the underlying macropores and ii their restricted number their tortuosity and the restricted interaction between macropores and the matrix below the topsoil layer the larger root water uptake of forest soil as compared to grassland soil can be viewed as an additional factor enhancing its storage capacity difference between total porosity and maximal soil moisture measured during infiltration and consequently may reduce the generation of surface runoff storage capacity may provide key information on the strength of macropore flow and the interaction between macropores and the soil matrix that are highly sensitive to the degree of soil compaction e g alaoui 2015 3 2 hillslope scale at the hillslope scale changes in the soil structure due to mechanical stresses resulting from tillage practices or cattle trampling can increase lateral fluxes in the topsoil interflow and surface runoff doerner and horn 2006 at the soil surface structure degraded or crusty soils caused by a lack of soil cover or by heavy agricultural machines may lead to ponding of water or overland flow in sloping landscapes and potentially to increased erosion battiato et al 2015 at the hillslope scale the conditions that affect surface runoff generation have often been investigated using sprinkling experiments scherrer et al 2007 conducted sprinkling experiments on 60 m2 hillslope sites at 18 mainly grassland locations in switzerland with rates of 50 100 mm h during 3 6 h they found that infiltration inhibitors such as compacted topsoils in combination with surface sealing and permanently hydrophobic humus in combination with poor macropore development were linked to surface runoff excess in some locations attributes such as vegetation slope soil clay content and antecedent soil moisture were not directly linked to surface runoff excess other studies showed that compaction of water repellent dry soils in forested catchments may lead to a temporary hortonian overland flow e g badoux et al 2006 schwarz 1986 kohl et al 1997 markart et al 2004 3 3 catchment scale the catchment evidence reported in the literature is mostly related to stock trampling effects e g holman et al 2003 pattison and lane 2011 stocking densities have recently increased in a number of countries and this has been correlated with increasing floods for example in wales 72 of the agricultural land was under grassland production to support sheep farming in 2005 sheep numbers in the uk increased from 19 7 million in 1950 to 40 2 million in 1990 fuller and gough 1999 stock tends to reduce the vegetation cover which may lead to soil surface crusting and reduced overland flow resistance ferrero 1991 it may also lead to a decrease in evapotranspiration owens et al 1997 heathwaite et al 1990 found that infiltration capacity was reduced by 80 on grazed areas compared to fields with no stock overall stock trampling may impact on runoff generation and possibly downstream flood risk pattison and lane 2011 for example in the derwent catchment sheep stocking rates doubled between 1944 and 1975 which coincided with a runoff increase of 25 evans 1996 similarly increasing flow peaks in the upper catchment of the river lune was qualitatively related to increased stock densities orr and carling 2006 within the yorkshire ouse catchment over 40 of the sites investigated after the autumn 2000 floods had high soil degradation and this was estimated to have caused a runoff increase of between 0 8 and 9 4 holman et al 2003 heathwaite et al 1989 found that 7 of the rainfall was converted to runoff in ungrazed fields while this increased to 53 in grazed fields although urban soils are often thought to be of poor quality and highly compacted lorenz and lal 2009 pickett and cadenasso 2009 little attention has been paid to its impact on floods edmondson et al 2011 arnold and gibbons 1996 and white and greer 2006 concluded that storm runoff and peak flow increase with urban development as the proportion of impervious land increases for example mercer creek an urban stream in western washington had an earlier and higher peak discharge and a larger volume during a one day storm on february 1 2000 than newaukum creek a nearly rural stream konrad 2016 in general runoff increases with the fraction of built up area in a catchment but the relationship is not necessarily linear chen et al 2015 importantly the location of built up area within the catchment matters because of spatial flow connectivity warburton et al 2012 sanyal et al 2014 4 modelling evidence of soil compaction on floods numerous studies have attempted to relate land use changes and flood changes based on hydrological modelling table 2 in this review we have included studies that are not strictly on soil compaction but more generally on land use to put soil compaction into a broader context the studies fall into three groups i increasing areas of compacted soils grayson et al 2010 schilling et al 2014a b peña et al 2016 fohrer et al 2001 ii changes in rainfall exacerbated by highly degraded and compacted soils e g viglione et al 2016 holman et al 2003 and iii soil type effects i e fine texture and low infiltration capacity of degraded forest and wood land soils roy and mistri 2013 4 1 area of compaction most studies reviewed found a direct relationship between increased area of compacted soil and peak discharge grayson et al 2010 reported that the storm hydrograph in their 11 4 km2 catchment was significantly affected by the area of bare peat so revegetation of eroded blanket peatland could be beneficial in reducing flood peaks schilling et al 2014a b suggest that land afforestation in the raccoon river watershed could reduce both the number of flood events and the frequency of severe floods peña et al 2016 analysed the relationship between changes in topsoil hydraulic properties static storage capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity due to changes in land use and peak flows using a conceptual distributed hydrological model table 2 in their study grassland area increased by 37 5 while forests and crops decreased by 32 1 and 6 2 respectively between the 1991 and 2000 scenarios these changes produced an increase of 2 1 in the mean annual floods in the 2007 scenario forest and crop areas were increased by 7 0 and 55 9 while grassland was decreased by 30 5 compared to the 2000 scenario which translated in a 7 0 decrease of the mean annual floods fohrer et al 2001 used the swat soil and water assessment tool model to quantify the hydrologic response of several catchments to land use change and noted that a decrease in forest cover may amplify flood peaks for the dietzhölze catchment in germany the outcomes cited above are supported by other studies hess et al 2010 modelled the impacts of improved soil conditions on peak discharges across england and wales they showed that changes in land management can reduce small floods while the effect on large flood peaks 100 year floods is less than 5 mcintyre and marshall 2010 proposed that agriculturally improved grassland which at some point had been drained ploughed and fertilized produces a flashier response than grassland in a more natural condition in the uk naef et al 2002 modelled the effect of converting pasture to forest showing that fast response dominant runoff processes may become slower however subsurface flow processes occurring mainly in the deep soil layers or in the bedrock are often outside the sphere of influence of land use change yan et al 2013 attributed changes in streamflow to changes in the extent of farmland forest and urban areas in a chinese catchment while chen et al 2015 reported a direct relationship between rapid urbanisation and peak discharge 4 2 rainfall and compaction while the studies mentioned above have focused on a single driver a number of multidriver studies have been published recently for example villarini and strong 2014 and prosdocimi et al 2015 considered precipitation and a land use indicator as covariates in us and uk contexts respectively while villarini and strong 2014 attributed flood changes to rainfall variability changes prosdocimi et al 2015 focused on the dominant role of urbanisation viglione et al 2016 reported precipitation change to be the main driver of increasing flood trends in upper austria while they identified land use change as an important driver in small catchments fig 2 they reasoned that the effect of land use change on floods decreases with catchment area due to a shift in runoff generation mechanisms in small catchments with short response times floods are mostly generated by high intensity short duration storms so the infiltration excess mechanism is dominant in large catchments with long response times floods are mostly generated by low intensity long duration storms so the saturation excess mechanism is dominant since land use change affects the infiltration excess mechanism more strongly through reduced infiltration capacity associated with soil compaction than the saturation excess mechanism the land use change effect on floods decreases with catchment area fig 2 in their four uk catchments holman et al 2003 showed that rapid response runoff during the autumn floods of 2000 was related to the widespread highly degraded and compacted soils in fodder maize fields due to harvesting under wet soil conditions at larger catchment scales agricultural land management does not seem to have affected flooding in the uk o connell et al 2007 which suggests that the effect of compaction does decrease with catchment area 4 3 soil texture exacerbating compaction effects the effect of compaction on increasing peak discharges may be enhanced if topsoils are fine textured with low infiltration capacities roy and mistri 2013 showed a direct relationship between the extent of area covered by fine material and peak discharge in their kunur watershed india based on the hydrological soil groups the areas with particularly large peak discharges were characterized by fine sandy loam dense forest and degraded wood land 55 followed by areas characterized by fine clay to silt soils and agricultural land use 35 similarly alaoui et al 2011b found that compared to forest hillslopes grassland hillslopes had higher micropore volumes in the topsoil down to 0 35 m the topsoils of the hillslopes that generated surface runoff had higher clay contents than the hillslopes without surface runoff as clay content was closely correlated with micropore volume the authors concluded that the high clay content enhances matrix flow delays water routing into the macropores and thus increases surface runoff 5 research gaps research gaps on soil compaction effects on floods mainly remain at the medium and large catchment scales and in particular regarding the question whether the effects really decrease with area and why we consider the following to be key research gaps 5 1 areal coverage a first order control of the effect on floods is the total area of soil compaction within a catchment which however can vary tremendously in space and time depending on agricultural practices fiener et al 2011 green et al 2003 methods are needed to reliably map soil compaction in the landscape these may be based on a combination of field surveys spatial soil data and possibly remote sensing 5 2 patchiness connectivity the spatial arrangement of compacted soils may be equally important as their area per se this is because of the role of spatial connectivity and patchiness on runoff generation and routing from the hillslope to the catchment scales western et al 1998 a better understanding of the effects of connectivity and location would be useful for deriving scaling relationships for upscaling land use change effects to the catchment scale 5 3 temporal variability the seasonal variability in topsoil compaction due to regular agricultural practices such as harvesting and subsequent field traffic is important for flood generation if maximum rainfall coincides with maximum compaction during the year current models do not account for this variability more research is needed on understanding these links across scales 5 4 feedbacks many of the processes involved in compaction effects on floods are interlinked rogger et al 2017 for example the mechanical and hydraulic processes during soil deformation are coupled which exacerbates soil compaction since more compact soils generally remain wet for a longer time of the year identifying the most important feedbacks related to soil compaction processes is therefore of key interest for upscaling their impacts to the catchments scale 5 5 masking in most instances changes in floods at the catchment scale are related to more than one control including climate and river training quantitative knowledge of these components is necessary to isolate the impact of soil compaction on floods blöschl et al 2007 and viglione et al 2016 among others suggested that the impact of land use on floods decreases with catchment scale but more quantitative analyses in different climates are needed to attribute flood changes to their drivers including soil compaction 5 6 model parameterization studies on land use change impacts at the catchment scale currently are mostly modelling studies that are based on assumptions of how model parameters change with changing land use e g salazar et al 2012 an important task is to improve soil compaction parameterization at the hillslope and catchment scales the parameterizations should account for flow connectivity and patchiness 6 ways forward we believe that the research gaps summarised above can be addressed by focusing on four research strands i synthesizing past research related to soil compaction and runoff by meta analyses ii complementing this knowledge by additional field experiments iii developing novel methods for mapping soil compaction and iv learning from disciplines such as agricultural sciences and soil physics where extensive knowledge on soil compaction exists 6 1 meta analyses as suggested by rogger et al 2017 comparative meta analyses of existing studies related to soil compaction and runoff processes would be a first step towards generalising the findings from individual case studies see e g koricheva and gurevitch 2014 mutema et al 2015 soil compaction studies have often been performed in agricultural contexts but do address very relevant information related to flood processes such as changes in pore structure hydraulic conductivity and bulk density to facilitate future meta analyses it would be important for publications to fully report the relevant information ideally in a consistent way koutsoyiannis et al 2016 data on soil physical properties measured in the field compaction assessments and maps of compaction susceptibility of soils should be made publically available in a similar way as the european hydropedological data inventory eu hydi tóth et al 2013 and the hypres database wösten et al 1999 6 2 additional field experiments existing long term experimental sites should be upgraded to better address the question of soil compaction effects on floods specifically the evolution of hydraulic soil characteristics and its dynamics during the year including changes in the macropore volume connectivity and functionality should be monitored over long periods of time in addition to runoff of particular interest is the memory effect of soils i e how fast a change in soil conditions translates into a corresponding change in flood characteristics in order to obtain a mechanistic description of the coupled mechanical and hydraulic processes tailored field experiments should be conducted these would consist of treatment and wheeling experiments on plots under different crop management practices and soils where soil deformation and stress strain processes are measured as well as the stress induced changes in hydraulic conductivity and their time dependency during loading and soil deformation this research should build on the findings of the meta analyses mentioned above 6 3 mapping soil compaction there is a lot of potential in developing new mapping methods that may assist in understanding the spatial compaction patterns and thus upscaling compaction effects to the catchment scale blöschl 2006 data from geophysical techniques such as ground penetrating radar lane et al 2016 gps based modelling of field traffic duttmann et al 2013 and perhaps remote sensing data e g ryan et al 2014 joshi et al 2016 could be combined since soil compaction may persist over decades knowledge of the land use history would be a benefit 6 4 bridging gap between different disciplines collaborations between hydrology and sister disciplines has dramatically increased in the recent decade but there is room for improvement in particular regarding soils bringing soil science pedology agricultural sciences and hydrology closer together through joint projects conferences and publications would assist in a more permanent contribution to advancing science batey 2009 noted that several authors recommend that monitoring of soil physical conditions including compaction should be part of routine soil management we suggest that monitoring compaction processes would also be of enormous benefit for water management 7 conclusions based on the literature review we can distinguish three ways in which soil compaction impacts peak discharge at the catchment scale i by an increase in the area affected by soil compaction ii by changes in rainfall events exacerbated by highly degraded soils and iii by coincidence of soil compaction with fine topsoils in degraded lands more specifically the following conclusions can be drawn on the effects of soil compaction on floods 1 experimental studies at the plot and hillslope scales suggest consistent evidence of the impact of soil compaction on increasing surface runoff locally compaction tends to reduce infiltration and increase surface runoff with increasing scale the tendency of reduced infiltration and increased surface runoff persists but is modulated by numerous other factors such as surface sealing permanently hydrophobic humus and poor macropore development at the catchment scale studies tend to be more speculative as most of the evidence comes from non quantitative reasoning increasing floods in some regions were attributed to increased stocking densities as suggested by marked differences of surface runoff between grazed and ungrazed fields the literature suggests that storm runoff increases with urban development as the proportion of impervious land increases but this relationship is not necessarily linear the location of built up area within the mosaic of land uses may affect the spatial flow connectivity and consequently surface runoff in many ways 2 modelling studies suggest that soil compaction may affect peak discharges at the catchment scale but the magnitude of this effect varies between studies in small catchments with short response times floods are mostly generated by the infiltration excess mechanism from high intensity short duration storms in this case the reduction of infiltration capacity by soil compaction can have a major effect on flood peaks in large catchments where floods are often produced by the saturation excess mechanism from lower intensity longer duration storms the effect of soil compaction of flood peaks is less obvious overall soil compaction effects on floods tend to increase with the size of the compacted area but its spatial arrangement in the landscape does matter 3 research gaps include the reliable mapping of soil compaction in the landscape understanding the patchiness of compacted soils and the spatial connectivity of flow paths they also include a better understanding of the temporal variability of compacted soil characteristics feedbacks between floods and soil compaction at different time scales and unravelling the multitude of factors that may mask the relationship between soil compaction and floods future research and funding should give high priority to understanding the links between soil compaction and floods at the catchment scale as it will provide key information on one of the important drivers of floods acknowledgements the present work was developed within the framework of the panta rhei research initiative of the international association of hydrological sciences iahs as a contribution of the working groups understanding flood changes and changes in flood risk funding was

7513,europe has experienced a series of major floods in the past years which suggests that flood magnitudes may have increased land degradation due to soil compaction from crop farming or grazing intensification is one of the potential drivers of this increase a literature review suggests that most of the experimental evidence was generated at plot and hillslope scales at larger scales most studies are based on models there are three ways in which soil compaction affects floods at the catchment scale i through an increase in the area affected by soil compaction ii by exacerbating the effects of changes in rainfall especially for highly degraded soils and iii when soil compaction coincides with soils characterized by a fine texture and a low infiltration capacity we suggest that future research should focus on better synthesising past research on soil compaction and runoff tailored field experiments to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the coupled mechanical and hydraulic processes new mapping methods of soil compaction that combine mechanical and remote sensing approaches and an effort to bridge all disciplines relevant to soil compaction effects on floods keywords soil compaction floods land use changes soil hydrology upscaling flow processes 1 introduction europe has experienced a series of major floods in the past years which may suggest that flooding is becoming more frequent and severe e g hall et al 2014 destructive floods occurred in several european countries like germany and poland in august 2002 in western austria in 2005 in italy in november 1994 october 2000 and autumn 2011 the uk in october 2000 summer 2007 and the winters of 2013 14 and 2015 16 in central europe in july 1997 summer 2010 and june 2013 the balkan region in may 2014 and most recently in germany france and belgium in june 2016 kundzewicz et al 2017 in order to project any changes into the future it is important to understand the drivers that have triggered flood changes in the past there are three potential drivers climate change hydraulic structures and land use change viglione et al 2016 hall et al 2014 blöschl et al 2017 among these land use change effects are probably the least well understood e g peña et al 2016 rogger et al 2017 humans have interfered with landscapes over millennia at an ever increasing rate in the last centuries global rain fed cropland and pastureland have increased by 460 and 560 respectively scanlon et al 2007 land use change tends to follow a set pattern from the restoration of natural vegetation to boundary clearing then to subsistence agriculture and small scale farms and as a final point to intensive agriculture urban areas and protected recreational lands foley et al 2005 these land use changes are often associated with soil degradation particularly if heavy machinery is used but grazing intensification may also lead to major modifications of the soils carroll et al 2004 o connell et al 2004 some 33 million hectares are affected by soil compaction in europe oldeman et al 1991 cited by birkas 2008 of these 20 million hectares are in eastern europe which amounts to 37 5 of the agricultural land birkas 2008 batey 2009 soil compaction can cause a number of environmental and agronomic problems including increased leaching of agrochemicals to the recipient waters emission of greenhouse gases crop yield losses erosion and flooding holman et al 2003 doerner and horn 2006 singh and hadda 2014 while soil compaction effects on surface runoff are relatively well understood at the local scale rogger et al 2017 the larger scale effects are rather elusive and the literature is rather fragmented to the best of the authors knowledge no literature review has been published on the impacts of soil compaction on flood processes at the catchment scale the main aim of this review is to summarise current knowledge on the subject in an organised way identify gaps and propose new avenues to better understanding soil compaction effects on floods while the focus is on soil compaction effects on floods we refer to land use instead of soil compaction in cases where the degree of compaction is not specifically quantified in the literature 2 soil compaction processes 2 1 types and causes of soil compaction compaction is defined as an increase in soil bulk density and reduction in soil porosity boone 1988 da silva et al 1994 in contrast soil shearing does not necessarily reduce soil porosity but does destroy the continuity of macropores e g horn et al 1995 alaoui et al 2011a together they are referred to as soil deformation e g alaoui et al 2011a the ability of a soil to resist non recoverable deformation during loading the soil strength is influenced by several factors such as texture structure organic matter content and in particular the soil water content gill and vanden berg 1967 horn 1988 the behaviour of a soil during loading is therefore usually examined as a function of soil water content young and warkentin 1966 soil strength can be estimated from stress strain relationships obtained from laboratory experiments casagrande 1936 or from pedo transfer functions van den akker 2004 horn and fleige 2003 the vulnerability to compaction may be assessed by comparing soil strength with the vertical loading soil compaction may affect the surface and the subsurface surface topsoil compaction compaction at the soil surface down to the depth reached by tillage may result from stock grazing trampling and traffic loading table 1 trampling effects depend on stock density animal weight hoof size soil moisture soil type plant type and field slope e g zhao et al 2010 krümmelbein et al 2006 it mainly affects the pore geometry at the soil surface nie et al 2001 vzzotto et al 2000 and the topsoil matrix alaoui and helbling 2006 it may reduce the number of earthworms resulting in an additional reduction in infiltration e g hills 1971 the compaction depth does not usually exceed 10 cm greenwood and mckenzie 2001 surface compaction may result from traffic loading especially from tractors with mounted or trailed implements below the contact surface between soil and tire the soil deforms under normal and shear stresses e g horn and rostek 2000 the shear stress rises sharply with an increase in traction force and wheel slip which may lead to the detachment of a weak topsoil layer vulnerable to erosion and surface runoff battiato et al 2013 tractor passes can form an anisotropic soil pore system due to the simultaneous movement of particles forward and downwards and to wheel slippage pagliai et al 2003 peng and horn 2008 the changes can form a platy structure in the upper few centimetres with elongated pores that are oriented parallel to the soil surface these pores are not vertically continuous and induce mainly horizontal water fluxes horn et al 2003 pagliai et al 2003 subsurface subsoil compaction the mechanical strength of structured characterized by the matrix and macropore domains soils mainly depends on aggregation actual and maximum pre drying and the composition and arrangement of the pore system horn and rostek 2000 the more negative the pore water pressure the more pronounced is the strength increase thus under humid climatic conditions soils usually get weaker with depth subsoil compaction risks increase with farm size machine weight e g harvester and the drive for greater productivity once subsoil damage occurs it can be extremely difficult and expensive to alleviate jones et al 2003 usually the first pass of a wheel causes a major portion of the total topsoil compaction bakker and davis 1995 botta et al 2006 silva et al 2008 whereas repeated traffic with low axle loads can affect the subsoil balbuena et al 2000 hamza and anderson 2005 2 2 soil properties 2 2 1 soil structure laboratory experiments have shown that the inter aggregate structure of soils is more susceptible to compaction than the soil aggregates themselves li and zhang 2009 macroporosity is therefore more sensitive to compaction than total porosity alakukku 1996 jégou et al 2002 showed that soil compaction decreases the continuity of burrow systems soils with mainly horizontal pores are more susceptible to compaction than those with vertical pores hartge and bohne 1983 schäffer et al 2008 2 2 2 soil texture the degree of compaction actual bulk density expressed as a percentage of the reference compaction state of a given soil håkansson and lipiec 2000 also depends on soil texture for example silt loam soils with low colloid contents are more susceptible than medium or fine textured loamy and clayey soils at low water contents while sandy soils are only slightly susceptible to soil compaction horn et al 1995 smith et al 1997 showed that a loamy soil subjected to varied pressures and moisture contents was resistant to compaction when dried and susceptible to compaction when wet while a loamy sand soil showed smaller increases in compaction with increasing load and moisture content 2 2 3 organic matter increases in soil organic matter may reduce compactibility by increasing resistance to deformation and or by increasing elasticity rebound effects soane 1990 high organic carbon contents can even reduce soil compaction at high moisture levels in clay and silty clay soils smith et al 1997 nawaz et al 2013 hamza and anderson 2005 smith et al 1997 2 2 4 water content soil water content is usually the most important factor influencing soil compaction soane and van ouwerkerk 1994 hamza and anderson 2005 traffic experiments on arable land with heavy excavators weighing up to 47 tons showed a decrease in the frequency and volume of macropores down to depths of 0 65 m and 1 0 m for dry and wet soils respectively dumbeck 1984 wet conditions in autumn winter and spring exacerbate the effect of heavy machinery on compaction arvidsson et al 2001 showed that the risk of soil compaction with commonly used machinery in southern sweden is 100 for spring slurry application and more than 60 after october in sugar beet harvesting yung et al 2010 found that high compaction was due to the footslope staying wetter for a longer period during the spring and early summer because of cover crop residues 2 3 time scales of soil compaction environmental and management related factors tend to interact on different time scales in driving the temporal dynamics of the structure related soil hydraulic properties mapa et al 1986 kay 1990 bodner et al 2013 for example kohl and markart 2002 showed that compaction effects are usually largest in autumn after the grazing period but soils may recover during winter and spring due to freezing thawing processes plant root activity and microbial activity soils which are wet during critical times of land management operations such as ploughing and harvesting can be prone to compaction and structural damage earl 1997 holman et al 2003 and can result in long term effects that are mainly observed where a plough pan a compacted layer that tends to form just below the ploughing depth develops a stable natural soil structure may only be achieved after several years when changing practices from regular soil loosening to no tillage wright et al 1999 soils under long term no tillage with low self mulching potential low clay and organic matter content may tend towards high bulk density and low water permeability munkholm et al 2003 persistent compaction effects are often observed for the subsoil of agriculturally used fields even after their abandonment soil compaction may be persistent over decades kellner and hubbart 2016 indicating a long memory effect potential factors controlling this memory are land use soil type topography and climate cambi et al 2015 rogger et al 2017 for some soils the compaction may be measurable even after 14 years berisso et al 2012 etana et al 2013 and may persist over 30 years if underground pipelines have been installed or the landscape remodelled using heavy machinery batey 2009 the impact of 13 years of cattle grazing was still measurable in a secondary teak forest after 10 years of growth zimmermann et al 2006 and former agricultural plots showed increased runoff 30 years after afforestation hümann et al 2011 while some forest soils tend to recover in a few years mace 1971 shoulders and terry 1978 others take 10 20 years to recover from shallow compaction dickerson 1976 froehlich 1979 jakobsen 1983 compaction of deep layers can persist over 100 years greacen and sands 1980 2 4 macropore flow surface runoff relationship macropores i e biopores represent only 0 23 2 00 of the total soil volume but may account for about 74 100 of the total water flux alaoui and helbling 2006 they are the most sensitive pores to compaction their volume reduction may significantly reduce vertical infiltration and thus increase surface runoff e g gerke 2006 hendrickx and flury 2001 alaoui 2015 severing their connectivity between the top few centimetres and the underlying macropores additionally reduces infiltration alaoui et al 2011b jégou et al 2002 alaoui 2015 the flow through macropores depends on the initial and boundary conditions and the exchange between the matrix and macropore domains which in turn depends on soil moisture texture degree of compaction and organic matter kluitenberg and horton 1990 zehe and blöschl 2004 mcgrath et al 2009 larsbo 2011 since these variables are rarely known at the field scale jarvis et al 2012 one usually resorts to quantifying their spatially integrated effects as effective hydraulic properties blöschl and sivapalan 1995 one possibility is to classify these properties into pedons or spatial units addiscott and mirza 1998 seyfried and wilcox 1995 an interesting observation is that of structural hierarchy brewer 1964 hadas 1987 dexter 1988 dexter et al 2008 the mean sizes of the pores separating the soil aggregates at progressively higher levels are themselves progressively bigger e g dexter et al 2008 this structural hierarchy can be extended to the hillslope scale in humid climates lateral preferential flow can dominate stream response in catchments with steep slopes and permeable soils on low permeability rocks weiler and mcdonnell 2007 anderson et al 2009 cammeraat and kooijman 2009 compaction can affect this hierarchy possibly resulting in a more heterogeneous spatial distribution of flow processes 2 5 mapping soil compaction when assessing the effects of soil compaction on floods one would ideally like to know the spatial distribution and extent of soil compaction or at least the soil compaction risk a number of approaches have been developed for assessing the soil compaction risk although invariably they have focused on agricultural applications rather than floods van den akker 1988 1994 computed soil stresses due to tractor wheels based on the relationships of söhne 1958 by dividing the contact area into small units and aggregating the stresses from point loads of all units lebert 2010 estimated the soil compaction risk for the arable land in germany using results of houšková 2008 while troldborg et al 2013 used bayesian belief networks by combining data from standard soil surveys land use and expert judgement d or and destain 2014 computed the preconsolidation stress determined based on the stress strain relationship of soil obtained during laboratory compression according to casagrande 1936 from pedotransfer functions horn and fleige 2003 based on pedological mechanical and hydraulic characteristics within a geostatistical framework recently geophysical techniques for investigating subsurface compaction in agricultural soils have been advanced such as ground penetrating radar lane et al 2016 wang et al 2016 andré et al 2012 although these are usually limited to rather small scales mapping methods can be assisted by gps based modelling of spatial patterns of field traffic intensity duttmann et al 2013 3 experimental evidence of soil compaction effects on floods 3 1 plot scale compaction of the topsoil due to tillage practices results in a reduced infiltration capacity and increases the probability of surface runoff formation during heavy precipitation e g byrd et al 2002 furthermore the spatial variability of compaction due to the trafficked rows and non trafficked interrows tends to enhance the spatial variability of surface and subsurface flow paths liebig et al 1993 mohanty et al 1996 kim et al 2010 conducted field experiments on mexico silt loam with field treatments of uniformly compacted and non compacted plots they found an increase in the bulk density of the compacted plot of 8 and a decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity of 69 respectively which would translate into increased surface runoff battiato et al 2015 studied the effect of slipping driving wheels of agricultural equipment on surface runoff generation during sprinkling experiments they found that the runoff coefficient increased from 0 79 with a minimum slip of 1 to 1 00 with a maximum slip of 27 indicating that all the rainwater would be transformed into surface runoff at high slip the formation of a plough pan in the subsoil changes the direction of water percolation by impeding vertical infiltration and enhancing interflow bertolino et al 2010 for instance found that soils in south eastern brasilia with a plough pan at about 20 cm depth stay longer saturated after rainfall events and favour surface runoff during intense rainy periods singh and hadda 2014 reported a decrease in the infiltration rate with increasing subsoil compaction they observed a decrease in infiltration rate by a factor of 2 0 2 3 under two different treatments of their sandy loam soil the decrease in infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration was due to a decrease in total porosity under higher subsoil compaction using infiltration and dye tracer experiments supplemented by soil textural and structural data alaoui et al 2012 investigated flow pathways on grassland and forest hillslopes in order to identify the controls of surface runoff generation they showed that the two types of land use lead to different flow processes mainly vertical infiltration for the forest soil and mainly surface runoff for the grassland soil fig 1 this is due to the larger root water uptake by trees and thus lower soil moisture and the larger unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of forest soils as compared to compacted grassland soils the low efficiency of grassland soil macropores in transporting water vertically downward can be explained by i the fine and dense topsoil layers caused by the land use that limits water fluxes into the underlying macropores and ii their restricted number their tortuosity and the restricted interaction between macropores and the matrix below the topsoil layer the larger root water uptake of forest soil as compared to grassland soil can be viewed as an additional factor enhancing its storage capacity difference between total porosity and maximal soil moisture measured during infiltration and consequently may reduce the generation of surface runoff storage capacity may provide key information on the strength of macropore flow and the interaction between macropores and the soil matrix that are highly sensitive to the degree of soil compaction e g alaoui 2015 3 2 hillslope scale at the hillslope scale changes in the soil structure due to mechanical stresses resulting from tillage practices or cattle trampling can increase lateral fluxes in the topsoil interflow and surface runoff doerner and horn 2006 at the soil surface structure degraded or crusty soils caused by a lack of soil cover or by heavy agricultural machines may lead to ponding of water or overland flow in sloping landscapes and potentially to increased erosion battiato et al 2015 at the hillslope scale the conditions that affect surface runoff generation have often been investigated using sprinkling experiments scherrer et al 2007 conducted sprinkling experiments on 60 m2 hillslope sites at 18 mainly grassland locations in switzerland with rates of 50 100 mm h during 3 6 h they found that infiltration inhibitors such as compacted topsoils in combination with surface sealing and permanently hydrophobic humus in combination with poor macropore development were linked to surface runoff excess in some locations attributes such as vegetation slope soil clay content and antecedent soil moisture were not directly linked to surface runoff excess other studies showed that compaction of water repellent dry soils in forested catchments may lead to a temporary hortonian overland flow e g badoux et al 2006 schwarz 1986 kohl et al 1997 markart et al 2004 3 3 catchment scale the catchment evidence reported in the literature is mostly related to stock trampling effects e g holman et al 2003 pattison and lane 2011 stocking densities have recently increased in a number of countries and this has been correlated with increasing floods for example in wales 72 of the agricultural land was under grassland production to support sheep farming in 2005 sheep numbers in the uk increased from 19 7 million in 1950 to 40 2 million in 1990 fuller and gough 1999 stock tends to reduce the vegetation cover which may lead to soil surface crusting and reduced overland flow resistance ferrero 1991 it may also lead to a decrease in evapotranspiration owens et al 1997 heathwaite et al 1990 found that infiltration capacity was reduced by 80 on grazed areas compared to fields with no stock overall stock trampling may impact on runoff generation and possibly downstream flood risk pattison and lane 2011 for example in the derwent catchment sheep stocking rates doubled between 1944 and 1975 which coincided with a runoff increase of 25 evans 1996 similarly increasing flow peaks in the upper catchment of the river lune was qualitatively related to increased stock densities orr and carling 2006 within the yorkshire ouse catchment over 40 of the sites investigated after the autumn 2000 floods had high soil degradation and this was estimated to have caused a runoff increase of between 0 8 and 9 4 holman et al 2003 heathwaite et al 1989 found that 7 of the rainfall was converted to runoff in ungrazed fields while this increased to 53 in grazed fields although urban soils are often thought to be of poor quality and highly compacted lorenz and lal 2009 pickett and cadenasso 2009 little attention has been paid to its impact on floods edmondson et al 2011 arnold and gibbons 1996 and white and greer 2006 concluded that storm runoff and peak flow increase with urban development as the proportion of impervious land increases for example mercer creek an urban stream in western washington had an earlier and higher peak discharge and a larger volume during a one day storm on february 1 2000 than newaukum creek a nearly rural stream konrad 2016 in general runoff increases with the fraction of built up area in a catchment but the relationship is not necessarily linear chen et al 2015 importantly the location of built up area within the catchment matters because of spatial flow connectivity warburton et al 2012 sanyal et al 2014 4 modelling evidence of soil compaction on floods numerous studies have attempted to relate land use changes and flood changes based on hydrological modelling table 2 in this review we have included studies that are not strictly on soil compaction but more generally on land use to put soil compaction into a broader context the studies fall into three groups i increasing areas of compacted soils grayson et al 2010 schilling et al 2014a b peña et al 2016 fohrer et al 2001 ii changes in rainfall exacerbated by highly degraded and compacted soils e g viglione et al 2016 holman et al 2003 and iii soil type effects i e fine texture and low infiltration capacity of degraded forest and wood land soils roy and mistri 2013 4 1 area of compaction most studies reviewed found a direct relationship between increased area of compacted soil and peak discharge grayson et al 2010 reported that the storm hydrograph in their 11 4 km2 catchment was significantly affected by the area of bare peat so revegetation of eroded blanket peatland could be beneficial in reducing flood peaks schilling et al 2014a b suggest that land afforestation in the raccoon river watershed could reduce both the number of flood events and the frequency of severe floods peña et al 2016 analysed the relationship between changes in topsoil hydraulic properties static storage capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity due to changes in land use and peak flows using a conceptual distributed hydrological model table 2 in their study grassland area increased by 37 5 while forests and crops decreased by 32 1 and 6 2 respectively between the 1991 and 2000 scenarios these changes produced an increase of 2 1 in the mean annual floods in the 2007 scenario forest and crop areas were increased by 7 0 and 55 9 while grassland was decreased by 30 5 compared to the 2000 scenario which translated in a 7 0 decrease of the mean annual floods fohrer et al 2001 used the swat soil and water assessment tool model to quantify the hydrologic response of several catchments to land use change and noted that a decrease in forest cover may amplify flood peaks for the dietzhölze catchment in germany the outcomes cited above are supported by other studies hess et al 2010 modelled the impacts of improved soil conditions on peak discharges across england and wales they showed that changes in land management can reduce small floods while the effect on large flood peaks 100 year floods is less than 5 mcintyre and marshall 2010 proposed that agriculturally improved grassland which at some point had been drained ploughed and fertilized produces a flashier response than grassland in a more natural condition in the uk naef et al 2002 modelled the effect of converting pasture to forest showing that fast response dominant runoff processes may become slower however subsurface flow processes occurring mainly in the deep soil layers or in the bedrock are often outside the sphere of influence of land use change yan et al 2013 attributed changes in streamflow to changes in the extent of farmland forest and urban areas in a chinese catchment while chen et al 2015 reported a direct relationship between rapid urbanisation and peak discharge 4 2 rainfall and compaction while the studies mentioned above have focused on a single driver a number of multidriver studies have been published recently for example villarini and strong 2014 and prosdocimi et al 2015 considered precipitation and a land use indicator as covariates in us and uk contexts respectively while villarini and strong 2014 attributed flood changes to rainfall variability changes prosdocimi et al 2015 focused on the dominant role of urbanisation viglione et al 2016 reported precipitation change to be the main driver of increasing flood trends in upper austria while they identified land use change as an important driver in small catchments fig 2 they reasoned that the effect of land use change on floods decreases with catchment area due to a shift in runoff generation mechanisms in small catchments with short response times floods are mostly generated by high intensity short duration storms so the infiltration excess mechanism is dominant in large catchments with long response times floods are mostly generated by low intensity long duration storms so the saturation excess mechanism is dominant since land use change affects the infiltration excess mechanism more strongly through reduced infiltration capacity associated with soil compaction than the saturation excess mechanism the land use change effect on floods decreases with catchment area fig 2 in their four uk catchments holman et al 2003 showed that rapid response runoff during the autumn floods of 2000 was related to the widespread highly degraded and compacted soils in fodder maize fields due to harvesting under wet soil conditions at larger catchment scales agricultural land management does not seem to have affected flooding in the uk o connell et al 2007 which suggests that the effect of compaction does decrease with catchment area 4 3 soil texture exacerbating compaction effects the effect of compaction on increasing peak discharges may be enhanced if topsoils are fine textured with low infiltration capacities roy and mistri 2013 showed a direct relationship between the extent of area covered by fine material and peak discharge in their kunur watershed india based on the hydrological soil groups the areas with particularly large peak discharges were characterized by fine sandy loam dense forest and degraded wood land 55 followed by areas characterized by fine clay to silt soils and agricultural land use 35 similarly alaoui et al 2011b found that compared to forest hillslopes grassland hillslopes had higher micropore volumes in the topsoil down to 0 35 m the topsoils of the hillslopes that generated surface runoff had higher clay contents than the hillslopes without surface runoff as clay content was closely correlated with micropore volume the authors concluded that the high clay content enhances matrix flow delays water routing into the macropores and thus increases surface runoff 5 research gaps research gaps on soil compaction effects on floods mainly remain at the medium and large catchment scales and in particular regarding the question whether the effects really decrease with area and why we consider the following to be key research gaps 5 1 areal coverage a first order control of the effect on floods is the total area of soil compaction within a catchment which however can vary tremendously in space and time depending on agricultural practices fiener et al 2011 green et al 2003 methods are needed to reliably map soil compaction in the landscape these may be based on a combination of field surveys spatial soil data and possibly remote sensing 5 2 patchiness connectivity the spatial arrangement of compacted soils may be equally important as their area per se this is because of the role of spatial connectivity and patchiness on runoff generation and routing from the hillslope to the catchment scales western et al 1998 a better understanding of the effects of connectivity and location would be useful for deriving scaling relationships for upscaling land use change effects to the catchment scale 5 3 temporal variability the seasonal variability in topsoil compaction due to regular agricultural practices such as harvesting and subsequent field traffic is important for flood generation if maximum rainfall coincides with maximum compaction during the year current models do not account for this variability more research is needed on understanding these links across scales 5 4 feedbacks many of the processes involved in compaction effects on floods are interlinked rogger et al 2017 for example the mechanical and hydraulic processes during soil deformation are coupled which exacerbates soil compaction since more compact soils generally remain wet for a longer time of the year identifying the most important feedbacks related to soil compaction processes is therefore of key interest for upscaling their impacts to the catchments scale 5 5 masking in most instances changes in floods at the catchment scale are related to more than one control including climate and river training quantitative knowledge of these components is necessary to isolate the impact of soil compaction on floods blöschl et al 2007 and viglione et al 2016 among others suggested that the impact of land use on floods decreases with catchment scale but more quantitative analyses in different climates are needed to attribute flood changes to their drivers including soil compaction 5 6 model parameterization studies on land use change impacts at the catchment scale currently are mostly modelling studies that are based on assumptions of how model parameters change with changing land use e g salazar et al 2012 an important task is to improve soil compaction parameterization at the hillslope and catchment scales the parameterizations should account for flow connectivity and patchiness 6 ways forward we believe that the research gaps summarised above can be addressed by focusing on four research strands i synthesizing past research related to soil compaction and runoff by meta analyses ii complementing this knowledge by additional field experiments iii developing novel methods for mapping soil compaction and iv learning from disciplines such as agricultural sciences and soil physics where extensive knowledge on soil compaction exists 6 1 meta analyses as suggested by rogger et al 2017 comparative meta analyses of existing studies related to soil compaction and runoff processes would be a first step towards generalising the findings from individual case studies see e g koricheva and gurevitch 2014 mutema et al 2015 soil compaction studies have often been performed in agricultural contexts but do address very relevant information related to flood processes such as changes in pore structure hydraulic conductivity and bulk density to facilitate future meta analyses it would be important for publications to fully report the relevant information ideally in a consistent way koutsoyiannis et al 2016 data on soil physical properties measured in the field compaction assessments and maps of compaction susceptibility of soils should be made publically available in a similar way as the european hydropedological data inventory eu hydi tóth et al 2013 and the hypres database wösten et al 1999 6 2 additional field experiments existing long term experimental sites should be upgraded to better address the question of soil compaction effects on floods specifically the evolution of hydraulic soil characteristics and its dynamics during the year including changes in the macropore volume connectivity and functionality should be monitored over long periods of time in addition to runoff of particular interest is the memory effect of soils i e how fast a change in soil conditions translates into a corresponding change in flood characteristics in order to obtain a mechanistic description of the coupled mechanical and hydraulic processes tailored field experiments should be conducted these would consist of treatment and wheeling experiments on plots under different crop management practices and soils where soil deformation and stress strain processes are measured as well as the stress induced changes in hydraulic conductivity and their time dependency during loading and soil deformation this research should build on the findings of the meta analyses mentioned above 6 3 mapping soil compaction there is a lot of potential in developing new mapping methods that may assist in understanding the spatial compaction patterns and thus upscaling compaction effects to the catchment scale blöschl 2006 data from geophysical techniques such as ground penetrating radar lane et al 2016 gps based modelling of field traffic duttmann et al 2013 and perhaps remote sensing data e g ryan et al 2014 joshi et al 2016 could be combined since soil compaction may persist over decades knowledge of the land use history would be a benefit 6 4 bridging gap between different disciplines collaborations between hydrology and sister disciplines has dramatically increased in the recent decade but there is room for improvement in particular regarding soils bringing soil science pedology agricultural sciences and hydrology closer together through joint projects conferences and publications would assist in a more permanent contribution to advancing science batey 2009 noted that several authors recommend that monitoring of soil physical conditions including compaction should be part of routine soil management we suggest that monitoring compaction processes would also be of enormous benefit for water management 7 conclusions based on the literature review we can distinguish three ways in which soil compaction impacts peak discharge at the catchment scale i by an increase in the area affected by soil compaction ii by changes in rainfall events exacerbated by highly degraded soils and iii by coincidence of soil compaction with fine topsoils in degraded lands more specifically the following conclusions can be drawn on the effects of soil compaction on floods 1 experimental studies at the plot and hillslope scales suggest consistent evidence of the impact of soil compaction on increasing surface runoff locally compaction tends to reduce infiltration and increase surface runoff with increasing scale the tendency of reduced infiltration and increased surface runoff persists but is modulated by numerous other factors such as surface sealing permanently hydrophobic humus and poor macropore development at the catchment scale studies tend to be more speculative as most of the evidence comes from non quantitative reasoning increasing floods in some regions were attributed to increased stocking densities as suggested by marked differences of surface runoff between grazed and ungrazed fields the literature suggests that storm runoff increases with urban development as the proportion of impervious land increases but this relationship is not necessarily linear the location of built up area within the mosaic of land uses may affect the spatial flow connectivity and consequently surface runoff in many ways 2 modelling studies suggest that soil compaction may affect peak discharges at the catchment scale but the magnitude of this effect varies between studies in small catchments with short response times floods are mostly generated by the infiltration excess mechanism from high intensity short duration storms in this case the reduction of infiltration capacity by soil compaction can have a major effect on flood peaks in large catchments where floods are often produced by the saturation excess mechanism from lower intensity longer duration storms the effect of soil compaction of flood peaks is less obvious overall soil compaction effects on floods tend to increase with the size of the compacted area but its spatial arrangement in the landscape does matter 3 research gaps include the reliable mapping of soil compaction in the landscape understanding the patchiness of compacted soils and the spatial connectivity of flow paths they also include a better understanding of the temporal variability of compacted soil characteristics feedbacks between floods and soil compaction at different time scales and unravelling the multitude of factors that may mask the relationship between soil compaction and floods future research and funding should give high priority to understanding the links between soil compaction and floods at the catchment scale as it will provide key information on one of the important drivers of floods acknowledgements the present work was developed within the framework of the

7514,estimating continental water availability is of great importance for water resources management in terms of maintaining ecosystem integrity and sustaining society development to more accurately quantify the predictability of water availability on the basis of univariate probabilistic budyko framework a bivariate probabilistic budyko approach was developed using copula based joint distribution model for considering the dependence between parameter ω of wang tang s equation and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and was applied globally the results indicate the predictive performance in global water availability is conditional on the climatic condition in comparison with simple univariate distribution the bivariate one produces the lower interquartile range under the same global dataset especially in the regions with higher ndvi values highlighting the importance of developing the joint distribution by taking into account the dependence structure of parameter ω and ndvi which can provide more accurate probabilistic evaluation of water availability keywords budyko equation probabilistic framework water availability 1 introduction changes in the availability of water under changing environments have substantial impacts on hydroclimatic conditions allen and ingram 2002 ecosystem functions mooney et al 2005 and socioeconomic activities shiklomanov and rondda 2003 reiter et al 2004 from the hydrological cycle perspective water availability relies on the long term partitioning of precipitation p between evapotranspiration e and runoff r ye et al 2015 fang et al 2016 which reflects the hydrological response to atmospheric climate and landscape conditions jaramillo and destouni 2014 traditionally paired catchments method brown et al 2005 and the newtonian hydrological models which is a general term of the mechanistic models with the physical description of hydrologic processes e g evaporation infiltration surface runoff and base flow wang and tang 2014 are believed to be effective approaches to measure the change in water availability caused by climate and landscape altering however the paired catchments are subject to the difficulties in locating suitable controls and the expensive investigation wei and zhang 2010 wang et al 2013a b meanwhile the newtonian hydrological models are always limited due to the time consuming computation greve et al 2015 and large uncertainties in the model structure and parameter estimation wang et al 2016 therefore called darwinian hydrologic models a series of simpler water balance hydrological models aiming to explain the hydrologic behavior as a system have been concerned and applied harman and troch 2014 wang and tang 2014 among the darwinian hydrologic models a simple first order theoretical equation to describe the water and energy balance proposed by budyko 1974 has been found wide applications and experienced a revival in understanding of hydrologic behavior under changing environment milly 1994 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2006 donohue et al 2010 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and hejazi 2011 shao et al 2012 williams et al 2012 wang et al 2013a b li et al 2013 xu et al 2013 greve et al 2014 2015 singh and kumar 2015 zhou et al 2015 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 originally a universal relationship between the mean annual evaporation ratio e p and the aridity index potential evapotranspiration ep p without any parameter was proposed by budyko 1974 to describe long term water balance at large basins to characterize the shape of the budyko curve for a specific basin with different local conditions some analytical functional forms with a single parameter have been successively derived e g fu 1981 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 milly and dunne 2002 yang et al 2008 gerrits et al 2009 wang and tang 2014 the single parameter is considered to represent the integrated effect of the catchment characteristics which is reflected by topography shao et al 2012 xu et al 2013 vegetation functioning zhang et al 2001 donohue et al 2007 2010 brümmer et al 2002 li et al 2013 soil type and geologic substrate yang et al 2006 donohue et al 2012 as well as climate seasonality potter and zhang 2009 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and tang 2014 due to the complex interactions between the parameter ω and observable regional factors the systematic variations related to various catchment and climate characteristics are not still conclusive although many scholars attempted to give quantitative description for one or combined local factors e g roderick and farquhar 2011 donohue et al 2012 xu et al 2013 li et al 2013 recently without considering the concrete controls for a special basin greve et al 2015 established a probabilistic budyko framework to theoretically evaluate the predictability of water availability stemming from various catchment characteristics by deriving budyko distributions using observational data in basins widespread in u s subsequently based on the probabilistic budyko singh and kumar 2015 presented a bottom up framework to estimate the vulnerability of available water in india under the changing climate moreover in another work of gudmundsson et al 2016 based upon a derived sensitivity function from the probabilistic budyko framework the ep p was identified as the dominated factor of water availability in very humid climates presenting a greater influence on water availability than an equal relative change in other factors e g changes in seasonally irrigation and land use change the strength of the probabilistic framework is that with extending the deterministic formulation of the budyko curve to a probabilistic one it allows to quantitatively assess the uncertainties of water availability estimation from varying catchment characteristics under the same climatic aridity condition in the probabilistic budyko framework the single parameter ω of the one parameter budyko type equations was considered as a random variable in fact there are widespread evidences for the linkages of ω to various catchment characteristics and climate variability donohue et al 2010 roderick and farquhar 2011 shao et al 2012 to date although there are no definite physical or empirical relational expressions available for its estimations among the contributing factors to ω vegetation can specially serve as an excellent integrated indicator of these physical properties impacts on water and energy balances due that the influences of soil textures and topography yokoo et al 2008 williams et al 2012 climate seasonality gutman and ignatov 1998 as well as even some human activities such as harvesting and clearing roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and hejazi 2011 can be directly or indirectly reflected by vegetation signatures therefore it can be hypothesized that ω is not strictly a random variable gudmundsson et al 2016 apparently for the regions with the same mean climatic conditions represented by ep p the probability density of ω should not be uniform and will be impacted by the information of other controlling factors such as vegetation characteristics fig 1 consequently despite of the ambiguous conclusions about the physical driving mechanisms when constructing the probabilistic budyko framework integrating the spatiotemporal knowledge of known contributing factors into ω distribution may be better underline the deterministic origin of budyko theory thus in this study to address the predictability of water availability upon a recent probabilistic extension of the budyko framework by greve et al 2015 we further proposed a bivariate probabilistic framework based on the joint distribution between the ω and vegetation information despite of the unknown detailed dependency established using the copula model in this study a one parameter equation recently derived by wang and tang 2014 has been selected to construct the bivariate probabilistic framework in wang tang s equation the parameter ω was represented by the ratio between λ the initial evaporation ratio and h the horton index moreover the vegetation characteristics are proved to be one of the dominant controlling factors on the parameter ω a global application of the bivariate probabilistic framework was conducted to assess the water availability meanwhile a comparison between the uncertainties estimated from bivariate probabilistic framework and original one as well as the related discussion were carried out to highlight the advantages of new framework 2 methods 2 1 the wang tang s budyko equation recently a budyko equation has been derived by wang and tang 2014 for mean annual water balance in wang tang s equation as an analog to the concept of initial abstraction in the scs model e is separated into an initial evapotranspiration and continuing evapotranspiration wang and tang 2014 indicated that the initial evapotranspiration is broadly defined to include evapotranspiration from the forest floor leaf interception and temporary storage in pools the differences between p and initial evapotranspiration are defined as the effective precipitation effective precipitation is then partitioned into runoff and continuing evapotranspiration in this case wang and tang 2014 then implemented the generalization of the proportionality hypothesis of the scs model the ratio of continuing evapotranspiration to its potential values is equal to the ratio of runoff to its potential value in this context a one parameter budyko type equation was derived by wang and tang 2014 the equation is expressed as follows 1 e p 1 e p p 1 e p p 2 4 ω 2 ω e p p 2 ω 2 ω from the evapotranspiration perspective the parameter ω of eq 1 is the ratio between initial evapotranspiration and e also the parameter ω can be interpreted as the ratio between λ the initial evaporation ratio and h the horton index from the soil wetting perspective the initial evaporation ratio is the ratio of initial evapotranspiration to total soil wetting both soil wetting and initial evapotranspiration are affected by vegetation thus vegetation is the dominant factor on the parameter ω given that the parameter ω in wang tang s equation is mainly controlled by vegetation characteristics it is more appropriate for constructing the bivariate probabilistic model with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the parameter ω therefore wang tang s equation as a typical budyko type equation has been used in this study the parameter ω was calibrated with historically available data sets and used to establish the probabilistic representation of the budyko framework 2 2 one parameter archimedean bivariate copulas copulas can be defined as multivariate cumulative distribution functions cdfs with standard uniform marginal representing the dependence structure of random variables a bivariate cdf f x y x y can be written as a function of its marginal cdfs f x x and f y y according to the sklar theorem sklar 1959 2 f x y x y c f x x f y y the function c c u v is called a copula and is unique if the marginal distributions are continuous there are two main advantages in determining f x y x y 1 the marginals can be determined using different distributions and 2 the dependence structure can be described separately from the

be observed in fig 2a which is also revealed by previous studies e g li et al 2013 xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 therefore the conditional probability of ω given the scenarios of ndvi is of great importance for predictability of water availability comparing with the single distribution without considering the ndvi involvement e g singh and kumar 2015 greve et al 2015 gudmundsson et al 2016 the joint probability distribution would differ substantially the probabilistic budyko analysis stemming from ω distribution would thus be different more accurate estimations of uncertainties of predicting the water availability are expected compared with univariate probabilistic analysis 4 2 the global water availability and its uncertainties the estimated ω of 583 watersheds around the world were plotted see fig s3 spanning a wide range from 0 01 to 0 93 with the 5 50 and 95 quantile values of 0 052 0 400 and 0 770 different with the study of greve et al 2015 which employing the distribution of ω across the unite state for global assessments we used the dataset covering all the world to establish the bivariate distribution the median estimated values of water availability ratio defined as water availability divided by p varied spatially ranged from 0 1 to 0 80 fig 3 a taking the low water availability ratio as an example it mainly distribute in middle east north middle asia parts of australia and southeast africa the spatial pattern of water availability is mostly similar with that of the ep p fig 3b and is consistent with the common observed annual runoff rate milly et al 2005 while the uncertainties of the water availability ratio represented by the inter quartile range iqr present different spatial patterns fig 3c the high uncertainties mainly distribute in north of russia middle and east of africa the midwest with relative dry climate and west africa western europe east of russia with relative humid climate while the low uncertainties are mostly located in south of australia north of south america middle of asia east of north america and south of africa under very wet or dry conditions it s generally indicating the uncertainty itself is conditional on climate conditions ep p and the predictive performance in water availability initially decreases with increasing aridity and reaches its low value under transitional climates then slowly increases with increasing dryness this point is supported by the result of a meta analysis of 34 studies involving 3874 catchments parajka et al 2013 and earlier study conducted by greve et al 2015 however we also note the low or high uncertainty of water availability estimations should rely on the built distribution of ω for example compared with the study of greve et al 2015 a different pattern of distribution of ω across india showing boarder scatter scatter plot in budyko space with increasing aridity condition can be found in singh and kumar 2015 another national scale analysis although with the similar trend of iqr the difference in pattern of distribution of ω will affect the correlation between uncertainty and climate condition ep p for an example the relative high value of iqr will at different ep p ranges based on different built distributions of ω to further evaluate the analysis of uncertainties of water availability based on the bivariate probabilistic budyko framework proposed in this study we compared the iqr estimated by the ω univariate distribution signed as iqr1 and the copulas joint distribution of ω and ndvi signed as iqr2 fig 4 a although a strong correlation of iqr1 and iqr2 can be found all the iqr2 values were lower than the related iqr1 and the differences become larger along with the increasing iqr this means that the copulas bivariate can offer more accurate results with considering the dependence structure of ω and its dominated variable when assessing the probabilistic behaviors of water availability spatially it shows that the large differences in iqr estimated between simple univariate approach and copulas bivariate one mainly distributed in the regions with relative higher ndvi values figs 4b and 5 this may be explained by the different contribution of ndvi to water yield in different climate regions in terms of the previous studies the vegetation characteristics exert a significant influence on regional water balance and the long term regional annual water balance is sensitive to vegetation characteristics in other words a higher correlation between ndvi and the parameter ω is associated with an increasing ndvi indicating larger differences between margin distribution and conditional distribution of the parameter ω at the higher ndvi 5 summary and conclusion in this paper a bivariate probabilistic budyko approach was developed and employed to the global analysis for the water availability and the related uncertainty the ndvi reflecting the vegetation characteristics information the main controlling variable for water and energy balance proved previously e g donohue et al 2007 li et al 2013 was chosen to establish the copula based joint distribution model together with the catchment characteristic parameter ω of wang tang s equation the frank copula from the archimedean copula family was selected as the best fitted copula for building the bivariate distribution of global ω and ndvi dataset the uncertainty of water availability estimation can be quantified using conditional probabilities derived from the joint distribution model results indicated that the uncertainty relies on climatic condition with the high and low values distributing in transitional climates and very wet or dry conditions regions respectively moreover the results of comparative analysis between simple univariate distribution and bivariate one for uncertainty of water availability showed that the latter produce the lower interquartile range under the same global dataset especially in the regions with higher ndvi values indicating that the global analysis based on the joint distribution can provide more accurate probabilistic evaluation of water availability based on the characterization of the dependence structure of parameter ω and ndvi in fact in addition to vegetation characteristics information other catchment characteristics such as soil types topographic features and climatic seasonality can be also important for the hydrological processes and thus influence the water yield future efforts are thus needed to make multivariate copula model involving other critical controlling variables information to gain more precise assessment and prediction of water availability moreover only natural elements affecting the water availability were involved in the established bivariate probabilistic framework in this study however vegetation changes and human activities such as agricultural irrigation drinking water extraction and hydraulic projects also have altered the distribution of water resources and further influence the predictability of water availability therefore a holistic probabilistic framework should be comprehensively conducted in future with taking into consideration the natural and anthropogenic effects on water availability acknowledgments this work was jointly supported by the national science foundation of china 51779073 51379057 the

7514,estimating continental water availability is of great importance for water resources management in terms of maintaining ecosystem integrity and sustaining society development to more accurately quantify the predictability of water availability on the basis of univariate probabilistic budyko framework a bivariate probabilistic budyko approach was developed using copula based joint distribution model for considering the dependence between parameter ω of wang tang s equation and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and was applied globally the results indicate the predictive performance in global water availability is conditional on the climatic condition in comparison with simple univariate distribution the bivariate one produces the lower interquartile range under the same global dataset especially in the regions with higher ndvi values highlighting the importance of developing the joint distribution by taking into account the dependence structure of parameter ω and ndvi which can provide more accurate probabilistic evaluation of water availability keywords budyko equation probabilistic framework water availability 1 introduction changes in the availability of water under changing environments have substantial impacts on hydroclimatic conditions allen and ingram 2002 ecosystem functions mooney et al 2005 and socioeconomic activities shiklomanov and rondda 2003 reiter et al 2004 from the hydrological cycle perspective water availability relies on the long term partitioning of precipitation p between evapotranspiration e and runoff r ye et al 2015 fang et al 2016 which reflects the hydrological response to atmospheric climate and landscape conditions jaramillo and destouni 2014 traditionally paired catchments method brown et al 2005 and the newtonian hydrological models which is a general term of the mechanistic models with the physical description of hydrologic processes e g evaporation infiltration surface runoff and base flow wang and tang 2014 are believed to be effective approaches to measure the change in water availability caused by climate and landscape altering however the paired catchments are subject to the difficulties in locating suitable controls and the expensive investigation wei and zhang 2010 wang et al 2013a b meanwhile the newtonian hydrological models are always limited due to the time consuming computation greve et al 2015 and large uncertainties in the model structure and parameter estimation wang et al 2016 therefore called darwinian hydrologic models a series of simpler water balance hydrological models aiming to explain the hydrologic behavior as a system have been concerned and applied harman and troch 2014 wang and tang 2014 among the darwinian hydrologic models a simple first order theoretical equation to describe the water and energy balance proposed by budyko 1974 has been found wide applications and experienced a revival in understanding of hydrologic behavior under changing environment milly 1994 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2006 donohue et al 2010 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and hejazi 2011 shao et al 2012 williams et al 2012

evaporation ratio e p and the aridity index potential evapotranspiration ep p without any parameter was proposed by budyko 1974 to describe long term water balance at large basins to characterize the shape of the budyko curve for a specific basin with different local conditions some analytical functional forms with a single parameter have been successively derived e g fu 1981 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 milly and dunne 2002 yang et al 2008 gerrits et al 2009 wang and tang 2014 the single parameter is considered to represent the integrated effect of the catchment characteristics which is reflected by topography shao et al 2012 xu et al 2013 vegetation functioning zhang et al 2001 donohue et al 2007 2010 brümmer et al 2002 li et al 2013 soil type and geologic substrate yang et al 2006 donohue et al 2012 as well as climate seasonality potter and zhang 2009 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and tang 2014 due to the complex interactions between the parameter ω and observable regional factors the systematic variations related to various catchment and climate characteristics are not still conclusive although many scholars attempted to give quantitative description for one or combined local factors e g roderick and farquhar 2011 donohue et al 2012 xu et al 2013 li et al 2013 recently without considering the concrete controls for a special basin greve et al 2015 established a probabilistic budyko framework to theoretically evaluate the predictability of water availability stemming from various catchment characteristics by deriving budyko distributions using observational data in basins widespread in u s subsequently based on the probabilistic budyko singh and kumar 2015 presented a bottom up framework to estimate the vulnerability of available water in india under the changing climate moreover in another work of gudmundsson et al 2016 based upon a derived sensitivity function from the probabilistic budyko framework the ep p was identified as the dominated factor of water availability in very humid climates presenting a greater influence on water availability than an equal relative change in other factors e g changes in seasonally irrigation and land use change the strength of the probabilistic framework is that with extending the deterministic formulation of the budyko curve to a probabilistic one it allows to quantitatively assess the uncertainties of water availability estimation from varying catchment characteristics under the same climatic aridity condition in the probabilistic budyko framework the single parameter ω of the one parameter budyko type equations was considered as a random variable in fact there are widespread evidences for the linkages of ω to various catchment characteristics and climate variability donohue et al 2010 roderick and farquhar 2011 shao et al 2012 to date although there are no definite physical or empirical relational expressions available for its estimations among the contributing factors to ω vegetation can specially serve as an excellent integrated indicator of these physical properties impacts on water and energy balances due that the influences of soil textures and topography yokoo et al 2008 williams et al 2012 climate seasonality gutman and ignatov 1998 as well as even some human activities such as harvesting and clearing roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and hejazi 2011 can be directly or indirectly reflected by vegetation signatures therefore it can be hypothesized that ω is not strictly a random variable gudmundsson et al 2016 apparently for the regions with the same mean climatic conditions represented by ep p the probability density of ω should not be uniform and will be impacted by the information of other controlling factors such as vegetation characteristics fig 1 consequently despite of the ambiguous conclusions about the physical driving mechanisms when constructing the probabilistic budyko framework integrating the spatiotemporal knowledge of known contributing factors into ω distribution may be better underline the deterministic origin of budyko theory thus in this study to address the predictability of water availability upon a recent probabilistic extension of the budyko framework by greve et al 2015 we further proposed a bivariate probabilistic framework based on the joint distribution between the ω and vegetation information despite of the unknown detailed dependency established using the copula model in this study a one parameter equation recently derived by wang and tang 2014 has been selected to construct the bivariate probabilistic framework in wang tang s equation the parameter ω was represented by the ratio between λ the initial evaporation ratio and h the horton index moreover the vegetation characteristics are proved to be one of the dominant controlling factors on the parameter ω a global application of the bivariate probabilistic framework was conducted to assess the water availability meanwhile a comparison between the uncertainties estimated from bivariate probabilistic framework and original one as well as the related discussion were carried out to highlight the advantages of new framework 2 methods 2 1 the wang tang s budyko equation recently a budyko equation has been derived by wang and tang 2014 for mean annual water balance in wang tang s equation as an analog to the concept of initial abstraction in the scs model e is separated into an initial evapotranspiration and continuing evapotranspiration wang and tang 2014 indicated that the initial evapotranspiration is broadly defined to include evapotranspiration from the forest floor leaf interception and temporary storage in pools the differences between p and initial evapotranspiration are defined as the effective precipitation effective precipitation is then partitioned into runoff and continuing evapotranspiration in this case wang and tang 2014 then implemented the generalization of the proportionality hypothesis of the scs model the ratio of continuing evapotranspiration to its potential values is equal to the ratio of runoff to its potential value in this context a one parameter budyko type equation was derived by wang and tang 2014 the equation is expressed as follows 1 e p 1 e p p 1 e p p 2 4 ω 2 ω e p p 2 ω 2 ω from the evapotranspiration perspective the parameter ω of eq 1 is the ratio between initial evapotranspiration and e also the parameter ω can be interpreted as the ratio between λ the initial evaporation ratio and h the horton index from the soil wetting perspective the initial evaporation ratio is the ratio of initial evapotranspiration to total soil wetting both soil wetting and initial evapotranspiration are affected by vegetation thus vegetation is the dominant factor on the parameter ω given that the parameter ω in wang tang s equation is mainly controlled by vegetation characteristics it is more appropriate for constructing the bivariate probabilistic model with the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the parameter ω therefore wang tang s equation as a typical budyko type equation has been used in this study the parameter ω was calibrated with historically available data sets and used to establish the probabilistic representation of the budyko framework 2 2 one parameter archimedean bivariate copulas copulas can be defined as multivariate cumulative distribution functions cdfs with standard uniform marginal representing the dependence structure of random variables a bivariate cdf f x y x y can be written as a function of its marginal cdfs f x x and f y y according to the sklar theorem sklar 1959 2 f x y x y c f x x f y y the function c c u v is called a copula and is unique if the marginal distributions are continuous there are two main advantages in determining f x y x y 1 the marginals can be determined using different distributions and 2 the dependence structure can be described separately from the marginals allowing building complex multivariate distributions for modeling stochastic phenomena fu and butler 2014 many families of copulas have been proposed for representing different dependence

distribution of ω across the unite state for global assessments we used the dataset covering all the world to establish the bivariate distribution the median estimated values of water availability ratio defined as water availability divided by p varied spatially ranged from 0 1 to 0 80 fig 3 a taking the low water availability ratio as an example it mainly distribute in middle east north middle asia parts of australia and southeast africa the spatial pattern of water availability is mostly similar with that of the ep p fig 3b and is consistent with the common observed annual runoff rate milly et al 2005 while the uncertainties of the water availability ratio represented by the inter quartile range iqr present different spatial patterns fig 3c the high uncertainties mainly distribute in north of russia middle and east of africa the midwest with relative dry climate and west africa western europe east of russia with relative humid climate while the low uncertainties are mostly located in south of australia north of south america middle of asia east of north america and south of africa under very wet or dry conditions it s generally indicating the uncertainty itself is conditional on climate conditions ep p and the predictive performance in water availability initially decreases with increasing aridity and reaches its low value under transitional climates then slowly increases with increasing dryness this point is supported by the result of a meta analysis of 34 studies involving 3874 catchments parajka et al 2013 and earlier study conducted by greve et al 2015 however we also note the low or high uncertainty of water availability estimations should rely on the built distribution of ω for example compared with the study of greve et al 2015 a different pattern of distribution of ω across india showing boarder scatter scatter plot in budyko space with increasing aridity condition can be found in singh and kumar 2015 another national scale analysis although with the similar trend of iqr the difference in pattern of distribution of ω will affect the correlation between uncertainty and climate condition ep p for an example the relative high value of iqr will at different ep p ranges based on different built distributions of ω to further evaluate the analysis of uncertainties of water availability based on the bivariate probabilistic budyko framework proposed in this study we compared the iqr estimated by the ω univariate distribution signed as iqr1 and the copulas joint distribution of ω and ndvi signed as iqr2 fig 4 a although a strong correlation of iqr1 and iqr2 can be found all the iqr2 values were lower than the related iqr1 and the differences become larger along with the increasing iqr this means that the copulas bivariate can offer more accurate results with considering the dependence structure of ω and its dominated variable when assessing the probabilistic behaviors of water availability spatially it shows that the large differences in iqr estimated between simple univariate approach and copulas bivariate one mainly distributed in the regions with relative higher ndvi values figs 4b and 5 this may be explained by the different contribution of ndvi to water yield in different climate regions in terms of the previous studies the vegetation characteristics exert a significant influence on regional water balance and the long term regional annual water balance is sensitive to vegetation characteristics in other words a higher correlation between ndvi and the parameter ω is associated with an increasing ndvi indicating larger differences between margin distribution and conditional distribution of the parameter ω at the higher ndvi 5 summary and conclusion in this paper a bivariate probabilistic budyko approach was developed and employed to the global analysis for the water availability and the related uncertainty the ndvi reflecting the vegetation characteristics information the main controlling variable for water and energy balance proved previously e g donohue et al 2007 li et al 2013 was chosen to establish the copula based joint distribution model together with the catchment characteristic parameter ω of wang tang s equation the frank copula from the archimedean copula family was selected as the best fitted copula for building the bivariate distribution of global ω and ndvi dataset the uncertainty of water availability estimation can be quantified using conditional probabilities derived from the joint distribution model results indicated that the uncertainty relies on climatic condition with the high and low values distributing in transitional climates and very wet or dry conditions regions respectively moreover the results of comparative analysis between simple univariate distribution and bivariate one for uncertainty of water availability showed that the latter produce the lower interquartile range under the same global dataset especially in the regions with higher ndvi values indicating that the global analysis based on the joint distribution can provide more accurate probabilistic evaluation of water availability based on the characterization of the dependence structure of parameter ω and ndvi in fact in addition to vegetation characteristics information other catchment characteristics such as soil types topographic features and climatic seasonality can be also important for the hydrological processes and thus influence the water yield future efforts are thus needed to make multivariate copula model involving other critical controlling variables information to gain more precise assessment and prediction of water availability moreover only natural elements affecting the water availability were involved in the established bivariate probabilistic framework in this study however vegetation changes and human activities such as agricultural irrigation drinking water extraction and hydraulic projects also have altered the distribution of water resources and further influence the predictability of water availability therefore a holistic probabilistic framework should be comprehensively conducted in future with taking into consideration the natural and anthropogenic effects on water availability acknowledgments this work was jointly supported by the national science foundation of china 51779073 51379057 the
