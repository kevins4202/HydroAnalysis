11655,groundwater abstraction in many parts of india is highly unregulated which has caused a gradual decrease in groundwater levels over the years normally surface water storage structures or recharge zones are developed without knowing if all the groundwater is getting recharged the issue becomes serious in the plateau region where most of the rainfall goes as surface runoff here an effort was made to identify the groundwater potential recharge zones of the entire jharkhand state using remote sensing gis and analytic hierarchy approach techniques thematic layers which could contribute to the successful recharge of groundwater were prepared the whole region was classified into four prospective groundwater potential zones extremely low low moderate and high the results showed that approximately 3 28 and 77 34 of the total area falls under the high and average groundwater potential zones and the rest are under low and very low most of the high potential area is located in eight districts due to the alluvial plain region or a few mountains in that region namely godda sahibganj pakur dumka purbi singhbhum saraikela kharsawan and part of the ranchi the discharge data of 28 existing bore wells were used to endorse the groundwater potential zones the further validation was made with an area under curve auc of 83 according to the validation the applied method produces a fairly dependable outcome for the state of jharkhand graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater recharge ahp gis thematic layers jharkhand data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction among all natural resources groundwater is the most protected and vital source of water stored in the earth s crust below ground fitts 2013 it provides water for domestic industrial and agricultural purposes as well as for other development projects around the world nampak et al 2014 about 2 5 billion people across the globe relies on groundwater for their domestic water uses unesco 2015 global withdrawal of groundwater for agricultural industrial and domestic sectors is evaluated at rate of 27 42 and 36 respectively dar et al 2021 taylor et al 2013 groundwater abstraction in india is estimated at 230 km3 per year world bank 2012 increased demand for domestic water agriculture and other purposes has added to the burden on these natural resources creating an issue that is of major concern to most populous nations and industries das et al 2017 groundwater quality and quality are strongly influenced by the growth of cities forests and industry in india around half of the total agricultural area is irrigated with groundwater supply central groundwater board annual report 2014 due to water shortages a few parts of india are experiencing high water pressure and declining quality niti aayog state statistics handbook 2017 most populous countries have a similar attitude groundwater consumption will increase due to various development activities so it is very important to identify potential groundwater areas where adequate annual rainfall is received various probabilistic methods such as frequency ratio have been used by many scholars around the world to identify groundwater potential recharge zones das et al 2019 guru et al 2017 logistic retrospective modeling process ozdemir 2011 model of the random forest golkarian and rahmati 2018 the neural network of synthetic naghibi et al 2018 the model tree chenini et al 2010 and the evidence function nampak et al 2014 the spatial techniques in such type of study has gained attention in recent decades as it is a relatively efficient and time saving strategy saaty 1980 introduced the analytical hierarchy process ahp as a useful way to address complex decisions in groundwater related fields few researchers have successfully identified groundwater recycling sites using the integrated ahp method in conjunction with rs and gis anshumala et al 2021 arulbalaji et al 2019 in the purulia region west bengal india potential groundwater was identified using ahp and rs gis strategies and the results were confirmed using groundwater harvesting das et al 2019 in addition by integrating multi criteria decision analysis mcda and rs and gis methods ahp has been successfully used in various groundwater management studies and groundwater saaty 1980 1986 1987 1990 jharkhand receives 1100 1442 mm rainfall of which 23 800 million cubic meter mcm comes as surface water and 500 mcm as groundwater mahato et al 2021 but due to the geographical set up about 80 of the surface water and 74 of the groundwater flow out of the region causing 38 of the drought in jharkhand all the cities of jharkhand have shown a decrease in groundwater levels which has led to the need for artificial recharge to increase groundwater availability in rural and urban areas much of jharkhand is a plateau from which most of the water flows kumari and singh 2021 and they explored the appropriate site selection of surface water storage facilities in the deoria watershed area of jharkhand using the analytical hierarchy process therefore the delineation of the potential groundwater zone of the entire jharkhand region is reasonable and important leblanc et al 2003 applied remote sensing gis and mcdm techniques to identify the potential groundwater zone and verified the findings using measured well discharge data as a result the remote sensing system provides systemic synoptic and fast paced region coverage making it a useful tool for obtaining short term spatio temporal data over a large area increased mining of these water resources has prompted scholars to devise cost effective measures to identify potential groundwater recharge zones which could assist in the integrated planning and management of water resources senanayake et al 2016 identifying and planning the use and conservation of potential groundwater resources is important hutti 2011 the location of wells for domestic purposes and irrigation can also be determined using the groundwater map ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 because groundwater is an underground substance it can only be detected indirectly by examining certain features that are directly visible dinesan et al 2015 various studies were conducted to determine the potential impacts on groundwater as a result geomorphology water density linear density slope geology land use and land cover soil rainfall and altitude are the most important factors to consider when delineating the prospective groundwater potential zones the origin geological composition and hydrological properties of groundwater are all explained by these criteria various methods were used to determine the ideal weight and rank for these features which were then summarized to produce a possible site the knowledge based standard was used to establish the weights and ranks assigned to the parameters sitender 2019 one of the approaches is multi criteria decision analysis mcda and the analytic hierarchy approach is one of the key mcda methods over the past two decades that multidisciplinary decision making has been found as an excellent way to manage water because it adds structure readability transparency and firmness to decision making flug et al 2005 roberts and goodwin 2002 proper mcda is important for water resource management it should focus on the premise of the decision making process which includes conditional decision making and possible decisions the mcda strategy has been successfully used to identify potential groundwater environmental management agricultural suitability and other applications a key advantage of these methods is integration with gis based methods which produce more accurate results and require less calculation time than traditional gwpz field methods zolekar and bhagat 2015 as a result ahp gis and rs techniques were integrated to explore hydrological geo morphological and climate data to identify groundwater potential zones in the entire jharkhand state in this study the results obtained were validated by using receiver operating characteristic roc curves janizadeh et al 2019 groundwater potential zones were identified to build a projected guide map to enable state agency to plan management of groundwater resources of the state 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area with an area of 79 749 km2 jharkhand state is bounded between 21 57 and 25 14 n latitude and 83 020 to 87 58 e longitude its capital is ranchi as illustrated in fig 1 the state is divided into 24 districts its eastern boundary is with west bengal its western border with chhattisgarh its northern border with bihar and its southern border with orissa tanks lakes and dams in jharkhand and the state has a plentiful supply of fresh water because of the state s varied topography it is endowed with a plethora of mountains and rivers there are several portions of the jharkhand region that are located on the chota nagpur plateau which is composed of the number of mountain ranges and plateaus divided by rivers in the state there are several major waterways the damodar the mayurakshi the bakra the barakar the koyal the son the auranga the more the karo the bansloi the south koel the ganga the gumani and the batane from july to september the province receives the most precipitation accounting for more than 90 of the total rainfall received as a result of significant fluctuation in rainfall poor soil moisture content a lack of established aquifers areas due to hard rock substrate and rapid flow rates due to anomalous terrain agriculture is particularly vulnerable the purpose of this study was to examine the state s groundwater potential zone using statistical and gis methods for sustainable groundwater management the key elements of surface geology lulc and rainfall have been studied in gis for groundwater potential zone an ahp method is used to weigh each of these variables this is a well known approach to making decisions based on a variety of criteria saaty 1980 the raster calculator in arcgis was used to do an overlay analysis after the weights of each class had been determined the geometric mean method was used for normalizing weights in ahp the parameters were rated based on a defined scale 1 9 scale for calculating the geometric mean the geometric mean is derived from the total sum of the scale of a specific parameter known as total scale weight divided by a total number of parameters the final result displays the potential working area and the entire data used and procedure to perform the study is shown in fig 2 2 2 description of the data used i aster global dem v3 digital elevation model dem of earth s land areas with a

create the digital surface model dsm provides a relative dem without the use of any ground control points gcps rawat et al 2019 ii rainfall gridded data 2020 rainfall graphs from the climate research unit has been gridded cru monthly time series of precipitation daily maximum and minimum temperatures cloud cover and other variables are included in the cru ts collection of data sets cru ts climatic research unit timeseries cru ts4 0 is a recent release according to an investigation of more than 4000 weather station records the data set is gridded to 0 5 0 5 the data set as a whole is not homogeneous despite the fact that many of the input records have been homogenized data sets like crutem4 show long term air temperature changes over wide areas as a result of this research gridded drought indices like the spi and the sc pdsi have been developed using precipitation data climate variability and extremes can be studied more thoroughly when there are a large number of variables studies of trends must take into account whether the trends are physically consistent with other variables from independent data sets when possible harris et al 2014 trenberth et al 2014 iii soil

batjes 2000 faounesco 1979 iv world lulc esri maps of land usage and land cover across the globe may be found in this layer lulc esa sentinel 2 imagery with a resolution of 10 m was used to create this map maps of global lulc can be used for conservation planning food security and hydrologic modeling among other purposes land use and land cover lulc can be seen in any part of the world using this set of data more than 5 billion hand labelled sentinel 2 pixels taken from more than 20 000 locations across the world s major biomes were used to train this model sentinel 2 surface reflectance data from visible blue green red near infrared and two shortwave infrared bands are used in the deep learning model finally a map of the year 2020 will be produced by running the algorithm on a variety of dates of imagery collected over the year karra et al 2021 iv geomorphology and lineament lineaments and geomorphological mapping were framed by obtaining data from the bhukosh gsi geological survey of india website https bhukosh gsi gov in bhukosh public geomorphological and lineament mapping has been one of the major efforts undertaken using remote sensing data for mapping the diversity of landform in the country and was jointly executed by isro and gsi ministry of mines along with more than 15 partner institutions across the country this has resulted in the creation of a national level geospatial database for use and decision making these maps are generated on 1 50 000 scale denudational hill linear ridge pediments pedi plain water body residual hill structural hill and valley fill were identified from irs p6 liss iv image through visual interpretation rajaveni et al 2017 v geology geology was prepared from the map available at a 1 50 000 scale wandrey and law 1998 steinshouer et al 1997 provided by u s department of the interior geological survey usgs the data used and its source of acquisition are given in table 1 2 3 generation of thematic layers maps geospatial techniques have been used to prepare thematic layers such as lulc geology geomorphology soil types altitude water density slope precipitation topographic roughness index tri curvature lines topographic wetness index twi and topographic position index tpi these layers are important because they reflect the occurrence of groundwater and movement groundwater occurrence and spatial distribution are influenced by the geology and hydrogeological environment of the region groundwater recharge can also be augmented by water bodies in rural and urban communities as well as in wasteland areas infiltration is very low wakode et al 2018 geomorphological features of the region help to understand the spatial distribution of geological diversity and spatial information such as groundwater movement mukherjee and singh 2020 groundwater fluctuations in the area are determined by rainfall however percolation is determined by the intensity and duration of the rain the slope is an important element of groundwater recharge because it controls the flow of water and the ingress of vertical water especially rainfall the slope gradient is connected differently to rainwater intrusion and surface water ahmed ii and mansor 2018 another important condition for predicting groundwater potential is the diversity in terrain roughness is used to measure regional topographical undulations riley et al 1999 an upward convex surface can be represented as positive curvature an upwardly concave surface as negative curvature and a smooth surface as zero curvature in a topographic curvature pattern vijith and dodge wan 2019 lineaments indicate regional faults joints and fractures and are naturally controlled by curvilinear and linear topography twi is the secondary topographical element used to assess the impact of topographic control on hydrological processes it is defined as the tendency to collect water in a catchment area and the tendency to move water down due to gravity nejad et al 2016 as a result the high twi values indicate the possibility of groundwater infiltration and recharge due to topographic effects tpi on the other hand is the most frequently used method of determining geographical categories and as an indicator of local slopes mokarram et al 2015 a region can be divided into one of three categories based on this index value hilltops ridgetops or mid slope valley bottoms or depressions tpi certain limit tpi certain limit and flat plains tpi 0 nair et al 2017 this indicator has a high value when there is more flow and less intrusion which leads to poor recharge of groundwater fig 2 elaborates the methods used to identify the potential location of the groundwater recharge zone 2 4 deriving the weights using ahp ranking of all thematic layer groundwater potential zones can be defined using the analytical hierarchical process a multi criteria decision making process saaty 1990a each thematic layer was given a ranking based on its contribution towards groundwater potentiality using saaty s scale of 1 9 saaty 1980 the ahp approach was used to calculate the weightage of each thematic map layers the priority of the thematic layers is given after thorough literature and experts opinion as shown in table 2 to allocate weightage previous research on other geographic locations and field experience were considered 2 4 1 consistency analysis a pairwise comparison matrix was developed for the thematic layers as shown in table 3 the creation of geomorphology soil types geology and lulc thematic strata was classified the consistency ratio was used to validate the decision on the pair wise comparison of thematic layers and subclasses within thematic layers c r using equation 1 saaty 1990b 1 c o n s i s t e n c y r a t i o c r c o n s i s t e n c y i n d e x c i r a n d o m c o n s i s t e n c y i n d e x r c i firstly a matrix of pairwise comparison was prepared for the thematic layers of climate and non climate data to find the weightage of each factor that contributes to the potentiality of groundwater table 4 the factors which play a major role in potentiality were given the highest weight and the least weight was given to the factors which are least responsible for groundwater flow in the comparison matrix after that the geometric mean was calculated for all the factors and then the normalized weight matrix was calculated by dividing the weight assigned to each factor by its equivalent geometric mean as tabulated in table 5 in the later process of ahp the weighted sum matrix was prepared by multiplying all the weights in the comparison matrix with their corresponding normalized weights as given in table 6 finally eigenvalues λ were calculated to check the consistency of the weights that were assigned to each factor the consistency analysis was carried out to measure the acceptance of these weights that were allotted arrangement of the pairwise comparison matrix p was done by using the following matrix from equation 2 2 p p 11 p 12 p 1 n p 21 p 22 p 2 n p n 1 p n 2 p n n where p n n is the judgment matrix element the normalized weight was obtained by using the following formula equation 3 3 w n g m n n 1 n g m n where w n is the weight vector column and g m n is the geometric mean of the ith row of the judgement to determine the consistency ratio c r the first principal eigenvalue λ was calculated by eigenvector technique as given in equation 4 and consistency index c i was calculated from the given expressions in equation 5 4 λ i 1 n p i w n n w 5 c i λ max n n 1 where λ is an eigenvalue that represents the ratio of weighted sum and normalized weight and n is the number of factors used in the analysis the random consistency index value is obtained from saaty s standard as illustrated in table 5 as per saaty 1980 a c r o f 0 1 shows that the decision to remain with the ahp analysis is acceptable if a c r o f 0 1 the judgement must be revised to determine the cause of the inconsistency and corrected until the value of c r 0 1 is achieved the gwpz was constructed by utilizing the weighted overlay approach to overlap all of the thematic layers after each thematic layer were given weight and each sub class of thematic layers was given a rank using equation 6 6 g w p z i n w i r i where gwpz is the groundwater potential the weight of each thematic layer is wi and ri is rank of each thematic layer s sub classes based on the groundwater potential zones the areas were classified as very low low moderate high and very high arulbalaji et al 2019 the equation proposed was utilized to determine groundwater potential index values using the weighted overlay analysis tools jacek 1999 equation 7 7 g w p z g m w g m r g e w g e r s o w s o r l u w l u r

s l symbolizes slope l u labels lulc r f states average annual rainfall t w topographic wetness index twi e l digital elevation model dem t r topographic roughness index tri p l topographic position index tpi c curvature 2 5 sensitivity analysis in order to better understand the influential thematic layers of the produced gwpz single parameter sensitivity analysis techniques were applied to analyse each of the classes and thematic layers in the gis platform these analyses were carried out using the raster calculator and raster properties tools by comparing the weighting factor for each of the thematic layers with the empirical weighting factor assigned to the same layer on the potential map this method was utilized to assess the impact on the groundwater potential map of each thematic layer fenta et al 2015 an equation 8 was used to calculate the weighting factor w for each thematic layer 8 w p r p w g w p z 100 where p r and p w are the rates and weights values of each thematic layer and gwpz is the groundwater potential zone computed using all the thematic layers 2 6 multicollinearity analysis at least one input parameter independent predictor variable in the model is considerably associated with a combination of the other input parameters independent predictor variables in the multiple regression model which is called multicollinearity it demonstrates that a model s output can be quite accurate when one input parameter can be predicted linearly from another for example slope and slope aspects consequently it is necessary to test for multicollinearity before running the regression model to access this validation a linear regression analysis is performed where input parameters say x i are considered as the dependent variables and the r 2 value is calculated say r i 2 this value is further used to calculate the tolerance and variance inflation factor vif of the input variables using equation 9 and 10 mukherjee and singh 2020 9 t o l e r a n c e

the processes are repeated for each one multicollinearity issues are indicated by tolerance of 0 010 or a vif of 0 010 saha 2017 all layers with a tolerance level or vif value lower than 10 must be omitted from this evaluation 2 7 validation of groundwater potential zone with the help of well discharge data from 28 excavated wells a groundwater potential zone map was validated that were created in this study isro which provides a single window solution for all water resources data and information acquired the excavated well data through the generation of database and implementation of web enabled india wris the final groundwater prospect map was checked for correctness by overlaying the well s discharge points on top of the map murmu et al 2019 3 results and discussion land use land cover hydrological conditions in a location and the interaction between these elements all have a role in determining where and how much groundwater potential or recharge zone is present as do a variety of other variables acharya et al 2019 murmu et al 2019 groundwater potential zones in the study region were identified using thirteen contributing parameters including d d designates drainage density g e refers geology l d indicates lineament density g m denotes geomorphology s o represents soil type s l symbolizes slope l u labels lulc r f states average annual rainfall t w topographic wetness index twi e l digital elevation model dem t r topographic roughness index tri p l topographic position index tpi c curvature 3 1 digital elevation model dem the elevation is a crucial element in identifying prospective groundwater locations plain surface areas often see less irruption than moderate to highly elevated sites ashwini et al 2020 pande et al 2021 the digital elevation model dem was extracted from the shuttle radar topography obtained from the us geological survey usgs website and cleaned by filling the sink to remove local depressions the study area was divided into five classes a 6 9 m b 200 330 m c 340 510 m d 520 740 and e 750 1400 m fig 3 the lower relief areas are characterized by soft lithology that allows for groundwater replenishment and high relief sites have a relatively complex lithology that creates high flow 3 2 slope and drainage density the slope map was developed using aster dem in gis by processing hydrology tools in arcmap slope was classified in 5 types and it ranges from very low to very high slope variation in jharkhand as shown in fig 4 a varies from 0 to 67 62 plain land lies in the lesser slope region whereas the greater slope represents the hilly region drainage density is defined as the ratio of the overall stream length to the area under drainage the drainage density map is shown in fig 4 b a high drainage density ranges of 0 69 1 059 is found in 26 of the area because it affects the lithology beneath it drainage density is a key indicator of hydrogeological features an inverse relationship between permeability and the distance between stream channels is known as the closeness of the channel spacing agarwal and garg 2016 jaiswal et al 2003 it measures the channel length per unit area the drainage pattern is a reflection of both the surface and the underlying formations prasad et al 2008 higher runoff results from increased drainage density while increased recharge or a potential groundwater zone results from decreased drainage density the drainage density is inversely proportional to permeability pande et al 2020 there is less rainwater infiltration due to the lack of penetrable hard rock which tends to be concentrated in surface runoff and aquifers 3 3 rainfall and lineament density map rainfall data were obtained from the climatic research unit cru which is available from 1901 to present in high resolution gridded form and considering the average annual rainfall data a thematic map was prepared in arcgis using the idw tool as presented in fig 5 a the classification of rainfall was based on the amount of rainfall that occurred during the previous years and was presented at a depth in mm it has been noted that the western and central parts have more rainfall compared to other regions and directly affect the groundwater potential by recharging the jharkhand region rainfall makes a significant role in replenishing groundwater reserves it calculates the volume of water that would be accessible for evaporation into the underground storage system any place that receives more rainfall has a greater chance of being recharged machiwal and singh 2015 the presence of precipitation was regarded as a key source of recharging magesh et al 2012 the lineaments provide space for water to flow through it and thus affect the flow and ingress of water leading to the recharge of groundwater mukherjee et al 2012 reddy et al 2000 the linear density map was created using the hill shade tool in arcgis by drawing lineaments on the aster dem of jharkhand as shown in fig 5 b five classes were arranged namely medium low very low high and very high lineaments are visible in the hills and valleys rather than in the plains 3 4 soil and lulc map surface run off and groundwater recharge are significantly influenced by soil texture groundwater recharge is influenced by soil types infiltration rates percolation rates and permeability jasrotia et al 2019 pandey et al 2022 the study area is heavily covered with four types of soil groups as shown on the soil map fig 6 a the leading soil types of the study area are i lithosols bc chromic cambisols ne eutricnitosols nd dystric nitosols chromic vertisols io orthic luvisols be eutriccambisols and jc calcaricfluvisols due to the presence of eutricgleysols the western and eastern parts capture more water and contribute significantly to groundwater potential lulc has a significant role in groundwater recharging ashwini et al 2020 shaban et al 2006 it comprises the types of soil deposits where homes are located and the amount of vegetation yeh et al 2016 it is influenced by anthropological intervention as well as universal phenomena like agronomic skill and demand residential development consumer trends urban growth and economic development as well as other variables pande et al 2021 pathan et al 2021 the change in land use land cover also affects the quality of groundwater singh et al 2010 the esri lulc 2021 product was used and the whole state was divided into five types namely agricultural land forest vegetable area urban built up areas water bodies and other vacant lands fig 6 b 3 5 geomorphology and geology of jharkhand the geomorphology of a region exhibits different landforms and structural elements which is crucial for determining the potential and prospects for groundwater since it regulates the circulation of groundwater underground gumma and pavelic 2013 kumar et al 2022 the geomorphological map was developed on information obtained from the geological survey of india gsi arulbalaji et al 2019 for better analysis the geomorphological features are divided into 67 types as shown in fig 7 a the area around the river has alluvial plains and floodplains leading to the additional filling as underground springs have sand and silt that help hold water in the northern and eastern parts of the study area the hilly regions are covered with moderately dispersed hills and valleys as well as hills and valleys with a highly dispersed structure therefore groundwater availability is high in the central and western parts of the region due to the availability of suitable sites in the vicinity a map with a geology theme was prepared using a map obtained by the u s department of the interior geological survey usgs steinshouer et al 1997 as shown in fig 7 b nair et al 2017 observed that the hydrogeological zone s porosity and permeability are greatly influenced by groundwater occurrence and flow allowing for easy water storage and transmission jharkhand contains five types of rocks namely trcs lower triassic to carboniferous sedimentary rocks tk high and cretaceous sedimentary rocks q quaternary sediments pc precambrian rocks separately and jms jurassic metamorphic rocks and sediment the glacial sediments and rocks of the surma group occupy a large part of the jharkhand group and barail the formation of dupitila the presence of tipamsandstoe formations is small compared to the other two species in general glacial sediments or fluvial sediments have good accessibility as they contain sand and mud from nearby rivers that hold more water and contribute to potentiality 3 6 topographic wetness index twi and topographic position index tpi the topographic wetness index twi is often used to calculate the impacts of topography on hydrological processes and reflects the possibility of groundwater penetration mokarram et al 2015 it illustrates the link between the diversion of the water stored in the site portion and the gravity that pushes the water following the slope it is one of the crucial aspects taken into account while studying the groundwater potential zone because it indicates the wetness of the terrain and fluctuates with topographic gradient slope which would be repeated in multi criteria decision making this thematic layer was not regarded as an effective element for the groundwater potential under the ahp model of inquiry pandey et al 2022 describing the wetness pattern twi is the most widely used feature to detect potential groundwater zone saha 2017 the twi was prepared by using topmodel a model that stimulates the hydrologic fluxes of water throughout the watershed beven 1997 equation 11 given below was used for the estimation of twi 11 t w i ln α tan β α upslope contributing area β topographic gradient slope jharkhand s twi value is between 2 52 and 27 21 as shown in fig 8 a very low 2 52 6 31 low 6 31 8 06 medium 8 06 10 39 high 10 39 13 70 and very high 10 39 13 70 were five categories 13 70 27 21 as mentioned earlier higher weights were given higher twi and vice versa dem data was used to calculate twi as the number of twi increases so does the potential for groundwater availability the topographic position index tpi is an algorithm that is often used to calculate topographic slope areas default geographical sections and automated landforms classification de reu et al 2013 many visible processes in the landscape are associated with a geographical indicator including the flat plain the hilltop the lowland area and the open hills the activities of the upper and lower slopes jenness 2006 equation 12 given below was used for the estimation of twi 12 t p i m o n 1 m n n where m o elevation of the model point under evaluation m n elevation of grid n the total number of surrounding points employed in the evaluation jenness 2006 tpi ranged from 70 to 82 across the province tpi 0 refers to the low flat area at lower tpi values higher weights are given and vice versa nair et al 2017 fig 8 b shows the topographic position index tpi map 3 7 curvature and roughness index the curvature of peak slopes which represents the topography of the region is the most important factor to be studied for identifying possible groundwater locations water hydrology and assessing the stability of the terrain pande et al 2021 the slope s curvatures provide a more accurate description of the hydrology soil formation and accumulation dynamics under the surface negative bending indicates that the surface is facing upwards and the positive curvature represents that the surface is upwards convex at that cell whereas zero indicates the level of the surface oh et al 2011 the curvature of a contour line created by intersecting a horizontal plane with the surface is known as plan curvature and can be used to show the intersection and flow of the flow lee et al 2012 in the study areas plan curvature can be used to describe divergence and flow interactions as well as to distinguish between reservoirs and wells transmitted through a 0thorder hydraulic network the map was created using arcgis 10 3 and a natural break method was used to combine values into five groups 20 19 1 01 1 01 to 0 35 0 35 0 29 0 29 1 12 and 1 12 21 61 fig 9 a the roughness index of the digital elevation model indicates the amount of height change between adjacent cells dem climate and erosion processes are constantly changing the surface of the smooth rock to a slippery slippery slope resulting in a more rugged landscape nair et al 2017 fig 9 b shows the roughness map of jharkhand and the values vary from 0 11 to 0 88 the values were further divided into five categories 0 11 0 37 0 37 0 45 0 45 0 53 0 53 0 61 0 61 0 88 with a low roughness value higher weights were assigned and vice versa see table 8 3 8 delineation of groundwater potential zones by overlaying the relevant groundwater contributing thematic layers potential groundwater areas have been created groundwater prospect zones were assessed using the groundwater index which was calculated by compiling all thematic layers potential zone maps are produced using weights assigned to all categories of fifteen layers after weighted overlay analysis of all the thematic layers in arcgis a potential location map was finally created fig 10 the potential groundwater zone is classified as very low low medium and high in relation to the assigned weight the results showed that approximately 3 28 of the total falls under the high 77 34 under the average 19 12 under the low and the very low areas make up about 0 25 of the study area table 9 the alluvial plateau of the jharkhand river is characterized by high groundwater low slope flat topography high penetration and porosity and high infiltration capacity according to the hydro geomorphological nature of the river basin most of the high potential area is located in eight districts due to the alluvial plain region or a few mountains in that region namely godda sahibganj pakur dumka purbi singhbhum saraikela kharsawan and part of the ranchi while chatra hazaribagh latehar garhwa pashchimi singhbhum in a place with low potential zone and rest are in the moderate zone fig 11 shows the roc plot for the entire jharkhand region and the sub curve auc score is 83 indicating the potential reliable and efficient groundwater resources developed by the ahp method the groundwater level in any region describes the actual state of the groundwater source to confirm further divergence of potential groundwater a potential zone map was verified by 28 bore wells of these 28 bore wells 23 were found to be positive the locations of the bore wells are given in table 10 the well data of taranari giridih takaha bokaro balak hazaribagh lalkhatanga ranchi and suilibari jamtara were the five places where the acceptance of the tested sites was not valid and gwls in all other areas have shown good acceptance 3 9 single parameter sensitivity analysis of the groundwater potential map the single parameter sensitivity analysis depicted in table 7 indicates how the groundwater influencing parameters contribute towards the potentiality the sensitivity analysis results show that lineament density and geomorphology have a high impact compared to other parameters with 36 18 percent and 25 43 percent contributions respectively in addition soil type and lulc are the contributing parameters following the preceding parameters corresponding to 12 58 percent and 9 85 percent while roughness and curvature are the parameters that have the low influence with 1 66 percent and 1 70 percent respectively the empirical weights calculated using ahp of some parameters might differ from the effective weights determined using sensitivity analysis these influencing parameters which are responsible for infiltration and recharge would undoubtedly reduce the groundwater by rejuvenating the aquifer system 4 discussion 4 1 cross validation of groundwater potential zone map to confirm accuracy the groundwater potential map was matched to bore well yield data from wris to that purpose the 28 borewells in jharkhand having discharge data have been analysed representing a wide range of geographical topographical and land use land cover changes based on the yield achieved 28 borewells were categorised into four categories low 4lps low 4 12lps medium 12 20lps and high 20lps the map was separated into four classes very low low medium or high the gwpz map was then overlaid with borewell sites and yield categorization labels as shown in fig 10 according to the verification results almost 80 of the borewells were correctly identified based on the position of the generated gwpz map fig 11 according to the gwpz model certain portions of alluvial farms will drain groundwater but these areas will have medium to high potential long term groundwater extraction for agricultural purposes could be the cause of the variability which has impacted the study area s capability for groundwater recharge in the current climate according to various studies groundwater depletion is putting the availability of groundwater for irrigation purposes in danger mukherjee and singh 2020 altering harvesting patterns and harvest types as well as using drip and sprinkler irrigation in certain areas could assist prevent groundwater depletion birkenholtz 2017 kaarakka et al 2019 the receiver operating characteristic roc curve was used to confirm the groundwater potential recharge zone fig 11 borewell yield data was compared to a map based validation the roc curve shows the sensitivity pair that corresponds to a threshold and sets a genuine positive rate relative to the non true value for dissimilar cut off points of a variable auc on the other hand is a measure of how well a metric can distinguish between two different diagnostic groups auc values of 0 5 and 0 6 imply erroneous predictability whereas auc values of 0 6 and 0 7 0 7 0 8 0 8 0 9 and 0 9 1 indicate a precise decent excellent measure and the most precise exact measurement respectively andualem and demeke 2019 the auc gwpz map was 0 813 implying that the ahp approach predicted the results properly there is no multicollinearity problem uncertainty in the gwpz test model as shown in the single parameter sensitivity analysis all of the thematic layers explored are critical for managing the study area s gwpz and their absence will have a major impact on the accuracy attained furthermore the gwpz map was developed by modifying judgements to reconcile the contradictions discovered by the consistency analysis among the thematic levels and subclasses of each thematic layer when compared to groundwater yield data the gwpz map was generated with 80 accuracy and a good predictive value of 0 813 using auc as a result a recent study employing ahp and gis approaches discovered a high degree of accuracy with a significant number of major thematic layers pairwise comparison matrix was utilized to evaluate the impact of thematic elements and then mcdm and ahp were applied to provide a geographic mapping of groundwater potential using weighted overlay analysis based on weighted overlay analysis four zones were identified in the study region the impact of these layers on determining groundwater potential is then supported by a thorough statistical study of the sensitivity of each thematic factor this geospatial method is by itself a dependable and trusted instrument in research assessing groundwater potential many modern researchers have widely embraced it doke 2019 yeh et al 2016 5 conclusions the current study is an attempt to designate groundwater potential zones in the state of jharkhand utilizing integrated data viz remote sensing and geographic information systems gis in conjunction with the ahp technique satellite imagery and topographic maps were utilized to create several different thematic maps the purpose of this study was to apply the ahp approach to identify possible groundwater recharge sites a total of fifteen layers were built by combining data from various sources the final groundwater potential map of the research region is divided into four zones high moderate low and very low it was determined what the normalized weight of these theme layers was following their impact on affecting groundwater potential all thematic layers and their classes are given ranks and weights based on their importance in impacting groundwater potential the territory is classified into four potential groundwater areas low groundwater potential low groundwater potential medium groundwater potential and high groundwater potential for the validation of the groundwater potential zones map a total of 28 existing borewell data sets were employed following the findings of the cross validation it was determined that ahp was an effective method for delineating the groundwater potential of the research area using an area under curve auc of 83 the data validation was found to be compatible with the evidence obtained following validation the method employed delivers a reasonably reliable outcome for the state of jharkhand in conclusion it can be readily seen that the groundwater potential maps anticipated in this study have a very high degree of accuracy as demonstrated above the findings of the study can be used as a tool for water planners and policymakers to better manage water resources the introduction of management strategies is predicted to boost natural groundwater recharge resulting in a large increase in the volume of water available to the local population 6 limitations because of the method used some limits may be considered in obtaining the results ahp is a knowledge driven process hence it makes predictions with reasonable accuracy but not high accuracy mukherjee and singh 2020 after considering the rainfall data from the gauges monitoring station provided by the indian meteorological department imd an interpolation approach with lower prediction error may be utilized to generate the rainfall distribution which will help improve the accuracy of the groundwater potential zone amini et al 2019 a more accurate groundwater potential map of the state can be constructed in the future by considering all of these elements despite these limitations in the research process and estimation the study s findings are genuine and scientific the findings of this study may be valuable to policymakers in their efforts to enhance the state s groundwater management practices declaration of competing

11655,groundwater abstraction in many parts of india is highly unregulated which has caused a gradual decrease in groundwater levels over the years normally surface water storage structures or recharge zones are developed without knowing if all the groundwater is getting recharged the issue becomes serious in the plateau region where most of the rainfall goes as surface runoff here an effort was made to identify the groundwater potential recharge zones of the entire jharkhand state using remote sensing gis and analytic hierarchy approach techniques thematic layers which could contribute to the successful recharge of groundwater were prepared the whole region was classified into four prospective groundwater potential zones extremely low low moderate and high the results showed that approximately 3 28 and 77 34 of the total area falls under the high and average groundwater potential zones and the rest are under low and very low most of the high potential area is located in eight districts due to the alluvial plain region or a few mountains in that region namely godda sahibganj pakur dumka purbi singhbhum saraikela kharsawan and part of the ranchi the discharge data of 28 existing bore wells were used to endorse the groundwater potential zones the further validation was made with an area under curve auc of 83 according to the validation the applied method produces a fairly dependable outcome for the state of jharkhand graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater recharge ahp gis thematic layers jharkhand data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction among all natural resources groundwater is the most protected and vital source of water stored in the earth s crust below ground fitts 2013 it provides water for domestic industrial and agricultural purposes as well as for other development projects around the world nampak et al 2014 about 2 5 billion people across the globe relies on groundwater for their domestic water uses unesco 2015 global withdrawal of groundwater for agricultural industrial and domestic sectors is evaluated at rate of 27 42 and 36 respectively dar et al 2021 taylor et al 2013 groundwater abstraction in india is estimated at 230 km3 per year world bank 2012 increased demand for domestic water agriculture and other purposes has added to the burden on these natural resources creating an issue that is of major concern to most populous nations and industries das et al 2017 groundwater quality and quality are strongly influenced by the growth of cities forests and industry in india around half of the total agricultural area is irrigated with groundwater supply central groundwater board annual report 2014 due to water shortages a few parts of india are experiencing high water pressure and declining quality niti aayog state statistics handbook 2017 most populous countries have a similar attitude groundwater consumption will increase due to various development activities so it is very important to identify potential groundwater areas where adequate annual rainfall is received various probabilistic methods such as frequency ratio have been used by many scholars around the world to identify groundwater potential recharge zones das et al 2019 guru et al 2017 logistic retrospective modeling process ozdemir 2011 model of the random forest golkarian and rahmati 2018 the neural network of synthetic naghibi et al 2018 the model tree chenini et al 2010 and the evidence function nampak et al 2014 the spatial techniques in such type of study has gained attention in recent decades as it is a relatively efficient and time saving strategy saaty 1980 introduced the analytical hierarchy process ahp as a useful way to address complex decisions in groundwater related fields few researchers have successfully identified groundwater recycling sites using the integrated ahp method in conjunction with rs and gis anshumala et al 2021 arulbalaji et al 2019 in the purulia region west bengal india potential groundwater was identified using ahp and rs gis strategies and the results were confirmed using groundwater harvesting das et al 2019 in addition by integrating multi criteria decision analysis mcda and rs and gis methods ahp has been successfully used in various groundwater management studies and groundwater saaty 1980 1986 1987 1990 jharkhand receives 1100 1442 mm rainfall of which 23 800 million cubic meter mcm comes as surface water and 500 mcm as groundwater mahato et al 2021 but due to the geographical set up about 80 of the surface water and 74 of the groundwater flow out of the region causing 38 of the drought in jharkhand all the cities of jharkhand have shown a decrease in groundwater levels which has led to the need for artificial recharge to increase groundwater availability in rural and urban areas much of jharkhand is a plateau from which most of the water flows kumari and singh 2021 and they explored the appropriate site selection of surface water storage facilities in the deoria watershed area of jharkhand using the analytical hierarchy process therefore the delineation of the potential groundwater zone of the entire jharkhand region is reasonable and important leblanc et al 2003 applied remote sensing gis and mcdm techniques to identify the potential groundwater zone and verified the findings using measured well discharge data as a result the remote sensing system provides systemic synoptic and fast paced region coverage making it a useful tool for obtaining short term spatio temporal data over a large area increased mining of these water resources has prompted scholars to devise cost effective measures to identify potential groundwater recharge zones which could assist in the integrated planning and management of water resources senanayake et al 2016 identifying and planning the use and conservation of potential groundwater resources is important hutti 2011 the location of wells for domestic purposes and irrigation can also be determined using the groundwater map ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 because groundwater is an underground substance it can only be detected indirectly by examining certain features that are directly visible dinesan et al 2015 various studies were conducted to determine the potential impacts on groundwater as a result geomorphology water density linear density slope geology land use and land cover soil rainfall and altitude are the most important factors to consider when delineating the prospective groundwater potential zones the origin geological composition and hydrological properties of groundwater are all explained by these criteria various methods were used to determine the ideal weight and rank for these features which were then summarized to produce a possible site the knowledge based standard was used to establish the weights and ranks assigned to the parameters sitender 2019 one of the approaches is multi criteria decision analysis mcda and the analytic hierarchy approach is one of the key mcda methods over the past two decades that multidisciplinary decision making has been found as an excellent way to manage water because it adds structure readability transparency and firmness to decision making flug et al 2005 roberts and goodwin 2002 proper mcda is important for water resource management it should focus on the premise of the decision making process which includes conditional decision making and possible decisions the mcda strategy has been successfully used to identify potential groundwater environmental management agricultural suitability and other applications a key advantage of these methods is integration with gis based methods which produce more accurate results and require less calculation time than traditional gwpz field methods zolekar and bhagat 2015 as a result ahp gis and rs techniques were integrated to explore hydrological geo morphological and climate data to identify groundwater potential zones in the entire jharkhand state in this study the results obtained were validated by using receiver operating characteristic roc curves janizadeh et al 2019 groundwater potential zones were identified to build a projected guide map to enable state agency to plan management of groundwater resources of the state 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area with an area of 79 749 km2 jharkhand state is bounded between 21 57 and 25 14 n latitude and 83 020 to 87 58 e longitude its capital is ranchi as illustrated in fig 1 the state is divided into 24 districts its eastern boundary is with west bengal its western border with chhattisgarh its northern border with bihar and its southern border with orissa tanks lakes and dams in jharkhand and the state has a plentiful supply of fresh water because of the state s varied topography it is endowed with a plethora of mountains and rivers there are several portions of the jharkhand region that are located on the chota nagpur plateau which is composed of the number of mountain ranges and plateaus divided by rivers in the state there are several major waterways the damodar the mayurakshi the bakra the barakar the koyal the son the auranga the more the karo the bansloi the south koel the ganga the gumani and the batane from july to september the province receives the most precipitation accounting for more than 90 of the total rainfall received as a result of significant fluctuation in rainfall poor soil moisture content a lack of established aquifers areas due to hard rock substrate and rapid flow rates due to anomalous terrain agriculture is particularly vulnerable the purpose of this study was to examine the state s groundwater potential zone using statistical and gis methods for sustainable groundwater management the key elements of surface geology lulc and rainfall have been studied in gis for groundwater potential zone an ahp method is used to weigh each of these variables this is a well known approach to making decisions based on a variety of criteria saaty 1980 the raster calculator in arcgis was used to do an overlay analysis after the weights of each class had been determined the geometric mean method was used for normalizing weights in ahp the parameters were rated based on a defined scale 1 9 scale for calculating the geometric mean the geometric mean is derived from the total sum of the scale of a specific parameter known as total scale weight divided by a total number of parameters the final result displays the potential working

geological survey of india website https bhukosh gsi gov in bhukosh public geomorphological and lineament mapping has been one of the major efforts undertaken using remote sensing data for mapping the diversity of landform in the country and was jointly executed by isro and gsi ministry of mines along with more than 15 partner institutions across the country this has resulted in the creation of a national level geospatial database for use and decision making these maps are generated on 1 50 000 scale denudational hill linear ridge pediments pedi plain water body residual hill structural hill

1998 steinshouer et al 1997 provided by u s department of the interior geological survey usgs the data used and its source of acquisition are given in table 1 2 3 generation of thematic layers maps geospatial techniques have been used to prepare thematic layers such as lulc geology geomorphology soil types altitude water density slope precipitation topographic roughness index tri curvature lines topographic wetness index twi and topographic position index tpi these layers are important because they reflect the occurrence of groundwater and movement groundwater occurrence and spatial distribution are influenced by the geology and hydrogeological environment of the region groundwater recharge can also be augmented by water bodies in rural and urban communities as well as in wasteland areas infiltration is very low wakode et al 2018 geomorphological features of the region help to understand the spatial distribution of geological diversity and spatial information such as groundwater movement mukherjee and singh 2020 groundwater fluctuations in the area are determined by rainfall however percolation is determined by the intensity and duration of the rain the slope is an important element of groundwater recharge because it controls the flow of water and the ingress of vertical water especially rainfall the slope gradient is connected differently to rainwater intrusion and surface water ahmed ii and mansor 2018 another important condition for predicting groundwater potential is the diversity in terrain roughness is used to measure regional topographical undulations riley et al 1999 an upward convex surface can be represented as positive curvature an upwardly concave surface as negative curvature and a smooth surface as zero curvature in a topographic curvature pattern vijith and dodge wan 2019 lineaments indicate regional faults joints and fractures and are naturally controlled by curvilinear and linear topography twi is the secondary topographical element used to assess the impact of topographic control on hydrological processes it is defined as the tendency to collect water in a catchment area and the tendency to move water down due to gravity nejad et al 2016 as a result the high twi values indicate the possibility of groundwater infiltration and recharge due to topographic effects tpi on the other hand is the most frequently used method of determining geographical categories and as an indicator of local slopes mokarram et al 2015 a region can be divided into one of three categories based on this index value hilltops ridgetops or mid slope valley bottoms or depressions tpi certain limit tpi certain limit and flat plains tpi 0 nair et al 2017 this indicator has a high value when there is more flow and less intrusion which leads to poor recharge of groundwater fig 2 elaborates the methods used to identify the potential location of the groundwater recharge zone 2 4 deriving the weights using ahp ranking of all thematic layer groundwater potential zones can be defined using the analytical hierarchical process a multi criteria decision making process saaty 1990a each thematic layer was given a ranking based on its contribution towards groundwater potentiality using saaty s scale of 1 9 saaty 1980 the ahp approach was used to calculate the weightage of each thematic map layers the priority of the thematic layers is given after thorough literature and experts opinion as shown in table 2 to allocate weightage previous research on other geographic locations and field experience were considered 2 4 1 consistency analysis a pairwise comparison matrix was developed for the thematic layers as shown in table 3 the creation of geomorphology soil types geology and lulc thematic strata was classified the consistency ratio was used to validate the decision on the pair wise comparison of thematic layers and subclasses within thematic layers c r using equation 1 saaty 1990b 1 c o n s i s t e n c y r a t i o c r c o n s i s t e n c y i n d e x c i r a n d o m c o n s i s t e n c y i n d e x r c i firstly a matrix of pairwise comparison was prepared for the thematic layers of climate and non climate data to find the weightage of each factor that contributes to the potentiality of groundwater table 4 the factors which play a major role in potentiality were given the highest weight and the least weight was given to the factors which are least responsible for groundwater flow in the comparison matrix after that the geometric mean was calculated for all the factors and then the normalized weight matrix was calculated by dividing the weight assigned to each factor by its equivalent geometric mean as tabulated in table 5 in the later process of ahp the weighted sum matrix was prepared by multiplying all the weights in the comparison matrix with their corresponding normalized weights as given in table 6 finally eigenvalues λ were calculated to check the consistency of the weights that were assigned to each factor the consistency analysis was carried out to measure the acceptance of these weights that were allotted arrangement of the pairwise comparison matrix p was done by using the following matrix from equation 2 2 p p 11 p 12 p 1 n p 21 p 22 p 2 n p n 1 p n 2 p n n where p n n is the judgment matrix element the normalized weight was obtained by using the following formula equation 3 3 w n g m n n 1 n g m n where w n is the weight vector column and g m n is the geometric mean of the ith row of the judgement to determine the consistency ratio c r the first principal eigenvalue λ was calculated by eigenvector technique as given in equation 4 and consistency index c i was calculated from the given expressions in equation 5 4 λ i 1 n p i w n n w 5 c i λ max n n 1 where λ is an eigenvalue that represents the ratio of weighted sum and normalized weight and n is the number of factors used in the analysis the random consistency index value is obtained from saaty s standard as illustrated in table 5 as per saaty 1980 a c r o f 0 1 shows that the decision to remain with the ahp analysis is acceptable if a c r o f 0 1 the judgement must be revised to determine the cause of the inconsistency and corrected until the value of c r 0 1 is achieved the gwpz was constructed by utilizing the weighted overlay approach to overlap all of the thematic layers after each thematic layer were given weight and each sub class of thematic layers was given a rank using equation 6 6 g w p z i n w i r i where gwpz is the groundwater potential the weight of each thematic layer is wi and ri is rank of each thematic layer s sub classes based on the groundwater potential zones the areas were classified as very low low moderate high and very high arulbalaji et al 2019 the equation proposed was utilized to determine groundwater potential index values using the weighted overlay analysis tools jacek 1999 equation 7 7 g w p z g m w g m r g e w g e r s o w s o r l u w l u r

index tpi c curvature 2 5 sensitivity analysis in order to better understand the influential thematic layers of the produced gwpz single parameter sensitivity analysis techniques were applied to analyse each of the classes and thematic layers in the gis platform these analyses were carried out using the raster calculator and raster properties tools by comparing the weighting factor for each of the thematic layers with the empirical weighting factor assigned to the same layer on the potential map this method was utilized to assess the impact on the groundwater potential map of each thematic layer fenta et al 2015 an equation 8 was used to calculate the weighting factor w for each thematic layer 8 w p r p w g w p z 100 where p r and p w are the rates and weights values of each thematic layer and gwpz is the groundwater potential zone computed using all the thematic layers 2 6 multicollinearity analysis at least one input parameter independent predictor variable in the model is considerably associated with a combination of the other input parameters independent predictor variables in the multiple regression model which is called multicollinearity it demonstrates that a model s output can be quite accurate when one input parameter can be predicted linearly from another for example slope and slope aspects consequently it is necessary to test for multicollinearity before running the regression model to access this validation a linear regression analysis is performed where input parameters say x i are considered as the dependent variables and the r 2 value is calculated say r i 2 this value is further used to calculate the tolerance and variance inflation factor vif of the input variables using equation 9 and 10 mukherjee and singh 2020 9 t o l e r a n c e

the processes are repeated for each one multicollinearity issues are indicated by tolerance of 0 010 or a vif of 0 010 saha 2017 all layers with a tolerance level or vif value lower than 10 must be omitted from this evaluation 2 7 validation of groundwater potential zone with the help of well discharge data from 28 excavated wells a groundwater potential zone map was validated that were created in this study isro which provides a single window solution for all water resources data and information acquired the excavated well data through the generation of database and implementation of web enabled india wris the final groundwater prospect map was checked for correctness by overlaying the well s discharge points on top of the map murmu et al 2019 3 results and discussion land use land cover hydrological conditions in a location and the interaction between these elements all have a role in determining where and how much groundwater potential or recharge zone is present as do a variety of other variables acharya et al 2019 murmu et al 2019 groundwater potential zones in the study region were identified using thirteen contributing parameters including d d designates drainage

in identifying prospective groundwater locations plain surface areas often see less irruption than moderate to highly elevated sites ashwini et al 2020 pande et al 2021 the digital elevation model dem was extracted from the shuttle radar topography obtained from the us geological survey usgs website and cleaned by filling the sink to remove local depressions the study area was divided into five classes a 6 9 m b 200 330 m c 340 510 m d 520 740 and e 750 1400 m fig 3 the lower relief areas are characterized by soft lithology that allows for groundwater replenishment and high relief sites have a relatively complex lithology that creates high flow 3 2 slope and drainage density the slope map was developed using aster dem in gis by processing hydrology tools in arcmap slope was classified in 5 types and it ranges from very low to very high slope variation in jharkhand as shown in fig 4 a varies from 0 to 67 62 plain land lies in the lesser slope region whereas the greater slope represents the hilly region drainage density is defined as the ratio of the overall stream length to the area under drainage the drainage density map is shown in fig 4 b a high drainage density ranges of 0 69 1 059 is found in 26 of the area because it affects the lithology beneath it drainage density is a key indicator of hydrogeological features an inverse relationship between permeability and the distance between stream channels is known as the closeness of the channel spacing agarwal and garg 2016 jaiswal et al 2003 it measures the channel length per unit area the drainage pattern is a reflection of both the surface and the underlying formations prasad et al 2008 higher runoff results from increased drainage density while increased recharge or a potential groundwater zone results from decreased drainage density the drainage density is inversely proportional to permeability pande et al 2020 there is less rainwater infiltration due to the lack of penetrable hard rock which tends to be concentrated in surface runoff and aquifers 3 3 rainfall and lineament density map rainfall data were obtained from the climatic research unit cru which is available from 1901 to present in high resolution gridded form and considering the average annual rainfall data a thematic map was prepared in arcgis using the idw tool as presented in fig 5 a the classification of rainfall was based on the amount of rainfall that occurred during the previous years and was presented at a depth in mm it has been noted that the western and central parts have more rainfall compared to other regions and directly affect the groundwater potential by recharging the jharkhand region rainfall makes a significant role in replenishing groundwater reserves it calculates the volume of water that would be accessible for evaporation into the underground storage system any place that receives more rainfall has a greater chance of being recharged machiwal and singh 2015 the presence of precipitation was regarded as a key source of recharging magesh et al 2012 the lineaments provide space for water to flow through it and thus affect the flow and ingress of water leading to the recharge of groundwater mukherjee et al 2012 reddy et al 2000 the linear density map was created using the hill shade tool in arcgis by drawing lineaments on the aster dem of jharkhand as shown in fig 5 b five classes were arranged namely medium low very low high and very high lineaments are visible in the hills and valleys rather than in the plains 3 4 soil and lulc map surface run off and groundwater recharge are significantly influenced by soil texture groundwater recharge is influenced by soil types infiltration rates percolation rates and permeability jasrotia et al 2019 pandey et al 2022 the study area is heavily covered with four types of soil groups as shown on the soil map fig 6 a the leading soil types of the study area are i lithosols bc chromic cambisols ne eutricnitosols nd dystric nitosols chromic vertisols io orthic luvisols be eutriccambisols and jc calcaricfluvisols due to the presence of eutricgleysols the western and eastern parts capture more water and contribute significantly to groundwater potential lulc has a significant role in groundwater recharging ashwini et al 2020 shaban et al 2006 it comprises the types of soil deposits where homes are located and the amount of vegetation yeh et al 2016 it is influenced by anthropological intervention as well as universal phenomena like agronomic skill and demand residential development consumer trends urban growth and economic development as well as other variables pande et al 2021 pathan et al 2021 the change in land use land cover also affects the quality of groundwater singh et al 2010 the esri lulc 2021 product was used and the whole state was divided into five types namely agricultural land forest vegetable area urban built up areas water bodies and other vacant lands fig 6 b 3 5 geomorphology and geology of jharkhand the geomorphology of a region exhibits different landforms and structural elements which is crucial for determining the potential and prospects for groundwater since it regulates the circulation of groundwater underground gumma and pavelic 2013 kumar et al 2022 the geomorphological map was developed on information obtained from the geological survey of india gsi arulbalaji et al 2019 for better analysis the geomorphological features are divided into 67 types as shown in fig 7 a the area around the river has alluvial plains and floodplains leading to the additional filling as underground springs have sand and silt that help hold water in the northern and eastern parts of the study area the hilly regions are covered with moderately dispersed hills and valleys as well as hills and valleys with a highly dispersed structure therefore groundwater availability is high in the central and western parts of the region due to the availability of suitable sites in the vicinity a map with a geology theme was prepared using a map obtained by the u s department of the interior geological survey usgs steinshouer et al 1997 as shown in fig 7 b nair et al 2017 observed that the hydrogeological zone s porosity and permeability are greatly influenced by groundwater occurrence and flow allowing for easy water storage and transmission jharkhand contains five types of rocks namely trcs lower triassic to carboniferous sedimentary rocks tk high and cretaceous sedimentary rocks q quaternary sediments pc precambrian rocks separately and jms jurassic metamorphic rocks and sediment the glacial sediments and rocks of the surma group occupy a large part of the jharkhand group and barail the formation of dupitila the presence of tipamsandstoe formations is small compared to the other two species in general glacial sediments or fluvial sediments have good accessibility as they contain sand and mud from nearby rivers that hold more water and contribute to potentiality 3 6 topographic wetness index twi and topographic position index tpi the topographic wetness index twi is often used to calculate the impacts of topography on hydrological processes and reflects the possibility of groundwater penetration mokarram et al 2015 it illustrates the link between the diversion of the water stored in the site portion and the gravity that pushes the water following the slope it is one of the crucial aspects taken into account while studying the groundwater potential zone because it indicates the wetness of the terrain and fluctuates with topographic gradient slope which would be repeated in multi criteria decision making this thematic layer was not regarded as an effective element for the groundwater potential under the ahp model of inquiry pandey et al 2022 describing the wetness pattern twi is the most widely used feature to detect potential groundwater zone saha 2017 the twi was prepared by using topmodel a model that stimulates the hydrologic fluxes of water throughout the watershed beven 1997 equation 11 given below was used for the estimation of twi 11 t w i ln α tan β α upslope contributing area β topographic gradient slope jharkhand s twi value is between 2 52 and 27 21 as shown in fig 8 a very low 2 52 6 31 low 6 31 8 06 medium 8 06 10 39 high 10 39 13 70 and very high 10 39 13 70 were five categories 13 70 27 21 as mentioned earlier higher weights were given higher twi and vice versa dem data was used to calculate twi as the number of twi increases so does the potential for groundwater availability the topographic position index tpi is an algorithm that is often used to calculate topographic slope areas default geographical sections and automated landforms classification de reu et al 2013 many visible processes in the landscape are associated with a geographical indicator including the flat plain the hilltop the lowland area and the open hills the activities of the upper and lower slopes jenness 2006 equation 12 given below was used for the estimation of twi 12 t p i m o n 1 m n n where m o elevation of the model point under evaluation m n elevation of grid n the total number of surrounding points employed in the evaluation jenness 2006 tpi ranged from 70 to 82 across the province tpi 0 refers to the low flat area at lower tpi values higher weights are given and vice versa nair et al 2017 fig 8 b shows the topographic position index tpi map 3 7 curvature and roughness index the curvature of peak slopes which represents the topography of the region is the most important factor to be studied for identifying possible groundwater locations water hydrology and assessing the stability of the terrain pande et al 2021 the slope s curvatures provide a more accurate description of the hydrology soil formation and accumulation dynamics under the surface negative bending indicates that the surface is facing upwards and the positive curvature represents that the surface is upwards convex at that cell whereas zero indicates the level of the surface oh et al 2011 the curvature of a contour line created by intersecting a horizontal plane with the surface is known as plan curvature and can be used to show the intersection and flow of the flow lee et al 2012 in the study areas plan curvature can be used to describe divergence and flow interactions as well as to distinguish between reservoirs and wells transmitted through a 0thorder hydraulic network the map was created using arcgis 10 3 and a natural break method was used to combine values into five groups 20 19 1 01 1 01 to 0 35 0 35 0 29 0 29 1 12 and 1 12 21 61 fig 9 a the roughness index of the digital elevation model indicates the amount of height change between adjacent cells dem climate and erosion processes are constantly changing the surface of the smooth rock to a slippery slippery slope resulting in a more rugged landscape nair et al 2017 fig 9 b shows the roughness map of jharkhand and the values vary from 0 11 to 0 88 the values were further divided into five categories 0 11 0 37 0 37 0 45 0 45 0 53 0 53 0 61 0 61 0 88 with a low roughness value higher weights were assigned and vice versa see table 8 3 8 delineation of groundwater potential zones by overlaying the relevant groundwater contributing thematic layers potential groundwater areas have been created groundwater prospect zones were assessed using the groundwater index which was calculated by compiling all thematic layers potential zone maps are produced using weights assigned to all categories of fifteen layers after weighted overlay analysis of all the thematic layers in arcgis a potential location map was finally created fig 10 the potential groundwater zone is classified as very low low medium and high in relation to the assigned weight the results showed that approximately 3 28 of the total falls under the high 77 34 under the average 19 12 under the low and the very low areas make up about 0 25 of the study area table 9 the alluvial plateau of the jharkhand river is characterized by high groundwater low slope flat topography high penetration and porosity and high infiltration capacity according to the hydro geomorphological nature of the river basin most of the high potential area is located in eight districts due to the alluvial plain region or a few mountains in that region namely godda sahibganj pakur dumka purbi singhbhum saraikela kharsawan and part of the ranchi while chatra hazaribagh latehar garhwa pashchimi singhbhum in a place with low potential zone and rest are in the moderate zone fig 11 shows the roc plot for the entire jharkhand region and the sub curve auc score is 83 indicating the potential reliable and efficient groundwater resources developed by the ahp method the groundwater level in any region describes the actual state of the groundwater source to confirm further divergence of potential groundwater a potential zone map was verified by 28 bore wells of these 28 bore wells 23 were found to be positive the locations of the bore wells are given in table 10 the well data of taranari giridih takaha bokaro balak hazaribagh lalkhatanga ranchi and suilibari jamtara were the five places where the acceptance of the tested sites was not valid and gwls in all other areas have shown good acceptance 3 9 single parameter sensitivity analysis of the groundwater potential map the single parameter sensitivity analysis depicted in table 7 indicates how the groundwater influencing parameters contribute towards the potentiality the sensitivity analysis results show that lineament density and geomorphology have a high impact compared to other parameters with 36 18 percent and 25 43 percent contributions respectively in addition soil type and lulc are the contributing parameters following the preceding parameters corresponding to 12 58 percent and 9 85 percent while roughness and curvature are the parameters that have the low influence with 1 66 percent and 1 70 percent respectively the empirical weights calculated using ahp of some parameters might differ from the effective weights determined using sensitivity analysis these influencing parameters which are responsible for infiltration and recharge would undoubtedly reduce the groundwater by rejuvenating the aquifer system 4 discussion 4 1 cross validation of groundwater potential zone map to confirm accuracy the groundwater potential map was matched to bore well yield data from wris to that purpose the 28 borewells in jharkhand having discharge data have been analysed representing a wide range of geographical topographical and land use land cover changes based on the yield achieved 28 borewells were categorised into four categories low 4lps low 4 12lps medium 12 20lps and high 20lps the map was separated into four classes very low low medium or high the gwpz map was then overlaid with borewell sites and yield categorization labels as shown in fig 10 according to the verification results almost 80 of the borewells were correctly identified based on the position of the generated gwpz map fig 11 according to the gwpz model certain portions of alluvial farms will drain groundwater but these areas will have medium to high potential long term groundwater extraction for agricultural purposes could be the cause of the variability which has impacted the study area s capability for groundwater recharge in the current climate according to various studies groundwater depletion is putting the availability of groundwater for irrigation purposes in danger mukherjee and singh 2020 altering harvesting patterns and harvest types as well as using drip and sprinkler irrigation in certain areas could assist prevent groundwater depletion birkenholtz 2017 kaarakka et al 2019 the receiver operating characteristic roc curve was used to confirm the groundwater potential recharge zone fig 11 borewell yield data was compared to a map based validation the roc curve shows the sensitivity pair that corresponds to a threshold and sets a genuine positive rate relative to the non true value for dissimilar cut off points of a variable auc on the other hand is a measure of how well a metric can distinguish between two different diagnostic groups auc values of 0 5 and 0 6 imply erroneous predictability whereas auc values of 0 6 and 0 7 0 7 0 8 0 8 0 9 and 0 9 1 indicate a precise decent excellent measure and the most precise exact measurement respectively andualem and demeke 2019 the auc gwpz map was 0 813 implying that the ahp approach predicted the results properly there is no multicollinearity problem uncertainty in the gwpz test model as shown in the single parameter sensitivity analysis all of the thematic layers explored are critical for managing the study area s gwpz and their absence will have a major impact on the accuracy attained furthermore the gwpz map was developed by modifying judgements to reconcile the contradictions discovered by the consistency analysis among the thematic levels and subclasses of each thematic layer when compared to groundwater yield data the gwpz map was generated with 80 accuracy and a good predictive value of 0 813 using auc as a result a recent study employing ahp and gis approaches discovered a high degree of accuracy with a significant number of major thematic layers pairwise comparison matrix was utilized to evaluate the impact of thematic elements and then mcdm and ahp were applied to provide a geographic mapping of groundwater potential using weighted overlay analysis based on weighted overlay analysis four zones were identified in the study region the impact of these layers on determining groundwater potential is then supported by a thorough statistical study of the sensitivity of each thematic factor this geospatial method is by itself a dependable and trusted instrument in research assessing groundwater potential many modern researchers have widely embraced it doke 2019 yeh et al 2016 5 conclusions the current study is an attempt to designate groundwater potential zones in the state of jharkhand utilizing integrated data viz remote sensing and geographic information systems gis in conjunction with the ahp technique satellite imagery and topographic maps were utilized to create several different thematic maps the purpose of this study was to apply the ahp approach to identify possible groundwater recharge sites a total of fifteen layers were built by combining data from various sources the final groundwater potential map of the research region is divided into four zones high moderate low and very low it was determined what the normalized weight of these theme layers was following their impact on affecting groundwater potential all thematic layers and their classes are given ranks and weights based on their importance in impacting groundwater potential the territory is classified into four potential groundwater areas low groundwater potential low groundwater potential medium groundwater potential and high groundwater potential for the validation of the groundwater potential zones map a total of 28 existing borewell data sets were employed following the findings of the cross validation it was determined that ahp was an effective method for delineating the groundwater potential of the research area using an area under curve auc of 83 the data validation was found to be compatible with the evidence obtained following validation the method employed delivers a reasonably reliable outcome for the state of jharkhand in conclusion it can be readily seen that the groundwater potential maps anticipated in this study have a very high degree of accuracy as demonstrated above the findings of the study can be used as a tool for water planners and policymakers to better manage water resources the introduction of management strategies is predicted to boost natural groundwater recharge resulting in a large increase in the volume of water available to the local population 6 limitations because of the method used some limits may be considered in obtaining the results ahp is a knowledge driven process hence it makes predictions with reasonable accuracy but not high accuracy mukherjee and singh 2020 after considering the rainfall data from the gauges monitoring station provided by the indian meteorological department imd an interpolation approach with lower prediction error may be utilized to generate the rainfall distribution which will help improve the accuracy of the groundwater potential zone amini et al 2019 a more accurate groundwater potential map of the state can be constructed in the future by considering all of these elements despite these limitations in the research process and estimation the study s findings are genuine and scientific the findings of this study may be valuable to policymakers in their efforts to enhance the state s groundwater management practices declaration of competing

activities and usual geochemical activities mostly developing countries are directly generating pressure in this regard and distressing chemical activities of urban groundwater day by day hossain et al 2020 groundwater is a very important natural source which gives access to potable drinking water across the urban centres such as udham singh nagar of upper gangetic alluvial plains of northern india macdonald et al 2016 where groundwater is abstracted from shallow tube wells deeper hand pumps and deeper dug wells shallow aquifer systems are vulnerable to pollution and can cause risks to human health due to various contaminants lapworth et al 2018 when groundwater moves in different geogenic pathways it dissolves both inorganic and organic constituents backman et al 1998 these constituents and the micronutrients play a key role in human life if present in optimum amount however when dissolved constituents go beyond the amount needed for human beings it becomes toxic for health generally heavy metals and metallic constituents with comparatively high density could be hazardous even in low concentration if they accumulate within the body biswas et al 2017 dippong et al 2018 dippong et al 2020 roşca et al 2020 heavy metals are non disintegrable and once accumulated in human being system they can lead to the formation of neurological disorders symptoms such as

located in the south eastern part of uttarakhand state and falls in the terai region of kumaun division of uttarakhand latitude 28 51 and 29 22 n longitude 78 46 e and 80 09 e area 3055 sq km fig 1 the average annual rainfall in this area is 962 mm the climate fluctuates from sub humid and sub tropical to summer rainy and winter seasons maximum temperature goes up to 44 c in summer and minimum temperature during winter is between 1 and 4 c cgwb 2011 2 1 1 geology and hydro geological characteristics of the study area geology plays a significant role in maintaining the quality of groundwater of a particular region and therefore it becomes essential to have knowledge about the geology of the study area in the present investigation piedmont alluvial deposits signify the geology of this region the study area can be separated into two parts bhabar and terai bhabar division has elevated porosity and permeability which allow the precipitation to permeate in fairly plentiful amount in short period resulting in the formation of exceptional reservoirs for groundwater the lithology of bhabar leads in badly sorted unconsolidated sediments like rocks grains stones and cobbles deposit coarse to fine sand and clay ultimately the bhabar unit joints with the terai region in south where the aquifers are generally released from bhabar the water level depth declines steadily towards south lastly rising as the helix line water level depth in bhabar area was observed to be ranged from 2 1 to 5 3 mbgl and 1 3 to 3 8 mbgl in pre and post monsoon seasons of year 2015 respectively cgwb 2015 the terai region consists of large pieces of talus material mainly the lithology includes clays and silts with well sorted grainy substance like gravel sand irregular boulders cobbles and stone beds the sand and grate are the better portion of most important aquifers in this region the depth of water level ranged from 2 8 to 14 7 mbgl and 0 4 to 12 7 mbgl for the period of pre and post monsoon 2015 seasons respectively but the groundwater in deeper aquifers arise under artesian situation in the individual well the artesian flow may differ from just a drip at the surface from the limited aquifer to numerous hundred or in extraordinary cases a thousand gallons per minute cgwb 2015 2 1 2 land use pattern agriculture is the chief profession of the people of the study area and it is called the food bowl of uttarakhand owing to plenty of groundwater availability kharif and rabi are the two vital cropping systems the main crops of kharif are moong rice soyabean till and urad

rating system is an illogical value that lies between 0 and 1 and it depends on the significance of each water quality deliberation in a relative way and can be represented by the value in reverse proportional to the suggestive standard of the respective parameter mohan et al 1996 according to prasad and bose 2001 unit weightage wi values are in reverse proportional to the suggestive standard values si of the corresponding parameters reddy 1995 reported that the hpi value of the potable water should be 100 but edet and offiong 2002 had modified it into three categories low medium and high with hpi of 15 15 30 and 30 respectively furthermore on the other hand hossain et al 2020 suggested the categories hpi 100 to be critical the formula for hpi suggested by mohan et al 1996 is as follows 1 h p i i 1 n w i s i i 1 n w i in the above equation wi unit weight of the nth parameter n number of parameters and si sub index of ith parameter which was evaluated by the following formula 2 s i i 1 n o i d i m i d i x 100 where oi observed value of heavy metal of ith parameter di desirable limit bis 2012 and mi maximum allowable value bis 2012 wi was calculated by 1 di 2 4 2 heavy metal evaluation index hei hei was determined utilizing maximum allowable concentration mac given by edet and offiong 2002 the hei was evaluated by the following formula 3 h e i i 1 n h e i i in the above equation heii is the pollution index which was evaluated by using the following formula 4 h e i o i m a c i maci maximum allowable concentration of ith parameter for who 2011 guidelines and oi observed value of the particular heavy metal according to edet and offiong 2002 the criteria of hei for each sample are low hei 1 66 medium hei 1 66 3 32 high hei 3 32 2 4 3 modified heavy metal pollution index m hpi for calculating both hpi and hei wither highest desirable concentration or maximum permissible limit by bis 2012 and who 2011 is required sometimes hpi is calculated using bis standards where only lower limit of the metals are given and there is no relaxation towards the upper limit additionally hpi classification is based upon the heavy metal content in the water sample as very good good and excellent this system is not helping in decision making acceptable or unacceptable about water quality tariq et al 2008 and maskoomi et al 2020 have improved the heavy metal pollution indices hpi and hei and evaluated new hpi termed as m hpi modified heavy metal pollution index which is helpful in deciding the water quality in terms of its level of potability m hpi was evaluated using maximum allowable concentration chaturvedi et al 2018 suppose n is the total number of heavy metals then m hpi can be calculated using the following formula 5 m h p i i 1 n m h p i i in equation 5 m hpii corresponds to the ith heavy metal and was evaluated using the following formula 6 m h p i i ᾠ i s i where ᾠi is the relative weight of factors and was calculated by using equation 7 7 ᾠ w i i 1 n w i 8 w i 1 m i 9 s i o i d i d i in the above mentioned equation oi observed concentration and di is the desirable concentration with reference to bis 2012 standards table 1 if oi di m hpii will have a negative value negative index ni and if oi di m hpii will have a positive value positive index pi to evaluate m hpi the pi and ni added individually to get compounded values of pi and ni positive index showed the involvement of those heavy metal ions to the quality of groundwater which are present beyond the maximum desired limit while negative index represented the involvement of metal ions that beyond the desirable limit the upper limit ul was also calculated using the following formula 10 u l i 1 n m i l i l i thus the water quality of the groundwater samples was decided by the values of the pair of calculated indices pi and ni if pi 0 0 ni 1 water quality is excellent if ul pi 0 0 ni 1 water quality is very good to good and if pi ul ni 0 water quality is unacceptable 2 5 statistical analysis the statistical software spss 16 0 was used for statistical analysis including principal component and cluster analysis 2 5 1 principal component analysis pca pca is a controlling model and appreciation techniques that efforts to describe the variance of a huge dataset and convert into a lesser dataset of self determining variables simeonov et al 2003 pca methods remove the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the covariance matrix of creative dataset the principal components pcs are the uncorrelated orthogonal variables achieved with means of increasing the inventive correlated datasets with the eigenvector which is a list of coefficients loadings or weightings thus the pcs are weighted linear combinations of the original variables the pca technique affords some knowledge on the most important parameters which explain the complete data set as affording the decline data by a least defeat of inventive knowledge vega et al 1998 the factor analysis additionally decreases the involvement of fewer major datasets created from pca along with the innovative group of datasets generated from pca and the innovative group of datasets known as varifactors vf is removed during rotating axis distinct by pca vega et al 1998 pca with varimax rotation of identical factor loadings was done for maximizing the difference among the datasets under every condition and those pcs with eigen value 1 were maintained singh et al 2004 2 5 2 cluster analysis ca according to shrestha and kazama 2007 the technique of ca is used to allocate a set of matter converted into group so that the objects in the one group are similar to each other further than to those in different cluster two types of cluster techniques have been identified q and r mode respectively in r mode dendrogram is produced which shows similarity while in q mode it is difficult to separate clusters magesh et al 2013 hierarchical agglomerative clustering hac is commonly used technique which completely gives natural relationship between a sample and different parameter and is represented by dendrogram in the present research hierarchical cluster analysis was applied using ward s method by spss 16 0 to check the variability among different water parameters 2 6 risk analysis on human health according to usepa 2004 and wu et al 2010 human being can be exposed to the metals via three pathways namely inhalation dermal route or direct ingestion among these pathways ingestion is the main pathway of exposure of metals through drinking water the quantity of metals received through the ingestion pathway was evaluated by applying three equation 11 which was helpful in analyzing the risk of metal on human health giri and singh 2015 11 a d d o i x i r x e f x e d b w x a t add average daily dose in μg kg day oi observed concentration of metals in μg l ir ingestion rate in l day 1 l day for child 1 48 m3 year adult giri et al 2020 ef exposure frequency in days year 350 days ed exposure duration in years 6 years for child and 24 years for adult bw body weight in kg 16 3 kg for child 52 kg for adult icmr 2009 and at averaging time in days usepa 2011 at ed x 365 days non carcinogenic risk usepa 2011 2 6 1 hazard quotient hq hazard quotient hq was determined by comparing contact or regular ingestion of pollutants from revelation path of intake with the subsequent reference dose rfd using equation 12 if hq 1 non carcinogenic effects might be there 12 h a z a r d q u o t i e n t a d d r f d where rfd was originated from risk based concentration table of usepa 1993 another index namely hazard index hi was also evaluated by adding all the determined hazard quotient hq values equation 13 for assessing the risk due to the presence of metals in the potable water hi value greater than 1 suggested possibilities of the adverse effect of the heavy metals on human health usepa 1989 2004 13 h i i 1 n h q i where hqi hazard quotient of each metal and n is 6 for total number of trace elements 2 7 spatial distribution in current years the groundwater quality assessment and monitoring on a regular basis has been carried out by using is geographic information system gis tool additional with the idw inverse distance weighted interpolation method and has confirmed itself as a powerful technique for determining and analyzing spatial information of water resources venkateswaran et al 2012 magesh and elango 2019 kamble et al 2020 ram et al 2021 these techniques efficiently reasonable and time efficient methods for converting large data sets to create different spatial allocation maps and protrusion revealing style relatives and the possible sources of contaminants or pollutants 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of the groundwater samples results obtained from physicochemical and heavy metal analysis are represented in table 1 these results were compared with the drinking water quality norms suggested by bis 2012 the values of ph found in the range of 7 57 8 61 with an average value 8 18 which indicated slightly alkaline nature of the tested water samples the result also suggested that 10 groundwater samples showed value of ph more than the bis standard bis 2012 probable sources of higher ph in this region might be bicarbonate and carbonate ions sappa et al 2014 reported that these ions are produced during hydrothermal reactions because of the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide the values of ec found between 353 and 1274 μs cm 1 with an average value 617 μs cm 1 the ec value is a good indicator of total salinity or total amount of dissolved solids in water and assist to evaluate the water fit for potable and irrigation purposes tds values varied between 229 and 824 mg l with a mean value of 401 mg l all groundwater samples had tds value less than 1000 mg l the order of ionic species in the groundwater samples was hco3 ca2 cl so4 2 mg2 na no3 k f it is well predicted that within a water sample the number of cations should balance the number of anions charge balance error based upon the content of cations and anions was reported to be within the standard limit of 5 3 2 hydrogeochemical characteristics 3 2 1 piper diagram in this diagram major cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions hco3 co3 2 cl and so4 2 are placed in the two basal triangle fig 2 the content of major cations and anions are described as meq l the central part of this diagram indicates the presence of both cations and anions in the present study the water samples were grouped into two categories mg type and no dominant type in cation facies while in anion facies the water was hco3 and cl and no dominant type according to piper s diagram the hydrochemical facies were in the order of ca mg hco3 ca cl ca so4 which suggested that majority of groundwater samples were ca mg hco3 type in the groundwater samples ca2 ion could be mainly derived through dissolution of precipitates such as caco3 and ca hco3 2 mg hco3 2 for the period of recharge these results indicated that the groundwater consisted of combination of various alkaline earth metals with temporary hardness kumar and singh 2015 this type of facies is also fit for irrigation purpose kundu and nag 2018 the hydrochemical facies of ca cl water type suggests mineral dissolution due to interaction between rock and water among adequate recharge of fresh water singh et al 2012 srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 rezaei et al 2019 3 2 2 gibbs diagram precipitation chemistry the chemical characteristics of groundwater are mostly controlled by different type of factors as well as infiltrating rainwater characteristics geological processes and mineral composition of rocks and manmade activities fig 3 suggested that in all sampling locations weathering was the dominant source of dissolved solids in the groundwater samples rather than evaporation or precipitation 3 2 3 cholro alkaline index cai the chloro alkaline index may be positive or negative which depends upon the replacement of na and k present in water with mg2 and ca2 in rock soil or vice versa the positive value of index suggests the replacement of na and k in water with ca2 and mg2 in rock soil and this is known as base exchange phenomenon negative value of the ratio indicates chloro alkaline disequilibrium and the reaction termed as cation anion exchange reaction in udham singh nager region 46 of the groundwater samples have positive index which indicated base exchange reaction on the other hand 54 of the samples were having negative value of the ratio which signified chloro alkaline disequilibrium cation anion exchange reaction 3 3 contamination scenario of heavy metals in the groundwater samples of the collection sites in the study area the mean content of heavy metals followed the descending order fe zn mn cr pb cd in the groundwater samples the amount of fe mn and cr were found above the prescribed by bis 2012 and who 2011 while the content of zn pb and cd was found within the limit iron fe is an important constituent of hemoglobin red blood cells and myoglobin muscle cells that play a main role in moving oxygen from lungs to the tissues according to usepa 1993 utilization of high amount of iron makes the food unpleasant and infusion processing and moreover causes blemishes in laundry and apparatus iron is one of the mainly abundant metals found in earth crust wagh et al 2018 reported that iron and manganese play a significant role in regulation of the biochemical cycles in flora and fauna weathering and release of liquid industrialized untreated waste water are supposed to be the major sources of iron in the groundwater under flooding situation fe bearing natural resources enhance the amount of soluble iron in groundwater white et al 1991 the content of iron in the study area varied between 1 60 and 1680 00 ppb with an average value 153 06 ppb table 1 fig 4 according to bis 10 500 2012 desirable limit of iron in potable water is 300 ppb the amount of iron in the study area for 14 of the groundwater samples was found to be beyond the desirable limit reflecting the effect of irrigation and domestic activities as probable sources wagh et al 2018 reported that the higher fe content changes the taste and appearance of water and also supports the growth of iron bacteria continuous utilization of excess amount of iron may causes drowsiness weight loss joint pains and eventually cardiovascular syndrome liver diseases sugar problem and hemosiderosis rajappa et al 2010 uscdc 2011 manganese mn is a vital element which is generally found with iron usually it is found within surface subsurface as well as in soil anthropogenic activities are also major source of manganese in water the concentration of manganese varied from 1 00 to 675 00 ppb with an average value of 72 88 ppb in the study area according to the bis 2012 the desirable limit for manganese is 100 ppb and maximum permissible limit in potable water is 300 ppb table 1 fig 4 according to the interpreted results of the study area five groundwater samples were found to have mn content beyond the desirable limit and three groundwater samples had higher amount of mn than its standard limit the higher amount of mn in groundwater might be due to the natural weathering of manganese bearing minerals atmospheric deposition leaching from plant tissues and industrial effluents stokes et al 1988 in the study area the main resources of manganese might be the release of the industrial effluent and urban activities manganese is significant for human being and its insufficiency might inhibit growth skeletal defects and reproductive abnormalities whereas consumption of higher amount of mn might responsible for a syndrome known as mangnisms which may cause weakness of muscles watts 1990 homoncik et al 2010 observed that high amount of mn in potable water can cause the neurological problems for adults higher concentration of cr in some samples might be owing to anthropogenic sources such as industrial wastes from automobile steel and paint related industries it is a widely reported contaminant around tanning industries and might cause allergic dermatitis diseases brindha and elango 2012 chromium iii is essential for human body as it regulates insulin discharge that assists to sustain normal glucose level in the human body it is also an important trace element for flora and fauna it is widely used in metal alloys and cement colour paints and paper industry generally the amount of chromium in potable water is low and in the form of hexa chromium it becomes harmful when taken in high amount according to hyodo et al 1980 air borne chromium trioxide is harmful to the skin and causes respiratory problem ultimately long term uptake of chromium may harm moving and sensor system of the animals pandey et al 2010 the desirable limit for chromium according to bis10500 2012 is 50 ppb in the present study the amount of chromium varied between 0 00 and 72 00 ppb with the average value of 18 30 ppb which indicated that 16 groundwater samples had higher amount of cr than its desirable limit table 1 fig 4 islam and mostafa 2021 reported that utilization of excessive chromium content in drinking water may cause of asthma cold and cough breathing problem breathless damage kidney anemia irritation and sore zinc zn is a necessary metal for controlling normal metabolic activities and its deficiency leads to impeded development of body it is mainly found in all igneous rocks and in the present research the mean content of zn varied from 1 00 to 855 55 ppb with an average value 114 22 ppb table 1 fig 4 according to the bis 10500 2012 the permissible limit and desirable limit of zn is 15 000 ppb and 5000 ppb respectively in the study area the content of zinc of all the groundwater samples was beyond the desirable limit the concentration of lead pb varied between 3 12 ppb and 5 32 ppb with an average of 4 06 ppb table 1 fig 3 according to the bis 10500 2012 recommended desirable limit of lead is 10 ppb which indicated that all groundwater samples found within the standard limit lead is an extremely toxic heavy metal still in little amounts lead to the delay physical and mental growth in infants as well as the causes hypertension problem in adults usepa 2004 cadmium cd is not however confirmed to be of biological important and it is assumed to cause renal arterial and high blood pressure vetrimurugan et al 2017 reported that high amount of cd and hexavalent chromium cr causes kidney and liver problems in adults the concentration of cadmium in the groundwater samples of the study area varied from 1 22 to 2 80 ppb with an average value of 1 82 ppb table 1 fig 4 and was observed to be within the desirable limit of 3 ppb bis 2012 the heavy metal content of cd cr fe mn pb and zn in each sample was plotted for better representation and understanding fig 4 in 66 of water samples fe and mn were significantly contributing to metal load out of 50 water samples 38 were dominated by cr and zn confirming contribution from industrial effluents these samples have been collected from adjacent industrial units from the perusal of fig 4 the concentration of fe mn and cr was appeared to be much dominant in the areas of nagla khurpia bara kathangri and bhagora of rudrapur block further it was also observed that the zn also predominantly manifested at dhakiakalan chaiti more areas of kashipur block and rudrapur block respectively and remaining heavy metal concentration seemed to be within the limits in the study area various industries like textile automobile paper petrochemical etc are using heavy metals for their product development and discharge waste contaminated with heavy metals in environment and water bodies from water bodies it disseminates to soil and groundwater heavy metal contamination in soil and groundwater directly or indirectly impacts the plants animals insects and microorganisms limited studies were performed in udham singh nagar industrial area to understand the heavy metal chemistry in groundwater and observed that fe mn and zn contamination was constantly increased at different time periods during pre monsoon season lead concentration was constant in 2010 and 2011 seth et al 2014 and increased in the year 2016 singh et al 2022 fig 5 in the present investigation where the samples were collected in 2018 the content of these three metals were almost similar to that of 2010 and 2011 study cadmium content was constant in all the studied years but cr concentration was found to increase year by year which might be due to textile and paper industries in the nearby areas during 2016 to 2022 no study was reported in this area which makes this study important and unique to understand the trend of heavy mental contamination in ground water and encourage researchers to do surveillance study in this industrial area fig 5 comparison of heavy metal content in the water bodies near sidkul industries uttarakhand has been summarized in table 2 spatial variation of heavy metals is shown in fig 6 a fig 6 b and c kriging method was utilized for the spatial distribution of heavy metals kriging algorithm presumes that the direction or distance between collection sites considers a spatial correlation which can be utilized to elucidate differences in the surface elumalai et al 2017a 2017b iron 14 of groundwater samples manganese and chromium content was observed to be relatively higher in southern rudrapur and sitargunj blocks and south eastern region of the study area which might attributed to geogenic and anthropogenic sources such as industrial effluents from various industries and agricultural run off wagh et al 2018 singh et al 2022 the natural sources of fe and mn are weathering of fe and mn bearing minerals and rocks the amount of iron generally increased by human made sources like as metal processing iron and wastes from steel industries paper mill and discharge of industrial and sewage dirty water parween et al 2021 singh et al 2022 3 4 water pollution evaluation indices water pollution indices hpi hei and m hpi were calculated by following the methods developed by edet and offiong 2002 the concentrations of fe mn zn pb cd and cr were used for evaluating hpi hei and m hpi values bis 2012 limits were used for determining hpi and m hpi values while who 2011 standards were used for hei calculations the value of upper limit ul for this set of heavy metals was work out to be 0 0603 only mn and zn were used to determine ul as fe pb cd and cr came under non relaxable category for assessing the pollution level of heavy metals mean values approach has been practiced prasanna et al 2012 singh et al 2017b calculated values of water pollution indices are presented in table 3 the analytical results showed that 60 of hpi values and 66 hei values were lower than the corresponding mean value 3 4 1 heavy metal pollution index hpi hpi is one of the appropriate methods for calculating collective effect of heavy metals present in the groundwater samples the amount of evaluated hpi was compared with the critical amount of hpi 100 which is thought to be dangerous yankey et al 2013 singh and kamal 2017 hossain et al 2020 in the present study area hpi values ranged between 42 49 and 84 01 with an average value of 54 15 as per the categorization of hpi the results indicated that 58 samples found to be of low pollution category and 42 samples found under medium pollution category table 3 there was no sample found in higher category yankey et al 2013 from tarkara mining area ghana reported that the amount of hpi of the groundwater samples was less than the critical amount and only one sampling location was found to have critical amount of hpi 102 97 in the present study the hpi value was observed to be less than the critical amount of hpi 100 singh and kumar 2017 and kumar et al 2020 reported that 53 and 40 of sampling locations of ramgarh area jharkhand india were having lower and medium hpi values and only 7 samples found under higher category the amount of hpi was observed to be less than the critical index value 100 in the groundwater samples collected from bangladesh hossain et al 2020 3 4 2 heavy metal evaluation index hei according to mean value approach of hei water can be classified into three categories lower pollution hei 1 66 medium pollution hei 1 66 3 32 and higher pollution hei 3 32 edet and offiong 2002 in this study the values of hei varied between 0 87 and 2 84 with an average value of 1 66 which suggested that 46 samples found to fall under lower pollution category the 44 samples belonged to the medium category of pollution whereas remaining 10 samples were found in higher category table 3 the spatial distribution map of hpi revealed that central part small part of southern and south western part was dominant and as per the values of hei small part of southern side of the study area had medium contamination fig 7 fig 8 rezaei et al 2019 reported that 52 43 and 17 samples found under lower medium and highly polluted category respectively kumar et al 2020 have used the categorization as low 0 10 medium 10 20 and higher more than 20 further they observed that 60 and 40 samples were found in lower and medium pollution category respectively according to the hpi and hei values the best water samples were ku23 and ku50 respectively as per hpi the worst water sample in the selected region were ku2 khurpia and ku3 bara on the other hand as per hei values ku3 bara and ku4 kathangari were the worst water samples 3 4 3 modified heavy metal pollution index m hpi the evaluated values of m hpi were evaluated for each sampling location table 3 it was noted that out of a total of 50 groundwater samples only 72 samples categorized as excellent category and remaining sampling points under very good good to unacceptable category the pi values ranged between 0 and 0 025 for nine groundwater samples 18 suggesting very good quality and 2 samples were of good quality the remaining 3 groundwater samples were having the range of pi values between 0 091 and 1 41 suggesting that these water samples were unfit for potable purpose chromium being a non relaxable parameter 18 samples might consider to be unsuitable for drinking purpose presence of higher amount of cr in groundwater is reported by many researchers tariq et al 2008 ullah et al 2009 herojeet et al 2015 adimalla et al 2018 wagh et al 2018 islam and mostafa 2021 as per m hpi value the best water samples were ku40 and ku7 as the amount of pi 0 and ni was very low ku2 ku3 and ku4 were the worst water samples in the study area on the basis of m hpi values in the current study the concentration of three heavy metals fe mn cr found more than their standard limits thus making the value of pi always positive and ni 1 fig 9 demonstrates the spatial distribution map of m hpi generally the southern and some part of south eastern site of the pantnagar region was unfit for drinking purpose and in southern eastern and some part of south western part of the study area found under good category literature showed that 52 in pre and 58 in the post monsoon season were having the amount of pi values from 0 to 0 1 suggesting very good water quality chaturwadi et al 2018 according rezaei et al 2019 95 groundwater samples were having pi values from 0 to 0 1 suggesting very good water quality 3 5 health risk assessment 3 5 1 hazard quotient hq the average hq values of fe mn zn pb cd and cr for all the groundwater samples were determined to be 0 0162 0 0563 0 044 0 055 0 17 0 456 respectively for the grown person population and 0 014 0 033 0 024 0 074 0 231 and 0 39 respectively for the child population table 3 the average values of all trace elements found less than 1 which indicated that these metals created little hazard independently it was found to be the maximum for sampling locations of ku36 for both child and younger populations the value of hq for cr at all sampling locations varied in between 0 and 1 794 for adult population and 0 to 1 53 for younger population which indicated that cr might cause adverse impact on the local population at some sampling points along with some non carcinogenic concern the amount of hq of chromium was found to be high at ku2 ku3 ku4 ku8 ku12 ku14 ku16 ku21 ku36 ku38 ku39 and ku41 sampling points for adult population on the other hand for younger population it was observed high in ku3 ku4 ku8 ku12 ku16 ku21 ku36 ku 38 and ku39 which indicated that cr may cause unfavorable fitness impacts at these sampling sites and is a probable non carcinogenic concern 3 5 2 hazard index hi the non carcinogenic risk of heavy metal was given with the aid of hi values hi 1 was taken as safe while hi 1 was taken as hazard that can be related to a single metal or more metals vetrimurugan et al 2017 neogi et al 2018 in the study area the values of hi varied between 0 0306 and 4 98 average 0 79 and from 0 271 to 2 220 average 0 76 for the adult and younger populations respectively table 3 in adult population high hi 1 values were observed for ku2 ku3 ku4 ku8 ku12 ku14 ku15 ku16 ku21 ku25 ku36 ku37 ku38 ku39 and ku41 sampling sites while the sampling locations ku2 ku3 ku4 ku8 ku12 ku14 ku16 ku21 ku25 ku36 ku37 ku38 ku39 ku41 and ku44 for child population were observed to have higher hi value the amount of hi 1 revealed that total 14 samples namely khurpia ku2 bara ku3 kathangari ku4 dungerpur ku8 jhankat ku12 chakkarpur ku14 deori ku16 barhani ku21 dalpura ku25 dhakia kalan ku36 bhimnagar ku37 chandpur ku38 chatty more ku39 and hempur kechari ku41 were not safe for any age group of population table 3 thus the values of hi for elder and younger people of 28 sampling points of udham singh nagar region were demonstrating the hazardous health effect these sampling points have unusual geological activities and are under the influence of active sidcul textile and petrochemicals cement and sugar process industries additionally the potential hazardous appraisal revealed that cr was the most important element contaminant in the groundwater of udham singh nagar region uttarakhand the above health risk assessment study indicated that the adult population could be suffered more than the younger population through the metal contamination through the oral route chromium is frequently observed as one of the smallest amount poisonous element and there are numerous case reports of oral utilization of high amount of chromium have found to cause lung infections kidney failure intestinal hemorrhage and damage of liver mohammed et al 2011 rahaman et al 2020 vijaykumar et al 2021 giri and singh 2015 reported that the non carcinogenic hazards occur due to direct ingestion of groundwater and was found to be very high and categorized as adults child they also observed that manganese cobalt and arsenic were highly involved in chronic health hazard and the metals such as cadmium copper and selenium were the least contributed ions towards adult and child population neogi et al 2018 found that the amount of hq for fe mn ni and al was more than the standard limit for both adults and children according to hossain et al 2020 the amount of hi was observed to be greater than the standard limit near sugar mill region for any age group of population the hi values were greater than the standard limit in children followed by adults and infants respectively in groundwater of kadava river basin nashik india wagh et al 2018 they also reported that the content of lead cadmium chromium and nickel contributed to the high amount of hi 3 6 statistical analysis multivariate statistical techniques including principal component cluster and correlation analyses were used to explain the data sets 3 6 1 chemometric method principal component analysis pca was used for predicting the heavy metal pollution and identification of the sources of the pollution franco uría et al 2009 varimax rotation was used to maximize coefficients which can be helpful in the identification of possible sources of pollution gotelli and ellison 2004 corresponding factor variable loading and the variance which were obtained from the factor analysis of variables fe mn zn pb cd cr ph ec tds are represented in table 4 component loadings have been categorized as weak moderate and strong loading with values of 0 50 0 30 0 75 0 50 and 0 75 respectively after varimax rotation three factors have been extracted with eigen value 1 which explained 33 59 pc1 21 76 pc2 and 12 99 pc3 of total variance respectively along with a cumulative contribution of 68 35 in the data matrix table 4 bhuiyan et al 2010 reported that the positive loadings might be the major reason of declining the groundwater quality while negative loadings suggested that the water quality remained unaffected with any of the involved parameters pc 1 possessed high positive loading of ec and tds along with moderate loading of pb and cd indicated the pollution of the study area might be due to the anthropogenic activities such as runoff from agriculture lands and discharge from domestic wastes table 4 some heavy metals do not find generally in groundwater and so their origin was from exterior sources and not from the geogenic sources moderate loading of cadmium cd might concern with the environment burning of fossil fuels cadmium is also used for the development of dyes and batteries in the metal plating and synthetic production giri and singh 2015 shan et al 2013 and vetrimurugan et al 2017 reported that fertilizers in irrigation areas are main external sources for cadmium cadmium may also be much prejudiced by agrochemicals phosphate fertilizers may contain heavy metals in small amount and their utilization for long time can cause the pollution of groundwater in agricultural areas nouri et al 2008 herojeet et al 2015 high amount of cd was confirmed by discharge of the industrial misuse as of paint frickel and elliott 2008 and human missus mann et al 2002 the moderate loading of pb might be involved in the study area due to manmade activities like as discharge of different type of industrial dirty water wu et al 2010 boateng et al 2015 the component 1 could be mostly geogenic industrial and anthropogenic sources factor 2 pc 2 described 21 76 of total variance and strong positive loading of cr fe and mn table 4 the higher positive loading of iron and manganese might be due to leaching of theses ions from rocks geogenic activities and oxidation processes induced by rain kawya et al 2019 the major sources of mn are leaching from local bedrock and solubility in water depends on anions and oxidation reduction potential mostly at neutral ph atsdr 2000 wagh et al 2018 furthermore strong positive loading of cr might be involved for its utilization in chemical industries manufacture of stain timber conservation lather tanning developed of various type of alloys and a lot of utility and produce alimonti et al 2000 atsdr 2000 johnson et al 2006 the amount of cr in groundwater is a good indicator of paint and waste of metal industries in this region arslan and ayyildiz 2015 hassan et al 2021 factor 3 pc 3 with higher positive loading of zn might be due to the nearby hazardous waste discharge land filled leachates municipal sewage water and this factor might have been governed by industrial activities liu et al 2003 besides zinc is a significant constituent of brass bronze die casting element other alloys rubber and paints usepa 1980 nriagu and pacyna 1988 the ph showed medium and weak negative loading relation with zn 0 542 and pb 0 346 which suggested that acidic condition might be responsible for the release of zn and pb into the groundwater hassan et al 2021 thus the factor 3 signifies the effect of ph on the disbanding and mobility of zn and pb in this region the bond between heavy metal load cd cr fe mn pb zn and ph values of water samples have been plotted in fig 10 ficklin et al 1992 caboi et al 1999 it is obvious from fig 9 that most of the groundwater samples fall in near low metal region and only two samples fall in near neutral high metal hassan et al 2021 reported that 42 groundwater samples collected from çarşamba coastal aquifer belonged to near neutral high metal category and 58 samples falls in near neutral metal category 3 6 2 cluster analysis cluster technique grouped fifty sampling points into three clusters table 5 fig 11 the pattern of each cluster was evaluated through principal components technique to verify the recognized pollution sources it is evident from dendrogram that the cluster c1was having maximum number of sites which had the highest ph and ec values pc1 also had strong loading of ec the cluster c2 echoes the impact of industrial and anthropogenic activities due to the presence of the highest amount of zn pb cd and tds which was indicating the natural water quality as pc2 this cluster personified normal quality of water the average value for all the analyzed parameters of c2 cluster were less than c3 cluster finally the third cluster c3 was described with individual tracers fe mn and cr at the higher amount which was equivalent to pc3 and suggested the industrial impact and geogenic activities of these location points fig 11 additionally the sampling points categorized in each cluster were also compared with categorization of hei to confirm the rank of contaminants cluster c1 samples total 38 samples containing ku5 to ku11 and ku13 to ku50 sampling points were categorized as less polluted and cluster c2 containing ku1 ku2 and ku12 was termed as moderate category cluster finally the last cluster c3 containing only two locations ku3 and ku4 was termed as higher pollutant category cluster a good correlation between the statistical skills and indexing approach was clarified in all analyzed datasets even though there are few variations among the outcome of ca and hei 3 6 3 correlation coefficients hamzaoui azaza et al 2011 observed that correlation technique is helpful in the interpretation of the relationships between the characteristic parameters of water according to seth et al 2014 the coefficient of correlations close to 1 suggests a good positive correlation between two variables while the correlation coefficients equal to 0 signifies no relationship between them botang et al 2015 reported that the heavy metals having the same source and same geochemical characteristics demonstrate the strong correlation between them pearson s correlation coefficient for 9 parameters matrix was utilized to identify the connection between different metals table 6 strong positive correlation occurred between ec and tds r 0 0 95 which might be due to the dissolved cations and anions correlation matrix indicated strong positive correlation between fe and mn 0 89 which suggested that both the metals have same source and similar characteristics botong et al 2015 positive significant correlation of mn with cd 0 43 and pb with cd 0 39 was also indicating the similar source of these metals in the correlation matrix negative correlation was observed for pb with ph 0 37 however pb was showing positive correlation with cd 0 39 and mn 0 28 which signified the same source of origin of these metals and this might occur due to anthropogenic activities salem et al 2022 additionally in the correlation matrix some insignificant positive and negative correlations were observed which suggested that the sources of these parameters are independent to each other hossain et al 2020 the correlation matrix generated from 8 parameters 6 heavy metals and 2 heavy metal indices indicated positive and significant correlation of hpi with cd 0 96 pb 0 50 cr 0 47 and mn 0 45 which suggested that cd and pb concentrations have contributed significantly to the heavy metal pollution indices table 7 higher amount cd can be due to petrochemical industries manufacturing of stain and different type of alloys the correlation among the heavy metal indices depicted significant correlation of hpi with hei r 0 49 along with strong correlation of hei with fe 0 94 mn 0 91 cr 0 55 and cd 0 41 table 7 from these correlations it was confirmed that all above indices can considerably be used to determine the heavy metal hazard in this region the outcome of correlation coefficients compared with the pca to identify the inter parameters interaction positive correlation between pb and cd also observed for pc1 a significant positive correlation of fe has been observed with mn 0 89 demonstrating a comparable source of pc2 it is pragmatic that there is good concurrence between pca ca and chemometric cm tools for grouping the contributory factors in the analyzed data sets and it was established that pb cd and cr were the major attributers to promote the health risk from groundwater 4 conclusion in the present study physicochemical parameters and heavy metals in 50 groundwater samples from udham singh nagar region of uttarakhand were detected and investigated by assessing heavy metal pollution indices health risk multivariate techniques and spatial distribution according to piper diagram the water type was ca mg hco3 type the mean content of the heavy metals followed the order fe zn mn cr pb cd the mean content of cr fe and mn exceeded the desirable limit in 7 8 and 9 water samples respectively the higher amount of these metal in this region might be due to unusual geochemical sources influence of sidkul petrochemical pant paper and sugar processing industries based on the bond between heavy metal load and ph value of water samples the results revealed that most of the water samples were clustered in natural low metal region the hei values suggested that only 5 samples namely ku2 ku3 ku4 ku5 and ku12 were highly polluted on the other hand m hpi values revealed that 6 groundwater samples ku3 ku4 ku5 were found to be of unacceptable category in most of the cases the overall impact of the hi was observed to be higher in children as compared to the adult population and the risk assessment model revealed that cr was the main significant contaminant for non carcinogenic concern in all age groups the health risk assessment model showed that total 14 groundwater samples were not fit for any age group of the population on the basis of principal component analysis factor 1 was observed to attribute to geochemical and anthropogenic activities while factor 2 attributed to lithogenic and anthropogenic activities furthermore factor 3 signified the impact of ph on the accumulation and mobility of zinc multivariate statistical results indicated good correlation between pca and hca which confirms lithogenic outputs such as enduring of rocks and minerals along with anthropogenic contribution emanating from effluents from industrial wastes in the study area this investigation is an integrative approach to assess the quality of groundwater which might be helpful and useful for managing health risk of the local population frequent monitoring of industrial effluents can be helpful in tracing out the points with elevated level of metal pollution before these pollutants reach consumers and threaten human health they should be mitigated by facilitating engineering solutions the spatial variation in the heavy metal content and heavy metal pollution indices was presented for the first time from the study area also this is the first documentation on the health risk assessment of heavy metals declaration of competing interest the authors

hazard index hi multivariate statistical analysis was also done to identify the sources of heavy metals and categorize groundwater quality concentration of fe mn and cr in 14 16 and 18 water samples exceeded the desirable limit piper diagram suggested that majority of groundwater samples were ca mg hco3 type hpi calculation indicated that no groundwater sample fall under high category of pollution hei and m hpi indicated that 90 and 82 groundwater samples were found suitable for potable purpose respectively while on the basis of m hpi 3 groundwater samples were found under the unacceptable category non carcinogenic hazards were observed which might be due to high chromium content according to principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca geogenic anthropogenic and industrial activities were responsible for groundwater pollution the values of hq for cr for both adult 13 samples and younger people 9 sampling sits surpass the unity hi values indicated that groundwater samples from 14 sites were not suitable for drinking purpose this is the first attempt of analyzing heavy metal pollution and health risk in udham singh nagar district of uttarakhand

availability all the data has been given in the mansucript 1 introduction urban groundwater is one of the world s biggest challenges due to rapid unexpected urbanization industrialization irrigation activities and usual geochemical activities mostly developing countries are directly generating pressure in this regard and distressing chemical activities of urban groundwater day by day hossain et al 2020 groundwater is a very important natural source which gives access to potable drinking water across the urban centres such as udham singh nagar of upper gangetic alluvial plains of northern india macdonald et al 2016 where groundwater is abstracted from shallow tube wells deeper hand pumps and deeper dug wells shallow aquifer systems are vulnerable to pollution and can cause risks to human health due to various contaminants lapworth et al 2018 when groundwater moves in different geogenic pathways it dissolves both inorganic and organic constituents backman et al 1998 these constituents and the micronutrients play a key role in human life if present in optimum amount however when dissolved constituents go beyond the amount needed for human beings it becomes toxic for health generally heavy metals and metallic constituents with comparatively high density could be hazardous even in low concentration if they accumulate within the body biswas et al 2017 dippong et al 2018 dippong et al 2020 roşca et al 2020 heavy metals are non disintegrable and once accumulated in human being system they can lead to the formation of neurological disorders symptoms such as nauseate high blood pressure sores in the mouth serious pulmonary infection skin lesions veins disease gangrene kidney disorders and even cancer lohani et al 2008 kavcar et al 2009 seth et al 2014 neogi et al 2018 boateng et al 2019 rahman et al 2020 ganiyu et al 2021 heavy metals are added in the groundwater from different types of natural factors such as geochemical activities mineral and chemical constitution of the aquifer rocks and manmade activities like discharge of industrial dirty water farming activities seepage into the groundwater supplies from polluted areas and geothermal waters adaikpoh et al 2005 leung and jiao 2006 united states environmental protection agency usepa described human health risk assessment as a procedure to approximate the environment as well as possibilities of unfavorable health impacts in humans being and exposure to the elements in polluted ecological media the health risk assessment hra helps in classifying the possible hazard sources

located in the south eastern part of uttarakhand state and falls in the terai region of kumaun division of uttarakhand latitude 28 51 and 29 22 n longitude 78 46 e and 80 09 e area 3055 sq km fig 1 the average annual rainfall in this area is 962 mm the climate fluctuates from sub humid and sub tropical to summer rainy and winter seasons maximum temperature goes up to 44 c in summer and minimum temperature during winter is between 1 and 4 c cgwb 2011 2 1 1 geology and hydro geological characteristics of the study area geology plays a significant role in maintaining the quality of groundwater of a particular region and therefore it becomes essential to have knowledge about the geology of the study area in the present investigation piedmont alluvial deposits signify the geology of this region the study area can be separated into two parts bhabar and terai bhabar division has elevated porosity and permeability which allow the precipitation to permeate in fairly plentiful amount in short period resulting in the formation of exceptional reservoirs for groundwater the lithology of bhabar leads in badly sorted unconsolidated sediments like rocks grains stones and cobbles deposit coarse to fine sand and clay ultimately the bhabar unit joints with the terai region in south where the aquifers are generally released from bhabar the water level depth declines steadily towards south lastly rising as the helix line water level depth in bhabar area was observed to be ranged from 2 1 to 5 3 mbgl and 1 3 to 3 8 mbgl in pre and post monsoon seasons of year 2015 respectively cgwb 2015 the terai region consists of large pieces of talus material mainly the lithology includes clays and silts with well sorted grainy substance like gravel sand irregular boulders cobbles and stone beds the sand and grate are the better portion of most important aquifers in this region the depth of water level ranged from 2 8 to 14 7 mbgl and 0 4 to 12 7 mbgl for the period of pre and post monsoon 2015 seasons respectively but the groundwater in deeper aquifers arise under artesian situation in the individual well the artesian flow may differ from just a drip at the surface from the limited aquifer to numerous hundred or in extraordinary cases a thousand gallons per minute cgwb 2015 2 1 2 land use pattern agriculture is the chief profession of the people of the study area and it is called the food bowl of uttarakhand owing to plenty of groundwater availability kharif and rabi are the two vital cropping systems the main crops of kharif are moong rice soyabean till and urad while the rabi crop includes barley gram masoor mustard sunflower and wheat during the field study it was observed that in the study area paddy was grown three times a year the udham singh nagar region is reported to have 279 455 ha land out of which 84 717 ha is the forests area in udham singh nagar region rabi and khariff crops are grown in 97 973 and 139 928 ha area respectively the sugarcane crop is also grown intensively as it is a cash crop cgwb 2011 now a days a major shift has taken place from agriculture to industrialization because of favourable conditions the study area has one of the biggest integrated industrial estate iie state industrial development corporation of uttarakhand limited sidcul and biotech park located at pantnagar the eldeco sidcul industrial park is located at sitarganj esip unprocessed harmful effluents from about 4000 manufacturing units might pollute the groundwater of the study area 2 2 sampling and analytical methods total 50 groundwater samples were collected from different locations 4 tube well 11 summer sevil and 35 hand pump in the polyethylene bottles capacity 250 ml during the month of june 2018 and were passed through a 0 45 millipore filtration unit with pore size of 0 45 μm to remove suspended sediments and acidified to maintain the ph 2 radojevic et al 1999 during the experiment the glasswares were appropriately hygienic and the reagents were of analytical grade in each location three samples were randomly collected and then assorted in situ a potable kit orion stara215 was used for measuring ph total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec of the groundwater samples ultrapure nitric acid has been used to acidify 50 ml of filtered water samples ph 2 and conserved them for fe mn zn pb cd and cr analysis later on the collected groundwater samples were analyzed by using the standard measures within 10 days of duration of sampling time major anions f no3 and so4 2 estimated by uv spectrophotometric shimadzu uv2550 method the content of cl and hco3 was determined by titration method sodium na and potassium k content was estimated by flame photometer labtronics lt671 method the amount of ca2 was determined by edta titration method while magnesium content was calculated by the subtracting content of ca2 from th apha 1995 the amount of iron fe manganese mn zinc zn lead pb cadmium cd and chromium cr were estimated by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas thermofisharies a 5 the precision of the investigation was examined by using the blank standard reference nist 1640a and 1643e certified water reference solutions of national institute of standards and technology nist usa were used to examine the he accuracy of the methods calibration status of the aas was regularly monitored by using calibration blank and standard solutions after every 10 samples for all the tested metals matrix interfering blank was 1 the precision achieved in all determinants was greater than 5 relative standard deviation rsd the water class based upon ph and heavy metal content was determined using ficlin caboi method ficklin et al 1992 caboi et al 1999 2 3 hydrogeochemical characterization of groundwater samples the piper and gibbs diagrams were prepared along with the calculation of chloro alkaline indices to evaluate the hydrogeochemical properties of the ground water samples 2 3 1 piper diagram piper 1944 described the piper trilinear diagram as one of the significant features that have been used to understand the hydrogeochemical characteristics of water samples ramesh and thirumangai 2014 reported that this diagram indicates the similarity and dissimilarity within the water samples the diagram was prepared by using aquachem software free version 2 3 2 gibbs diagram precipitation chemistry gibbs in 1970 discussed the mechanism of controlling the composition of dissolved salts cations and anions in water samples a diagram has been proposed by him in which ratio of major cations and anions are plotted as a function of tds this diagram describes three dominant mechanisms that control the composition of cations and anions in water system evaporation weathering and precipitation in the present study gibbs diagrams were prepared by plotting na k na k ca2 and cl cl hco3 against tds 2 3 3 chloro alkaline indices cai the ion exchange practice can be implicit by chloro alkaline indices cai which is also known as schoeller index schoeller 1977 and described by cai i cl na k cl cai ii cl na k so4 2 hco3 no3 2 4 pollution assessment indices to compare contamination load in each sample area the heavy metal pollution index hpi heavy metal evaluation index hei modified heavy metal pollution index m hpi hq hazardous quotient and hi hazardous index were calculated 2 4 1 heavy metal pollution index hpi hpi technique signifies the entire quality of water in regard of heavy metals on the basis of weighted quality mean method calculation and can be done following steps first by creating a grading cycle for individual parameter giving weightage and in the next step the pollutant parameter was selected on which the index was dependent the rating system is an illogical value that lies between 0 and 1 and it depends on the significance of each water quality deliberation in a relative way and can be represented by the value in reverse proportional to the suggestive standard of the respective parameter mohan et al 1996 according to prasad and bose 2001 unit weightage wi values are in reverse proportional to the suggestive standard values si of the corresponding parameters reddy 1995 reported that the hpi value of the potable water should be 100 but edet and offiong 2002 had modified it into three categories low medium and high with hpi of 15 15 30 and 30 respectively furthermore on the other hand hossain et al 2020 suggested the categories hpi 100 to be critical the formula for hpi suggested by mohan et al 1996 is as follows 1 h p i i 1 n w i s i i 1 n w i in the above equation wi unit weight of the nth parameter n number of parameters and si sub index of ith parameter which was evaluated by the following formula 2 s i i 1 n o i d i m i d i x 100 where oi observed value of heavy metal of ith parameter di desirable limit bis 2012 and mi maximum allowable value bis 2012 wi was calculated by 1 di 2 4 2 heavy metal evaluation index hei hei was determined utilizing maximum allowable concentration mac given by edet and offiong 2002 the hei was evaluated by the following formula 3 h e i i 1 n h e i i in the above equation heii is the pollution index which was evaluated by using the following formula 4 h e i o i m a c i maci maximum allowable concentration of ith parameter for who 2011 guidelines and oi observed value of the particular heavy metal according to edet and offiong 2002 the criteria of hei for each sample are low hei 1 66 medium hei 1 66 3 32 high hei 3 32 2 4 3 modified heavy metal pollution index m hpi for calculating both hpi and hei wither highest desirable concentration or maximum permissible limit by bis 2012 and who 2011 is required sometimes hpi is calculated using bis standards where only lower limit of the metals are given and there is no relaxation towards the upper limit additionally hpi classification is based upon the heavy metal content in the water sample as very good good and excellent this system is not helping in decision making acceptable or unacceptable about water quality tariq et al 2008 and maskoomi et al 2020 have improved the heavy metal pollution indices hpi and hei and evaluated new hpi termed as m hpi modified heavy metal pollution index which is helpful in deciding the water quality in terms of its level of potability m hpi was evaluated using maximum allowable concentration chaturvedi et al 2018 suppose n is the total number of heavy metals then m hpi can be calculated using the following formula 5 m h p i i 1 n m h p i i in equation 5 m hpii corresponds to the ith heavy metal and was evaluated using the following formula 6 m h p i i ᾠ i s i where ᾠi is the relative weight of factors and was calculated by using equation 7 7 ᾠ w i i 1 n w i 8 w i 1 m i 9 s i o i d i d i in the above mentioned equation oi observed concentration and di is the desirable concentration with reference to bis 2012 standards table 1 if oi di m hpii will have a negative value negative index ni and if oi di m hpii will have a positive value positive index pi to evaluate m hpi the pi and ni added individually to get compounded values of pi and ni positive index showed the involvement of those heavy metal ions to the quality of groundwater which are present beyond the maximum desired limit while negative index represented the involvement of metal ions that beyond the desirable limit the upper limit ul was also calculated using the following formula 10 u l i 1 n m i l i l i thus the water quality of the groundwater samples was decided by the values of the pair of calculated indices pi and ni if pi 0 0 ni 1 water quality is excellent if ul pi 0 0 ni 1 water quality is very good to good and if pi ul ni 0 water quality is unacceptable 2 5 statistical analysis the statistical software spss 16 0 was used for statistical analysis including principal component and cluster analysis 2 5 1 principal component analysis pca pca is a controlling model and appreciation techniques that efforts to describe the variance of a huge dataset and convert into a lesser dataset of self determining variables simeonov et al 2003 pca methods remove the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the covariance matrix of creative dataset the principal components pcs are the uncorrelated orthogonal variables achieved with means of increasing the inventive correlated datasets with the eigenvector which is a list of coefficients loadings or weightings thus the pcs are weighted linear combinations of the original variables the pca technique affords some knowledge on the most important parameters which explain the complete data set as affording the decline data by a least defeat of inventive knowledge vega et al 1998 the factor analysis additionally decreases the involvement of fewer major datasets created from pca along with the innovative group of datasets generated from pca and the innovative group of datasets known as varifactors vf is removed during rotating axis distinct by pca vega et al 1998 pca with varimax rotation of identical factor loadings was done for maximizing the difference among the datasets under every condition and those pcs with eigen value 1 were maintained singh et al 2004 2 5 2 cluster analysis ca according to shrestha and kazama 2007 the technique of ca is used to allocate a set of matter converted into group so that the objects in the one group are similar to each other further than to those in different cluster two types of cluster techniques have been identified q and r mode respectively in r mode dendrogram is produced which shows similarity while in q mode it is difficult to separate clusters magesh et al 2013 hierarchical agglomerative clustering hac is commonly used technique which completely gives natural relationship between a sample and different parameter and is represented by dendrogram in the present research hierarchical cluster analysis was applied using ward s method by spss 16 0 to check the variability among different water parameters 2 6 risk analysis on human health according to usepa 2004 and wu et al 2010 human being can be exposed to the metals via three pathways namely inhalation dermal route or direct ingestion among these pathways ingestion is the main pathway of exposure of metals through drinking water the quantity of metals received through the ingestion pathway was evaluated by applying three equation 11 which was helpful in analyzing the risk of metal on human health giri and singh 2015 11 a d d o i x i r x e f x e d b w x a t add average daily dose in μg kg day oi observed concentration of metals in μg l ir ingestion rate in l day 1 l day for child 1 48 m3 year adult giri et al 2020 ef exposure frequency in days year 350 days ed exposure duration in years 6 years for child and 24 years for adult bw body weight in kg 16 3 kg for child 52 kg for adult icmr 2009 and at averaging time in days usepa 2011 at ed x 365 days non carcinogenic risk usepa 2011 2 6 1 hazard quotient hq hazard quotient hq was determined by comparing contact or regular ingestion of pollutants from revelation path of intake with the subsequent reference dose rfd using equation 12 if hq 1 non carcinogenic effects might be there 12 h a z a r d q u o t i e n t a d d r f d where rfd was originated from risk based concentration table of usepa 1993 another index namely hazard index hi was also evaluated by adding all the determined hazard quotient hq values equation 13 for assessing the risk due to the presence of metals in the potable water hi value greater than 1 suggested possibilities of the adverse effect of the heavy metals on human health usepa 1989 2004 13 h i i 1 n h q i where hqi hazard quotient of each metal and n is 6 for total number of trace elements 2 7 spatial distribution in current years the groundwater quality assessment and monitoring on a regular basis has been carried out by using is geographic information system gis tool additional with the idw inverse distance weighted interpolation method and has confirmed itself as a powerful technique for determining and analyzing spatial information of water resources venkateswaran et al 2012 magesh and elango 2019 kamble et al 2020 ram et al 2021 these techniques efficiently reasonable and time efficient methods for converting large data sets to create different spatial allocation maps and protrusion revealing style relatives and the possible sources of contaminants or pollutants 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of the groundwater samples results obtained from physicochemical and heavy metal analysis are represented in table 1 these results were compared with the drinking water quality norms suggested by bis 2012 the values of ph found in the range of 7 57 8 61 with an average value 8 18 which indicated slightly alkaline nature of the tested water samples the result also suggested that 10 groundwater samples showed value of ph more than the bis standard bis 2012 probable sources of higher ph in this region might be bicarbonate and carbonate ions sappa et al 2014 reported that these ions are produced during hydrothermal reactions because of the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide the values of ec found between 353 and 1274 μs cm 1 with an average value 617 μs cm 1 the ec value is a good indicator of total salinity or total amount of dissolved solids in water and assist to evaluate the water fit for potable and irrigation purposes tds values varied between 229 and 824 mg l with a mean value of 401 mg l all groundwater samples had tds value less than 1000 mg l the order of ionic species in the groundwater samples was hco3 ca2 cl so4 2 mg2 na no3 k f it is well predicted that within a water sample the number of cations should balance the number of anions charge balance error based upon the content of cations and anions was reported to be within the standard limit of 5 3 2 hydrogeochemical characteristics 3 2 1 piper diagram in this diagram major cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions hco3 co3 2 cl and so4 2 are placed in the two basal triangle fig 2 the content of major cations and anions are described as meq l the central part of this diagram indicates the presence of both cations and anions in the present study the water samples were grouped into two categories mg type and no dominant type in cation facies while in anion facies the water was hco3 and cl and no dominant type according to piper s diagram the hydrochemical facies were in the order of ca mg hco3 ca cl ca so4 which suggested that majority of groundwater samples were ca mg hco3 type in the groundwater samples ca2 ion could be mainly derived through dissolution of precipitates such as caco3 and ca hco3 2 mg hco3 2 for the period of recharge these results indicated that the groundwater consisted of combination of various alkaline earth metals with temporary hardness kumar and singh 2015 this type of facies is also fit for irrigation purpose kundu and nag 2018 the hydrochemical facies of ca cl water type suggests mineral dissolution due to interaction between rock and water among adequate recharge of fresh water singh et al 2012 srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 rezaei et al 2019 3 2 2 gibbs diagram precipitation chemistry the chemical characteristics of groundwater are mostly controlled by different type of factors as well as infiltrating rainwater characteristics geological processes and mineral composition of rocks and manmade activities fig 3 suggested that in all sampling locations weathering was the dominant source of dissolved solids in the groundwater samples rather than evaporation or precipitation 3 2 3 cholro alkaline index cai the chloro alkaline index may be positive or negative which depends upon the replacement of na and k present in water with mg2 and ca2 in rock soil or vice versa the positive value of index suggests the replacement of na and k in water with ca2 and mg2 in rock soil and this is known as base exchange phenomenon negative value of the ratio indicates chloro alkaline disequilibrium and the reaction termed as cation anion exchange reaction in udham singh nager region 46 of the groundwater samples have positive index which indicated base exchange reaction on the other hand 54 of the samples were having negative value of the ratio which signified chloro alkaline disequilibrium cation anion exchange reaction 3 3 contamination scenario of heavy metals in the groundwater samples of the collection sites in the study area the mean content of heavy metals followed the descending order fe zn mn cr pb cd in the groundwater samples the amount of fe mn and cr were found above the prescribed by bis 2012 and who 2011 while the content of zn pb and cd was found within the limit iron fe is an important constituent of hemoglobin red blood cells and myoglobin muscle cells that play a main role in moving oxygen from lungs to the tissues according to usepa 1993 utilization of high amount of iron makes the food unpleasant and infusion processing and moreover causes blemishes in laundry and apparatus iron is one of the mainly abundant metals found in earth crust wagh et al 2018 reported that iron and manganese play a significant role in regulation of the biochemical cycles in flora and fauna weathering and release of liquid industrialized untreated waste water are supposed to be the major sources of iron in the groundwater under flooding situation fe bearing natural resources enhance the amount of soluble iron in groundwater white et al 1991 the content of iron in the study area varied between 1 60 and 1680 00 ppb with an average value 153 06 ppb table 1 fig 4 according to bis 10 500 2012 desirable limit of iron in potable water is 300 ppb the amount of iron in the study area for 14 of the groundwater samples was found to be beyond the desirable limit reflecting the effect of irrigation and domestic activities as probable sources wagh et al 2018 reported that the higher fe content changes the taste and appearance of water and also supports the growth of iron bacteria continuous utilization of excess amount of iron may causes drowsiness weight loss joint pains and eventually cardiovascular syndrome liver diseases sugar problem and hemosiderosis rajappa et al 2010 uscdc 2011 manganese mn is a vital element which is generally found with iron usually it is found within surface subsurface as well as in soil anthropogenic activities are also major source of manganese in water the concentration of manganese varied from 1 00 to 675 00 ppb with an average value of 72 88 ppb in the study area according to the bis 2012 the desirable limit for manganese is 100 ppb and maximum permissible limit in potable water is 300 ppb table 1 fig 4 according to the interpreted results of the study area five groundwater samples were found to have mn content beyond the desirable limit and three groundwater samples had higher amount of mn than its standard limit the higher amount of mn in groundwater might be due to the natural weathering of manganese bearing minerals atmospheric deposition leaching from plant tissues and industrial effluents stokes et al 1988 in the study area the main resources of manganese might be the release of the industrial effluent and urban activities manganese is significant for human being and its insufficiency might inhibit growth skeletal defects and reproductive abnormalities whereas consumption of higher amount of mn might responsible for a syndrome known as mangnisms which may cause weakness of muscles watts 1990 homoncik et al 2010 observed that high amount of mn in potable water can cause the neurological problems for adults higher concentration of cr in some samples might be owing to anthropogenic sources such as industrial wastes from automobile steel and paint related industries it is a widely reported contaminant around tanning industries and might cause allergic dermatitis diseases brindha and elango 2012 chromium iii is essential for human body as it regulates insulin discharge that assists to sustain normal glucose level in the human body it is also an important trace element for flora and fauna it is widely used in metal alloys and cement colour paints and paper industry generally the amount of chromium in potable water is low and in the form of hexa chromium it becomes harmful when taken in high amount according to hyodo et al 1980 air borne chromium trioxide is harmful to the skin and causes respiratory problem ultimately long term uptake of chromium may harm moving and sensor system of the animals pandey et al 2010 the desirable limit for chromium according to bis10500 2012 is 50 ppb in the present study the amount of chromium varied between 0 00 and 72 00 ppb with the average value of 18 30 ppb which indicated that 16 groundwater samples had higher amount of cr than its desirable limit table 1 fig 4 islam and mostafa 2021 reported that utilization of excessive chromium content in drinking water may cause of asthma cold and cough breathing problem breathless damage kidney anemia irritation and sore zinc zn is a necessary metal for controlling normal metabolic activities and its deficiency leads to impeded development of body it is mainly found in all igneous rocks and in the present research the mean content of zn varied from 1 00 to 855 55 ppb with an average value 114 22 ppb table 1 fig 4 according to the bis 10500 2012 the permissible limit and desirable limit of zn is 15 000 ppb and 5000 ppb respectively in the study area the content of zinc of all the groundwater samples was beyond the desirable limit the concentration of lead pb varied between 3 12 ppb and 5 32 ppb with an average of 4 06 ppb table 1 fig 3 according to the bis 10500 2012 recommended desirable limit of lead is 10 ppb which indicated that all groundwater samples found within the standard limit lead is an extremely toxic heavy metal still in little amounts lead to the delay physical and mental growth in infants as well as the causes hypertension problem in adults usepa 2004 cadmium cd is not however confirmed to be of biological important and it is assumed to cause renal arterial and high blood pressure vetrimurugan et al 2017 reported that high amount of cd and hexavalent chromium cr causes kidney and liver problems in adults the concentration of cadmium in the groundwater samples of the study area varied from 1 22 to 2 80 ppb with an average value of 1 82 ppb table 1 fig 4 and was observed to be within the desirable limit of 3 ppb bis 2012 the heavy metal content of cd cr fe mn pb and zn in each sample was plotted for better representation and understanding fig 4 in 66 of water samples fe and mn were significantly contributing to metal load out of 50 water samples 38 were dominated by cr and zn confirming contribution from industrial effluents these samples have been collected from adjacent industrial units from the perusal of fig 4 the concentration of fe mn and cr was appeared to be much dominant in the areas of nagla khurpia bara kathangri and bhagora of rudrapur block further it was also observed that the zn also predominantly manifested at dhakiakalan chaiti more areas of kashipur block and rudrapur block respectively and remaining heavy metal concentration seemed to be within the limits in the study area various industries like textile automobile paper petrochemical etc are using heavy metals for their product development and discharge waste contaminated with heavy metals in environment and water bodies from water bodies it disseminates to soil and groundwater heavy metal contamination in soil and groundwater directly or indirectly impacts the plants animals insects and microorganisms limited studies were performed in udham singh nagar industrial area to understand the heavy metal chemistry in groundwater and observed that fe mn and zn contamination was constantly increased at different time periods during pre monsoon season lead concentration was constant in 2010 and 2011 seth et al 2014 and increased in the year 2016 singh et al 2022 fig 5 in the present investigation where the samples were collected in 2018 the content of these three metals were almost similar to that of 2010 and 2011 study cadmium content was constant in all the studied years but cr concentration was found to increase year by year which might be due to textile and paper industries in the nearby areas during 2016 to 2022 no study was reported in this area which makes this study important and unique to understand the trend of heavy mental contamination in ground water and encourage researchers to do surveillance study in this industrial area fig 5 comparison of heavy metal content in the water bodies near sidkul industries uttarakhand has been summarized in table 2 spatial variation of heavy metals is shown in fig 6 a fig 6 b and c kriging method was utilized for the spatial distribution of heavy metals kriging algorithm presumes that the direction or distance between collection sites considers a spatial correlation which can be utilized to elucidate differences in the surface elumalai et al 2017a 2017b iron 14 of groundwater samples manganese and chromium content was observed to be relatively higher in southern rudrapur and sitargunj blocks and south eastern region of the study area which might attributed to geogenic and anthropogenic sources such as industrial effluents from various industries and agricultural run off wagh et al 2018 singh et al 2022 the natural sources of fe and mn are weathering of fe and mn bearing minerals and rocks the amount of iron generally increased by human made sources like as metal processing iron and wastes from steel industries paper mill and discharge of industrial and sewage dirty water parween et al 2021 singh et al 2022 3 4 water pollution evaluation indices water pollution indices hpi hei and m hpi were calculated by following the methods developed by edet and offiong 2002 the concentrations of fe mn zn pb cd and cr were used for evaluating hpi hei and m hpi values bis 2012 limits were used for determining hpi and m hpi values while who 2011 standards were used for hei calculations the value of upper limit ul for this set of heavy metals was work out to be 0 0603 only mn and zn were used to determine ul as fe pb cd and cr came under non relaxable category for assessing the pollution level of heavy metals mean values approach has been practiced prasanna et al 2012 singh et al 2017b calculated values of water pollution indices are presented in table 3 the analytical results showed that 60 of hpi values and 66 hei values were lower than the corresponding mean value 3 4 1 heavy metal pollution index hpi hpi is one of the appropriate methods for calculating collective effect of heavy metals present in the groundwater samples the amount of evaluated hpi was compared with the critical amount of hpi 100 which is thought to be dangerous yankey et al 2013 singh and kamal 2017 hossain et al 2020 in the present study area hpi values ranged between 42 49 and 84 01 with an average value of 54 15 as per the categorization of hpi the results indicated that 58 samples found to be of low pollution category and 42 samples found under medium pollution category table 3 there was no sample found in higher category yankey et al 2013 from tarkara mining area ghana reported that the amount of hpi of the groundwater samples was less than the critical amount and only one sampling location was found to have critical amount of hpi 102 97 in the present study the hpi value was observed to be less than the critical amount of hpi 100 singh and kumar 2017 and kumar et al 2020 reported that 53 and 40 of sampling locations of ramgarh area jharkhand india were having lower and medium hpi values and only 7 samples found under higher category the amount of hpi was observed to be less than the critical index value 100 in the groundwater samples collected from bangladesh hossain et al 2020 3 4 2 heavy metal evaluation index hei according to mean value approach of hei water can be classified into three categories lower pollution hei 1 66 medium pollution hei 1 66 3 32 and higher pollution hei 3 32 edet and offiong 2002 in this study the values of hei varied between 0 87 and 2 84 with an average value of 1 66 which suggested that 46 samples found to fall under lower pollution category the 44 samples belonged to the medium category of pollution whereas remaining 10 samples were found in higher category table 3 the spatial distribution map of hpi revealed that central part small part of southern and south western part was dominant and as per the values of hei small part of southern side of the study area had medium contamination fig 7 fig 8 rezaei et al 2019 reported that 52 43 and 17 samples found under lower medium and highly polluted category respectively kumar et al 2020 have used the categorization as low 0 10 medium 10 20 and higher more than 20 further they observed that 60 and 40 samples were found in lower and medium pollution category respectively according to the hpi and hei values the best water samples were ku23 and ku50 respectively as per hpi the worst water sample in the selected region were ku2 khurpia and ku3 bara on the other hand as per hei values ku3 bara and ku4 kathangari were the worst water samples 3 4 3 modified heavy metal pollution index m hpi the evaluated values of m hpi were evaluated for each sampling location table 3 it was noted that out of a total of 50 groundwater samples only 72 samples categorized as excellent category and remaining sampling points under very good good to unacceptable category the pi values ranged between 0 and 0 025 for nine groundwater samples 18 suggesting very good quality and 2 samples were of good quality the remaining 3 groundwater samples were having the range of pi values between 0 091 and 1 41 suggesting that these water samples were unfit for potable purpose chromium being a non relaxable parameter 18 samples might consider to be unsuitable for drinking purpose presence of higher amount of cr in groundwater is reported by many researchers tariq et al 2008 ullah et al 2009 herojeet et al 2015 adimalla et al 2018 wagh et al 2018 islam and mostafa 2021 as per m hpi value the best water samples were ku40 and ku7 as the amount of pi 0 and ni was very low ku2 ku3 and ku4 were the worst water samples in the study area on the basis of m hpi values in the current study the concentration of three heavy metals fe mn cr found more than their standard limits thus making the value of pi always positive and ni 1 fig 9 demonstrates the spatial distribution map of m hpi generally the southern and some part of south eastern site of the pantnagar region was unfit for drinking purpose and in southern eastern and some part of south western part of the study area found under good category literature showed that 52 in pre and 58 in the post monsoon season were having the amount of pi values from 0 to 0 1 suggesting very good water quality chaturwadi et al 2018 according rezaei et al 2019 95 groundwater samples were having pi values from 0 to 0 1 suggesting very good water quality 3 5 health risk assessment 3 5 1 hazard quotient hq the average hq values of fe mn zn pb cd and cr for all the groundwater samples were determined to be 0 0162 0 0563 0 044 0 055 0 17 0 456 respectively for the grown person population and 0 014 0 033 0 024 0 074 0 231 and 0 39 respectively for the child population table 3 the average values of all trace elements found less than 1 which indicated that these metals created little hazard independently it was found to be the maximum for sampling locations of ku36 for both child and younger populations the value of hq for cr at all sampling locations varied in between 0 and 1 794 for adult population and 0 to 1 53 for younger population which indicated that cr might cause adverse impact on the local population at some sampling points along with some non carcinogenic concern the amount of hq of chromium was found to be high at ku2 ku3 ku4 ku8 ku12 ku14 ku16 ku21 ku36 ku38 ku39 and ku41 sampling points for adult population on the other hand for younger population it was observed high in ku3 ku4 ku8 ku12 ku16 ku21 ku36 ku 38 and ku39 which indicated that cr may cause unfavorable fitness impacts at these sampling sites and is a probable non carcinogenic concern 3 5 2 hazard index hi the non carcinogenic risk of heavy metal was given with the aid of hi values hi 1 was taken as safe while hi 1 was taken as hazard that can be related to a single metal or more metals vetrimurugan et al 2017 neogi et al 2018 in the study area the values of hi varied between 0 0306 and 4 98 average 0 79 and from 0 271 to 2 220 average 0 76 for the adult and younger populations respectively table 3 in adult population high hi 1 values were observed for ku2 ku3 ku4 ku8 ku12 ku14 ku15 ku16 ku21 ku25 ku36 ku37 ku38 ku39 and ku41 sampling sites while the sampling locations ku2 ku3 ku4 ku8 ku12 ku14 ku16 ku21 ku25 ku36 ku37 ku38 ku39 ku41 and ku44 for child population were observed to have higher hi value the amount of hi 1 revealed that total 14 samples namely khurpia ku2 bara ku3 kathangari ku4 dungerpur ku8 jhankat ku12 chakkarpur ku14 deori ku16 barhani ku21 dalpura ku25 dhakia kalan ku36 bhimnagar ku37 chandpur ku38 chatty more ku39 and hempur kechari ku41 were not safe for any age group of population table 3 thus the values of hi for elder and younger people of 28 sampling points of udham singh nagar region were demonstrating the hazardous health effect these sampling points have unusual geological activities and are under the influence of active sidcul textile and petrochemicals cement and sugar process industries additionally the potential hazardous appraisal revealed that cr was the most important element contaminant in the groundwater of udham singh nagar region uttarakhand the above health risk assessment study indicated that the adult population could be suffered more than the younger population through the metal contamination through the oral route chromium is frequently observed as one of the smallest amount poisonous element and there are numerous case reports of oral utilization of high amount of chromium have found to cause lung infections kidney failure intestinal hemorrhage and damage of liver mohammed et al 2011 rahaman et al 2020 vijaykumar et al 2021 giri and singh 2015 reported that the non carcinogenic hazards occur due to direct ingestion of groundwater and was found to be very high and categorized as adults child they also observed that manganese cobalt and arsenic were highly involved in chronic health hazard and the metals such as cadmium copper and selenium were the least contributed ions towards adult and child population neogi et al 2018 found that the amount of hq for fe mn ni and al was more than the standard limit for both adults and children according to hossain et al 2020 the amount of hi was observed to be greater than the standard limit near sugar mill region for any age group of population the hi values were greater than the standard limit in children followed by adults and infants respectively in groundwater of kadava river basin nashik india wagh et al 2018 they also reported that the content of lead cadmium chromium and nickel contributed to the high amount of hi 3 6 statistical analysis multivariate statistical techniques including principal component cluster and correlation analyses were used to explain the data sets 3 6 1 chemometric method principal component analysis pca was used for predicting the heavy metal pollution and identification of the sources of the pollution franco uría et al 2009 varimax rotation was used to maximize coefficients which can be helpful in the identification of possible sources of pollution gotelli and ellison 2004 corresponding factor variable loading and the variance which were obtained from the factor analysis of variables fe mn zn pb cd cr ph ec tds are represented in table 4 component loadings have been categorized as weak moderate and strong loading with values of 0 50 0 30 0 75 0 50 and 0 75 respectively after varimax rotation three factors have been extracted with eigen value 1 which explained 33 59 pc1 21 76 pc2 and 12 99 pc3 of total variance respectively along with a cumulative contribution of 68 35 in the data matrix table 4 bhuiyan et al 2010 reported that the positive loadings might be the major reason of declining the groundwater quality while negative loadings suggested that the water quality remained unaffected with any of the involved parameters pc 1 possessed high positive loading of ec and tds along with moderate loading of pb and cd indicated the pollution of the study area might be due to the anthropogenic activities such as runoff from agriculture lands and discharge from domestic wastes table 4 some heavy metals do not find generally in groundwater and so their origin was from exterior sources and not from the geogenic sources moderate loading of cadmium cd might concern with the environment burning of fossil fuels cadmium is also used for the development of dyes and batteries in the metal plating and synthetic production giri and singh 2015 shan et al 2013 and vetrimurugan et al 2017 reported that fertilizers in irrigation areas are main external sources for cadmium cadmium may also be much prejudiced by agrochemicals phosphate fertilizers may contain heavy metals in small amount and their utilization for long time can cause the pollution of groundwater in agricultural areas nouri et al 2008 herojeet et al 2015 high amount of cd was confirmed by discharge of the industrial misuse as of paint frickel and elliott 2008 and human missus mann et al 2002 the moderate loading of pb might be involved in the study area due to manmade activities like as discharge of different type of industrial dirty water wu et al 2010 boateng et al 2015 the component 1 could be mostly geogenic industrial and anthropogenic sources factor 2 pc 2 described 21 76 of total variance and strong positive loading of cr fe and mn table 4 the higher positive loading of iron and manganese might be due to leaching of theses ions from rocks geogenic activities and oxidation processes induced by rain kawya et al 2019 the major sources of mn are leaching from local bedrock and solubility in water depends on anions and oxidation reduction potential mostly at neutral ph atsdr 2000 wagh et al 2018 furthermore strong positive loading of cr might be involved for its utilization in chemical industries manufacture of stain timber conservation lather tanning developed of various type of alloys and a lot of utility and produce alimonti et al 2000 atsdr 2000 johnson et al 2006 the amount of cr in groundwater is a good indicator of paint and waste of metal industries in this region arslan and ayyildiz 2015 hassan et al 2021 factor 3 pc 3 with higher positive loading of zn might be due to the nearby hazardous waste discharge land filled leachates municipal sewage water and this factor might have been governed by industrial activities liu et al 2003 besides zinc is a significant constituent of brass bronze die casting element other alloys rubber and paints usepa 1980 nriagu and pacyna 1988 the ph showed medium and weak negative loading relation with zn 0 542 and pb 0 346 which suggested that acidic condition might be responsible for the release of zn and pb into the groundwater hassan et al 2021 thus the factor 3 signifies the effect of ph on the disbanding and mobility of zn and pb in this region the bond between heavy metal load cd cr fe mn pb zn and ph values of water samples have been plotted in fig 10 ficklin et al 1992 caboi et al 1999 it is obvious from fig 9 that most of the groundwater samples fall in near low metal region and only two samples fall in near neutral high metal hassan et al 2021 reported that 42 groundwater samples collected from çarşamba coastal aquifer belonged to near neutral high metal category and 58 samples falls in near neutral metal category 3 6 2 cluster analysis cluster technique grouped fifty sampling points into three clusters table 5 fig 11 the pattern of each cluster was evaluated through principal components technique to verify the recognized pollution sources it is evident from dendrogram that the cluster c1was having maximum number of sites which had the highest ph and ec values pc1 also had strong loading of ec the cluster c2 echoes the impact of industrial and anthropogenic activities due to the presence of the highest amount of zn pb cd and tds which was indicating the natural water quality as pc2 this cluster personified normal quality of water the average value for all the analyzed parameters of c2 cluster were less than c3 cluster finally the third cluster c3 was described with individual tracers fe mn and cr at the higher amount which was equivalent to pc3 and suggested the industrial impact and geogenic activities of these location points fig 11 additionally the sampling points categorized in each cluster were also compared with categorization of hei to confirm the rank of contaminants cluster c1 samples total 38 samples containing ku5 to ku11 and ku13 to ku50 sampling points were categorized as less polluted and cluster c2 containing ku1 ku2 and ku12 was termed as moderate category cluster finally the last cluster c3 containing only two locations ku3 and ku4 was termed as higher pollutant category cluster a good correlation between the statistical skills and indexing approach was clarified in all analyzed datasets even though there are few variations among the outcome of ca and hei 3 6 3 correlation coefficients hamzaoui azaza et al 2011 observed that correlation technique is helpful in the interpretation of the relationships between the characteristic parameters of water according to seth et al 2014 the coefficient of correlations close to 1 suggests a good positive correlation between two variables while the correlation coefficients equal to 0 signifies no relationship between them botang et al 2015 reported that the heavy metals having the same source and same geochemical characteristics demonstrate the strong correlation between them pearson s correlation coefficient for 9 parameters matrix was utilized to identify the connection between different metals table 6 strong positive correlation occurred between ec and tds r 0 0 95 which might be due to the dissolved cations and anions correlation matrix indicated strong positive correlation between fe and mn 0 89 which suggested that both the metals have same source and similar characteristics botong et al 2015 positive significant correlation of mn with cd 0 43 and pb with cd 0 39 was also indicating the similar source of these metals in the correlation matrix negative correlation was observed for pb with ph 0 37 however pb was showing positive correlation with cd 0 39 and mn 0 28 which signified the same source of origin of these metals and this might occur due to anthropogenic activities salem et al 2022 additionally in the correlation matrix some insignificant positive and negative correlations were observed which suggested that the sources of these parameters are independent to each other hossain et al 2020 the correlation matrix generated from 8 parameters 6 heavy metals and 2 heavy metal indices indicated positive and significant correlation of hpi with cd 0 96 pb 0 50 cr 0 47 and mn 0 45 which suggested that cd and pb concentrations have contributed significantly to the heavy metal pollution indices table 7 higher amount cd can be due to petrochemical industries manufacturing of stain and different type of alloys the correlation among the heavy metal indices depicted significant correlation of hpi with hei r 0 49 along with strong correlation of hei with fe 0 94 mn 0 91 cr 0 55 and cd 0 41 table 7 from these correlations it was confirmed that all above indices can considerably be used to determine the heavy metal hazard in this region the outcome of correlation coefficients compared with the pca to identify the inter parameters interaction positive correlation between pb and cd also observed for pc1 a significant positive correlation of fe has been observed with mn 0 89 demonstrating a comparable source of pc2 it is pragmatic that there is good concurrence between pca ca and chemometric cm tools for grouping the contributory factors in the analyzed data sets and it was established that pb cd and cr were the major attributers to promote the health risk from groundwater 4 conclusion in the present study physicochemical parameters and heavy metals in 50 groundwater samples from udham singh nagar region of uttarakhand were detected and investigated by assessing heavy metal pollution indices health risk multivariate techniques and spatial distribution according to piper diagram the water type was ca mg hco3 type the mean content of the heavy metals followed the order fe zn mn cr pb cd the mean content of cr fe and mn exceeded the desirable limit in 7 8 and 9 water samples respectively the higher amount of these metal in this region might be due to unusual geochemical sources influence of sidkul petrochemical pant paper and sugar processing industries based on the bond between heavy metal load and ph value of water samples the results revealed that most of the water samples were clustered in natural low metal region the hei values suggested that only 5 samples namely ku2 ku3 ku4 ku5 and ku12 were highly polluted on the other hand m hpi values revealed that 6 groundwater samples ku3 ku4 ku5 were found to be of unacceptable category in most of the cases the overall impact of the hi was observed to be higher in children as compared to the adult population and the risk assessment model revealed that cr was the main significant contaminant for non carcinogenic concern in all age groups the health risk assessment model showed that total 14 groundwater samples were not fit for any age group of the population on the basis of principal component analysis factor 1 was observed to attribute to geochemical and anthropogenic activities while factor 2 attributed to lithogenic and anthropogenic activities furthermore factor 3 signified the impact of ph on the accumulation and mobility of zinc multivariate statistical results indicated good correlation between pca and hca which confirms lithogenic outputs such as enduring of rocks and minerals along with anthropogenic contribution emanating from effluents from industrial wastes in the study area this investigation is an integrative approach to assess the quality of groundwater which might be helpful and useful for managing health risk of the local population frequent monitoring of industrial effluents can be helpful in tracing out the points with elevated level of metal pollution before these pollutants reach consumers and threaten human health they should be mitigated by facilitating engineering solutions the spatial variation in the heavy metal content and heavy metal pollution indices was presented for the first time from the study area also this is the first documentation on the health risk assessment of heavy metals declaration of competing interest the authors

11657,over the previous half century increased groundwater mining has had significant social and economic implications that are still going on many solutions and frameworks have been proposed in the world to overcome these problems in this study we attempted to analyze the conditions of hamedan bahar plain in terms of groundwater governance gg the groundwater governance indicators were evaluated using the structural equation modeling pls sem in general the status of the groundwater governance gg indicators in the region shows that these indicators are all lower than the standard level and are not in good condition based on the results the constructs of policy making β 0 867 information and data β 0 866 and stakeholder engagement β 0 859 had the greatest effect on the latent variable i e groundwater governance while the other constructs had a moderate effect among the three constructs of water governance the efficiency construct β 0 404 with the indicators of information and data budget legislation and innovative measures had the greatest impact on the governance of groundwater resources in hamedan bahar plain finally the overall goodness of fit gof 0 77 reflects the excellent fit of the model according to the results obtained the water system managers and policy makers in the province should increase stakeholders knowledge and awareness about new frameworks of water resources governance a robust framework is presented for policy makers and planners to identify the gaps and problems of water resources furthermore various aspects and features should be emphasized simultaneously so as to achieve sustainable governance of groundwater resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater indicators effectiveness efficiency trust and engagement agricultural

created water rules might differ even within the class of surface water water law may be separated broadly into two substantive areas rights to utilize water and limitations on groundwater contamination macpherson 2019 groundwater is considered as one of the main resources of water worldwide fao 2018 increasing groundwater exploitation brings about negative impacts e g ecosystem damage surface water dewatering landslides etc on meeting the long term needs for water by natural systems and individuals rani et al 2022 the dramatic increase in groundwater use over the last half century has had significant social and economic implications as well as many consequences such as ecosystem damage surface water drying out landslides and sea water penetration all over the world balali and viaggi 2015 agricultural production largely depends on water and water resources are increasingly at risk oecd 2016 in recent years agricultural areas have increased worldwide leading to an increase in water demands miao et al 2021 in this respect unsustainable practices have led to serious groundwater depletion and degradation in many regions of the world thereby leading to a series of negative effects on people and the environment agudelo moreno et al 2020 asfaw and ayalew 2020 balali et al 2011 jia et al 2020 agricultural production has been influenced by major droughts resulting in a decrease in groundwater and surface water reserves miao et al 2021 pumping groundwater intensively for irrigation has resulted in the depletion of aquifers it might negatively affect environmental externalities and exert a considerable economic effect on the water sector and beyond the fao project related to the governance of groundwater 2018 indicates three times increase in extraction of groundwater over the last 50 years 1960 2010 barati et al 2019 for example groundwater is used for irrigation of nearly 100 million hectares of arable lands and more than 40 of uses through irrigation water döll et al 2012 oecd 2016 siebert et al 2010 furthermore about 11 of the groundwater discharge is consumed for irrigation in the international food trade dalin et al 2017 in a number of developing nations including iran frequent droughts along with intensive exploitation of surface and groundwater resources through a large network of hydraulic infrastructure and deep wells have brought the country s water to a critical level agutu et al 2020 balali et al 2011 custodio et al 2016 hamer et al 2020 havril et al 2018 wu et al 2020 west et al 2019 although complexity and uncertainty as well as climate change have increased over recent decades castells 2010 the development of new social technical environmental and economic subjects is important and needs to be addressed franco torres et al 2021 under these circumstances by increasing the dependence on groundwater water managers and policy makers should be aware about the quality and quantity of groundwater and they should make rational decisions concerning the preservation and allocation of resources added to this we have to emphasize that the groundwater considerations should be taken into account in agricultural energy and land use planning as well as in urban development and environmental policies rani et al 2022 moreover in order to achieve an integrated water management portfolio with adaptability and resilience to climatic change and drought it is critical to have effective groundwater management as mentioned by popovici et al 2021 van dijk 2012 gondo et al 2020 and franco torres et al 2021 it is not the lack of resources or knowledge financial constraints or technical issues that hinder sustainable development of the water sector rather socio institutional challenges including governance hinder its development furthermore debate and negotiation on the best way to reconcile the benefits and consequences of using groundwater are first and foremost a governance challenge rather than a technical issue foster and garduño 2013 extensive research has shown that problems and challenges cannot be overcome by technological upgrades alone instead what is emphasized and considered today is attention to social and organizational factors and their communication and interaction with each other bayat et al 2015 the challenge of water is seen as a problem of governance in the current century the defined local institutional capacity of which has been weakened by certain factors of social economic and political stress uker and fanany 2011 popovici et al 2021 according to the global water partnership gwp the water issue is primarily a governance catastrophe and this concept is frequently cited by international institutions such as the world bank the oecd and the un franco torres et al 2021 as a governance system water management involves various forms of control and management in water access meissner and jacobs 2016 oecd 2015a various public frameworks have been proposed to improve the governance of groundwater resources and most have confirmed that there is no plan for good governance that will work everywhere foster and ait kadi 2012 moench et al 2013 yet many aquifers are at risk due to poor governance wijnen et al 2012 and inadequate legal frameworks that do not take into account geological and or sociological political environmental and economic complexities gupta and conti 2017 it has been recognized that governance is an important challenge in reaching the long term sustainability of water resources oecd 2015a pahl wostl 2017 in this regard water governance means an environmental empowerment in which water management regulates or influences water resources strategies policies plans incentives and financial structures related to water resources when there is effective water governance relevant regulatory and legal frameworks and institutions are provided they enhance responsible measures and actions for protecting and ensuring water resources sustainability and optimizing the services and advantages achieved from these resources roy et al 2011 in most regions of iran groundwater is the main water resource hojjati and boustani 2010 and most of iran s agricultural lands depend on it barati et al 2019 in addition population growth has been estimated to reach 95 million over the next two decades iran currently has a population of more than 80 million and the quality and quantity conditions of water resources could be worsened by the expansion of climate change sadeghi 2017 the characteristics of arid and semi arid regions like iran include high evaporation unequal spatial and temporal distribution of water resources and low rainfall agricultural water governance is particularly important in such areas to this end water security and food security are influenced by decision making nazemi et al 2020 as noted in the contemporary history of legislation and policy making of water resources in iran negligence of the significance of water rights both economically and legally and water markets in addressing sustainability challenges is noticeable moreover there are not any clear criteria in legislation related to water to establish transparency in the water governance system nabavi 2017 the main factors for groundwater exhaustion in iran include the absence of optimal water governance hojjati and boustani 2010 moridi 2017 and mismanagement nabavi 2017 for instance groundwater level decline land subsidence and poor agricultural water efficiency are some of the main effects of ineffective water administration and management in iran the biggest water consuming sector sadeghi 2017 groundwater governance is seriously challenging and it has been considerably neglected despite a large number of works allocated to groundwater assessment barati et al 2019 therefore the main aim of this study was to investigate the principles of water governance and its effects on development of rural areas based on the model proposed by oecd the overuse of groundwater tables has posed serious problems and issues such as sinkholes and subsidence in agricultural lands therefore different countries have used different models and frameworks to cope with these implications and to improve groundwater tables depending on their social economic and legal conditions most activities on groundwater management in the world address the issues and barriers of attracting the cooperation and presence of stakeholders in the process of decision making and implementation however the oecd model has introduced an operational framework at a wide range for studying different factors influencing water resources considering the social economic and geographical systems thus the oecd water resources governance framework can identify the present and future problems and challenges by investigating the factors underpinning groundwater management and conservation in hamedan bahar plain according to pahl wostl 2009 and poudyal et al 2019 resource difficulties are caused by bad governance exposing the inadequacy of existing governance regimes to deal with current and future challenges nonetheless understanding of resource governance systems and how they develop is extremely limited major structural traits of governance regimes include the impact of formal and informal institutions the function of state and non state actors the pattern of multi level interactions and the relative significance of administrative hierarchies markets and networks change is seen as the result of society learning which develops in stages as it moves from single to double to triple loop learning informal networks are thought to be extremely important in such learning processes governance systems with a wider range of complexity and diversity are more adaptable the application of common conceptual frameworks that account for the true complexity of governance regimes can thus produce the knowledge base required to advance current understanding to a level that enables providing insightful policy advice goal conflicts are evident in this respect as demonstrated by the evaluation by van der voorn et al 2020 and policy makers must compromise between aims conflicts or synergies result from the method chosen to handle these trade offs the multi dimensional aspects of goal conflicts are thought to be better accounted for in multi target backcasting scenarios as a result this calls for a thorough multi target backcasting strategy that combines the advantages of backcasting nexus approaches and multi criteria analysis in previous studies the management of water resources was carried out to prevent water reduction and to solve the problems such as monitoring development and daily operations to maintain water resources under optimal conditions however when discussing governance different structural and institutional dimensions in which management activities are regulated are mentioned due to the fact that previous studies could not take into account the different dimensions of the groundwater resource system and resolve the existing problems in the area of water resources in this study we attempted to find and identify problems in the area of groundwater resources using the governance framework water governance contains several features that help to define the topic from many perspectives various and extensive frameworks such as the ostrom s iad framework blomquist and deleon 2011 bushouse 2011 heikkila et al 2011 oakerson and parks 2011 ostrom 2011 have been proposed in the field of water resources governance almost all these frameworks identify different and hidden dimensions and issues including norms stakeholders structures and laws that affect the sustainable governance of water resources these frameworks also examine the role and relationship of these components in the governance of water resources by considering different socio cultural institutional political in addition this framework assesses economic dimensions such as the ostrom s ses framework which establishes communication and interaction among the resource system resource unit and stakeholders governance system etc to achieve sustainable governance of resources the majority of these frameworks place a strong emphasis on governance indicators like legislation and public involvement which are crucial for implementing water policy the focus on other elements such as communication and monitoring is evidence of the policy applicability of research to water governance which frequently looks at recent changes in water regulations the indicative evidence gathered from a number of sources reveals that groundwater pollution has become a concern for the safety of drinking water in several regions of iran even on a worldwide scale the socio economic dependence on groundwater transcends the traditional distinctions between arid semi arid and humid regions stressing the need for governance solutions that are specifically tailored to the circumstances in which groundwater issues arise furthermore due to the relative youth of intensive groundwater use the gap between society and science technology is wider in the case of groundwater than it is in the case of surface water resources the availability of freshwater resources in iran has come under scrutiny due to the combined effects of rising demand and numerous layers of supply including canals from large but remote reservoirs dozens to hundreds of wells and small dams therefore there is a growing need to develop a groundwater governance framework that is pertinent to india s particular groundwater situation while iran struggles with managing its groundwater resources keeping in mind that millions depend on this resource and that vulnerability to scarcity and contamination is on the rise a framework for groundwater governance in iran is being developed as a result of this study and it is anticipated that these ideas will eventually be developed into more specific institutions practices and policies that will make up the foundation of groundwater governance in iran the oecd water resources governance framework is a universal framework as the experiences of 17 oecd members 13 latin american countries and some asian and african countries e g jordan and tunisia have been used in its development world health organization 2017 the key novelty and contribution of this work is that groundwater governance appears to be lacking even in situations when there is a high demand for water and a limited supply through an integrated examination along the three dimensions the features of the groundwater resource negative externalities issues and governance institutions this study looked at the social and institutional traditions in the area of iran s subsurface water resources this framework and its indicators have not been researched therefore the most significant feature of the uniqueness of this study is its evaluation of the oecd water resource governance metrics for iran s groundwater sector the purpose of this study was to evaluate the indicators of the oecd water resources governance in the improvement of underground water management in dasht bahar in hamedan in this regard the specific objectives of this study are as follows 1 the identification of gaps and shortcomings through the examination of the groundwater governance parameters using the oecd governance model 2 the determination of governance inadequacies in various levels and sectors of groundwater 3 the identification of barriers to effective groundwater management in addition to these objectives the oecd principles are based on the premise that there is no comprehensive and universal solution for the challenges and issues of water resources but the principles developed in different parts of the world are applicable therefore the present research aims to use the oecd principles composed of diverse sections including the legal system administrative system capacities and cooperation and communications to explore these principles and indices as per the local conditions of the hamedan bahar region considering the geographical and climatic conditions of the studied region 2 theoretical background groundwater governance gg water governance is defined as practices processes formal and informal and rules through which decisions are made and implemented to manage water resources and services with stakeholders expressing interest and decision makers being accountable oecd 2015a historically groundwater management was launched for highlighting the best practices in gg in 2011 and the gg project was inserted into political goals and decisions in 2016 groundwater governance 2018 gg is about decision making on groundwater involving individuals and or entities organized at various levels kulkarni et al 2015 comparing strom s framework as a multi level governance framework and the oecd it should be noted that strom s framework deals less with the institutional and structural dimensions of organizations and laws in indicators such as responsibility and accountability or innovation in actions however the framework provided by pahl wostl 2009 deals more with the investigation of adaptive capacity and systematic learning processes to analyze the characteristics of governance structures in addition this framework can provide other hidden layers to identify existing problems in the field of water resources and can be used as a complement to other frameworks such as the oecd framework pahl wostl 2009 mcginnis and ostrom 2014 however based on this study the oecd framework has a codified structure in examining and identifying different dimensions in the field of water resources governance it is noteworthy that the initial framework of the oecd groundwater governance was proposed on the basis of researches on the institutional framework of water governance in 17 oecd countries organisation for economic co operation and development 2018 and 13 latin american countries 2012 and also by conducting in depth multilateral political discussions of national participation in support of water reforms in mexico 2013 the netherlands 2014 jordan 2014 tunisia 2014 and brazil 2015 oecd framework provided guidelines have been prepared and compiled according to the experiences of different countries with different regional conditions oecd 2015a therefore considering that the oecd framework presents different and extensive dimensions in identifying the problems related to water sector and reaching a suitable and stable situation the aim of this study was to assess the governance status of the groundwater resources of hamedan bahar plain according to van der voorn et al s 2017 research access to clean drinking water has long been a top concern in many regions of the world to enhance water governance and how water requirement is defined and controlled address access disparities safeguard water quantity and quality and reuse it industrialized nations such as germany and the us have implemented a number of legal measures and institutional changes voltz and grischek 2018 for instance in big cities creative solutions like subsidized connection have been implemented to aid the most underprivileged neighborhoods however the current political climate emergency necessitates a reevaluation of the problems with water and its governance due to its particularly detrimental effects on water in areas where there is a danger of water shortage and drought preserving water sustainability is essential according to van der voorn et al 2017 as explicitly mentioned in the sustainable development goals the awra presented ten recommendations about sustainable groundwater management in the beginning of 2018 these recommendations are summarized as follows 1 to assess the resource 2 to build partnerships 3 to create a legal framework 4 to include groundwater considerations 5 to maintain sustainability 6 to respect ecosystems 7 to engage stakeholders 8 to commit to understanding 9 to safeguard assets and 10 to use interdisciplinary approaches awra 2018 gg comprises a collection of regionally unique institutional social and economic structures with various roles as a result of various water locations and the connections between their constituent parts gondo et al 2020 veettil et al 2011 barati et al 2019 kulkarni et al 2015 in addition it can be described as a process that determines who receives water when and how much undp 2015 the main goal of the fao led gg is raising awareness on the outstanding significance of groundwater resources as well as their sustainable management to avoid the threat of water crisis d agostino et al 2019 dillon et al 2012 pahl wostl et al 2013 a framework has been developed by the project for action on gg which includes some institutional and policy guidelines and best practices and recommendations fitting to local contexts for improving gg at cross border national and local levels morgera et al 2020 the purpose of designing the gg was to raise awareness of the importance of groundwater resources for many world regions and to identify and promote best practices in gg as a way for achievement of the sustainable management of groundwater resources it presents a framework related to regulations customs and laws for groundwater use as well as the processes for engagement of the private and public sectors and civil society shah 2014 the water related challenges are more complicated and locally diverse policy makers should attempt to boost the overall efficiency of water use by the agricultural sector decrease the impact of the sector on freshwater resources and enhance its flexibility against water risks oecd 2014 therefore as advocated by the oecd multiple policy responses are needed at different levels each of which fitted to specific water resource systems in order to help policy makers and address water resource issue the oecd analysis and indicators formulate policy responses define paths for making necessary policy changes and facilitate their implementation for moving agriculture towards sustainable water management oecd 2017 furthermore political guidance and thematic knowledge have been developed on the participation of stakeholders oecd 2015c the sovereignty of water regulators oecd 2015c and water sovereignty in cities oecd 2016 with the oecd s water governance standards water sovereignty has achieved its pinnacle fig 1 35 oecd member nations participated in a high level process in june 2015 to develop the oecd principles to promote effective equitable and efficient water policy oecd 2015a different stakeholders researchers practitioners policy makers etc use the oecd principles as a framework to assess the efficiency of water management and to be effective through discussions in a particular subdivision these indicators carry out specific tasks that are required to close the gaps found and offer stakeholders and governments a framework for self assessment there are several definitions of water governance in terms of the many aspects of water policy law and government which are frequently regarded in the literature as performance factors oecd 2015a water rights decentralization pricing accountability participation by the private sector and user groups integration and the institutional foundation of water management are among these factors rola et al 2012 araral and yu 2013 tatar et al 2019 the term governance stretches back to ancient greece when it was used to the state and the world bank merely adds that strong governance is important for growth and progress plattner 2013 not surprisingly the definitions and conception of governance have grown in recent times and have been used in different areas the term was generally expanded to include non governmental actors such as civil society private sector and non governmental organizations ngos rather than simply the state bernauer and betzold 2012 hasmath et al 2019 since the late 1980s the world bank has raised the issue of good governance mundy and verger 2015 erkkilä and piironen 2014 the report of the international organization for migration iom in 1989 for the first time defined good governance as providing efficient public services a reliable judicial system and an accountable administrative system bertoncello et al 2015 the oecd defines good governance as the ability to work with different environments to achieve balance at various local and international levels olfat and pishdar 2020 while hundreds of different and varied definitions can be found by a comprehensive search for governance definitions of key thinkers continue to be prepared the water organization has different purposes and services which include identifying the formation of water governance in a variety of contexts in performance evaluation and in designing lessons in different areas and for different reasons araral and wu 2013 water governance is seen as a range of social political administrative and economic systems designed for regulating the management and development of water resources and providing water services at various levels of society pahl wostl 2017 woodhouse and muller 2017 the use of multi center governance is focused on analyses at national and sub levels as a type of water management knieper and pahl wostl 2016 marshall et al 2013 thiel 2015 with a finite investigation of boundary watershed akamani and wilson 2011 da silveira and richards 2013 myint 2012 national and secondary actors have tested various forms of watershed governance with regional environmental history cook et al 2016 and catchment or river basin based authorities huitema and meijerink 2017 suhardiman et al 2012 in recent decade s research akram et al 2011 investigated the effect of the governance indicators on poverty and inequality and found that poor governance has an impact on increasing poverty in the long run in addition baltutis and moore 2019 estimated the indicators of good governance based on the quality of the services provided by the government in the case of water it is often aimed to optimize the allocation of resources for human use water is a crucial issue for all nations therefore most countries suffering from water crises in some of their regions have developed and implemented plans for the control or optimal use of their water resources one of the fundamental plans is associated with the use of groundwater resources which account for the largest part of available fresh water in the world 3 methodology 3 1 study area hamedan bahar plain is situated in hamedan province iran at latitudes 34 49 n and 35 02 n and longitudes 48 17 e and 48 33 e hamedan bahar aquifer has a total area of 480 km2 and the aquifer is unconfined balali and viaggi 2015 it has a semi arid and cold climate with a mean annual temperature of 11 c and an average annual precipitation of 324 mm balali and viaggi 2015 balali et al 2011 zamani et al 2020 hamedan bahar plain is one of the groundwater restricted areas groundwater extraction has had enormous social and economic effects during the last half century which continues to date nozari and zali 2013 the plain which is also called simineh river covers an area of 2459 km2 in the northern slopes of alvand mountains the area of the plain is 880 km2 with the surface area of the main aquifer of the plain amounting to 468 km2 and the area of the mountains amounting to 1579 km2 balali et al 2011 the aquifer is recharged by the direct infiltration of rainfalls the infiltration of surface flow the water returning from agricultural urban and industrial uses and the underground inflows and it is discharged by the abstraction of the groundwater for different uses and underground outflows balali et al 2011 increasing uncontrolled use of groundwater in this plain has caused a sharp reduction in the level of the station in the area and created problems such as increasing the depth of the wells increasing pumping costs and reducing water quality nozari and zali 2013 accordingly the groundwater level has constantly declined in recent decades which threatens the groundwater aquifer life in this region regional water company iran 2018 groundwater resources are the most important sources of agricultural water supply in the area more than 80 of the water needed by the agricultural sector and 50 of urban drinking water are provided from the groundwater resources of the plain seydan and ghadami firoozabadi 2018 as indicated by the research on the groundwater balance of the research area by adjusting agricultural policies optimal groundwater exploitation can be ensured in the agriculture sector considering the broad amount of aquifer water used in this region balali et al 2011 3 2 data collection method the aim of this study was to evaluate the gg indices based on the oecd model through a survey method in light of the survey research design this descriptive analytical study took advantage of 254 farmers in hamedan bahar plain the study used the pls sem process for evaluating the measurement and structural models through smart pls version 3 software the objective of the current work was to adapt this method to be appropriate for exploratory studies and theory development ali et al 2018 hair et al 2017 in order to measure and investigate gg the indicators and principles of the oecd model were used fig 3 then a questionnaire was developed all the items were evaluated using a 10 point likert s scale from 0 strongly low to 10 strongly high the effectiveness indicators of the oecd are related to government s contribution to determining clear policies and goals in the sustainability of water resources at all levels of government this requires the careful allocation of roles and responsibilities in water resources management as well as water policies on the proper scale and at different levels in the face of the challenges and complexities of water issues this indicator includes four items capacity policy coherence optimization and clear roles and responsibility fig 3 the efficiency indicators are related to government participation for maximizing the sustainable management benefits and water well being with the lowest cost for the community relying on sharing data and information about water mobilizing water resources implementing regulatory frameworks and supporting innovative water management practices cooperation among municipalities rural and urban partnerships etc for this indicator the oecd has proposed four items including information and data budgeting and financing regulatory framework and innovative governance the trust and engagement indicators are related to government s share of public trust and assuring the inclusion of stakeholders through democratic legitimacy and fairness related to the entire society see fig 4 the promotion of routine monitoring and evaluation to be adjusted as necessary trade management among water consumers urban and rural areas and generations trust and interaction with the mainstream of honesty and transparency for this part four items including integrity and transparency stakeholders engagement trade offs and monitoring have been presented finally we first developed a questionnaire based on the indices and sub sections provided by the oecd then its items and indices were validated by experts the validity and reliability of the indices were fitted by the structural equation model given the results of the model fitting it can be used in other regions and by other researchers 4 results 4 1 demographics the demographic characteristics of the farmers indicated that all farmers were male and in the age range of 22 80 with a mean value of 46 years in terms of educational level 38 had secondary education or a 12 year high school diploma 50 had a primary or secondary school degree and 12 were illiterate as for membership in the associations like village councils or cooperatives 45 were members of these associations but 55 were not regarding water ownership status 58 7 had private property 18 5 were tenants and 22 8 only had a partial right to use water hagh abeh in persian in terms of the water supply method 70 used wells 14 springs and 16 aqueduct in terms of irrigation methods 43 1 used rainy irrigation 9 5 used drip irrigation and 54 7 used furrow irrigation 4 2 the adequacy of indices and items measurement model the pls sem analysis of the 254 samples was done using smart pls 3 0 software ringle et al 2015 to assess the measurement and structural models the pls sem analysis was done through three steps first the measurement model outer model through the analysis of validity and reliability and confirmatory factor analysis was investigated in the second stage the structural model internal model was investigated using the path estimation among the variables holland 1999 in the final stage the model s overall fit was investigated the outer model complies with the pls measurement model in structural equations therefore table 1 presents the typical load fitting indicators in pls models that assess latent finding variables furthermore the indicators that determine the suitability of the measurement of variables in the pls models are as follows the average variance extracted ave cronbach s alpha loading factor r square and composite reliability cr according to table 1 all indicators are at the appropriate level in the following models the factor and the coefficients of determination among items and indicators have been shown all constructs in the present work showed a ca and a cr above 0 70 moreover the value of the loading indicator for all the items was above 0 5 it is acceptable assuming that the ave and cr establish the required thresholds ali et al 2018 moreover the ave of all the constructs was above 0 5 indicating an acceptable convergent validity as suggested by fornell and larcker 1981 the discriminant validity is assessed using the heterotrait monotrait htmt ratio and in contrast to the traditional criterion proposed by fornell and larcker 1981 it is possible to use it to assess covariance and variance based structural equation models therefore when the htmt ratio is used the correlation value should be smaller than 0 85 as demonstrated by voorhees et al 2016 the cut off value of 0 85 for the htmt ratio is at a very good level in the current work an htmt of 0 85 is used for evaluating discriminant validity the results of the discriminant validity assessment for the measurement model using the htmt ratio are given in table 2 the final results of the path analysis of the measurement model are presented in table 4 fig 5 shows the output of the pls algorithm command this command is used to extract the coefficients of external loads and path coefficients see fig 6 4 3 general model fit gof criterion the gof criterion is used to evaluate the general model fit that includes three values 0 01 0 25 and 0 36 as weak medium and strong values for gof respectively manuel et al 2009 vinzi et al 2010 table 3 in order to fit the overall model which controls the measurement and structural models the criterion is calculated as follows gof communalities r2 gof 9 34 9 2 12 0 77 gof was calculated to be 0 77 which is higher than the recommended value of 0 36 therefore it can be concluded that the research model had in general an optimal fit 4 4 path analysis results and investigating research hypotheses the pls sem was employed as an approach of statistical analysis in the present study and the indicators contributing to gg in hamdan bahar plain areas were investigated the three indicators discussed in this study included efficiency effectiveness and trust and engagement each demonstrating a significant and positive impact on gg to perform a path analysis first a path diagram must be drawn which illustrates the direct and indirect effects of each variable i e the effect of x on the other variable of y additionally the bootstrap method was used to assess the path coefficients of the structural model with 5000 samples as shown by the results the impact of high levels of efficiency β efic gg 0 404 p 0 001 effectiveness β efct gg 0 38 p 0 001 and trust and engagement β tae gg 0 29 p 0 001 had a positive relationship with gg which supports the hypothesis hence h1 h2 and h3 were confirmed the significance of the effects and path coefficients are presented in fig 2 and table 4 therefore it can be concluded that these variables are important in inducing the improvement of gg effective on the site in hamdan bahar plain insert table 4 5 discussion groundwater resources have long been considered by human societies and are considered strategic resources in all regions at present the role and significance of water resources sustainability and in particular their role in the sustainability of the rural and agricultural community are being considered at different levels therefore water resource management has been proposed to protect and enhance groundwater resources through involvement and cooperation of the government and the public in this study the status of the gg indicators in hamadan bahar plain of iran has been assessed by using the definitions and the framework provided by the oecd in general the status of the gg indicators in the region showed that these indicators are all lower than the standard level and are not in good condition this result is in conformity with that of the previous studies by thomann et al 2020 who studied lack of evaluation of actions and plans in management of groundwater and lack of transparency in the guidelines of groundwater governance mirnezami and bagheri 2017 assessed the ineffectiveness of water governance un terms of capacity to carry out policies ghafouri fard et al 2015 investigated close interaction and participation in decision making in water governance ghaemi et al 2016 assessed emphasis on public participation training and capacity building in water governance there were weaknesses in some indicators such as accountability transparency responsibility legislation and capacity building which prevent some organizations and institutions from performing their duties well and from achieving water resources protection goals in a critical situation this is in line with the findings of other studies for example agudelo moreno et al 2020 assessed knowledge upgrade and sustainable management of groundwater resources asfaw and ayalew 2020 analyzed management and protection of groundwater resources and hérivaux and grémont 2019 investigated increasing awareness and tackling environmental problems among the three dimensions of water governance the efficiency dimension with the indicators of information and data budget legislation and innovative measures has the greatest impact on the governance of groundwater resources in hamadan bahar plain and can be said to be a precondition for other dimensions of water governance this dimension focuses on accurate and transparent information which requires for a budget and strong regulations to access and provide this should be sought in the relevant legal documents therefore in order to access sustainable and appropriate water governance in the region serious attention should be paid to accurate and reliable information and data for decision making and policy making this finding is in agreement with the study by thomann et al 2020 who studied lack of transparency in guidelines of groundwater governance mirnezami and bagheri 2017 assessed weakness of water governance in implementing policies and poor capacity hamer et al 2020 investigated accessible database system the importance of knowledge in policy making and appropriate legislation custodio et al 2016 and barati et al 2019 evaluated increasing the penetration rate and reducing the exploitation rate of groundwater resources a single indication is more crucial and efficient in every aspect of government in the efficiency dimension information and data in the effectiveness dimension policy and in the trust and engagement dimension the indicators of stakeholder engagement are more important and effective the indicator of information and data is one of the most important elements in a decision making system without awareness of the current situation planning to achieve the desired situation will not be possible the transparent and reliable information and data help organizations policy makers and stakeholders to protect the valuable assets of groundwater resources and increase their productivity and added value dissemination of free statistics and information is the first step to achieving transparency and transparency is the first step towards gaining the trust of people the trust of the people is the seedbed of their participation in a decision making or management process moreover transparency of information makes organizations and individuals more responsible in their duties today governments around the world believe that systematically access to more information for the public is an important asset for positive social and economic changes in general it can be concluded that the availability of information and data will increase the participation of people and elites in all government processes including problem finding recognizing and prioritizing problems formulating strategies implementation monitoring and evaluation of government processes furthermore it makes a country s water management system accountable responsible and optimized this finding is in harmony with the findings of the study by enteshari and safavi 2019 transparency is the first step in reforming governance and achieving good governance javadzadeh et al 2020 assessed anthropogenic activity excessive exploitation of groundwater for irrigation hérivaux and grémont 2019 investigated the valuing of ecosystem services via raising awareness and involving stakeholders in the assessment process in the effectiveness dimension the policy indicator has a special role and importance this indicator provides the necessary basis for the effective participation of stakeholders thus with the relevant policy the engagement and participation of stakeholders and their representatives can be legally provided in the process of decision making furthermore the absence of clear policies in water resources governance in the agricultural sector leads to contradiction and conflict in this sector and in water management this finding is in conformity with the investigations by vahid and ranjbar 2019 lack of stakeholders and non governmental participation in the water resources policy making process is one of the reasons for the inefficiency of water policies mirnezami and bagheri 2017 lack of solidarity and coordination coherence in the components of governance results in non implementation of groundwater protection policies the stakeholders engagement is another important factor influencing the governance of water resources in fact one of the basic principles of water governance is the involvement and participation of all stakeholders in the decision making process and implementation and policy making process of water resources management these results have been supported by the previous findings by ghaemi et al 2016 emphasis on public participation education and capacity building should be considered by policy makers in a decision making and planning process based on islam et al s 2020 findings there is a gap in creating coordination technical capacity transparency implementation and citizen participation singh et al 2019 emphasized a coherent approach including inclusive knowledge and technology new policy making and community participation thomann et al 2020 achieved the expected results of stakeholders communication through transparency in planning sarami et al 2022 considered policy factors innovation and creativity in actions and financing as the three important indicators in improving the governance of groundwater resources unfortunately the government does not interpret interaction correctly and still considers it the only way to improve the situation and to control externally the consumption behavior of stakeholders the majority of the remedies that have been suggested are of the engineering construction and external control type rather than measures for democratic participation what is important is that the same and unified policies must be considered in line with the vision of sustainable development based on resource capacity and participatory governance finally it should be noted that each of the dimensions and indicators of governance is important and effective and ignoring any of them will cause imbalance and failure to achieving sustainable development goals and programs as a result all aspects and indicators of water governance should be addressed and a synergy should be established by developing and strengthening each of them in order to ensure sustainable governance of groundwater resources in fact the governance should be also about strategic planning and based on a guiding vision a guiding perspective can actually unify disparate policies and expand the various levels covered by governance van der voorn et al 2012 according to van der voorn et al 2012 vision formation is critical to success but visions have been increasingly prevalent since humans acquired a need to know what would happen in the future in truth visioning is a process used to assist a group of stakeholders in generating a common future vision these visions can be found in a variety of circumstances albeit in differing shapes e g corporate political religious and personal and with varying levels of content detail future visions on the other hand will frequently arise without any significant investigation according to research by van der voorn et al 2012 a powerful vision gains power from the authoritative leader pursuing it and steering participants in the desired path though it is possible that what comes out of visioning will not be as robust authoritative and unambiguous as the powerful vision that makes structural couplings possible as a result the existing governance environment is very fragmented and maintains a significant distance from the ideal future prospects in order to fulfill the objectives of sustainable development this necessitates a broad mobilization in water governance according to the findings of this study it can be concluded that in order to overcome the limitations related to the socio cultural aspects of the oecd framework the attitudes of community members should be considered as shown in the study of van der voorn 2008 the power distance is a measurement of the acceptance of a hierarchy of power and wealth by the individuals who make up the general population of a nation culture or business this criterion measures the degree to which less powerful members of society are expected to accept and value unequally distributed wealth and power the great power gap shows that inequality of power and wealth has been instilled in a society in contrast low power distance represents a society in which the differences between power and wealth of the people seem to be in harmony opportunities and equality for all are constrained in such societies accordingly socio cultural aspects in the framework of the oecd can be classified into the following five criteria low versus high power distance the power gap influences societal acceptance of hierarchical position differentiation it assesses how much less powerful individuals of a society tolerate and expect inequitable distribution of power and income power and wealth disparities are ingrained in society as evidenced by a high power distance a short power distance on the other hand indicates a society in which discrepancies in power and wealth appear to be synchronized the acceptability of hierarchical position differentiation in a society is influenced by the power differential it investigates the degree to which a society s weaker members accept and anticipate unequal power and wealth distribution inequalities in power and wealth have permeated society as shown by a sizable power distance additionally a society with a minimal power distance is one in which the differences in power and wealth seem to be balanced in such societies there are limits on everyone s equality and opportunity individualism versus collectivism individuals are incorporated into organizations through strong links in a collectivistic culture it strengthens extended families and collectives in which everyone is responsible for their group s members individuals in an individualistic society have poor bonds with one another masculinity versus femininity the acceptance of gender role diversity in a society is emphasized by this criterion men and women share the same caring values of life in feminine societies females are treated equally in all social aspects in such communities with no differentiation and discrimination between genders moreover in a patriarchal society these ideals are decisive and competitive and there are deep gaps between the values of men and women it implies a significant degree of gender discrimination and differentiation as well as the dominance of males in the social and political sectors short versus long term orientation this indicates if national cultures are more long term or short term focused in their decision making processes a long term oriented civilization works for compatibility with its changing environment to do so such a society seeks to adapt its existing rituals and traditions to new situations challenges or threats short term oriented societies on the other hand tend to stick to ancient traditions and customs regardless of future changes in the unfixed environment this study was faced with two main limitations first accessing the location of the study and data gathering were difficult because of the limitations caused by the covid 19 secondly some limitations were related to the oecd model which was concentrated more on social and economic aspects while other issues were ignored i e technical and infrastructures ones for future studies it is recommended that the socio economic aspects of the oecd model be considered alongside with other aspects 6 conclusion with regard to current management strategies as well as macro plans and policies it is imperative to pay attention to the indicators and components of groundwater resource governance in this regard what is important is the interrelated cycle among the different dimensions of the governance model as any defect in any of its dimensions and indicators will upset the balance and governance cycle of groundwater resources in this study due to the comprehensiveness of the dimensions of water resources governance presented by the oecd model the status of the groundwater resources governance indicators in hamadan bahar plain was investigated the results of construct validity estimation including factor loading ave convergent validity divergent validity and cr and gof indicators indicate the quality and proper fit of the groundwater resource governance measurement model based on the results some reasons such as lack of organizational innovation lack of clear and imperative laws lack of transparent information and collective management cause the inability of institutions to implement water resources management regarding the lack of organizational innovation the current situation is in a manner that the organizations in charge of water resources management follow a magisterial and hierarchical system and this has weakened the interaction among organizations and key actors therefore to get out of this problem it is suggested to use a responsible creative and innovative team for the groundwater resources management system in a coordinated and structured way that can implement the goals and policies of water resources governance well the next item that will improve the governance of groundwater resources is the existence of a formulated practical and innovative legal framework the transparent and innovative laws such as the law of reducing the government s role and leaving tasks to the people play an important role in this regard therefore it is necessary to be creative and innovative in passing and implementing new laws about reducing the role of the government increasing the interaction and participation of people and leaving tasks to them another solution is the availability of transparent accurate and timely information in policy making however a correct policy will lead to adoption of appropriate laws that are compatible with the conditions of the region the involvement of stakeholders and ultimately better governance of groundwater resources another problem with groundwater resource governance is that it does not adequately support collective management for example water users associations can be involved in decision making projects but this is a rare occurrence and their role and importance are not taken into account evidence and many studies indicate that local collective and participatory management can be the most effective approach to establishing good governance one of the benefits of participation is the increase in the sense of beneficiaries ownership and the improvement of governance outputs if a bottom up participatory approach is implemented the participation will be stronger and local stakeholders empowerment will be increased the intended amount of engagement is determined by the regional circumstances that we wish to promote in local collective management organizations and associations will be more supportive the supportive laws and mechanisms will be one of the effective items and ways to improve stakeholders participation regarding the many capacities opportunities and advantages that exist in terms of human resources and natural capital in the region these potentials must be used to achieve the goals of groundwater resources management in the region it is suggested that through the consensus and collaboration of elites and experts existing challenges and weaknesses be identified and effective measures be taken to improve the governance of water resources for this purpose changing the existing rules and structures and adopting effective strategies are essential to strengthen the private sector government and society in general the results show that the oecd water resources governance framework is useful for studying and identifying the needs and implementing policies and new plans since this framework has 12 principles and related subsections it has successfully encompassed all dimensions and factors that are important for identifying and advancing the goals the point to consider is that the framework has a comprehensive mode that needs to be customized based on local conditions and features therefore its comprehensiveness causes all factors to be aggregated and helps draw the attention of officials and policy makers it also contributes to raising the awareness of officials and stakeholders about what they had no awareness of and making them responsible and accountable since water and water resources are among the important and challenging topics of all areas water officials and policy makers should welcome new knowledge and frameworks in order to be able to manage water and its related issues in the best possible way eventually these studies are very helpful in creating awareness and knowledge among officials and policy makers thereby influencing their decisions and programs the research evaluated the governance of groundwater resources in hamedan bahar plain quantitatively using a questionnaire however it seems necessary to supplement quantitative research with qualitative research in order to identify individual and environmental attributes of each region and the local stakeholders motives in attempts for developing region specific policies and programs it is recommended that future research consider different factors and aspects underpinning groundwater management and maintenance in addition to identifying the status quo and proposing approaches declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper questionnaire for

11657,over the previous half century increased groundwater mining has had significant social and economic implications that are still going on many solutions and frameworks have been proposed in the world to overcome these problems in this study we attempted to analyze the conditions of hamedan bahar plain in terms of groundwater governance gg the groundwater governance indicators were evaluated using the structural equation modeling pls sem in general the status of the groundwater governance gg indicators in the region shows that these indicators are all lower than the standard level and are not in good condition based on the results the constructs of policy making β 0 867 information and data β 0 866 and stakeholder engagement β 0 859 had the greatest effect on the latent variable i e groundwater governance while the other constructs had a moderate effect among the three constructs of water governance the efficiency construct β 0 404 with the indicators of information and data budget legislation and innovative measures had the greatest impact on the governance of groundwater resources in hamedan bahar plain finally the overall goodness of fit gof 0 77 reflects the excellent fit of the model according to the results obtained the water system managers and policy makers in the province should increase stakeholders knowledge and awareness about new frameworks of water resources governance a robust framework is presented for policy makers and planners to identify the gaps and problems of water resources furthermore various aspects and features should be emphasized simultaneously so as to achieve sustainable governance of groundwater resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater indicators effectiveness efficiency trust and engagement agricultural development data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the legal right of landowners to use and access bodies of water close to their properties is known as water right based on the many types of water that border or exist on a property different types of water rights exist jackson 2018 depending on whether the surface water is permanent ephemeral or artificially created water rules might differ even within the class of surface water water law may be separated broadly into two substantive areas rights to utilize water and limitations on groundwater contamination macpherson 2019 groundwater is considered as one of the main resources of water worldwide fao 2018 increasing groundwater exploitation brings about negative impacts e g ecosystem damage surface water dewatering landslides etc on meeting the long term needs for water by natural systems and individuals rani et al 2022 the dramatic increase in groundwater use over the last half century has had significant social and economic implications as well as many consequences such as ecosystem damage surface water drying out landslides and sea water penetration all over the world balali and viaggi 2015 agricultural production largely depends on water and water resources are increasingly at risk oecd 2016 in recent years agricultural areas have increased worldwide leading to an increase in water demands miao et al 2021 in this respect unsustainable practices have led to serious groundwater depletion and degradation in many regions of the world thereby leading to a series of negative effects on people and the environment agudelo moreno et al 2020 asfaw and ayalew 2020 balali et al 2011 jia et al 2020 agricultural production has been influenced by major droughts resulting in a decrease in groundwater and surface water reserves miao et al 2021 pumping groundwater intensively for irrigation has resulted in the depletion of aquifers it might negatively affect environmental externalities and exert a considerable economic effect on the water sector and beyond the fao project related to the governance of groundwater 2018 indicates three times increase in extraction of groundwater over the last 50 years 1960 2010 barati et al 2019 for example groundwater is used for irrigation of nearly 100 million hectares of arable lands and more than 40 of uses through irrigation water döll et al 2012 oecd 2016 siebert et al 2010 furthermore about 11 of the groundwater discharge is consumed for irrigation in the international food trade dalin et al 2017 in a number of developing nations including iran frequent droughts along with intensive exploitation of surface and groundwater resources through a large network of hydraulic infrastructure and deep wells have brought the country s water to a critical level agutu et al 2020 balali et al 2011 custodio et al 2016 hamer et al 2020 havril et al 2018 wu et al 2020 west et al 2019 although complexity and uncertainty as well as climate change have increased over recent decades castells 2010 the development of new social technical environmental and economic subjects is important and needs to be addressed franco torres et al 2021 under these circumstances by increasing the dependence on groundwater water managers and policy makers should be aware about the quality and quantity of groundwater and they should make rational decisions concerning the preservation and allocation of resources added to this we have to emphasize that the groundwater considerations should be taken into account in agricultural energy and land use planning as well as in urban development and environmental policies rani et al 2022 moreover in order to achieve an integrated water management portfolio with adaptability and resilience to climatic change and drought it is critical to have effective groundwater management as mentioned by popovici et al 2021 van dijk 2012 gondo et al 2020 and franco torres et al 2021 it is not the lack of resources or knowledge financial constraints or technical issues that hinder sustainable development of the water sector rather socio institutional challenges including governance hinder its development furthermore debate and negotiation on the best way to reconcile the benefits and consequences of using groundwater are first and foremost a governance challenge rather than a technical issue foster and garduño 2013 extensive research has shown that problems and challenges cannot be overcome by technological upgrades alone instead what is emphasized and considered today is attention to social and organizational factors and their communication and interaction with each other bayat et al 2015 the challenge of water is seen as a problem of governance in the current century the defined local institutional capacity of which has been weakened by certain factors of social economic and political stress uker and fanany 2011 popovici et al 2021 according to the global water partnership gwp the water issue is primarily a governance catastrophe and this concept is frequently cited by international institutions such as the world bank the oecd and the un franco torres et al 2021 as a governance system water management involves various forms of control and management in water access meissner and jacobs 2016 oecd 2015a various public frameworks have been proposed to improve the governance of groundwater resources and most have confirmed that there is no plan for good governance that will work everywhere foster and ait kadi 2012

environmental and economic complexities gupta and conti 2017 it has been recognized that governance is an important challenge in reaching the long term sustainability of water resources oecd 2015a pahl wostl 2017 in this regard water governance means an environmental empowerment in which water management regulates or influences water resources strategies policies plans incentives and financial structures related to water resources when there is effective water governance relevant regulatory and legal frameworks and institutions are provided they enhance responsible measures and actions for protecting and ensuring water resources sustainability and optimizing the services and advantages achieved from these resources roy et al 2011 in most regions of iran groundwater is the main water resource hojjati and boustani 2010 and most of iran s agricultural lands depend on it barati et al 2019 in addition population growth has been estimated to reach 95 million over the next two decades iran currently has a population of more than 80 million and the quality and quantity conditions of water resources could be worsened by the expansion of climate change sadeghi 2017 the characteristics of arid and semi arid regions like iran include high evaporation unequal spatial and temporal distribution of water resources and low rainfall agricultural water governance is particularly important in such areas to this end water security and food security are influenced by decision making nazemi et al 2020 as noted in the contemporary history of legislation and policy making of water resources in iran negligence of the significance of water rights both economically and legally and water markets in addressing sustainability challenges is noticeable moreover there are not any clear criteria in legislation related to water to establish transparency in the water governance system nabavi 2017 the main factors for groundwater exhaustion in iran include the absence of optimal water governance hojjati and boustani 2010 moridi 2017 and mismanagement nabavi 2017 for instance groundwater level decline land subsidence and poor agricultural water efficiency are some of the main effects of ineffective water administration and management in iran the biggest water consuming sector sadeghi 2017 groundwater governance is seriously challenging and it has been considerably neglected despite a large number of works allocated to groundwater assessment barati et al 2019 therefore the main aim of this study was to investigate the principles of water governance and its effects on development of rural areas based on the model proposed by oecd the overuse of groundwater tables has posed serious problems and issues such as sinkholes and subsidence in agricultural lands therefore different countries have used different models and frameworks to cope with these implications and to improve groundwater tables depending on their social economic and legal conditions most activities on groundwater management in the world address the issues and barriers of attracting the cooperation and presence of stakeholders in the process of decision making and implementation however the oecd model has introduced an operational framework at a wide range for studying different factors influencing water resources considering the social economic and geographical systems thus the oecd water resources governance framework can identify the present and future problems and challenges by investigating the factors underpinning groundwater management and conservation in hamedan bahar plain according to pahl wostl 2009 and poudyal et al 2019 resource difficulties are caused by bad governance exposing the inadequacy of existing governance regimes to deal with current and future challenges nonetheless understanding of resource governance systems and how they develop is extremely limited major structural traits of governance regimes include the impact of formal and informal institutions the function of state and non state actors the pattern of multi level interactions and the relative significance of administrative hierarchies markets and networks change is seen as the result of society learning which develops in stages as it moves from single to double to triple loop learning informal networks are thought to be extremely important in such learning processes governance systems with a wider range of complexity and diversity are more adaptable the application of common conceptual frameworks that account for the true complexity of governance regimes can thus produce the knowledge base required to advance current understanding to a level that enables providing insightful policy advice goal conflicts are evident in this respect as demonstrated by the evaluation by van der voorn et al 2020 and policy makers must compromise between aims conflicts or synergies result from the method chosen to handle these trade offs the multi dimensional aspects of goal conflicts are thought to be better accounted for in multi target backcasting scenarios as a result this calls for a thorough multi target backcasting strategy that combines the advantages of backcasting nexus approaches and multi criteria analysis in previous studies the management of water resources was carried out to prevent water reduction and to solve the problems such as monitoring development and daily operations to maintain water resources under optimal conditions however when discussing governance different structural and institutional dimensions in which management activities are regulated are mentioned due to the fact that previous studies could not take into account the different dimensions of the groundwater resource system and resolve the existing problems in the area of water resources in this study we attempted to find and identify problems in the area of groundwater resources using the governance framework water governance contains several features that help to define the topic from many perspectives various and extensive frameworks such as the ostrom s iad framework blomquist and deleon 2011 bushouse 2011 heikkila et al 2011 oakerson and parks 2011 ostrom 2011 have been proposed in the field of water resources governance almost all these frameworks identify different and hidden dimensions and issues including norms stakeholders structures and laws that affect the sustainable governance of water resources these frameworks also examine the role and relationship of these components in the governance of water resources by considering different socio cultural institutional political in addition this framework assesses economic dimensions such as the ostrom s ses framework which establishes communication and interaction among the resource system resource unit and stakeholders governance system etc to achieve sustainable governance of resources the majority of these frameworks place a strong emphasis on governance indicators like legislation and public involvement which are crucial for implementing water policy the focus on other elements such as communication and monitoring is evidence of the policy applicability of research to water governance which frequently looks at recent changes in water regulations the indicative evidence gathered from a number of sources reveals that groundwater pollution has become a concern for the safety of drinking water in several regions of iran even on a worldwide scale the socio economic dependence on groundwater transcends the traditional distinctions between arid semi arid and humid regions stressing the need for governance solutions that are specifically tailored to the circumstances in which groundwater issues arise furthermore due to the relative youth of intensive groundwater use the gap between society and science technology is wider in the case of groundwater than it is in the case of surface water resources the availability of freshwater resources in iran has come under scrutiny due to the combined effects of rising demand and numerous layers of supply including canals from large but remote reservoirs dozens to hundreds of wells and small dams therefore there is a growing need to develop a groundwater governance framework that is pertinent to india s particular groundwater situation while iran struggles with managing its groundwater resources keeping in mind that millions depend on this resource and that vulnerability to scarcity and contamination is on the rise a framework for groundwater governance in iran is being developed as a result of this study and it is anticipated that these ideas will eventually be developed into more specific institutions practices and policies that will make up the foundation of groundwater governance in iran the oecd water resources governance framework is a universal framework as the experiences of 17 oecd members 13 latin american countries and some asian and african countries e g jordan and tunisia have been used in its development world health organization 2017 the key novelty and contribution of this work is that groundwater governance appears to be lacking even in situations when there is a high demand for water and a limited supply through an integrated examination along the three dimensions the features of the groundwater resource negative externalities issues and governance institutions this study looked at the social and institutional traditions in the area of iran s subsurface water resources this framework and its indicators have not been researched therefore the most significant feature of the uniqueness of this study is its evaluation of the oecd water resource governance metrics for iran s groundwater sector the purpose of this study was to evaluate the indicators of the oecd water resources governance in the improvement of underground water management in dasht bahar in hamedan in this regard the specific objectives of this study are as follows 1 the identification of gaps and shortcomings through the examination of the groundwater governance parameters using the oecd governance model 2 the determination of governance inadequacies in various levels and sectors of groundwater 3 the identification of barriers to effective groundwater management in addition to these objectives the oecd principles are based on the premise that there is no comprehensive and universal solution for the challenges and issues of water resources but the principles developed in different parts of the world are applicable therefore the present research aims to use the oecd principles composed of diverse sections including the legal system administrative system capacities and cooperation and communications to explore these principles and indices as per the local conditions of the hamedan bahar region considering the geographical and climatic conditions of the studied region 2 theoretical background groundwater governance gg water governance is defined as practices processes formal and informal and rules through which decisions are made and implemented to manage water resources and services with stakeholders expressing interest and decision makers being accountable oecd 2015a historically groundwater management was launched for highlighting the best practices in gg in 2011 and the gg project was inserted into political goals and decisions in 2016 groundwater governance 2018 gg is about decision making on groundwater involving individuals and or entities organized at various levels kulkarni et al 2015 comparing strom s framework as a multi level governance framework and the oecd it should be noted that strom s framework deals less with the institutional and structural dimensions of organizations and laws in indicators such as responsibility and accountability or innovation in actions however the framework provided by pahl wostl 2009 deals more with the investigation of adaptive capacity and systematic learning processes to analyze the characteristics of governance structures in addition this framework can provide other hidden layers to identify existing problems in the field of water resources and can be used as a complement to other frameworks such as the oecd framework pahl wostl 2009 mcginnis and ostrom 2014 however based on this study the oecd framework has a codified structure in examining and identifying different dimensions in the field of water resources governance it is noteworthy that the initial framework of the oecd groundwater governance was proposed on the basis of researches on the institutional framework of water governance in 17 oecd countries organisation for economic co operation and development 2018 and 13 latin american countries 2012 and also by conducting in depth multilateral political discussions of national participation in support of water reforms in mexico 2013 the netherlands 2014 jordan 2014 tunisia 2014 and brazil 2015 oecd framework provided guidelines have been prepared and compiled according to the experiences of different countries with different regional conditions oecd 2015a therefore considering that the oecd framework presents different and extensive dimensions in identifying the problems related to water sector and reaching a suitable and stable situation the aim of this study was to assess the governance status of the groundwater resources of hamedan bahar plain according to van der voorn et al s 2017 research access to clean drinking water has long been a top concern in many regions of the world to enhance water governance and how water requirement is defined and controlled address access disparities safeguard water quantity and quality and reuse it industrialized nations such as germany and the us have implemented a number of legal measures and institutional changes voltz and grischek 2018 for instance in big cities creative solutions like subsidized connection have been implemented to aid the most underprivileged neighborhoods however the current political climate emergency necessitates a reevaluation of the problems with water and its governance due to its particularly detrimental effects on water in areas where there is a danger of water shortage and drought preserving water sustainability is essential according to van der voorn et al 2017 as explicitly mentioned in the sustainable development goals the awra presented ten recommendations about sustainable groundwater management in the beginning of 2018 these recommendations are summarized as follows 1 to assess the resource 2 to build partnerships 3 to create a legal framework 4 to include groundwater considerations 5 to maintain sustainability 6 to respect ecosystems 7 to engage stakeholders 8 to commit to understanding 9 to safeguard assets and 10 to use interdisciplinary approaches awra 2018 gg comprises a collection of regionally unique institutional social and economic structures with various roles as a result of various water locations and the connections between their constituent parts gondo et al 2020 veettil et al 2011 barati et al 2019 kulkarni et al 2015 in addition it can be described as a process that determines who receives water when and how much undp 2015 the main goal of the fao led gg is raising awareness on the outstanding significance of groundwater resources as well as their sustainable management to avoid the threat of water crisis d agostino et al 2019 dillon et al 2012 pahl wostl et al 2013 a framework has been developed by the project for action on gg which includes some institutional and policy guidelines and best practices and recommendations fitting to local contexts for improving gg at cross border national and local levels morgera et al 2020 the purpose of designing the gg was to raise awareness of the importance of groundwater resources for many world regions and to identify and promote best practices in gg as a way for achievement of the sustainable management of groundwater resources it presents a framework related to regulations customs and laws for groundwater use as well as the processes for engagement of the private and public sectors and civil society shah 2014 the water related challenges are more complicated and locally diverse policy makers should attempt to boost the overall efficiency of water use by the agricultural sector decrease the impact of the sector on freshwater resources and enhance its flexibility against water risks oecd 2014 therefore as advocated by the oecd multiple policy responses are needed at different levels each of which fitted to specific water resource systems in order to help policy makers and address water resource issue the oecd analysis and indicators formulate policy responses define paths for making necessary policy changes and facilitate their implementation for moving agriculture towards sustainable water management oecd 2017 furthermore political guidance and thematic knowledge have been developed on the participation of stakeholders oecd 2015c the sovereignty of water regulators oecd 2015c and water sovereignty in cities oecd 2016 with the oecd s water governance standards water sovereignty has achieved its pinnacle fig 1 35 oecd member nations participated in a high level process in june 2015 to develop the oecd principles to promote effective equitable and efficient water policy oecd 2015a different stakeholders researchers practitioners policy makers etc use the oecd principles as a framework to assess the efficiency of water management and to be effective through discussions in a particular subdivision these indicators carry out specific tasks that are required to close the gaps found and offer stakeholders and governments a framework for self assessment there are several definitions of water governance in terms of the many aspects of water policy law and government which are frequently regarded in the literature as performance factors oecd 2015a water rights decentralization pricing accountability participation by the private sector and user groups integration and the institutional foundation of water management are among these factors rola et al 2012 araral and yu 2013 tatar et al 2019 the term governance stretches back to ancient greece when it was used to the state and the world bank merely adds that strong governance is important for growth and progress plattner 2013 not surprisingly the definitions and conception of governance have grown in recent times and have been used in different areas the term was generally expanded to include non governmental actors such as civil society private sector and non governmental organizations ngos rather than simply the state bernauer and betzold 2012 hasmath et al 2019 since the late 1980s the world bank has raised the issue of good governance mundy and verger 2015 erkkilä and piironen 2014 the report of the international organization for migration iom in 1989 for the first time defined good governance as providing efficient public services a reliable judicial system and an accountable administrative system bertoncello et al 2015 the oecd defines good governance as the ability to work with different environments to achieve balance at various local and international levels olfat and pishdar 2020 while hundreds of different and varied definitions can be found by a comprehensive search for governance definitions of key thinkers continue to be prepared the water organization has different purposes and services which include identifying the formation of water governance in a variety of contexts in performance evaluation and in designing lessons in different areas and for different reasons araral and wu 2013 water governance is seen as a range of social political administrative and economic systems designed for regulating the management and development of water resources and providing water services at various levels of society pahl wostl 2017 woodhouse and muller 2017 the use of multi center governance is focused on analyses at national and sub levels as a type of water management knieper and pahl wostl 2016 marshall et al 2013 thiel 2015 with a finite investigation of boundary watershed akamani and wilson 2011 da silveira and richards 2013 myint 2012 national and secondary actors have tested various forms of watershed governance with regional environmental history cook et al 2016 and catchment or river basin based authorities huitema and meijerink 2017 suhardiman et al 2012 in recent decade s research akram et al 2011 investigated the effect of the governance indicators on poverty and inequality and found that poor governance has an impact on increasing poverty in the long run in addition baltutis and moore 2019 estimated the indicators of good governance based on the quality of the services provided by the government in the case of water it is often aimed to optimize the allocation of resources for human use water is a crucial issue for all nations therefore most countries suffering from water crises in some of their regions have developed and implemented plans for the control or optimal use of their water resources one of the fundamental plans is associated with the use of groundwater resources which account for the largest part of available fresh water in the world 3 methodology 3 1 study area hamedan bahar plain is situated in hamedan province iran at latitudes 34 49 n and 35 02 n and longitudes 48 17 e and 48 33 e hamedan bahar aquifer has a total area of 480 km2 and the aquifer is unconfined balali and viaggi 2015 it has a semi arid and cold climate with a mean annual temperature of 11 c and an average annual precipitation of 324 mm balali and viaggi 2015 balali et al 2011 zamani et al 2020 hamedan bahar plain is one of the groundwater restricted areas groundwater extraction has had enormous social and economic effects during the last half century which continues to date nozari and zali 2013 the plain which is also called simineh river covers an area of 2459 km2 in the northern slopes of alvand mountains the area of the plain is 880 km2 with the surface area of the main aquifer of the plain amounting to 468 km2 and the area of the mountains amounting to 1579 km2 balali et al 2011 the aquifer is recharged by the direct infiltration of rainfalls the infiltration of surface flow the water returning from agricultural urban and industrial uses and the underground inflows and it is discharged by the abstraction of the groundwater for different uses and underground outflows balali et al 2011 increasing uncontrolled use of groundwater in this plain has caused a sharp reduction in the level of the station in the area and created problems such as increasing the depth of the wells increasing pumping costs and reducing water quality nozari and zali 2013 accordingly the groundwater level has constantly declined in recent decades which threatens the groundwater aquifer life in this region regional water company iran 2018 groundwater resources are the most important sources of agricultural water supply in the area more than 80 of the water needed by the agricultural sector and 50 of urban drinking water are provided from the groundwater resources of the plain seydan and ghadami firoozabadi 2018 as indicated by the research on the groundwater balance of the research area by adjusting agricultural policies optimal groundwater exploitation can be ensured in the agriculture sector considering the broad amount of aquifer water used in this region balali et al 2011 3 2 data collection method the aim of this study was to evaluate the gg indices based on the oecd model through a survey method in light of the survey research design this descriptive analytical study took advantage of 254 farmers in hamedan bahar plain the study used the pls sem process for evaluating the measurement and structural models through smart pls version 3 software the objective of the current work was to adapt this method to be appropriate for exploratory studies and theory development ali et al 2018 hair et al 2017 in order to measure and investigate gg the indicators and principles of the oecd model were used fig 3 then a questionnaire was developed all the items were evaluated using a 10 point likert s scale from 0 strongly low to 10 strongly high the effectiveness indicators of the oecd are related to government s contribution to determining clear policies and goals in the sustainability of water resources at all levels of government this requires the careful allocation of roles and responsibilities in water resources management as well as water policies on the proper scale and at different levels in the face of the challenges and complexities of water issues this indicator includes four items capacity policy coherence optimization and clear roles and responsibility fig 3 the efficiency indicators are related to government participation for maximizing the sustainable management benefits and water well being with the lowest cost for the community relying on sharing data and information about water mobilizing water resources implementing regulatory frameworks and supporting innovative water management practices cooperation among municipalities rural and urban partnerships etc for this indicator the oecd has proposed four items including information and data budgeting and financing regulatory framework and innovative governance the trust and engagement indicators are related to government s share of public trust and assuring the inclusion of stakeholders through democratic legitimacy and fairness related to the entire society see fig 4 the promotion of routine monitoring and evaluation to be adjusted as necessary trade management among water consumers urban and rural areas and generations trust and interaction with the mainstream of honesty and transparency for this part four items including integrity and transparency stakeholders engagement trade offs and monitoring have been presented finally we first developed a questionnaire based on the indices and sub sections provided by the oecd then its items and indices were validated by experts the validity and reliability of the indices were fitted by the structural equation model given the results of the model fitting it can be used in other regions and by other researchers 4 results 4 1 demographics the demographic characteristics of the farmers indicated that all farmers were male and in the age range of 22 80 with a mean value of 46 years in terms of educational level 38 had secondary education or a 12 year high school diploma 50 had a primary or secondary school degree and 12 were illiterate as for membership in the associations like village councils or cooperatives 45 were members of these associations but 55 were not regarding water ownership status 58 7 had private property 18 5 were tenants and 22 8 only had a partial right to use water hagh abeh in persian in terms of the water supply method 70 used wells 14 springs and 16 aqueduct in terms of irrigation methods 43 1 used rainy irrigation 9 5 used drip irrigation and 54 7 used furrow irrigation 4 2 the adequacy of indices and items measurement model the pls sem analysis of the 254 samples was done using smart pls 3 0 software ringle et al 2015 to assess the measurement and structural models the pls sem analysis was done through three steps first the measurement model outer model through the analysis of validity and reliability and confirmatory factor analysis was investigated in the second stage the structural model internal model was investigated using the path estimation among the variables holland 1999 in the final stage the model s overall fit was investigated the outer model complies with the pls measurement model in structural equations therefore table 1 presents the typical load fitting indicators in pls models that assess latent finding variables furthermore the indicators that determine the suitability of the measurement of variables in the pls models are as follows the average variance extracted ave cronbach s alpha loading factor r square and composite reliability cr according to table 1 all indicators are at the appropriate level in the following models the factor and the coefficients of determination among items and indicators have been shown all constructs in the present work showed a ca and a cr above 0 70 moreover the value of the loading indicator for all the items was above 0 5 it is acceptable assuming that the ave and cr establish the required thresholds ali et al 2018 moreover the ave of all the constructs was above 0 5 indicating an acceptable convergent validity as suggested by fornell and larcker 1981 the discriminant validity is assessed using the heterotrait monotrait htmt ratio and in contrast to the traditional criterion proposed by fornell and larcker 1981 it is possible to use it to assess covariance and variance based structural equation models therefore when the htmt ratio is used the correlation value should be smaller than 0 85 as demonstrated by voorhees et al 2016 the cut off value of 0 85 for the htmt ratio is at a very good level in the current work an htmt of 0 85 is used for evaluating discriminant validity the results of the discriminant validity assessment for the measurement model using the htmt ratio are given in table 2 the final results of the path analysis of the measurement model are presented in table 4 fig 5 shows the output of the pls algorithm command this command is used to extract the coefficients of external loads and path coefficients see fig 6 4 3 general model fit gof criterion the gof criterion is used to evaluate the general model fit that includes three values 0 01 0 25 and 0 36 as weak medium and strong values for gof respectively manuel et al 2009 vinzi et al 2010 table 3 in order to fit the overall model which controls the measurement and structural models the criterion is calculated as follows gof communalities r2 gof 9 34 9 2 12 0 77 gof was calculated to be 0 77 which is higher than the recommended value of 0 36 therefore it can be concluded that the research model had in general an optimal fit 4 4 path analysis results and investigating research hypotheses the pls sem was employed as an approach of statistical analysis in the present study and the indicators contributing to gg in hamdan bahar plain areas were investigated the three indicators discussed in this study included efficiency effectiveness and trust and engagement each demonstrating a significant and positive impact on gg to perform a path analysis first a path diagram must be drawn which illustrates the direct and indirect effects of each variable i e the effect of x on the other variable of y additionally the bootstrap method was used to assess the path coefficients of the structural model with 5000 samples as shown by the results the impact of high levels of efficiency β efic gg 0 404 p 0 001 effectiveness β efct gg 0 38 p 0 001 and trust and engagement β tae gg 0 29 p 0 001 had a positive relationship with gg which supports the hypothesis hence h1 h2 and h3 were confirmed the significance of the effects and path coefficients are presented in fig 2 and table 4 therefore it can be concluded that these variables are important in inducing the improvement of gg effective on the site in hamdan bahar plain insert table 4 5 discussion groundwater resources have long been considered by human societies and are considered strategic resources in all regions at present the role and significance of water resources sustainability and in particular their role in the sustainability of the rural and agricultural community are being considered at different levels therefore water resource management has been proposed to protect and enhance groundwater resources through involvement and cooperation of the government and the public in this study the status of the gg indicators in hamadan bahar plain of iran has been assessed by using the definitions and the framework provided by the oecd in general the status of the gg indicators in the region showed that these indicators are all lower than the standard level and are not in good condition this result is in conformity with that of the previous studies by thomann et al 2020 who studied lack of evaluation of actions and plans in management of groundwater and lack of transparency in the guidelines of groundwater governance mirnezami and bagheri 2017 assessed the ineffectiveness of water governance un terms of capacity to carry out policies ghafouri fard et al 2015 investigated close interaction and participation in decision making in water governance ghaemi et al 2016 assessed emphasis on public participation training and capacity building in water governance there were weaknesses in some indicators such as accountability transparency responsibility legislation and capacity building which prevent some organizations and institutions from performing their duties well and from achieving water resources protection goals in a critical situation this is in line with the findings of other studies for example agudelo moreno et al 2020 assessed knowledge upgrade and sustainable management of groundwater resources asfaw and ayalew 2020 analyzed management and protection of groundwater resources and hérivaux and grémont 2019 investigated increasing awareness and tackling environmental problems among the three dimensions of water governance the efficiency dimension with the indicators of information and data budget legislation and innovative measures has the greatest impact on the governance of groundwater resources in hamadan bahar plain and can be said to be a precondition for other dimensions of water governance this dimension focuses on accurate and transparent information which requires for a budget and strong regulations to access and provide this should be sought in the relevant legal documents therefore in order to access sustainable and appropriate water governance in the region serious attention should be paid to accurate and reliable information and data for decision making and policy making this finding is in agreement with the study by thomann et al 2020 who studied lack of transparency in guidelines of groundwater governance mirnezami and bagheri 2017 assessed weakness of water governance in implementing policies and poor capacity hamer et al 2020 investigated accessible database system the importance of knowledge in policy making and appropriate legislation custodio et al 2016 and barati et al 2019 evaluated increasing the penetration rate and reducing the exploitation rate of groundwater resources a single indication is more crucial and efficient in every aspect of government in the efficiency dimension information and data in the effectiveness dimension policy and in the trust and engagement dimension the indicators of stakeholder engagement are more important and effective the indicator of information and data is one of the most important elements in a decision making system without awareness of the current situation planning to achieve the desired situation will not be possible the transparent and reliable information and data help organizations policy makers and stakeholders to protect the valuable assets of groundwater resources and increase their productivity and added value dissemination of free statistics and information is the first step to achieving transparency and transparency is the first step towards gaining the trust of people the trust of the people is the seedbed of their participation in a decision making or management process moreover transparency of information makes organizations and individuals more responsible in their duties today governments around the world believe that systematically access to more information for the public is an important asset for positive social and economic changes in general it can be concluded that the availability of information and data will increase the participation of people and elites in all government processes including problem finding recognizing and prioritizing problems formulating strategies implementation monitoring and evaluation of government processes furthermore it makes a country s water management system accountable responsible and optimized this finding is in harmony with the findings of the study by enteshari and safavi 2019 transparency is the first step in reforming governance and achieving good governance javadzadeh et al 2020 assessed anthropogenic activity excessive exploitation of groundwater for irrigation hérivaux and grémont 2019 investigated the valuing of ecosystem services via raising awareness and involving stakeholders in the assessment process in the effectiveness dimension the policy indicator has a special role and importance this indicator provides the necessary basis for the effective participation of stakeholders thus with the relevant policy the engagement and participation of stakeholders and their representatives can be legally provided in the process of decision making furthermore the absence of clear policies in water resources governance in the agricultural sector leads to contradiction and conflict in this sector and in water management this finding is in conformity with the investigations by vahid and ranjbar 2019 lack of stakeholders and non governmental participation in the water resources policy making process is one of the reasons for the inefficiency of water policies mirnezami and bagheri 2017 lack of solidarity and coordination coherence in the components of governance results in non implementation of groundwater protection policies the stakeholders engagement is another important factor influencing the governance of water resources in fact one of the basic principles of water governance is the involvement and participation of all stakeholders in the decision making process and implementation and policy making process of water resources management these results have been supported by the previous findings by ghaemi et al 2016 emphasis on public participation education and capacity building should be considered by policy makers in a decision making and planning process based on islam et al s 2020 findings there is a gap in creating coordination technical capacity transparency implementation and citizen participation singh et al 2019 emphasized a coherent approach including inclusive knowledge and technology new policy making and community participation thomann et al 2020 achieved the expected results of stakeholders communication through transparency in planning sarami et al 2022 considered policy factors innovation and creativity in actions and financing as the three important indicators in improving the governance of groundwater resources unfortunately the government does not interpret interaction correctly and still considers it the only way to improve the situation and to control externally the consumption behavior of stakeholders the majority of the remedies that have been suggested are of the engineering construction and external control type rather than measures for democratic participation what is important is that the same and unified policies must be considered in line with the vision of sustainable development based on resource capacity and participatory governance finally it should be noted that each of the dimensions and indicators of governance is important and effective and ignoring any of them will cause imbalance and failure to achieving sustainable development goals and programs as a result all aspects and indicators of water governance should be addressed and a synergy should be established by developing and strengthening each of them in order to ensure sustainable governance of groundwater resources in fact the governance should be also about strategic planning and based on a guiding vision a guiding perspective can actually unify disparate policies and expand the various levels covered by governance van der voorn et al 2012 according to van der voorn et al 2012 vision formation is critical to success but visions have been increasingly prevalent since humans acquired a need to know what would happen in the future in truth visioning is a process used to assist a group of stakeholders in generating a common future vision these visions can be found in a variety of circumstances albeit in differing shapes e g corporate political religious and personal and with varying levels of content detail future visions on the other hand will frequently arise without any significant investigation according to research by van der voorn et al 2012 a powerful vision gains power from the authoritative leader pursuing it and steering participants in the desired path though it is possible that what comes out of visioning will not be as robust authoritative and unambiguous as the powerful vision that makes structural couplings possible as a result the existing governance environment is very fragmented and maintains a significant distance from the ideal future prospects in order to fulfill the objectives of sustainable development this necessitates a broad mobilization in water governance according to the findings of this study it can be concluded that in order to overcome the limitations related to the socio cultural aspects of the oecd framework the attitudes of community members should be considered as shown in the study of van der voorn 2008 the power distance is a measurement of the acceptance of a hierarchy of power and wealth by the individuals who make up the general population of a nation culture or business this criterion measures the degree to which less powerful members of society are expected to accept and value unequally distributed wealth and power the great power gap shows that inequality of power and wealth has been instilled in a society in contrast low power distance represents a society in which the differences between power and wealth of the people seem to be in harmony opportunities and equality for all are constrained in such societies accordingly socio cultural aspects in the framework of the oecd can be classified into the following five criteria low versus high power distance the power gap influences societal acceptance of hierarchical position differentiation it assesses how much less powerful individuals of a society tolerate and expect inequitable distribution of power and income power and wealth disparities are ingrained in society as evidenced by a high power distance a short power distance on the other hand indicates a society in which discrepancies in power and wealth appear to be synchronized the acceptability of hierarchical position differentiation in a society is influenced by the power differential it investigates the degree to which a society s weaker members accept and anticipate unequal power and wealth distribution inequalities in power and wealth have permeated society as shown by a sizable power distance additionally a society with a minimal power distance is one in which the differences in power and wealth seem to be balanced in such societies there are limits on everyone s equality and opportunity individualism versus collectivism individuals are incorporated into organizations through strong links in a collectivistic culture it strengthens extended families and collectives in which everyone is responsible for their group s members individuals in an individualistic society have poor bonds with one another masculinity versus femininity the acceptance of gender role diversity in a society is emphasized by this criterion men and women share the same caring values of life in feminine societies females are treated equally in all social aspects in such communities with no differentiation and discrimination between genders moreover in a patriarchal society these ideals are decisive and competitive and there are deep gaps between the values of men and women it implies a significant degree of gender discrimination and differentiation as well as the dominance of males in the social and political sectors short versus long term orientation this indicates if national cultures are more long term or short term focused in their decision making processes a long term oriented civilization works for compatibility with its changing environment to do so such a society seeks to adapt its existing rituals and traditions to new situations challenges or threats short term oriented societies on the other hand tend to stick to ancient traditions and customs regardless of future changes in the unfixed environment this study was faced with two main limitations first accessing the location of the study and data gathering were difficult because of the limitations caused by the covid 19 secondly some limitations were related to the oecd model which was concentrated more on social and economic aspects while other issues were ignored i e technical and infrastructures ones for future studies it is recommended that the socio economic aspects of the oecd model be considered alongside with other aspects 6 conclusion with regard to current management strategies as well as macro plans and policies it is imperative to pay attention to the indicators and components of groundwater resource governance in this regard what is important is the interrelated cycle among the different dimensions of the governance model as any defect in any of its dimensions and indicators will upset the balance and governance cycle of groundwater resources in this study due to the comprehensiveness of the dimensions of water resources governance presented by the oecd model the status of the groundwater resources governance indicators in hamadan bahar plain was investigated the results of construct validity estimation including factor loading ave convergent validity divergent validity and cr and gof indicators indicate the quality and proper fit of the groundwater resource governance measurement model based on the results some reasons such as lack of organizational innovation lack of clear and imperative laws lack of transparent information and collective management cause the inability of institutions to implement water resources management regarding the lack of organizational innovation the current situation is in a manner that the organizations in charge of water resources management follow a magisterial and hierarchical system and this has weakened the interaction among organizations and key actors therefore to get out of this problem it is suggested to use a responsible creative and innovative team for the groundwater resources management system in a coordinated and structured way that can implement the goals and policies of water resources governance well the next item that will improve the governance of groundwater resources is the existence of a formulated practical and innovative legal framework the transparent and innovative laws such as the law of reducing the government s role and leaving tasks to the people play an important role in this regard therefore it is necessary to be creative and innovative in passing and implementing new laws about reducing the role of the government increasing the interaction and participation of people and leaving tasks to them another solution is the availability of transparent accurate and timely information in policy making however a correct policy will lead to adoption of appropriate laws that are compatible with the conditions of the region the involvement of stakeholders and ultimately better governance of groundwater resources another problem with groundwater resource governance is that it does not adequately support collective management for example water users associations can be involved in decision making projects but this is a rare occurrence and their role and importance are not taken into account evidence and many studies indicate that local collective and participatory management can be the most effective approach to establishing good governance one of the benefits of participation is the increase in the sense of beneficiaries ownership and the improvement of governance outputs if a bottom up participatory approach is implemented the participation will be stronger and local stakeholders empowerment will be increased the intended amount of engagement is determined by the regional circumstances that we wish to promote in local collective management organizations and associations will be more supportive the supportive laws and mechanisms will be one of the effective items and ways to improve stakeholders participation regarding the many capacities opportunities and advantages that exist in terms of human resources and natural capital in the region these potentials must be used to achieve the goals of groundwater resources management in the region it is suggested that through the consensus and collaboration of elites and experts existing challenges and weaknesses be identified and effective measures be taken to improve the governance of water resources for this purpose changing the existing rules and structures and adopting effective strategies are essential to strengthen the private sector government and society in general the results show that the oecd water resources governance framework is useful for studying and identifying the needs and implementing policies and new plans since this framework has 12 principles and related subsections it has successfully encompassed all dimensions and factors that are important for identifying and advancing the goals the point to consider is that the framework has a comprehensive mode that needs to be customized based on local conditions and features therefore its comprehensiveness causes all factors to be aggregated and helps draw the attention of officials and policy makers it also contributes to raising the awareness of officials and stakeholders about what they had no awareness of and making them responsible and accountable since water and water resources are among the important and challenging topics of all areas water officials and policy makers should welcome new knowledge and frameworks in order to be able to manage water and its related issues in the best possible way eventually these studies are very helpful in creating awareness and knowledge among officials and policy makers thereby influencing their decisions and programs the research evaluated the governance of groundwater resources in hamedan bahar plain quantitatively using a questionnaire however it seems necessary to supplement quantitative research with qualitative research in order to identify individual and environmental attributes of each region and the local stakeholders motives in attempts for developing region specific policies and programs it is recommended that future research consider different factors and aspects underpinning groundwater management and maintenance in addition to identifying the status quo and proposing approaches declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper questionnaire for

11658,mental models are the dynamic internal cognitive representations of people s interaction with the world such models can be used to gain insights into how humans structure their beliefs and actions about environmental issues this research paper aims to understand the mental models of sustainable groundwater management among farmers in semi arid regions of maharashtra india using a mixed method approach of qualitative interviews and systems mapping we assess how past experiences with drought and water scarcity have influenced farmers beliefs perceptions and actions and develop mental models that highlight the dynamic processes that guide farmer actions regarding groundwater use and management we identify policy triggers that can nudge farmers toward sustainable groundwater management in the future our results reveal three key insights i farmers who experience higher water scarcity have a higher desire for groundwater conservation and higher consciousness towards future groundwater sustainability ii farmers actions towards either increased groundwater extraction or conservation are shaped by complex social environmental and institutional dynamics rather than self interested individual will and iii supply driven water policies and initiatives can lead to maladaptive outcomes such as an increase in groundwater extraction in the long run current water policies need a transformative shift from focusing on short term groundwater supply to those that facilitate long term sustainable groundwater management by influencing the norms values and behavior toward groundwater conservation future interventions that allow and encourage collective mobilization enhanced ownership and participation adequate training financial resources and decentralized management structures with enhanced accountability are likely to be more effective in developing long term solutions for sustainable groundwater management graphical abstract image 1 keywords sustainability groundwater management mental models droughts water scarcity systems thinking data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is a critical element in arid and semi arid landscapes as it forms a limited resource tied deeply to human livelihoods growth and development burmil et al 1999 as such water presence or lack of holds significant meaning to individuals and communities living in these regions who have historically used groundwater as a buffer against rainfall variability however population growth increase in agricultural production higher irrigation demand droughts and water scarcity have augmented the exploitation of groundwater reserves bierkens and wada 2019 india contributes to 23 of global groundwater depletion for irrigation dalin et al 2017 it is estimated that continued exploitation of india s groundwater resources combined with increased rainfall variability and drought incidences will likely lead to a severe water crisis in the future especially in arid regions dangar et al 2021 garduno and foster 2010 mukherji et al 2013 nair and indu 2020 narula et al 2011 the scarcity and conflict surrounding groundwater manifest themselves prominently in the drylands in india especially the hard rock aquifer regions in western india bharucha 2019 brunner et al 2010 wagle et al 2012 arid and semi arid regions can be particularly vulnerable to groundwater depletion incidences of droughts and water scarcity may exacerbate excessive groundwater extraction petersen perlman et al 2022 earlier works on water issues in india often focused on the physical availability of water as a function of water demand and supply dhawan 2017 moench 1998 with water management decisions often guided by hydrological engineering perspectives that focused on technical solutions to short term availability and supply of water kumar 2018 saroha 2017 scholars increasingly recognize the need to move beyond a utilitarian understanding of water and incorporate social science perspectives in water related policy research and development including an enhanced focus on issues such as differential access to water based on socio economic factors such as caste class gender etc asprilla echeverria 2021 kumar 2018 lafaye de micheaux and jenia 2021 shah and narain 2019 further groundwater management is a complex socio ecological problem with many interconnected positive and negative feedbacks between the social and ecological climatological hydrological components of the system barreteau et al 2016 rica et al 2017 developing solutions to sustainable groundwater management requires a systems approach for understanding the feedback and interrelations between the various social ecological institutional as well as behavioral aspects of groundwater use and management elsawah and guillaume 2016 mitchell et al 2012 pahl wostl et al 2007 kumar and singh 2007 our study contributes to this effort by focusing on the behavioral aspects of groundwater management including motivations beliefs norms and actions and develops mental models of groundwater management among farmers in semi arid regions of maharashtra india the mental models highlight how groundwater management decisions and actions are shaped by complex social climatological hydrological and institutional dynamics we use the framework proposed by corral verdugo et al 2006 to understand the time perspective of farmers experiences compartmentalized as past present and future frames of beliefs perceptions attitudes actions and expectations around groundwater management according to corral verdugo et al 2006 time perspective is learned through modifications by personal social and institutional factors and can be used as a framework to codify store and recall experiences goals and imaginary contexts as illustrated in fig 1 we explore the individual cognitive perceptions of groundwater related issues in the past and present time frames as well as beliefs motivations and solutions for groundwater sustainability in the future the objectives of this study were three fold i to understand how past experiences with drought and water scarcity have influenced farmers beliefs perceptions and actions ii to identify the dynamic processes that influence farmer actions regarding groundwater use and management and iii identify policy triggers that can nudge people towards sustainable groundwater management these findings enable an understanding of the cognitive and behavioral aspects of groundwater management that is often lacking in the water discourses in india and elsewhere in addition the development of mental models of groundwater management using a systems perspective provides an improved understanding of the dynamic manner through which the social environmental behavioral and institutional components of groundwater management operate in relation to each other together these results provide a direction for existing water policies and government interventions towards achieving sustainable groundwater management outcomes in the following sections we provide an overview of mental models section 2 we then elaborate on the study area section 3 and methodology including data collection processing model development and analysis section 4 section 5 presents the results sections 6 and 7 discuss results and limitations of the study followed by the conclusion in section 8 2 mental models overview mental models originated in psychology and cognitive sciences and are defined as cognitive representations of external reality that allow people to interact with the world by anticipating events reasoning and forming explanations ford and johnson laird 1985 johnson laird 2004 jones et al 2011 mental models are particularly useful for a qualitative inquiry into the environmental cognition of individuals which entails understanding how humans structure their thoughts about environmental issues how such cognitions form change over time and influence future behavior and actions henry and dietz 2016 such cognitive mapping enables people to form individual perceptions of reality based on past experiences downs and meyer 1978 mental models can be instrumental in exploring differences and similarities in stakeholders understanding of an issue integrating different perspectives aiding in the decision making processes of complex resource systems and enabling social learning jones et al 2011 pahl wostl and hare 2004 in the context of natural resource management mental models have been used to improve the understanding and communication of perceptions of climate change lowe and lorenzoni 2007 rangeland management abel et al 1998 forestry management klenk et al 2008 food security friedrichsen et al 2018 rivers et al 2018 and water resource management kolkman et al 2007 levy et al 2003 according to jones et al 2011 mental models differ from concept maps or diagrammatic representations of cognition due to their dynamic nature which allows an individual to simulate possible outcomes or possibilities before deciding or performing an action mental models can also change over time based on new information that reshapes existing cognitive constructs the dynamic nature of mental models has been of particular interest to the system dynamics community because of their ability to represent the perceived cause and effect dynamics of a phenomenon doyle and ford 1998 kaine et al 1999 by uncovering the hidden information feedback and delays that inhibit the sustainable functioning of a natural resource mental models can help gain a deeper understanding of complex dynamical systems these thought patterns or cognitive factors are then converted into visual diagrams models that connect the concepts and relations highlighted by individuals mental models of individuals and groups can be elicited through either direct or indirect mental modeling approaches jones et al 2011 direct elicitation techniques involve the use of pictures words and symbols that enable participants to visually represent their understanding of an issue for example see fuzzy cognitive mapping gray et al 2015 2014 özesmi and özesmi 2004 or the conceptual content cognitive map 3 cm kearney and kaplan 1997 indirect elicitation techniques involve the construction of mental models through concepts and relations extracted from verbal texts or written documents carley and palmquist 1992 we used the indirect elicitation of mental models where individuals verbally expressed their experiences beliefs values and understandings about groundwater management in the form of open ended interviews 3 study area the western semi arid regions of india are emblematic of water struggles in the way water forms the root of political and social conflict and strife brunner et al 2010 wagle et al 2012 maharashtra is one of the largest states in western india with agriculture as the major source of income for over 60 of the population the state can be divided into nine agroclimatic zones see fig 2 based on rainfall patterns soil characteristics and cropping patterns gom 2010 the geological formation in maharashtra is primarily basalt rock which is characterized by low permeability and lack of porosity wescoat 2019 thus low water retention capacity and rainwater run offs combined with low rainfall patterns have led to low groundwater levels in the region kumar et al 2008 in recent decades climate change has caused an increased frequency of droughts in the region with irregular and low intensity rainfall and extended periods of dry spells guhathakurta and saji 2013 such droughts create significant disruptions in agricultural production and have led to severe economic environmental and social distress among farmers resulting in distress driven migration rising rural household debts high rates of farmer suicides declining soil productivity and food insecurity udmale et al 2014 katalakute et al 2016 4 methodology 4 1 data collection data in the form of extensive narratives was collected from 43 respondents in six villages across four blocks in two districts in maharashtra we applied purposive sampling to obtain a heterogeneous sample that represented diverse socio hydrological characteristics such as gender landholding size and agro climatic zone the sample villages see table 1 were selected based on two criteria the agro climatic zone and whether any prior watershed related work had been conducted in the village two villages each were selected from the scarcity transition zone and assured rainfall agro climatic zones see fig 2 selection of villages ensured a diverse coverage of socio hydrological contexts in each village the research team along with the village sarpanch village head chief and key village representatives conducted a mapping exercise to identify the key landmarks school temple water resources farm ponds rivers community wells and layouts of houses streets and community hamlets within the village the number of interviews in villages in each agro climatic zone was determined after the research team reached a saturation point when no new insights were being generated with additional interviews guest et al 2006 the distribution of interviews based on gender and farmer type is outlined in table 2 the interviews were conducted in marathi or hindi by the research team the average length of the interviews was about 60 75 min a set of core open ended questions was asked to each respondent with follow up questions where needed respondents were asked open ended questions including but not limited to what were the challenges you faced regarding agriculture and water in the past what did you do to address those challenges what were the institutional processes that enabled you to address those challenges what are the challenges you face with agriculture and water now how do you cope with these challenges what will be the status of water and its problems in the future what could be possible solutions to water problems and issues additional questions included but were not limited to conflicts regarding water management institutional actions and challenges and perspectives of future generations on sustainability issues 4 2 data analysis 4 2 1 data processing the interviews were transcribed from audio to marathi by a team of transcribers who had observed the interview process and hence knew the context and were less prone to make interpretive errors the transcribed interviews were then translated into english by professional translators to ensure good quality translations such that contexts and meanings were not lost the translations were cross checked and reviewed by the core research members to ensure consistency and accuracy 4 2 2 thematic coding we used dedoose version 9 0 17 los angeles california an online qualitative analysis platform to code the transcribed interviews coding can be either open or closed which means that either the coding rubrics can be predetermined closed or generated during the process of coding open respectively glaser and strauss 1965 we conducted two rounds of coding by a team of three coders who coded the interviews separately to ensure intercoder reliability the first round of coding was conducted by three coders using closed coding the coding rubric was composed of 25 codes and subcodes see fig 3 the second round included the coding of excerpts from the first round of coding and was conducted separately by two coders using open coding which led to the emergence of secondary codes and sub codes examples of secondary coding rubrics codes and subcodes for past water related challenges and actions are highlighted in fig 3 dedoose is a collaborative qualitative analysis software that ensures blind coding as well as document coding this allowed us to check the codes case by case to help cover as much relevant information as possible and ensure intercoder reliability 4 2 3 content analysis content analysis is a method used to analyze rich contextual qualitative data by applying the concepts and themes identified through the coding process to describe organize and analyze a phenomenon kolbe and burnett 1991 the systematic coding and categorizing of data within content analysis enables researchers to identify trends and patterns of concepts and their frequency and relationships vaismoradi et al 2013 percentage frequency was calculated by dividing the total count of coding instances for a particular code for each agro climatic zone by the total number of code counts for all zones stemler 2000 for example low groundwater levels a secondary sub code was mentioned as a present water related challenge by respondents across all agroclimatic zones here 20 of the total number of instances where low groundwater level was mentioned were from respondents from the transition zone 65 from the scarcity zone and 15 from the assured rainfall zone see the appendix for a table of frequency counts and percentages for all primary and secondary codes for the study 4 2 4 mental model development while content analysis allowed us to identify patterns and trends in the data mental models enabled us to contextualize the information emergent from the content analysis from a systems thinking perspective this process entailed drawing causal relationships by linking the events described by the respondent bower and morrow 1990 the mental models were developed in the form of causal loop diagrams using vensim version 9 3 2 software we followed the mental model construction method by kumar 2018 where the process of elicitation of mental models through causal loop diagrams is similar to creating a story that makes sense of the world and can serve as a precursor to a theory in the first step following the content analysis the primary variables for the mental models for each agro climatic zone scarcity transition zone and assured rainfall were selected based on the codes with higher frequency counts in the second step additional variables were identified from textual data that were directly linked to the primary variables relationships between the variables such as causes consequences and constraints were identified to link the variables together a series of links of such variables that formed a recurrent feedback loop or pathways were identified for example water scarcity primary variable led to an increase in government funding additional variable that led to an increase in the construction of pipelines primary variable which led to an increase in competition for groundwater primary variable increased groundwater competition further drove excessive extraction of groundwater additional variable leading to a further increase in water scarcity primary variable this linked causal structure forms a positive feedback loop that is reinforcing in nature as opposed to a negative feedback loop that is balancing in nature groessera and schaffernicht 2012 similarly various causal structures and loops were identified and superimposed on each other to make a collective mental model three separate mental models were constructed to represent each agro climatic zone in each of the agro climatic zone mental models the links between variables were represented through weighted arrows depending on the frequency count of the variable links that directly or indirectly lead to groundwater conservation were highlighted in green while links that directly or indirectly lead to groundwater extraction were highlighted in blue 5 results 5 1 scarcity zone 5 1 1 past present and future trajectories on agriculture and water related issues results of the content analysis show that the key past agricultural challenges in the scarcity zone were climatic risks such as rainfall uncertainty 60 code frequency water scarcity 36 low crop production 43 low rainfall 33 low crop diversity 25 and low income 17 these challenges led to agricultural actions of rainfed 42 and subsistence farming 42 primarily including the cultivation of food crops such as sorghum millet and maize 35 farmers in the scarcity zone also reported lack of irrigation water availability as the key challenge in the past 67 along with low water quality 20 and lack of water related infrastructures such as wells dams etc 20 respondents recalled a series of institutional changes that occurred in the past to enable farmers to address such challenges government bodies constructed water infrastructure such as check dams and pipelines 50 respectively gram panchayats constructed pipelines 40 and increased the provision of water supply through water tankers 25 non governmental organizations focused on community mobilization 16 to promote watershed development 9 and water conservation structures 37 5 such changes led to present agricultural actions such as the cultivation of food 48 as well as cash crops 19 with intensive agricultural practices such as increased use of open and drip irrigation 67 and 43 respectively use of improved crop varieties and inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides 17 along with the use of farm machinery 14 respondents also highlighted additional water related challenges in the present such as excessive rainwater run off 80 dysfunctional water infrastructure system 71 water scarcity 57 and low water quality 20 respondents also highlighted the prevalence of use of borewells 75 provision of water through purchase of water tankers 85 use of drip irrigation 38 extraction of water through motor pumps 46 water conservation measures 45 and use of sprinkler irrigation 17 and farm ponds 17 according to the respondents despite the institutional actions by government bodies gram panchayats and non governmental organizations ngos the area continues to experience agricultural challenges at present such as low income 83 low crop production 63 low rainfall 38 and water scarcity 23 with additional agricultural challenges such as excessive rainfall 22 excessive use of chemical fertilizers 30 and pests and wildlife crop destruction 50 respondents also expressed farming as undesirable 50 and overwhelmingly responded that off farm jobs were more desirable than farming 75 in the scarcity zone the desire to conserve groundwater was expressed more 42 than the desire to extract more water 25 farmers in the scarcity zone expressed a positive view of the future state of water 67 which might explain their desire to conserve more water respondents highlighted several possible future solutions for water sustainability including water conservation measures banning of borewells afforestation water storage and recycling structures knowledge dissemination and training on water conservation and cultivation of improved crop varieties see appendix a code frequencies for a detailed comparison between zones 5 1 2 mental model of groundwater management in scarcity zone the mental model of groundwater management in the scarcity zone shows four stronger pathways of groundwater management that led to an increase in the extraction of groundwater highlighted in blue with thicker arrows denoting higher code frequency and two weaker causal pathways that led to the conservation of groundwater in the region highlighted in green with thinner arrows denoting lower code frequency the seven causal pathways are as follows and can be referred to in fig 4 causal pathway 1 extraction low rainfall increase in water scarcity increase in rainfed agriculture increase in subsistence farming increase in food crop cultivation increase in irrigation demand increase in need for water infrastructure increase in construction of borewells increase in open irrigation increase in extraction of groundwater decrease in groundwater availability increase in water scarcity causal pathway 2 extraction low rainfall rainfall uncertainty increase in water scarcity increase in agricultural risks decrease in farming desirability increase in farming pessimism increase in outmigration increase in income increase in use of crop inputs increase in cash crop production increase in construction of borewells increase in open irrigation increase in extraction of groundwater decrease in groundwater availability

water conservation structures increase in conservation of groundwater increase in groundwater availability decrease in water scarcity causal pathway 7 conservation increase in water scarcity increase in droughts increase in non governmental organizations initiatives increase in watershed development increase in drip irrigation construction of water conservation structures increase in conservation of groundwater increase in groundwater availability decrease in water scarcity 5 2 transition zone 5 2 1 past present and future trajectories on agriculture and water related issues the most recalled past agricultural challenges in the transition zone were food insecurity 100 low crop production 50 low rainfall 33 low income 33 rainfall uncertainty 20 and water scarcity 21 similar to the scarcity zone these challenges led to rainfed 50 and subsistence farming 60 with the cultivation of food crops 45 farmers in the transition zone also highlighted low water quality 40 water scarcity 20 lack of irrigation water 20 and lack of irrigation infrastructures 20 as key water related challenges in the past common water related actions included construction of dug wells 38 manual water collection from nearest water sources 32 use of dug wells for irrigation 32 excessive groundwater extraction 15 and use of pipeline water supply 11 farmers recalled institutional actions undertaken by government bodies such as water supply schemes 75 pipeline construction 60 and other water infrastructures such as dams 20 respondents also mentioned the role of non governmental organizations for the collective mobilization of community members 33 for watershed development 27 and the construction of conservation structures 25 such institutional actions enabled the cultivation of food 29 as well as cash crops 21 but with higher recall for intensive agricultural practices such as increased use of improved crop varieties 50 crop inputs 50 use of farm machineries 43 and use of open and drip irrigation 33 and 14 respectively the key agricultural challenges at present were excessive use of chemical fertilizers 60 excessive rainfall 33 water scarcity 31 low crop production 25 and low rainfall 25 respondents highlighted present water related actions such as the use of motor pumps 46 to fill high volume water storage structures 50 farmers also reported the use of farm ponds 17 and use of tanker water supply along with some use of drip irrigation 13 and sprinkler irrigation 17 additional water related challenges in the present were low water quality 40 dysfunctional water infrastructure systems 29 lack of income 25 social conflicts in water sharing 25 and water scarcity 16 although the respondents in the transition zone expressed either pessimistic 62 or uncertain 57 views on the future state of water and agriculture none of the respondents expressed a desire to extract more water instead they expressed the desire to conserve water 21 respondents also expressed farming as an undesirable livelihood 38 farmers highlighted several possible future solutions for water sustainability including irrigation structures to address water scarcity afforestation to decrease water runoff building water storage and recycling structures and water conservation measures to increase groundwater levels these solutions focused on increasing the short term availability of water for agricultural consumption as well as the long term conservation of water see appendix a code frequencies for a detailed comparison between zones 5 2 2 mental model of groundwater management in the transition zone the mental model of farmers in the transition zone fig 5 shows similar patterns with the mental model of the scarcity zone with stronger causal pathways for groundwater extraction and weaker pathways for groundwater conservation however while the main drivers of groundwater extraction in the scarcity zone were low rainfall and water scarcity the main drivers of groundwater extraction in the transition zone were food insecurity and the desire to improve crop yield and production the model shows four key causal pathways two pathways that led to groundwater extraction and two pathways that led to groundwater conservation causal pathway 1 extraction low rainfall increase in water scarcity increase in rainfed agriculture increase in subsistence farming increase in food crop cultivation increase in irrigation demand increase in the need for water infrastructure increase in construction of borewells increase in open irrigation increase in extraction of groundwater decrease in groundwater availability increase in water scarcity causal pathway 2 extraction decrease in rainfall decrease in crop yield decrease in food crop production decrease in food security increase in loans increase in income increase in construction of dug wells use of water pumps increase in extraction of groundwater decrease in groundwater availability increase in water scarcity causal pathway 3 conservation decrease in rainfall increase in droughts increase in water scarcity increased desire to conserve increase in construction of water conservation structures increase in conservation of groundwater decrease in groundwater availability increase in water scarcity causal pathway 4 conservation increase in water scarcity increase in droughts increase in non governmental organizations initiatives increase in watershed development increase in drip irrigation construction of water conservation structures increase in conservation of groundwater increase in groundwater availability decrease in water scarcity 5 3 assured rainfall zone 5 3 1 past present and future trajectories on agriculture and water related issues the key agricultural challenges in the past highlighted by farmers in the assured rainfall zone were low crop diversity 75 low income 50 water scarcity 43 low rainfall 33 and rainfall uncertainty 20 unlike the scarcity and transition zones farmers in this zone were involved in cash crop cultivation cotton sugarcane 100 along with the cultivation of food crops 19 through rainfed farming 8 farmers in the assured rainfall zone reported key water related challenges in the past such as lack of water infrastructure 60 water scarcity 45 low water quality 40 and lack of irrigation water 17 which reportedly led to excessive extraction of groundwater 46 construction of borewells and dug wells 38 purchase of water through water tankers 35 and use of pipeline water supply 22 respondents recalled a series of institutional changes such as watershed development 64 through collective community mobilization 50 community participation through voluntary labor donation shramdaan training workshops 100 financial institutions 100 and savings groups 89 government led construction of water infrastructure 57 subsidies 100 and water stewardship activities 100 agriculture in the assured rainfall zone improved with the adoption of new agricultural actions such as the use of drip and sprinkler irrigation 43 improved crop varieties 33 farm machineries 43 and crop inputs fertilizers and pesticides 33 farmers started to cultivate a diversity of food 23 and cash 60 crops the challenge of water scarcity 46 due to low rainfall 38 and losses due to excessive rainfall 44 persisted along with newer challenges such as market price fluctuation 17 low production 13 crop loss due to attack of pests and wildlife 20 and excessive use of chemical fertilizers 10 farmers reported the use of farm ponds 67 purchase of tank water 64 manual water collection 60 from common water sources wells rivers tankers etc for household purpose and agriculture as well as water related challenges such as excessive groundwater extraction 38 social conflicts in water sharing 75 low income 50 low water quality 40 excessive rainwater run off 20 and water scarcity 27 farmers expressed a higher desire to extract more groundwater 75 and a lower desire to conserve water 36 further respondents in the assured rainfall zone showed the highest desirability for farming as a livelihood source 77 compared to transition and scarcity zones 8 and 15 respectively they also showed the least desirability 25 for off farm jobs as a livelihood source fewer farmers expressed a positive view of the future water state 33 and a small percentage 14 expressed an uncertain view none of the respondents expressed a pessimistic view of the future water state farmers in the assured rainfall zone highlighted future solutions for water sustainability such as irrigation structures water conservation measures knowledge dissemination for conservation and reduction of water runoff see appendix a code frequencies for a detailed comparison between zones 5 3 2 mental model of groundwater management in assured rainfall zone unlike the mental models of groundwater management in scarcity and transition zones where causal pathways for groundwater extraction were stronger than the pathways of groundwater conservation figs 4 and 5 the mental model of assured rainfall zone shows a balance of pathways for both groundwater extraction and conservation fig 6 the main drivers for groundwater extraction were cultivation of cash crops which increased demand for irrigation along with water scarcity driven desire to extract groundwater the main drivers for groundwater conservation were water scarcit which increased the desire to conserve as well as watershed development and water stewardship initiatives by non governmental organizations we find two pathways that led to groundwater extraction and three pathways that lead to groundwater conservation causal pathway 1 extraction stable rainfall increase in food crop cultivation cash crop production increase in irrigation demand increase in need for water infrastructure increase in construction of borewells increase in open irrigation increase in extraction of groundwater decrease in groundwater availability increase in water scarcity causal pathway 2 extraction decrease in rainfall increase in droughts increase in water scarcity increase in desire to extract increase in construction of borewells increase in water related conflicts increase in groundwater competition increase in use of water pumps increase in extraction of groundwater decrease in groundwater availability increase in water scarcity causal pathway 3 conservation decrease in rainfall increase in droughts increase in water scarcity increase in water scarcity increase in desire to conserve increase in collective mobilization increase in participation of watershed development increase in construction of water conservation structures increase in conservation of groundwater increase in groundwater availability decrease in water scarcity causal pathway 4 conservation increase in water scarcity increase in droughts increase in non governmental organizations initiatives increase in participation with watershed development increase in training workshops increase in maintenance of conservation structures increase in water stewardship initiatives increase in conservation of groundwater increase in groundwater availability decrease in water scarcity causal pathway 5 conservation increase in water scarcity increase in droughts increase in non governmental organizations initiatives increase in collective mobilization increase in collective savings groups increase in income increase in use of drip and sprinkler irrigation increase in conservation of groundwater increase in groundwater availability 6 discussion groundwater management is highly complex with interdependent social environmental technological and institutional dynamics operating within the system pahl wostl et al 2007 transition towards sustainable and adaptive groundwater management regimes require an understanding of how these dynamics operate in relation to each other and how management decisions and behavior evolve within these contextual relations this also includes closing the science people policy gap by incorporating perspectives on the beliefs norms and motivations of people regarding sustainable water management tracing problems and histories of human experience give us insights into how people s beliefs and actions are shaped and gives us critical information on how people can be nudged towards pro environmental behavior learning from our results we offer three key broad level insights from our study farmers who experience higher water scarcity have a higher desire for groundwater conservation and higher consciousness towards future groundwater sustainability our analysis shows that despite high levels of water scarcity related distress farmers in the scarcity and transition zone expressed a higher desire to conserve rather than extracting groundwater by contrast farmers in the assured rainfall zone expressed a higher desire to extract groundwater for agriculture our study confirms insights from other scholars that people s perceptions of water scarcity can form a strong motivation for their desire for water conservation cauberghe et al 2021 hannibal et al 2019 holland et al 2019 while the availability of steady assured water supply can weaken public will for strong conservation policies brown 2017 our analysis shows that farmers in the scarcity and assured rainfall zones expressed a positive view on the future sustainability of water while farmers in the transition zone expressed either pessimistic or uncertain views about the future sustainability of groundwater resources according to corral verdugo et al 2006 people who focus on the present and have short term goals have a lower sustainability consciousness than those who focus on the future and have long term goals our study demonstrates that farmers in the scarcity zone have a higher sustainability consciousness in their desire to conserve groundwater for future generations and suggested numerous long term future solutions that could be implemented to promote groundwater conservation and sustainability in contrast farmers in the assured rainfall zone showed a lower sustainability consciousness and a short term focus on income generation through extraction of groundwater resources the desire to conserve groundwater amongst farmers manifests in their experiences of water scarcity in the past and their observations of continuing depletion of groundwater in the present as encapsulated by a quotation from a farmer in the scarcity and transition zone when asked about their vision for the future in fifteen twenty years there will be a serious water problem one will not get a liter of water all the problems will be caused by water if there is no water there is nothing people still do not understand the importance of water water is life the less water you use from the farm ponds or wells the more water you can use in the future if we use too much water it becomes a habit and therefore the water does not suffice if we draw more water the water tends to run off when it rains the rainwater should be used in a just manner these insights show that it is an oversight to view farmers only as consumers of the resource people s engagement with groundwater resources is influenced by their beliefs about the future state of the resource future interventions that encourage sustainable groundwater management by influencing behavior norms and values around groundwater management as a common pool resource see ostrom 1999 would be more effective in the long run farmers actions towards either increased groundwater extraction or conservation are shaped by social environmental and institutional dynamics rather than self interested individual will various scholars have attempted to explain the rationale behind why farmers might engage in unsustainable and excessive groundwater extraction such as self interest lack of economic or regulatory incentives or misperceptions about resource availability khair et al 2019 a widespread assumption tied to the implementation of individual groundwater extraction measures despite high operating costs is that farmers have a myopic perception that values short term exploitation of water resources for immediate profit rather than long term conservation of limited water resources de frutos cachorro et al 2021 khair et al 2019 vaidyanathan 1996 some scholars attribute farmers high rates of extraction of groundwater to a lack of knowledge about the groundwater resources system and its invisibility joshi and aslekar 2018 according to pahl wostl and hare 2004 state controlled regulation of groundwater extraction has been largely ineffective due to weak social legitimacy where people view groundwater as a right and entitlement rather than a limited resource in other words the perception that every man is entitled to use his well the way he wishes is very strong and legitimized phansalkar and kher 2006 pg 78 the mental models from our study contradict the simplistic view of farmers as profit maximizing or ignorant agents who extract groundwater for short sighted self interest the models show that groundwater management actions are guided by a multiplicity of social environmental and institutional factors that are interlinked with each other these factors operate in a dynamic way to steer farmers actions towards either groundwater extraction or conservation environmental and social factors such as rainfall droughts agricultural risks food security irrigation demand crop production groundwater competition and social conflicts shape farmers desires and motivations to varying degrees here the role of institutional factors such as government led initiatives for the construction of irrigation infrastructure or ngo led initiatives for watershed management and community mobilization become important in determining which pathways become dominant we observe this push and pull dynamic between extraction versus conservation in all three climate zones but with different outcomes in the scarcity and transition zones government led interventions for enhanced water supply such as the provision of water tankers and construction of irrigation infrastructures such as borewells pipelines dams etc increased social conflicts and groundwater competition resulting in widespread groundwater extraction on the other hand as we see in the assured rainfall zone ngo led initiatives for watershed development and groundwater conservation steered the dynamics towards increased groundwater conservation through community mobilization and knowledge dissemination however as ngos withdrew from the villages other factors such as increase in cash crop production increased desirability of farming and use of intensive agricultural practices shifted the dynamics again towards groundwater extraction our study demonstrates how broader policy signals institutional actions to steer system outcomes towards either groundwater extraction or conservation here farmers are complex actors embedded and operating within broader social ecological and political environments however most solutions for effective groundwater management assume individual farmers as selfish actors who need to either be regulated or educated to prevent them from extracting groundwater this assumption overlooks the role of state policy in steering farmers actions and outcomes and falls under the system archetype of shifting the burden senge et al 1994 wolstenholme 2003 where implemented solutions often ignore the primary problem because addressing it is more difficult supply driven water policies and initiatives can lead to maladaptive outcomes such as an increase in groundwater extraction in the long run in an analysis of the multiplicity of views on water issues and solutions for water management in india kumar 2018 highlights that water related policies and management decisions in india have been guided mostly through water engineering perspectives that promote a command control approach to water management such approaches often focus on supply driven technical solutions for short term access to water such as improved irrigation through subsidized electricity construction of large dams with canals and mega water supply projects however such solutions are often rendered maladaptive and lead to increased competition among agricultural users for water resources social conflicts and increased inequities in access to water resources shah 2021 shah and narain 2019 vaidyanathan 1996 the mental models reveal that interventions that support an increase in water supply through government led initiatives such as the provision of water tankers construction of pipelines electricity subsidies for irrigation farm pond subsidies etc can lead to reinforcing feedbacks that further drives groundwater competition and subsequent extraction thus they often result in inequitable outcomes that exacerbate water scarcity in the region we see an example of such a maladaptive outcomes in the case of farm ponds which were originally promoted to serve as rainwater harvesting structures the maharashtra state government provided financial subsidies of up to inr 50000 around 750 usd or 70 75 of the cost of farm pond construction to promote its use among farmers however as rainfall became increasingly unpredictable farmers opted to use the farm ponds as groundwater storage structures instead in this context the intended use of farm ponds as water rainwater harvesting and conservation structures turned to large scale storage structures for groundwater and precipitated a further extraction of groundwater reserves fig 7 shows field photograph of the use of such farm ponds as high volume water storage structures by a large scale farmer in the study area our study demonstrates the pathways through which short term solutions for addressing water scarcity can often lead to maladaptive outcomes in the long run the aforementioned example illustrates the systems archetype of fixes that fail where a short term solution works initially but creates deleterious effects over time and may even worsen the situation senge et al 1994 further communities can often rise to be stewards of groundwater as demonstrated by their participation and collective action in past watershed development works also see grassini 2019 our study confirms that past watershed development initiatives in india were successful due to community trust cooperation and participation through sharing of labor and costs and facilitated through financial technical and knowledge inputs from non governmental organizations joshi et al 2004 kolavalli and kerr 2002 sharma et al 2011 rica et al 2017 however most of these programs remained concentrated efforts that failed to sustain or scale up beyond the specific community village or region due to the dependency of such programs on external funding kerr 2002 in our study farmers highlighted how poverty and lack of financial resources can be an inhibitor in the collective mobilization of people to promote sustainable groundwater management 7 limitations narula et al 2011 notes that mental models are often incomplete and inaccurate representations of reality and hence are useful in understanding people s cognitive limitations in this study the mental models are constructed based on information as recalled by our study participants and hence may be incomplete as such the mental models represent an incomplete understanding of how past and present experiences of farmers in socio hydrological systems shape actions regarding groundwater extraction and conservation we chose to highlight the agro ecological zone based differences in farmers mental models instead of social dimensions social differences between people s cognitive perceptions based on class caste and gender are important aspects of groundwater management since they directly influence instances of competition conflicts and cooperation within groundwater resource management this forms an area that warrants future studies finally while our sample size of 44 respondents is a good number for a qualitative study we do not intend to generalize our findings for the different agro ecological zones instead the focus is to develop a contextualized information rich understanding of mental models of farmers regarding groundwater management and how beliefs motivations and actions around groundwater management are shaped 8 conclusion direct and indirect impacts of climate change pose a severe threat to the long term sustainability of water resources in india goyal and surampalli 2018 these impending changes exacerbated by population change agriculture and water consumption patterns call for policy adjustments and transitions that recognize the dynamic feedback structures within the various components of socio hydrological systems and give individuals groups and institutions enhanced agency to transform groundwater regimes towards sustainability and equity haeffner et al 2018 our study shows that farmers in the scarcity zone expressed more desire to conserve water and were optimistic about the future status of water conservation despite higher water related distress and pessimism about farming as a viable means of livelihood this finding counters the assumptions of farmers as myopic profit oriented actors and shows that groundwater management decisions are guided through an interplay of complex dynamics within social environmental and institutional factors these dynamics can often shift behavior towards groundwater extraction or conservation short term supply driven water policies can exacerbate groundwater extraction by amplifying groundwater competition resulting in maladaptive outcomes current water policies need a transformative shift from focusing on improving the physical availability and supply of water to those that encourage sustainable groundwater management by influencing behavior norms and values around water management future interventions that allow and encourage collective mobilization enhanced ownership and participation adequate training financial resources and decentralized management structures with enhanced accountability are likely to be more effective in developing long term solutions for sustainable groundwater management funding this work was supported by funding from corporate social responsibility support provided by hsbc hongkong and

11658,mental models are the dynamic internal cognitive representations of people s interaction with the world such models can be used to gain insights into how humans structure their beliefs and actions about environmental issues this research paper aims to understand the mental models of sustainable groundwater management among farmers in semi arid regions of maharashtra india using a mixed method approach of qualitative interviews and systems mapping we assess how past experiences with drought and water scarcity have influenced farmers beliefs perceptions and actions and develop mental models that highlight the dynamic processes that guide farmer actions regarding groundwater use and management we identify policy triggers that can nudge farmers toward sustainable groundwater management in the future our results reveal three key insights i farmers who experience higher water scarcity have a higher desire for groundwater conservation and higher consciousness towards future groundwater sustainability ii farmers actions towards either increased groundwater extraction or conservation are shaped by complex social environmental and institutional dynamics rather than self interested individual will and iii supply driven water policies and initiatives can lead to maladaptive outcomes such as an increase in groundwater extraction in the long run current water policies need a transformative shift from focusing on short term groundwater supply to those that facilitate long term sustainable groundwater management by influencing the norms values and behavior toward groundwater conservation future interventions that allow and encourage collective mobilization enhanced ownership and participation adequate training financial resources and decentralized management

india often focused on the physical availability of water as a function of water demand and supply dhawan 2017 moench 1998 with water management decisions often guided by hydrological engineering perspectives that focused on technical solutions to short term availability and supply of water kumar 2018 saroha 2017 scholars increasingly recognize the need to move beyond a utilitarian understanding of water and incorporate social science perspectives in water related policy research and development including an enhanced focus on issues such as differential access to water based on socio economic factors such as caste class gender etc asprilla echeverria 2021 kumar 2018 lafaye de micheaux and jenia 2021 shah and narain 2019 further groundwater management is a complex socio ecological problem with many interconnected positive and negative feedbacks between the social and ecological climatological hydrological components of the system barreteau et al 2016 rica et al 2017 developing solutions to sustainable groundwater management requires a systems approach for understanding the feedback and interrelations between the various social ecological institutional as well as behavioral aspects of groundwater use and management elsawah and guillaume 2016 mitchell et al 2012 pahl wostl et al 2007 kumar and singh 2007 our study contributes to this effort by focusing on the behavioral aspects of groundwater management including motivations beliefs norms and actions and develops mental models of groundwater management among farmers in semi arid regions of maharashtra india the mental models highlight how groundwater management decisions and actions are shaped by complex social climatological hydrological and institutional dynamics we use the framework proposed by corral verdugo et al 2006 to understand the time perspective of farmers experiences compartmentalized as past present and future frames of beliefs perceptions attitudes actions and expectations around groundwater management according to corral verdugo et al 2006 time perspective is learned through modifications by personal social and institutional factors and can be used as a framework to codify store and recall experiences goals and imaginary contexts as illustrated in fig 1 we explore the individual cognitive perceptions of groundwater related issues in the past and present time frames as well as beliefs motivations and solutions for groundwater sustainability in the future the objectives of this study were three fold i to understand how past experiences with drought and water scarcity have influenced farmers beliefs perceptions and actions ii to identify the dynamic processes that influence farmer actions regarding groundwater use and management and iii identify policy triggers that can nudge people towards sustainable groundwater management these findings enable an understanding of the cognitive and behavioral aspects of groundwater management that is often lacking in the water discourses in india and elsewhere in addition the development of mental models of groundwater management using a systems perspective provides an improved understanding of the dynamic manner through which the social environmental behavioral and institutional components of groundwater management operate in relation to each other together these results provide a direction for existing water policies and government interventions towards achieving sustainable groundwater management outcomes in the following sections we provide an overview of mental models section 2 we then elaborate on the study area section 3 and methodology including data collection processing model development and analysis section 4 section 5 presents the results sections 6 and 7 discuss results and limitations of the study followed by the conclusion in section 8 2 mental models overview mental models originated in psychology and cognitive sciences and are defined as cognitive representations of external reality that allow people to interact with the world by anticipating events reasoning and forming explanations ford and johnson laird 1985 johnson laird 2004 jones et al 2011 mental models are particularly useful for a qualitative inquiry into the environmental cognition of individuals which entails understanding how humans structure their thoughts about environmental issues how such cognitions form change over time and influence future behavior and actions henry and dietz 2016 such cognitive mapping enables people to form individual perceptions of reality based on past experiences downs and meyer 1978 mental models can be instrumental in exploring differences and similarities in stakeholders understanding of an issue integrating different perspectives aiding in the decision making processes of complex resource systems and enabling social learning jones et al 2011 pahl wostl and hare 2004 in the context of natural resource management mental models have been used to improve the understanding and communication of perceptions of climate change lowe and lorenzoni 2007 rangeland management abel et al 1998 forestry management klenk et al 2008 food security friedrichsen et al 2018 rivers et al 2018 and water resource management kolkman et al 2007 levy et al 2003 according to jones et al 2011 mental models differ from concept maps or diagrammatic representations of cognition due to their dynamic nature which allows an individual to simulate possible outcomes or possibilities before deciding or performing an action mental models can also change over time based on new information that reshapes existing cognitive constructs the dynamic nature of mental models has been of particular interest to the system dynamics community because of their ability to represent the perceived cause and effect dynamics of a phenomenon doyle and ford 1998 kaine et al 1999 by uncovering the hidden information feedback and delays that inhibit the sustainable functioning of a natural resource mental models can help gain a deeper understanding of complex dynamical systems these thought patterns or cognitive factors are then converted into visual diagrams models that connect the concepts and relations highlighted by individuals mental models of individuals and groups can be elicited through either direct or indirect mental modeling approaches jones et al 2011 direct elicitation techniques involve the use of pictures words and symbols that enable participants to visually represent their understanding of an issue for example see fuzzy cognitive mapping gray et al 2015 2014 özesmi and özesmi 2004 or the conceptual content cognitive map 3 cm kearney and kaplan 1997 indirect elicitation techniques involve the construction of mental models through concepts and relations extracted from verbal texts or written documents carley and palmquist 1992 we used the indirect elicitation of mental models where individuals verbally expressed their experiences beliefs values and understandings about groundwater management in the form of open ended interviews 3 study area the western semi arid regions of india are emblematic of water struggles in the way water forms the root of political and social conflict and strife brunner et al 2010 wagle et al 2012 maharashtra is one of the largest states in western india with agriculture as the major source of income for over 60 of the population the state can be divided into nine agroclimatic zones see fig 2 based on rainfall patterns soil characteristics and cropping patterns gom 2010 the geological formation in maharashtra is primarily basalt rock which is characterized by low permeability and lack of porosity wescoat 2019 thus low water retention capacity and rainwater run offs combined with low rainfall patterns have led to low groundwater levels in the region kumar et al 2008 in recent decades climate change has caused an increased frequency of droughts in the region with irregular and low intensity rainfall and extended periods of dry spells guhathakurta and saji 2013 such droughts create significant disruptions in agricultural production and have led to severe economic environmental and social distress among farmers resulting in distress driven migration rising rural household debts high rates of farmer suicides declining soil productivity and food insecurity udmale et al 2014 katalakute et al 2016 4 methodology 4 1 data collection data in the form of extensive narratives was collected from 43 respondents in six villages across four blocks in two districts in maharashtra we applied purposive sampling to obtain a heterogeneous sample that represented diverse socio hydrological characteristics such as gender landholding size and agro climatic zone the sample villages see table 1 were selected based on two criteria the agro climatic zone and whether any prior watershed related work had been conducted in the village two villages each were selected from the scarcity transition zone and assured rainfall agro climatic zones see fig 2 selection of villages ensured a diverse coverage of socio hydrological contexts in each village the research team along with the village sarpanch village head chief and key village representatives conducted a mapping exercise to identify the key landmarks school temple water resources farm ponds rivers community wells and layouts of houses streets and community hamlets within the village the number of interviews in villages in each agro climatic zone was determined after the research team reached a saturation point when no new insights were being generated with additional interviews guest et al 2006 the distribution of interviews based on gender and farmer type is outlined in table 2 the interviews were conducted in marathi or hindi by the research team the average length of the interviews was about 60 75 min a set of core open ended questions was asked to each respondent with follow up questions where needed respondents were asked open ended questions including but not limited to what were the challenges you faced regarding agriculture and water in the past what did you do to address those challenges what were the institutional processes that enabled you to address those challenges what are the challenges you face with agriculture and water now how do you cope with these challenges what will be the status of water and its problems in the future what could be possible solutions to water problems and issues additional questions included but were not limited to conflicts regarding water management institutional actions and challenges and perspectives of future generations on sustainability issues 4 2 data analysis 4 2 1 data processing the interviews were transcribed from audio to marathi by a team of transcribers who had observed the interview process and hence knew the context and were less prone to make interpretive errors the transcribed interviews were then translated into english by professional translators to ensure good quality translations such that contexts and meanings were not lost the translations were cross checked and reviewed by the core research members to ensure consistency and accuracy 4 2 2 thematic coding we used dedoose version 9 0 17 los angeles california an online qualitative analysis platform to code the transcribed interviews coding can be either open or closed which means that either the coding rubrics can be predetermined closed or generated during the process of coding open respectively glaser and strauss 1965 we conducted two rounds of coding by a team of three coders who coded the interviews separately to ensure intercoder reliability the first round of coding was conducted by three coders using closed coding the coding rubric was composed of 25 codes and subcodes see fig 3 the second round included the coding of excerpts from the first round of coding and was conducted separately by two coders using open coding which led to the emergence of secondary codes and sub codes examples of secondary coding rubrics codes and subcodes for past water related challenges and actions are highlighted in fig 3 dedoose is a collaborative qualitative analysis software that ensures blind coding as well as document coding this allowed us to check the codes case by case to help cover as much relevant information as possible and ensure intercoder reliability 4 2 3 content analysis content analysis is a method used to analyze rich contextual qualitative data by applying the concepts and themes identified through the coding process to describe organize and analyze a phenomenon kolbe and burnett 1991 the systematic coding and categorizing of data within content analysis enables researchers to identify trends and patterns of concepts and their frequency and relationships vaismoradi et al 2013 percentage frequency was calculated by dividing the total count of coding instances for a particular code for each agro climatic zone by the total number of code counts for all zones stemler 2000 for example low groundwater levels a secondary sub code was mentioned as a present water related challenge by respondents across all agroclimatic zones here 20 of the total number of instances where low groundwater level was mentioned were from respondents from the transition zone 65 from the scarcity zone and 15 from the assured rainfall zone see the appendix for a table of frequency counts and percentages for all primary and secondary codes for the study 4 2 4 mental model development while content analysis allowed us to identify patterns and trends in the data mental models enabled us to contextualize the information emergent from the content analysis from a systems thinking perspective this process entailed drawing causal relationships by linking the events described by the respondent bower and morrow 1990 the mental models were developed in the form of causal loop diagrams using vensim version 9 3 2 software we followed the mental model construction method by kumar 2018 where the process of elicitation of mental models through causal loop diagrams is similar to creating a story that makes sense of the world and can serve as a precursor to a theory in the first step following the content analysis the primary variables for the mental models for each agro climatic zone scarcity transition zone and assured rainfall were selected based on the codes with higher frequency counts in the second step additional variables were identified from textual data that were directly linked to the primary variables relationships between the variables such as causes consequences and constraints were identified to link the variables together a series of links of such variables that formed a recurrent feedback loop or pathways were identified for example water scarcity primary variable led to an increase in government funding additional variable that led to an increase in the construction of pipelines primary variable which led to an increase in competition for groundwater primary variable increased groundwater competition further drove excessive extraction of groundwater additional variable leading to a further increase in water scarcity primary variable this linked causal structure forms a positive feedback loop that is reinforcing in nature as opposed to a negative feedback loop that is balancing in nature groessera and schaffernicht 2012 similarly various causal structures and loops were identified and superimposed on each other to make a collective mental model three separate mental models were constructed to represent each agro climatic zone in each of the agro climatic zone mental models the links between variables were represented through weighted arrows depending on the frequency count of the variable links that directly or indirectly lead to groundwater conservation were highlighted in green while links that directly or indirectly lead to groundwater extraction were highlighted in blue 5 results 5 1 scarcity zone 5 1 1 past present and future trajectories on agriculture and water related issues results of the content analysis show that the key past agricultural challenges in the scarcity zone were climatic risks such as rainfall uncertainty 60 code frequency water scarcity 36 low crop production 43 low rainfall 33 low crop diversity 25 and low income 17 these challenges led to agricultural actions of rainfed 42 and subsistence farming 42 primarily including the cultivation of food crops such as sorghum millet and maize 35 farmers in the scarcity zone also reported lack of irrigation water availability as the key challenge in the past 67 along with low water quality 20 and lack of water related infrastructures such as wells dams etc 20 respondents recalled a series of institutional changes that occurred in the past to enable farmers to address such challenges government bodies constructed water infrastructure such as check dams and pipelines 50 respectively gram panchayats constructed pipelines 40 and increased the provision of water supply through water tankers 25 non governmental organizations focused on community mobilization 16 to promote watershed development 9 and water conservation structures 37 5 such changes led to present agricultural actions such as the cultivation of food 48 as well as cash crops 19 with intensive agricultural practices such as increased use of open and drip irrigation 67 and 43 respectively use of improved crop varieties and inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides 17 along with the use of farm machinery 14 respondents also highlighted additional water related challenges in the present such as excessive rainwater run off 80 dysfunctional water infrastructure system 71 water scarcity 57 and low water quality 20 respondents also highlighted the prevalence of use of borewells 75 provision of water through purchase of water tankers 85 use of drip irrigation 38 extraction of water through motor pumps 46 water conservation measures 45 and use of sprinkler irrigation 17 and farm ponds 17 according to the respondents despite the institutional actions by government bodies gram panchayats and non governmental organizations ngos the area continues to experience agricultural challenges at present such as low income 83 low crop production 63 low rainfall 38 and water scarcity 23 with additional agricultural challenges such as excessive rainfall 22 excessive use of chemical fertilizers 30 and pests and wildlife crop destruction 50 respondents also expressed farming as undesirable 50 and overwhelmingly responded that off farm jobs were more desirable than farming 75 in the scarcity zone the desire to conserve groundwater was expressed more 42 than the desire to extract more water 25 farmers in the scarcity zone expressed a positive view of the future state of water 67 which might explain their desire to conserve more water respondents highlighted several possible future solutions for water sustainability including water conservation measures banning of borewells afforestation water storage and recycling structures knowledge dissemination and training on water conservation and cultivation of improved crop varieties see appendix a code frequencies for a detailed comparison between zones 5 1 2 mental model of groundwater management in scarcity zone the mental model of groundwater management in the scarcity zone shows four stronger pathways of groundwater management that led to an increase in the extraction of groundwater highlighted in blue with thicker arrows denoting higher code frequency and two weaker causal pathways that led to the conservation of groundwater in the region highlighted in green with thinner arrows denoting lower code frequency the seven causal pathways are as follows and can be referred to in fig 4 causal pathway 1 extraction low rainfall increase in water scarcity increase in rainfed agriculture increase in subsistence farming increase in food crop cultivation increase in irrigation demand increase in need for water infrastructure increase in construction of borewells increase in open irrigation increase in extraction of groundwater decrease in groundwater availability increase in water scarcity causal pathway 2 extraction low rainfall rainfall uncertainty increase in water scarcity increase in agricultural risks decrease in farming desirability increase in farming pessimism increase in outmigration increase in income increase in use of crop inputs increase in cash crop production increase in construction of borewells increase in open irrigation increase in extraction of groundwater decrease in groundwater availability increase in water scarcity causal pathway 3 extraction increase in droughts increase in water scarcity increase in government funding for drought relief increase in construction of pipelines increase in groundwater competition increase in water related social conflicts increase in construction of borewells increase in open irrigation increase in extraction of groundwater decrease in groundwater availability increase in water scarcity causal pathway 4 extraction increase in water scarcity increase in droughts increase in government funding for drought relief increase in water supply schemes increase in purchase of water tankers decrease in water quality increase in desire to extract increase in construction of borewells increase in extraction of groundwater decrease in groundwater availability increase in water scarcity causal pathway 6 conservation decrease in rainfall increase in droughts increase in water scarcity increased desire to conserve increase in construction of water conservation structures increase in conservation of groundwater increase in groundwater availability decrease in water scarcity causal pathway 7 conservation increase in water scarcity increase in droughts increase in non governmental organizations initiatives increase in watershed development increase in drip irrigation construction of water conservation structures increase in conservation of groundwater increase in groundwater availability decrease in water scarcity 5 2 transition zone 5 2 1 past present and future trajectories on agriculture and water related issues the most recalled past agricultural challenges in the transition zone were food insecurity 100 low crop production 50 low rainfall 33 low income 33 rainfall uncertainty 20 and water scarcity 21 similar to the scarcity zone these challenges led to rainfed 50 and subsistence farming 60 with the cultivation of food crops 45 farmers in the transition zone also highlighted low water quality 40 water scarcity 20 lack of irrigation water 20 and lack of irrigation infrastructures 20 as key water related challenges in the past common water related actions included construction of dug wells 38 manual water collection from nearest water sources 32 use of dug wells for irrigation 32 excessive groundwater extraction 15 and use of pipeline water supply 11 farmers recalled institutional actions undertaken by government bodies such as water supply schemes 75 pipeline construction 60 and other water infrastructures such as dams 20 respondents also mentioned the role of non governmental organizations for the collective mobilization of community members 33 for watershed development 27 and the construction of conservation structures 25 such institutional actions enabled the cultivation of food 29 as well as cash crops 21 but with higher recall for intensive agricultural practices such as increased use of improved crop varieties 50 crop inputs 50 use of farm machineries 43 and use of open and drip irrigation 33 and 14 respectively the key agricultural challenges at present were excessive use of chemical fertilizers 60 excessive rainfall 33 water scarcity 31 low crop production 25 and low rainfall 25 respondents highlighted present water related actions such as the use of motor pumps 46 to fill high volume water storage structures 50 farmers also reported the use of farm ponds 17 and use of tanker water supply along with some use of drip irrigation 13 and sprinkler irrigation 17 additional water related challenges in the present were low water quality 40 dysfunctional water infrastructure systems 29 lack of income 25 social conflicts in water sharing 25 and water scarcity 16 although the respondents in the transition zone expressed either pessimistic 62 or uncertain 57 views on the future state of water and agriculture none of the respondents expressed a desire to extract more water instead they expressed the desire to conserve water 21 respondents also expressed farming as an undesirable livelihood 38 farmers highlighted several possible future solutions for water sustainability including irrigation structures to address water scarcity afforestation to decrease water runoff building water storage and recycling structures and water conservation measures to increase groundwater levels these solutions focused on increasing the short term availability of water for agricultural consumption as well as the long term conservation of water see appendix a code frequencies for a detailed comparison between zones 5 2 2 mental model of groundwater management in the transition zone the mental model of farmers in the transition zone fig 5 shows similar patterns with the mental model of the scarcity zone with stronger causal pathways for groundwater extraction and weaker pathways for groundwater conservation however while the main drivers of groundwater extraction in the scarcity zone were low rainfall and water scarcity the main drivers of groundwater extraction in the transition zone were food insecurity and the desire to improve crop yield and production the model shows four key causal pathways two pathways that led to groundwater extraction and two pathways that led to groundwater conservation causal pathway 1 extraction low rainfall increase in water scarcity increase in rainfed agriculture increase in subsistence farming increase in food crop cultivation increase in irrigation demand increase in the need for water infrastructure increase in construction of borewells increase in open irrigation increase in extraction of groundwater decrease in groundwater availability increase in water scarcity causal pathway 2 extraction decrease in rainfall decrease in crop yield decrease in food crop production decrease in food security increase in loans increase in income increase in construction of dug wells use of water pumps increase in extraction of groundwater decrease in groundwater availability increase in water scarcity causal pathway 3 conservation decrease in rainfall increase in droughts increase in water scarcity increased desire to conserve increase in construction of water conservation structures increase in conservation of groundwater decrease in groundwater availability increase in water scarcity causal pathway 4 conservation increase in water scarcity increase in droughts increase in non governmental organizations initiatives increase in watershed development increase in drip irrigation construction of water conservation structures increase in conservation of groundwater increase in groundwater availability decrease in water scarcity 5 3 assured rainfall zone 5 3 1 past present and future trajectories on agriculture and water related issues the key agricultural challenges in the past highlighted by farmers in the assured rainfall zone were low crop diversity 75 low income 50 water scarcity 43 low rainfall 33 and rainfall uncertainty 20 unlike the scarcity and transition zones farmers in this zone were involved in cash crop cultivation cotton sugarcane 100 along with the cultivation of food crops 19 through rainfed farming 8 farmers in the assured rainfall zone reported key water related challenges in the past such as lack of water infrastructure 60 water scarcity 45 low water quality 40 and lack of irrigation water 17 which reportedly led to excessive extraction of groundwater 46 construction of borewells and dug wells 38 purchase of water through water tankers 35 and use of pipeline water supply 22 respondents recalled a series of institutional changes such as watershed development 64 through collective community mobilization 50 community participation through voluntary labor donation shramdaan training workshops 100 financial institutions 100 and savings groups 89 government led construction of water infrastructure 57 subsidies 100 and water stewardship activities 100 agriculture in the assured rainfall zone improved with the adoption of new agricultural actions such as the use of drip and sprinkler irrigation 43 improved crop varieties 33 farm machineries 43 and crop inputs fertilizers and pesticides 33 farmers started to cultivate a diversity of food 23 and cash 60 crops the challenge of water scarcity 46 due to low rainfall 38 and losses due to excessive rainfall 44 persisted along with newer challenges such as market price fluctuation 17 low production 13 crop loss due to attack of pests and wildlife 20 and excessive use of chemical fertilizers 10 farmers reported the use of farm ponds 67 purchase of tank water 64 manual water collection 60 from common water sources wells rivers tankers etc for household purpose and agriculture as well as water related challenges such as excessive groundwater extraction 38 social conflicts in water sharing 75 low income 50 low water quality 40 excessive rainwater run off 20 and water scarcity 27 farmers expressed a higher desire to extract more groundwater 75 and a lower desire to conserve water 36 further respondents in the assured rainfall zone showed the highest desirability for farming as a livelihood source 77 compared to transition and scarcity zones 8 and 15 respectively they also showed the least desirability 25 for off farm jobs as a livelihood source fewer farmers expressed a positive view of the future water state 33 and a small percentage 14 expressed an uncertain view none of the respondents expressed a pessimistic view of the future water state farmers in the assured rainfall zone highlighted future solutions for water sustainability such as irrigation structures water conservation measures knowledge dissemination for conservation and reduction of water runoff see appendix a code frequencies for a detailed comparison between zones 5 3 2 mental model of groundwater management in assured rainfall zone unlike the mental models of groundwater management in scarcity and transition zones where causal pathways for groundwater extraction were stronger than the pathways of groundwater conservation figs 4 and 5 the mental model of assured rainfall zone shows a balance of pathways for both groundwater extraction and conservation fig 6 the main drivers for groundwater extraction were cultivation of cash crops which increased demand for irrigation along with water scarcity driven desire to extract groundwater the main drivers for groundwater conservation were water scarcit which increased the desire to conserve as well as watershed development and water stewardship initiatives by non governmental organizations we find two pathways that led to groundwater extraction and three pathways that lead to groundwater conservation causal pathway 1 extraction stable rainfall increase in food crop cultivation cash crop production increase in irrigation demand increase in need for water infrastructure increase in construction of borewells increase in open irrigation increase in extraction of groundwater decrease in groundwater availability increase in water scarcity causal pathway 2 extraction decrease in rainfall increase in droughts increase in water scarcity increase in desire to extract increase in construction of borewells increase in water related conflicts increase in groundwater competition increase in use of water pumps increase in extraction of groundwater decrease in groundwater availability increase in water scarcity causal pathway 3 conservation decrease in rainfall increase in droughts increase in water scarcity increase in water scarcity increase in desire to conserve increase in collective mobilization increase in participation of watershed development increase in construction of water conservation structures increase in conservation of groundwater increase in groundwater availability decrease in water scarcity causal pathway 4 conservation increase in water scarcity increase in droughts increase in non governmental organizations initiatives increase in participation with watershed development increase in training workshops increase in maintenance of conservation structures increase in water stewardship initiatives increase in conservation of groundwater increase in groundwater availability decrease in water scarcity causal pathway 5 conservation increase in water scarcity increase in droughts increase in non governmental organizations initiatives increase in collective mobilization increase in collective savings groups increase in income increase in use of drip and sprinkler irrigation increase in conservation of groundwater increase in groundwater availability 6 discussion groundwater management is highly complex with interdependent social environmental technological and institutional dynamics operating within the system pahl wostl et al 2007 transition towards sustainable and adaptive groundwater management regimes require an understanding of how these dynamics operate in relation to each other and how management decisions and behavior evolve within these contextual relations this also includes closing the science people policy gap by incorporating perspectives on the beliefs norms and motivations of people regarding sustainable water management tracing problems and histories of human experience give us insights into how people s beliefs and actions are shaped and gives us critical information on how people can be nudged towards pro environmental behavior learning from our results we offer three key broad level insights from our study farmers who experience higher water scarcity have a higher desire for groundwater conservation and higher consciousness towards future groundwater sustainability our analysis shows that despite high levels of water scarcity related distress farmers in the scarcity and transition zone expressed a higher desire to conserve rather than extracting groundwater by contrast farmers in the assured rainfall zone expressed a higher desire to extract groundwater for agriculture our study confirms insights from other scholars that people s perceptions of water scarcity can form a strong motivation for their desire for water conservation cauberghe et al 2021 hannibal et al 2019 holland et al 2019 while the availability of steady assured water supply can weaken public will for strong conservation policies brown 2017 our analysis shows that farmers in the scarcity and assured rainfall zones expressed a positive view on the future sustainability of water while farmers in the transition zone expressed either pessimistic or uncertain views about the future sustainability of groundwater resources according to corral verdugo et al 2006 people who focus on the present and have short term goals have a lower sustainability consciousness than those who focus on the future and have long term goals our study demonstrates that farmers in the scarcity zone have a higher sustainability consciousness in their desire to conserve groundwater for future generations and suggested numerous long term future solutions that could be implemented to promote groundwater conservation and sustainability in contrast farmers in the assured rainfall zone showed a lower sustainability consciousness and a short term focus on income generation through extraction of groundwater resources the desire to conserve groundwater amongst farmers manifests in their experiences of water scarcity in the past and their observations of continuing depletion of groundwater in the present as encapsulated by a quotation from a farmer in the scarcity and transition zone when asked about their vision for the future in fifteen twenty years there will be a serious water problem one will not get a liter of water all the problems will be caused by water if there is no water there is nothing people still do not understand the importance of water water is life the less water you use from the farm ponds or wells the more water you can use in the future if we use too much water it becomes a habit and therefore the water does not suffice if we draw more water the water tends to run off when it rains the rainwater should be used in a just manner these insights show that it is an oversight to view farmers only as consumers of the resource people s engagement with groundwater resources is influenced by their beliefs about the future state of the resource future interventions that encourage sustainable groundwater management by influencing behavior norms and values around groundwater management as a common pool resource see ostrom 1999 would be more effective in the long run farmers actions towards either increased groundwater extraction or conservation are shaped by social environmental and institutional dynamics rather than self interested individual will various scholars have attempted to explain the rationale behind why farmers might engage in unsustainable and excessive groundwater extraction such as self interest lack of economic or regulatory incentives or misperceptions about resource availability khair et al 2019 a widespread assumption tied to the implementation of individual groundwater extraction measures despite high operating costs is that farmers have a myopic perception that values short term exploitation of water resources for immediate profit rather than long term conservation of limited water resources de frutos cachorro et al 2021 khair et al 2019 vaidyanathan 1996 some scholars attribute farmers high rates of extraction of groundwater to a lack of knowledge about the groundwater resources system and its invisibility joshi and aslekar 2018 according to pahl wostl and hare 2004 state controlled regulation of groundwater extraction has been largely ineffective due to weak social legitimacy where people view groundwater as a right and entitlement rather than a limited resource in other words the perception that every man is entitled to use his well the way he wishes is very strong and legitimized phansalkar and kher 2006 pg 78 the mental models from our study contradict the simplistic view of farmers as profit maximizing or ignorant agents who extract groundwater for short sighted self interest the models show that groundwater management actions are guided by a multiplicity of social environmental and institutional factors that are interlinked with each other these factors operate in a dynamic way to steer farmers actions towards either groundwater extraction or conservation environmental and social factors such as rainfall droughts agricultural risks food security irrigation demand crop production groundwater competition and social conflicts shape farmers desires and motivations to varying degrees here the role of institutional factors such as government led initiatives for the construction of irrigation infrastructure or ngo led initiatives for watershed management and community mobilization become important in determining which pathways become dominant we observe this push and pull dynamic between extraction versus conservation in all three climate zones but with different outcomes in the scarcity and transition zones government led interventions for enhanced water supply such as the provision of water tankers and construction of irrigation infrastructures such as borewells pipelines dams etc increased social conflicts and groundwater competition resulting in widespread groundwater extraction on the other hand as we see in the assured rainfall zone ngo led initiatives for watershed development and groundwater conservation steered the dynamics towards increased groundwater conservation through community mobilization and knowledge dissemination however as ngos withdrew from the villages other factors such as increase in cash crop production increased desirability of farming and use of intensive agricultural practices shifted the dynamics again towards groundwater extraction our study demonstrates how broader policy signals institutional actions to steer system outcomes towards either groundwater extraction or conservation here farmers are complex actors embedded and operating within broader social ecological and political environments however most solutions for effective groundwater management assume individual farmers as selfish actors who need to either be regulated or educated to prevent them from extracting groundwater this assumption overlooks the role of state policy in steering farmers actions and outcomes and falls under the system archetype of shifting the burden senge et al 1994 wolstenholme 2003 where implemented solutions often ignore the primary problem because addressing it is more difficult supply driven water policies and initiatives can lead to maladaptive outcomes such as an increase in groundwater extraction in the long run in an analysis of the multiplicity of views on water issues and solutions for water management in india kumar 2018 highlights that water related policies and management decisions in india have been guided mostly through water engineering perspectives that promote a command control approach to water management such approaches often focus on supply driven technical solutions for short term access to water such as improved irrigation through subsidized electricity construction of large dams with canals and mega water supply projects however such solutions are often rendered maladaptive and lead to increased competition among agricultural users for water resources social conflicts and increased inequities in access to water resources shah 2021 shah and narain 2019 vaidyanathan 1996 the mental models reveal that interventions that support an increase in water supply through government led initiatives such as the provision of water tankers construction of pipelines electricity subsidies for irrigation farm pond subsidies etc can lead to reinforcing feedbacks that further drives groundwater competition and subsequent extraction thus they often result in inequitable outcomes that exacerbate water scarcity in the region we see an example of such a maladaptive outcomes in the case of farm ponds which were originally promoted to serve as rainwater harvesting structures the maharashtra state government provided financial subsidies of up to inr 50000 around 750 usd or 70 75 of the cost of farm pond construction to promote its use among farmers however as rainfall became increasingly unpredictable farmers opted to use the farm ponds as groundwater storage structures instead in this context the intended use of farm ponds as water rainwater harvesting and conservation structures turned to large scale storage structures for groundwater and precipitated a further extraction of groundwater reserves fig 7 shows field photograph of the use of such farm ponds as high volume water storage structures by a large scale farmer in the study area our study demonstrates the pathways through which short term solutions for addressing water scarcity can often lead to maladaptive outcomes in the long run the aforementioned example illustrates the systems archetype of fixes that fail where a short term solution works initially but creates deleterious effects over time and may even worsen the situation senge et al 1994 further communities can often rise to be stewards of groundwater as demonstrated by their participation and collective action in past watershed development works also see grassini 2019 our study confirms that past watershed development initiatives in india were successful due to community trust cooperation and participation through sharing of labor and costs and facilitated through financial technical and knowledge inputs from non governmental organizations joshi et al 2004 kolavalli and kerr 2002 sharma et al 2011 rica et al 2017 however most of these programs remained concentrated efforts that failed to sustain or scale up beyond the specific community village or region due to the dependency of such programs on external funding kerr 2002 in our study farmers highlighted how poverty and lack of financial resources can be an inhibitor in the collective mobilization of people to promote sustainable groundwater management 7 limitations narula et al 2011 notes that mental models are often incomplete and inaccurate representations of reality and hence are useful in understanding people s cognitive limitations in this study the mental models are constructed based on information as recalled by our study participants and hence may be incomplete as such the mental models represent an incomplete understanding of how past and present experiences of farmers in socio hydrological systems shape actions regarding groundwater extraction and conservation we chose to highlight the agro ecological zone based differences in farmers mental models instead of social dimensions social differences between people s cognitive perceptions based on class caste and gender are important aspects of groundwater management since they directly influence instances of competition conflicts and cooperation within groundwater resource management this forms an area that warrants future studies finally while our sample size of 44 respondents is a good number for a qualitative study we do not intend to generalize our findings for the different agro ecological zones instead the focus is to develop a contextualized information rich understanding of mental models of farmers regarding groundwater management and how beliefs motivations and actions around groundwater management are shaped 8 conclusion direct and indirect impacts of climate change pose a severe threat to the long term sustainability of water resources in india goyal and surampalli 2018 these impending changes exacerbated by population change agriculture and water consumption patterns call for policy adjustments and transitions that recognize the dynamic feedback structures within the various components of socio hydrological systems and give individuals groups and institutions enhanced agency to transform groundwater regimes towards sustainability and equity haeffner et al 2018 our study shows that farmers in the scarcity zone expressed more desire to conserve water and were optimistic about the future status of water conservation despite higher water related distress and pessimism about farming as a viable means of livelihood this finding counters the assumptions of farmers as myopic profit oriented actors and shows that groundwater management decisions are guided through an interplay of complex dynamics within social environmental and institutional factors these dynamics can often shift behavior towards groundwater extraction or conservation short term supply driven water policies can exacerbate groundwater extraction by amplifying groundwater competition resulting in maladaptive outcomes current water policies need a transformative shift from focusing on improving the physical availability and supply of water to those that encourage sustainable groundwater management by influencing behavior norms and values around water management future interventions that allow and encourage collective mobilization enhanced ownership and participation adequate training financial resources and decentralized management structures with enhanced accountability are likely to be more effective in developing long term solutions for sustainable groundwater management funding this work was supported by funding from corporate social responsibility support provided by hsbc hongkong and

the major ions are in the order na ca2 mg2 k and cl hco3 so4 2 these orders are similar to those reported in the dodoma urban district shemsanga et al 2017a nkotagu 1996a ec and main ions are gradient concentrated in the south as seen in fig 1 fig 2a d and fig 3 large standard deviations in all the parameters shown in table 1 fig 2a d and fig 3 show the presence of fragmented basement rocks which

been reported in the dodoma urban district shemsanga et al 2017a nkotagu 1996a fig 4b and c also indicate that groundwater in the dodoma region 1 contains mixed anion and cations types 2 alkaline earths ca2 mg2 exceed alkalies na k 3 strong acid anion so4 2 cl exceed weak acid hco3 and 4 the dominant hydrochemical facies is mixed ca mg cl so4 3 4 sources of cations and anions the chemical weathering of limestone caco3 and dolomite camg co3 rocks feldspar rocks and mineral salts causes groundwater mineralization meybeck 1987 meybeck 1987 loring et al 2019 welch 2005 feldspar minerals

ph ec tds turb th ca2 mg2 k na so4 2 cl and hco3 supplementary data the tables show that mpwapwa and chamwino districts have the highest number of pairs with strong correlations r 0 8 at 30 and 23 respectively followed by dodoma urban and kongwa districts with 17 each and chemba and kondoa districts with 8 and 3 the correlations between cl and na r 0 8 were found in all districts and were higher than those between cl and ca2 mg2 and k indicating that halide salt is the dominant source of cl and na ions in this region a comparable set of correlations was made in the urban district of dodoma nkotagu 1996b shemsanga et al 2017a strong correlations between na and k r 0 8 were found in chamwino dodoma urban chemba and mpwapwa while moderate and poor correlations were found in kongwa r 0 59 and kondoa r 0 19 indicating that na and k have common sources in most of the districts in the dodoma region a strong correlation between ca2 and mg2 r 0 8 was found only in mpwapwa districts in the remaining districts the correlation was moderate ranging from r 0 60 in kongwa to r 0 19 in kondoa indicating that ca2 and mg2 have multiple sources the lack of correlation between ca2 and mg2 with hco3 in most dodoma districts supplementary information suggests that ca and mg mineral salts and ca feldspar rocks contribute to ca2 and mg2 levels the disparity between ca2 mg2 and hco3 was noted in dodoma urban districts and attributed to the presence of ion exchange processes and the dissolution of sulfate containing rocks nkotagu 1996a strong correlations r 0 8 between so4 2 and ca2 mg2 na and k were also observed in this study in the majority of the districts indicating that sulfate containing rocks are a major source of cations in the dodoma region 3 6 ion exchange processes the occurrence of ion exchange processes between major cations is already reported in the dodoma urban district shemsanga et al 2017a table 3 shows the evidence of ion exchange processes occurring in other districts the na cl ratio is less than one in all districts indicating that na is replaced by ca or mg resulting in a decrease in na while increasing ca2 and mg2 egbueri 2019 kumar et al 2008 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 the ca2 mg2 hco3 ratio is greater than 1 0 in kongwa and less than 1 0 in the other districts suggesting that na is exchanged for ca2 and mg2 in kongwa and ca2 and mg2 are exchanged for na in dodoma urban kondoa mpwapwa and chamwino districts krishna kumar et al 2014 ahamed et al 2015 3 7 water quality for agriculture high mineral contents in water have negative effects on plant growth javed et al 2022 chakraborty et al 2022 wilcox s diagram supplemental information and fig 5 a show districts found in the north of the region contain low levels of ec and salinity hazards and therefore have more desirable water for irrigation the majority of the samples from the dodoma regions had sar values between 0 and 6 fig 5b kr ratio less than 1 fig 5c and na levels under 60 fig 5d demonstrating that the water in these areas is generally free of issues secure and suitable for agriculture these findings are similar to those obtained in the dodoma urban district shemsanga et al 2017a most of the samples in the dodoma region have rsc values less than 2 5 fig 5e and are therefore suitable for irrigation ahamed et al 2015 the majority of samples in mpwapwa and chamwino districts have mar values greater than 50 fig 5f indicating that water from these districts is not desirable for irrigation tanvir rahman et al 2017 4 conclusion the evaluation of hydrogeochemical characteristics spatial distribution of major ions and water quality for drinking and irrigation in six districts of dodoma region has been carried out results show that mineralization is concentrated in the south of the region ec are in the order kongwa mpwapwa chamwino dodoma urban kondoa chemba water quality for drinking purposes correlates with the order of ec most samples with parameters above the who guideline are also found in the south of the region the dominant cation and anion are na and cl kondoa had the highest na and cl concentrations at 264 33 144 04 mg l and 608 93 296 17 mg l respectively the dominant hydrochemical facies was found to be a mixed ca mg cl so4 type in all dodoma districts ec values show that chemba and kondoa districts located on the north of the region have the most desirable water for irrigation sar kr ratios and na shows that the majority of water in dodoma districts is problem free safe and suitable for irrigation mar

facies in the dodoma districts the research will focus on six districts in dodoma region which are dodoma urban chamwino mpwapwa kondoa kongwa and chemba 2 materials and method 2 1 the study area dodoma region was designated the capital of tanzania in 1973 namwata et al 2015 however most of the core functions of the government remained in dar es salaam until after the 2015 election when dr john magufuli became president and initiated the massive effort of reallocating the capital to the dodoma region in terms of population growth infrastructure investments and capital allocation the dodoma region is now one of tanzania s fastest growing regions dodoma region is one of three regions that make up central tanzania and covers an area of about 41 315 km2 this region is situated within the eastern and western rift valleys and the dodoman metamorphic granitoid belt which is found inside tanzania craton macheyeki et al 2008 fig 1 left this region is tectonically active and supported by fractured crystalline basement rocks nkotagu 1996b the rocks that are present in this region includes granodiorite basalt metavolcanic granitoids and granitic gneisses abu et al 2021 according to the 2012 population census 2013 the dodoma area has a total population of 2 083 588 people accounting for 4 6 percent of tanzania s total population of 44 928 923 an annual population growth rate of 2 1 and a population density of 50 people per square kilometer this region is divided into seven districts fig 1 right dodoma urban is the most populous district 410 956 followed by chamwino 330 543 mpwapwa 305 056 kongwa 309 973 kondoa 269 704 chemba 235 711 and bahi 235 711 2 2 groundwater sampling a total of 155 samples were collected and analyzed 26 samples were collected from dodoma urban district 46 samples from chamwino district 15 samples from mpwapwa district 23 samples from kondoa district 19 samples from kongwa district and 26 samples from chemba district the spatial distribution of the samples collection sites is shown in fig 1 bottom all samples were taken from groundwater sources utilized for domestic use drinking and agricultural activities the pgs coordinates of the sampling sites were recorded using a handheld gps receiver garmin nuvi 255w samples were collected and stored in 500 ml bottles made of commercially available polyethylene each bottle was rinsed with borehole water to prevent cross contamination before use ph temperatures ec and tds measurements were done on site other parameters were analyzed within four days of collection all water samples were collected between august and september 2021 during the dry season dry season was chosen in order to minimize groundwater contamination from rain runoff and facilitate easy collection of samples from locations that were far from paved roads 2 3 groundwater analyses parameters that were used for the assessment of water quality for drinking purposes were ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solid tds turbidity total hardness th concentration of calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 potassium k sodium na sulfate so4 2 chloride cl and alkalinity hco3 determination of ph temperatures ec and tds were done using combo ph conductivity tds tester high range manufactured by hanna instruments hanna hi98130 the ph electrode was calibrated using 4 0 0 05 7 00 0 05 and 10 00 0 05 ph buffers before analysis ec measurements were done after the instrument was calibrated using conductivity standard solution reference value of 1413 μs cm from hanna instruments hanna hi7031 turbidity was measured using a portable turbidity meter manufactured by hatch 2100q which meets epa method 180 1 for turbidity measurements the turbidity meter was calibrated with 10 ntu 20 ntu 100 ntu 400 ntu and 800 ntu standards also from hatch company before analysis sulfate portable photometer manufactured by hanna hi96751 was used to determine concentration of so4 2 ions sulfate portable photometer uses a turbidimetric method in which so4 2 ions from the sample is precipitated by ba2 ions from standard solution concentration of cl ions were done using mohr s titration method concentration of alkalinity

is presented in table 1 below this table shows the mean maximum minimum standard deviation who guidelines and the percentage of samples above those guidelines all samples tested had ph values that were within the who guideline of 6 5 8 5 the districts of kongwa and kondoa have the highest and lowest ph values at 7 22 0 49 and 6 78 0 21 respectively supplementary data the ph value of dodoma urban district 6 95 0 44 is within the ranges found in literature kisaka 2018 nkotagu 1996b in the field of hydrogeochemistry ph values are a useful tool for gaining insight into the nature of the interaction between groundwater and rocks high ph values indicate the existence and dissolution of alkaline rocks boyd et al 2016 tables 1 and 2 show that kongwa district is the most mineralized with over 80 of samples containing values above the who guideline for th ca2 mg2 k cl and hco3 chemba district is the least mineralized hco3 has the highest percentage of samples that exceed the who guideline in this district at 46 15 see table 1 mpwapwa and chamwino have the highest and lowest turbidities at 5 12 7 52 ntu and 0 71 0 54 ntu respectively supplementary data low turbidity water is clear transparent contains few suspended particles and is therefore more appealing for drinking low turbidities also suggest low infiltration and contamination from surface water udeigwe et al 2007 samples from southern districts contains higher th that samples from northern districts table 2 similar th in the ranges of 108 460 mg l was reported in the dodoma urban district hiji and ntalikwa 2014 3 2 major ions the na 264 33 144 04 mg l and cl 608 93 296 17 mg l are the most abundant ions in the region table 1 fig 2 a d and fig 3 na is followed by ca2 225 91 160 52 mg l mg2 116 09 55 mg l and k 11 85 3 17 mg l all found in kongwa district hco3 295 86 100 59 mg l and so4 2 278 07 335 39 mg l are the second and third most abundant anions found in kongwa and mpwapwa districts respectively the major ions are in the order na ca2 mg2 k and cl hco3 so4 2 these orders are similar to those reported in the dodoma urban district shemsanga et al 2017a nkotagu 1996a ec and main ions are gradient concentrated in the south as seen in fig 1 fig 2a d and fig 3 large standard deviations in all the parameters shown in table 1 fig 2a d and fig 3 show the presence of fragmented basement rocks which cause groundwater sources in close proximity to have varying degrees of mineral concentrations large standard deviations in this region have already been reported in the literature nkotagu 1996b shemsanga et al 2017b nkotagu 1996c 3 3 groundwater facies and groundwater types piper s trilinear diagram fig 4 a shows that most of the data points in fig 4b and c fall in the triangles 1 4 and 9 and on letters d and g indicating the presence of similar chemical characteristics hydrochemical facies and water types across all dodoma districts plots similar to those shown in fig 4b and c have been reported in the dodoma urban district shemsanga et al 2017a nkotagu 1996a fig 4b and c also indicate that groundwater in the dodoma region 1 contains mixed anion and cations types 2 alkaline earths ca2 mg2 exceed alkalies na k 3 strong acid anion so4 2 cl exceed weak acid hco3 and 4 the dominant hydrochemical facies is mixed ca mg cl so4 3 4 sources of cations and anions the chemical weathering of limestone caco3 and dolomite camg co3 rocks feldspar rocks and mineral salts causes groundwater mineralization meybeck 1987 meybeck 1987 loring et al 2019 welch 2005 feldspar minerals contribute about 50 of earth s crust yuan et al 2019 carbonate rocks contribute about 15 2 of the continental surface goldscheider et al 2020 and they account for 68 of the alkalinity in rivers gaillardet et al 1999 the dissolution of rocks is summarized by equations 6 12 below the dissolution of limestone dolomite and feldspar rocks shown in equations 6 8 is facilitated by carbonic acid

ph ec tds turb th ca2 mg2 k na so4 2 cl and hco3 supplementary data the tables show that mpwapwa and chamwino districts have the highest number of pairs with strong correlations r 0 8 at 30 and 23 respectively followed by dodoma urban and kongwa districts with 17 each and chemba and kondoa districts with 8 and 3 the correlations between cl and na r 0 8 were found in all districts and were higher than those between cl and ca2 mg2 and k indicating that halide salt is the dominant source of cl and na ions in this region a comparable set of correlations was made in the urban district of dodoma nkotagu 1996b shemsanga et al 2017a strong correlations between na and k r 0 8 were found in chamwino dodoma urban chemba and mpwapwa while moderate and poor correlations were found in kongwa r 0 59 and kondoa r 0 19 indicating that na and k have common sources in most of the districts in the dodoma region a strong correlation between ca2 and mg2 r 0 8 was found only in mpwapwa districts in the remaining districts the correlation was moderate ranging from r 0 60 in kongwa to r 0 19 in kondoa indicating that ca2 and mg2 have multiple sources the lack of correlation between ca2 and mg2 with hco3 in most dodoma districts supplementary information suggests that ca and mg mineral salts and ca feldspar rocks contribute to ca2 and mg2 levels the disparity between ca2 mg2 and hco3 was noted in dodoma urban districts and attributed to the presence of ion exchange processes and the dissolution of sulfate containing rocks nkotagu 1996a strong correlations r 0 8 between so4 2 and ca2 mg2 na and k were also observed in this study in the majority of the districts indicating that sulfate containing rocks are a major source of cations in the dodoma region 3 6 ion exchange processes the occurrence of ion exchange processes between major cations is already reported in the dodoma urban district shemsanga et al 2017a table 3 shows the evidence of ion exchange processes occurring in other districts the na cl ratio is less than one in all districts indicating that na is replaced by ca or mg resulting in a decrease in na while increasing ca2 and mg2 egbueri 2019 kumar et al 2008 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 the ca2 mg2 hco3 ratio is greater than 1 0 in kongwa and less than 1 0 in the other districts suggesting that na is exchanged for ca2 and mg2 in kongwa and ca2 and mg2 are exchanged for na in dodoma urban kondoa mpwapwa and chamwino districts krishna kumar et al 2014 ahamed et al 2015 3 7 water quality for agriculture high mineral contents in water have negative effects on plant growth javed et al 2022 chakraborty et al 2022 wilcox s diagram supplemental information and fig 5 a show districts found in the north of the region contain low levels of ec and salinity hazards and therefore have more desirable water for irrigation the majority of the samples from the dodoma regions had sar values between 0 and 6 fig 5b kr ratio less than 1 fig 5c and na levels under 60 fig 5d demonstrating that the water in these areas is generally free of issues secure and suitable for agriculture these findings are similar to those obtained in the dodoma urban district shemsanga et al 2017a most of the samples in the dodoma region have rsc values less than 2 5 fig 5e and are therefore suitable for irrigation ahamed et al 2015 the majority of samples in mpwapwa and chamwino districts have mar values greater than 50 fig 5f indicating that water from these districts is not desirable for irrigation tanvir rahman et al 2017 4 conclusion the evaluation of hydrogeochemical characteristics spatial distribution of major ions and water quality for drinking and irrigation in six districts of dodoma region has been carried out results show that mineralization is concentrated in the south of the region ec are in the order kongwa mpwapwa chamwino dodoma urban kondoa chemba water quality for drinking purposes correlates with the order of ec most samples with parameters above the who guideline are also found in the south of the region the dominant cation and anion are na and cl kondoa had the highest na and cl concentrations at 264 33 144 04 mg l and 608 93 296 17 mg l respectively the dominant hydrochemical facies was found to be a mixed ca mg cl so4 type in all dodoma districts ec values show that chemba and kondoa districts located on the north of the region have the most desirable water for irrigation sar kr ratios and na shows that the majority of water in dodoma districts is problem free safe and suitable for irrigation mar values shows that mpwapwa and chamwino have the least suitable water for irrigation according to rsc water from dodoma urban is mostly unsuitable for irrigation financial disclosure statement this
