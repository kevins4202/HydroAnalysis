solids ww wastewater 1 introduction the industrial use of salt use of seawater for industrial process water and for toilet flushing municipally as well as sewer infiltration generates large flows of organic and nutrient rich saline wastewaters this is relevant for both domestic wastewater e g where seawater is used for toilet flushing or industrial wastewaters particularly marine fish and microalgae processing biological removal of organics and nutrients is adversely impacted by high salinity due to the inhibitory effects of dissolved salts intrasungkha et al 1999 adverse effects such as plasmolysis and the activity loss affect aerobic anoxic and anaerobic organisms this results in limited extent of adaptation sensitivity to changes in ionic strength reduced degradation kinetics and poor settleability kargi and dincer 1996 biomass acclimation and adaptation can improve biological performance compared to non adapted communities panswad and anan 1999 this includes the presence of halophiles especially at salinities of over 2 0 kargi and uygur 2005 lefebvre and moletta 2006 anaerobic digestion of salty high strength wastes is particularly inhibited by sodium chloride kugelman and mccarty 1965 which results in reduced volatile solids vs destruction and consequently decreased methane production while stepwise adaptation reduces inhibitory effects and allows for effective treatment at salinities up to 70 g l 1 lefebvre and moletta 2006 adaptation periods can be very long up to 2 years mendez et al 1995 operation and adaptation are further complicated by high sulfate concentrations in seawater sources omil et al 1995 rinzema and lettinga 1988 sulfate is reduced to sulfides by sulfate reducing bacteria srb in the presence of organic acids sulfide is an inhibitor of anaerobic microbes at levels of 100 200 mgh2s s l 1 omil et al 1995 this h2s also affects downstream nutrient removal as anammox microbes are severely impaired by h2s as low as 0 03 mm carvajal arroyo et al 2013 although adaptation to saline conditions is possible 3 nacl kartal et al 2006 as opposed to anammox marine microalgae can withstand high h2s concentrations bahr et al 2014 and have been extensively researched and are applied for wastewater treatment and commercially produced in large scale ponds milledge 2011 jiang et al 2011 another far less researched option with the potential to simultaneous remove cod and nutrients in one treatment step is the application of purple phototrophic bacteria ppb ppb based wastewater treatment relies on assimilative uptake of organics and nutrients to discharge limits hülsen et al 2016 in an ir irradiated photo bioreactor salt tolerant ppb have been enriched and isolated from a vast variety of saline sources including sediments brackish lagoons and saline sulfur springs overmann et al 1992 guyoneaud et al 2002 and h2s tolerance is a common feature among ppb kobayashi et al 1983 it is unknown whether ppb based technology is viable for marine wastewater treatment nor whether h2s can be effectively eliminated or controlled sulfate in seawater is not an electron source for ppb while anaerobic sulfate reduction forms useable h2s ppb have the possibility to both minimise sulfate reduction by competition for electron donors such as organic acids and eliminate sulfide utilising it as an electron donor while h2s removal by ppb from anaerobic effluents non saline was previously reported garcia et al 2017 substantial sulfide was produced when ppb rhodopseudomonas palustris were fed non saline food processing wastewater with a feed sulfur sulfate and sulfite concentration of 420 mgs l 1 chiemchaisri et al 2007 in this case ppb could not effectively compete for electrons with srb and did not utilise sulfide as electron donor there are very few references to the use of ppb for saline wastewater treatment the only continuous reactor study qin et al 2017 found effective cod 80 and nh4 n 84 removal for saline 30 gnacl l 1 industrial food processing wastewater utilising rhodopseudomonas palustris however the ecology was not evaluated and we note rps palustris is a salt tolerant freshwater species imhoff 1988 and will likely be outcompeted by true marine ppb species over longer periods a batch study also used a strain of salt tolerant rhodopseudomonas and found inhibition at increasing salinities while total carotenoid and bacteriochlorophyll contents increased at 50 gnacl l 1 relative to a freshwater control wang et al 2017 this study aims to determine the capacity of a mixed native ppb culture for saline wastewater treatment nacl only and marine wastewater with high sulfate and other ions using domestic wastewater as a proxy the key objectives were a determination of basic ppb based process performance at seawater salinity 40 ms cm 1 2 8 b evaluate level of adaptation and microbial shift through sequencing and activity tests and c identify the degree to which a ppb based system can suppress sulfate reduction in marine wastewaters 2 material and methods 2 1 marine purple phototrophic bacteria enrichment brisbane river water samples with small amounts of mud sediment were collected from the river edge 27 29 44 0 s 153 01 05 8 e as a source for marine saline ppb the river water conductivity at the time of sample collection was 35 2 ms cm 1 at 10 c but can vary depending on tides season and many other factors yu et al 2014 in the case of lower conductivities of river water lowest conductivity was 21 7 ms cm 1 collected over next four weeks nacl was added to reach a uniform 35 ms cm 1 for the enrichment three 160 ml serum flasks were filled with 90 ml of river sample and spiked with 100 mg n l 1 nh4cl 50 mg p l 1 k2hpo4 and 500 mgcod l 1 as ch3cooh the ph was corrected with naoh to 6 8 the flasks were closed with rubber septa and sparged with n2 before incubating on at 100 rpm under anaerobic ir irradiated 20 2 w m 2 at 12v 96 led night vision infrared

were added during different periods red sea salt is evaporated sea salts and represents solutes actually present in seawater including significant amounts of sulfate the average sulfate concentration of the wastewater with the red sea salt addition during periods ii iv was 760 mgso4 s l 1 the wastewater compositions with added salts are detailed in table s2 2 3 anaerobic photo membrane bioreactor panmbr operation the panmbr consisted of a 2 l rectangular clear acrylic flat plate reactor width length and height 2 0 34 and 40 cm equipped with a submerged flat sheet membrane kubota osaka japan the system was continuously fed while level controlled effluent draining was semi continuous as for hülsen et al 2016 mixing was achieved via a headspace recirculation gas compressor 6 l min 1 and the gas recirculation line was equipped with a h2s sensor odalog l2 placed in a 5 l gastight acrylic vessel the panmbr had an illuminated surface to volume ratio of 18 m2 m 3 and was continuously illuminated at an average irradiance of 18 7 w m 2 spatial distribution over the reactor wall as per hülsen et al 2018b acetic acid hac was dosed directly into the reactor via the bottom with a programmable syringe pump ne 8000 scientific instrument services inc ringoes usa at around 0 629 ml h 1 383 mgcod l 1 total feed to achieve an acetate concentration equivalent to adding 280 mgcod l 1 to the wastewater influent due to problems with microbial growth in the influent storage tank and resulting cod consumption even at the storage temperature of 4 c direct hac addition into the reactor was implemented after period i the reactor operation was further divided into 5 periods to determine the effect of nacl salt period i ii 262 d addition prior to switching to domestic wastewater with red sea salt for another 110 d period iii v note during period iii a compressor leak accidently introduced air into the system dissolved oxygen do concentration of 4 8 mg l 1 and due to the immediate color loss purple color loss this period was extended to further characterise aerobic operation during period v the illumination was switched off period v only lasted for 7 d because the biological process failed due to extensive h2s formation the operational conditions of each period are summarised in table 1 2 4 varying conductivity salinity batch tests varying conductivity batch tests were

et al 2018b 2 7 data processing and statistical analysis cumulative mass balances were performed on tcod tn and tp to determine losses mass not accounted by the mass balance and recovery potentials in terms of mass and capture efficiency in the biomass mass loadings were calculated using hydraulic daily influent flow multiplied by measured mass concentration calculations for which daily data was missing in the effluent or sludge linear interpolation interp1 command in matlab of data measured on the days before and after were utilised the cod capture efficiency was calculated with the interpolated loads considering the particulate cod tcod scod of the withdrawn sludge over the tcod influent load over time measurement results for inputs are presented below as averages and variability in inputs where relevant is expressed as standard deviations in time series measurements given as x s x i where x is the average value for the data x i and s x i is the corresponding standard deviation measurement results for outputs and calculated parameters are presented below as average values with uncertainty expressed as uncertainty in the mean value based on a two tailed t test at the 95 confidence level 5 significance threshold and with an appropriate number of degrees of freedom thus values are given below as x e x where e x is the estimated error at the 95 confidence level 3 results and discussion 3 1 marine ppb enrichment the saline serum flasks inoculated with river water developed a purple colour after 7 d figure s1 this colour intensified after serial dilutions while cod nh4 n and po4 p removal increased and characteristic peaks above 800 nm spectrophotometric scan emerged data not shown as previously described for domestic wastewater enrichment hülsen et al 2014 after the 4th serial dilution the microbial analysis confirmed the presence of ppb which is further detailed in the microbial part and presented in fig 2 inoculum 3 2 reactor performance system performance including cod n and p removal is shown in fig 1 over the entire standard operational period effluent concentrations averaged 126 mgcod l 1 28 mgn l 1 and 7 mgp l 1 which is not at a suitable quality for direct discharge this equates with moderate average cod n and p removals of 86 1 7 62 2 0 and 51 2 6 respectively the effluent concentrations over time are provided in figure s2 as reported previously ppb assimilate around 6 0 8 0 gtn and 1 0 2 0 gtp for every 100 gtcod hülsen et al 2016 and similar ratios were seen here see next section this means additional cod either externally added or natively present will result in an increased nutrient uptake and removal efficiency hülsen et al 2016 the study found adverse effects of oxygen dissolved oxygen 4 8 mg l 1 during period iii resulted in instant colour loss due to the loss of carotenoids pemberton et al 1998 cod removal was maintained probably due to heterotrophic oxidation however tn and tp removal decreased due to the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate up to 13 4 mgno2 n l 1 day 290 and 36 mgno3 n day 293 figure s2 with reduced assimilative removal this was likely due to the population shift caused by the aerobic conditions as well as slightly reduced cod n p substrates ratios of aerobic heteroptrophs after re establishing anaerobic conditions during period iv cod tn and tp removal recovered with high sulfate input 730 mgso4 s l 1 due to the use of red sea salt during period iv the h2s concentration remained below 2 0 mgs l 1 for over 80 d indicating limited srb activity this changed immediately when the lights were switched off during period v within two days the h2s concentration in the liquid increased to 23 mgs l 1 and further increased to 90 mgs l 1 after 7 d fig 1b thus after 80d or 26 srts of ir suppression of srb by ppb srb subsequently emerged after 2 d without radiation 3 3 nutrient and cod recovery the mass balances based closures fraction of influent effluent and solids combined accounted for 82 1 0 cod 84 0 3 tn and 78 0 8 tp over 372 d the cumulative loads in and out are shown in figure s3 the sulfur balances closed to 104 biomass yields were 0 8 0 02gcod gcod 1 fed with 51 and 45 of the influent tn and tp incorporated into the biomass this results in a cod n p substrate ratio of 100 6 5 1 0 well in line with previously reported results in non saline conditions hülsen et al 2016 the crude protein cp content of the biomass tkn based was 0 62 0 21 gcp gvs 1 as seen in other wastewaters low salinity hülsen et al 2018a this is in the range of cp contents of other bacterial biomass anupama and ravindra 2000 but the main advantage of ppb including marine fed ppb is a relatively high capture extent compared with heterotrophic biomass due to higher biomass yields 3 4 microbial analysis of the panmbr microbial analysis confirmed the dominance of ppb but with a substantial shift in the continuous reactor from inoculum fig 2 the inoculum was dominated by allochromatium sp 34 4 marichromatium sp 3 4 and 0 8 of rhodovulum sp flanking the microbial community in the panmbr gradually shifted from an evenly distributed community 10 each of allochromatium sp rhodobacter sp and rhodovulum sp towards rhodovulum sp dominance up to 50 during periods i and ii this dominance of rhodovulum sp has not been previously observed in domestic or agri industrial wastewater trials on non saline wastewaters hülsen et al 2016 2018a rhodovulum sp originally described as rhodopseudomonas was the first marine purple non sulfur genus discovered hansen and veldkamp 1973 and has selective advantages in saline environments due to higher optimum salt concentrations over typical freshwater genera such as rhodobacter or allochromatium imhoff 2001 freshwater genera can exist in marine habitats and compete with marine species but marine species cannot grow in freshwater habitats imhoff 2001 this likely is the cause for the gradual shift from a mix of allochromatium sp rhodobacter sp towards marine rhodovulum sp dominance after 190 d fig 2 the non phototrophic flanking community did not appear to change substantially during period 2 with saline tolerant organisms such as pseudomonadaceae and pseudoalteromonas maintained between 5 and 15 relative abundance ra where representatives of both families have been reported in anaerobic environments xiao et al 2009 cheng et al 2019 the hydrogenotrophic methanobrevibacter sp previously detected in marine sediments kita et al 2016 was present at low abundances 0 1 0 9 in the first 143d but was below 0 07 afterwards during the aerobic period iii thalassospira sp emerged while ppb species were completely depleted with thalossospira being 85 ra at day 295 these are known to utilise acetic acid lópez lópez et al 2002 and were likely responsible for the aerobic cod removal thalassospira sp have been reported to utilise nitrate or ammonia as n source lópez lópez et al 2002 with some species able to perform denitrification liu et al 2007 interestingly we did not detect typical ammonium oxidising bacteria e g nitrospira nitrosomomas nitrobacter in the community although up to 36 mgno3 n l 1 were detected during period iii figure s2 anaerobic conditions were re established in period iv after 3 0d the purple color returned and a mix of ppb including but not dominated by rhodovulum sp re emerged tn and tp removal performance was regained the h2s suppression was underlined by the very low relative abundances 0 15 of srb in periods i iv desulfobacteraceae at these low relative abundances was the only identified sulfate reducer 3 5 batch test in addition to the reactor operation batch tests at multiple conductivities 0 5 160 ms cm 1 with saline adapted and unadapted ppb biomass were done to assess acclimatisation extent and capacity at varying salt concentrations fig 3 provides acetate uptake activity for unadapted samples as well as adapted samples taken between days 209 and 248 the maximum acetate uptake rate for unadapted inoculum was approximately 40 higher than for adapted inoculum 1 35 vs 0 9 gcod gvss 1d 1 the unadapted inoculum had a threshold type response to increased salt concentration where inhibition initiates at a lower limit and is complete at an upper limit the 50 inhibitory concentration or ki50 is normally the average of these astals et al 2018 the onset threshold was 20 ms cm 1 and a half maximal inhibition ki50 of approximately 30 ms cm 1 with almost complete inhibition at 40 ms cm 1 i e seawater concentration the adapted inoculum taken from the panmbr between day 209 and 248 fig 3 had a stimulatory inhibitory response with a broad optimum between 30 and 70 ms cm 1 this therefore represents a halophilic community since activity was minimal below 20 ms cm 1 even at conductivities 80 ms cm 1 twice seawater hac cod was still consumed at around 20 reduced rates actually indicating the presence of hypersaline microbes rhodovulum species have been described as such imhoff 2003 fig 4 shows the microbial composition at the end of the saline adapted biomass batch tests the results provide interpretation for the trends by indicating that rhodovulum sp was with 60 relative abundance the main mediator between 40 and 80 ms cm 1 above 100 ms cm 1 decreasing rhodovulum sp abundances indicate a shift towards pseudoalteromonas sp 3 6 significance for industrial application this study showed that ppb can simultaneously remove and partition cod n and p from saline and potentially hypersaline wastewaters at similar strengths to domestic wastewater the use of either nacl or red sea salt with high sulfate did not affect treatment performance this study further confirmed a cod n p assimilation ratio of 100 6 5 1 0 previously reported for non saline domestic hülsen et al 2016 and a range of agri industrial wastewaters hülsen et al 2018a 2018b several other process parameters such as hrt yield cp content and removal rates are essentially the same in saline and non saline panmbrs as such we consider this work as transferrable to other saline streams while domestic streams have limited bioavailable cod and would require external cod addition to achieve nutrient discharge limits industrial saline streams have a more favourable ratio prime sources with suitable ratios are mainly generated by the agri food sector and include meat canning pickled vegetables dairy products and fish processing where the latter usually contains seawater with high sulfate concentrations other potential saline streams are generated by the petroleum and the leather industry in the context of industrial applications ppb can effectively be selected by ir and enriched from natural saline marine sources or the wastewater itself in less than two weeks with a reactor start up up time of less than one week this is considerably faster compared to saline tolerant aerobic and anaerobic enrichment and start up times 80d omil et al 1995 lefebvre et al 2005 and does not require any adaptation which is interesting for industrial saline wastewater treatment plants in addition to short start up times the cod removal of 86 1 7 at hrts around 1 0 d and organic loading rates around 0 8 gcod l 1 d 1 are comparable with saline aerobic treatment systems this includes sequencing batch reactors sbr hrt 20 240 h olr 0 4 0 7 gcod l 1 d 1 moon et al 2003 lefebvre et al 2004 and activated sludge systems hrt 35 72 h olr 0 9 3 2 gcod l 1 d 1 kargi et al 2000 khannous et al 2003 and to a lesser extent higher olr fed batch reactors rotating biodiscs and membrane bioreactors as summarised by lefebvre and moletta 2006 the tn and tp removal of 62 2 0 and 51 2 6 respectively are low compared to aerobic systems 90 of tkn and po4 p saline fed sbr 5 d hrt lefebvre et al 2005 we note that nitrifiers and denitrifiers are sensitive to salt levels and ppb nutrient removal efficiency may be increased with a higher cod n ratio a comparison with saline anaerobic technologies such as continuous stirred tank reactors cstr and upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb shows the ppb can achieve comparable hrts but generally lower olr gebauer 2004 aspé et al 1997 the main differences however are the removal of tn and tp as well as the absence of biogas and h2s in a panmbr the latter generally reduces the potential inhibition of the microbial community in the ppb system reduces h2s related odor problems and increases operational safety in the absence of methane production and given the increased costs of illumination 8 1 kwh m 3 treated vs anaerobic treatment the utilisation of ppb biomass as single cell protein might offer an alternative revenue stream for agri food streams when grown on saline food processing streams this is highly relevant we confirmed high crude protein content of the biomass 0 62 0 21 gcp gvs 1 in this study which is well in line with previous reported crude protein contents of ppb biomass hülsen et al 2018a shipman et al 1975 combined with yields around 0 8 gcod gcod 1 fed commercially relevant amounts of scp can be generated from saline high strength wastewaters utilising ppb technology ppb biomass has been tested as a feed ingredient at small inclusion rates in economically important species such as nile tilapia marble goby barramundi and tor tambroides banerjee et al 2000 chowdhury et al 2016 loo et al 2015 shapawi et al 2012 the use of ppb biomass as bulk substitute for fishmeal in commercial fish diets was reported by delamare deboutteville et al 2019 the latter would give the ppb biomass a theoretical value of fishmeal which is around between 1400 and 1800 usd tonne 1 asche et al 2013 the results further indicate a general robustness towards salt concentrations between 30 and 70 ms cm 1 which might be an advantage when treating industrial effluents as concentrations shifts gradually and rapid usually impact the cod removal due to reduced removal in addition to soluble cod release cellular materials kincannon and gaudy jr 1966 however the process requires anaerobic conditions for effective ppb selection 4 conclusions purple phototrophic bacteria are effective and dominant mediators for simultaneous and organics and nutrients removal from saline nacl amended and marine red sea salt amended wastewaters removal of cod n p is in the proportion of 100 6 5 1 0 with high yields 0 8 gcod gcod 1 fed similar to freshwater systems ppb limited electron availability for sulfate reducers when fed sea salt including high sulfate levels such that no substantial h2s was produced the reactor microbial community shifted from allochromatium sp and rhodobacter sp to rhodovulum sp in 190 d the adapted community was halophilic with batch tests having a broad optimum between 20 and 70 ms cm 1 with the potential to withstand hypersaline conditions up to 140 ms cm 1 at 50 decreased activity

solids ww wastewater 1 introduction the industrial use of salt use of seawater for industrial process water and for toilet flushing municipally as well as sewer infiltration generates large flows of organic and nutrient rich saline wastewaters this is relevant for both domestic wastewater e g where seawater is used for toilet flushing or industrial wastewaters particularly marine fish and microalgae processing biological removal of organics and nutrients is adversely impacted by high salinity due to the inhibitory effects of dissolved salts intrasungkha et al 1999 adverse effects such as plasmolysis and the activity loss affect aerobic anoxic and anaerobic organisms this results in limited extent of adaptation sensitivity to changes in ionic strength reduced degradation kinetics and poor settleability kargi and dincer 1996 biomass acclimation and adaptation can improve biological performance compared to non adapted communities panswad and anan 1999 this includes the presence of halophiles especially at salinities of over 2 0 kargi and uygur 2005 lefebvre and moletta 2006 anaerobic digestion of salty high strength wastes is particularly inhibited by sodium chloride kugelman and mccarty 1965 which results in reduced volatile solids vs destruction and consequently decreased methane production while stepwise adaptation reduces inhibitory effects and allows for effective treatment at salinities up to 70 g l 1 lefebvre and moletta 2006 adaptation periods can be very long up to 2 years mendez et al 1995 operation and adaptation are further complicated by high sulfate concentrations in seawater sources omil et al 1995 rinzema and lettinga 1988 sulfate is reduced to sulfides by sulfate reducing bacteria srb in the presence of organic acids sulfide is an inhibitor of anaerobic microbes at levels of 100 200 mgh2s s l 1 omil et al 1995 this h2s also affects downstream nutrient removal as anammox microbes are severely impaired by h2s as low as 0 03 mm carvajal arroyo et al 2013 although adaptation to saline conditions is possible 3 nacl kartal et al 2006 as opposed to anammox marine microalgae can withstand high h2s concentrations bahr et al 2014 and have been extensively researched and are applied for wastewater treatment and commercially produced in large scale ponds milledge 2011 jiang et al 2011 another far less researched option with the potential to simultaneous remove cod and nutrients in one treatment step is the application of purple phototrophic bacteria ppb ppb based wastewater treatment relies on assimilative uptake of organics and nutrients to discharge limits hülsen et al 2016 in an ir irradiated photo bioreactor salt tolerant ppb have been enriched and isolated from a vast variety of saline sources including sediments brackish lagoons and saline sulfur springs overmann et al 1992 guyoneaud et al 2002 and h2s tolerance is a common feature among ppb kobayashi et al 1983 it is unknown whether ppb based technology is viable for marine wastewater treatment nor whether h2s can be effectively eliminated or controlled sulfate in seawater is not an electron source for ppb while anaerobic sulfate reduction forms useable h2s ppb have the possibility to both minimise sulfate reduction by competition for electron donors such as organic acids and eliminate sulfide utilising it as an electron donor while h2s removal by ppb from anaerobic effluents non saline was previously reported garcia et al 2017 substantial sulfide was produced when ppb rhodopseudomonas palustris were fed non saline food processing wastewater with a feed sulfur sulfate and sulfite concentration of 420 mgs l 1 chiemchaisri et al 2007 in this case ppb could not effectively compete for electrons with srb and did not utilise sulfide as electron donor there are very few references to the use of ppb for saline wastewater treatment the only continuous reactor study qin et al 2017 found effective cod 80 and nh4 n 84 removal for saline 30 gnacl l 1 industrial food processing wastewater utilising rhodopseudomonas palustris however the ecology was not evaluated and we note rps palustris is a salt tolerant freshwater species imhoff 1988 and will likely be outcompeted by true marine ppb species over longer periods a batch study also used a strain of salt tolerant rhodopseudomonas and found inhibition at increasing salinities while total carotenoid and bacteriochlorophyll contents increased at 50 gnacl l 1 relative to a freshwater control wang et al 2017 this study aims to determine the capacity of a mixed native ppb culture for saline wastewater treatment nacl only and marine wastewater with high sulfate and other ions using domestic wastewater as a proxy the key objectives were a determination of basic ppb based process performance at seawater salinity 40 ms cm 1 2 8 b evaluate level of adaptation and microbial shift through sequencing and activity tests and c identify the degree to which a ppb based system can suppress sulfate reduction in marine wastewaters 2 material and methods 2 1 marine purple phototrophic bacteria enrichment brisbane river water samples with small amounts of mud sediment were collected from the river edge 27 29 44 0 s 153 01 05 8 e as a source for marine saline ppb the river water conductivity at the time of sample collection was 35 2 ms cm 1 at 10 c but can vary depending on tides season and many other factors yu et al 2014 in the case of lower conductivities of river water lowest conductivity was 21 7 ms cm 1 collected over next four weeks nacl was added to reach a uniform 35 ms cm 1 for the enrichment three 160 ml serum flasks were filled with 90 ml of river sample and spiked with 100 mg n l 1 nh4cl 50 mg p l 1 k2hpo4 and 500 mgcod l 1 as ch3cooh the ph was

panmbr operation the panmbr consisted of a 2 l rectangular clear acrylic flat plate reactor width length and height 2 0 34 and 40 cm equipped with a submerged flat sheet membrane kubota osaka japan the system was continuously fed while level controlled effluent draining was semi continuous as for hülsen et al 2016 mixing was achieved via a headspace recirculation gas compressor 6 l min 1 and the gas recirculation line was equipped with a h2s sensor odalog l2 placed in a 5 l gastight acrylic vessel the panmbr had an illuminated surface to volume ratio of 18 m2 m 3 and was continuously illuminated at an average irradiance of 18 7 w m 2 spatial distribution over the reactor wall as per hülsen et al 2018b acetic acid hac was dosed directly into the reactor via the bottom with a programmable syringe pump ne 8000 scientific instrument services inc ringoes usa at around 0 629 ml h 1 383 mgcod l 1 total feed to achieve an acetate concentration equivalent to adding 280 mgcod l 1

was implemented after period i the reactor operation was further divided into 5 periods to determine the effect of nacl salt period i ii 262 d addition prior to switching to domestic wastewater with red sea salt for another 110 d period iii v note during period iii a compressor leak accidently introduced air into the system dissolved oxygen do concentration of 4 8 mg l 1 and due to the immediate color loss purple color loss this period was extended to further characterise aerobic operation during period v the illumination was switched off period v only lasted for 7 d because the biological process failed due to extensive h2s formation the operational conditions of each period are summarised in table 1 2 4 varying conductivity salinity batch tests varying conductivity batch tests were

et al 2018b 2 7 data processing and statistical analysis cumulative mass balances were performed on tcod tn and tp to determine losses mass not accounted by the mass balance and recovery potentials in terms of mass and capture efficiency in the biomass mass loadings were calculated using hydraulic daily influent flow multiplied by measured mass concentration calculations for which daily data was missing in the effluent or sludge linear interpolation interp1 command in matlab of data measured on the days before and after were utilised the cod capture efficiency was calculated with the interpolated loads considering the particulate cod tcod scod of the withdrawn sludge over the tcod influent load over time measurement results for inputs are presented below as averages and

level 3 results and discussion 3 1 marine ppb enrichment the saline serum flasks inoculated with river water developed a purple colour after 7 d figure s1 this colour intensified after serial dilutions while cod nh4 n and po4 p removal increased and characteristic peaks above 800 nm spectrophotometric scan emerged data not shown as previously described for domestic wastewater enrichment hülsen et al 2014 after the 4th serial dilution the microbial analysis confirmed the presence of ppb which is further detailed in the microbial part and presented in fig 2 inoculum 3 2 reactor performance system performance including cod n and p removal is shown in fig 1 over the entire standard operational period effluent concentrations averaged 126 mgcod l 1 28 mgn l 1 and 7 mgp l 1 which is not at a suitable quality for direct discharge this equates with moderate average cod n and p removals of 86 1 7 62 2 0 and 51 2 6 respectively the effluent concentrations over time are provided in figure s2 as reported previously ppb assimilate around 6 0 8 0 gtn and 1 0 2 0 gtp for every 100 gtcod hülsen et al 2016 and similar ratios were seen here see next section this means additional cod either externally added or natively present will result in an increased nutrient uptake and removal efficiency hülsen et al 2016 the study found adverse effects of oxygen dissolved oxygen 4 8 mg l 1 during period iii resulted in instant colour loss due to the loss of carotenoids pemberton et al 1998 cod removal was maintained probably due to heterotrophic oxidation however tn and tp removal decreased due to the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate up to 13 4 mgno2 n l 1 day 290 and 36 mgno3 n day 293 figure s2 with reduced assimilative removal this was likely due to the population shift caused by the aerobic conditions as well as slightly reduced cod n p substrates ratios of aerobic heteroptrophs after re establishing anaerobic conditions during period iv cod tn and tp removal recovered with high sulfate input 730 mgso4 s l 1 due to the use of red sea salt during period iv the h2s concentration remained below 2 0 mgs l 1 for over 80 d indicating limited srb activity this changed immediately when the lights were switched off during period v within two days the h2s concentration in the liquid increased to 23 mgs l 1 and further increased to 90 mgs l 1 after 7 d fig 1b thus after 80d or 26 srts of ir suppression of srb by ppb srb subsequently emerged after 2 d without radiation 3 3 nutrient and cod recovery the mass balances based closures fraction of influent effluent and solids combined accounted for 82 1 0 cod 84 0 3 tn and 78 0 8 tp over 372 d the cumulative loads in and out are shown in figure s3 the sulfur balances closed to 104 biomass yields were 0 8 0 02gcod gcod 1 fed with 51 and 45 of the influent tn and tp incorporated into the biomass this results in a cod n p substrate ratio of 100 6 5 1 0 well in line with previously reported results in non saline conditions hülsen et al 2016 the crude protein cp content of the biomass tkn based was 0 62 0 21 gcp gvs 1 as seen in other wastewaters low salinity hülsen et al 2018a this is in the range of cp contents of other bacterial biomass anupama and ravindra 2000 but the main advantage of ppb including marine fed ppb is a relatively high capture extent compared with heterotrophic biomass due to higher biomass yields 3 4 microbial analysis of the panmbr microbial analysis confirmed the dominance of ppb but with a substantial shift in the continuous reactor from inoculum fig 2 the inoculum was dominated by allochromatium sp 34 4 marichromatium sp 3 4 and 0 8 of rhodovulum sp flanking the microbial community in the panmbr gradually shifted from an evenly distributed community 10 each of allochromatium sp rhodobacter sp and rhodovulum sp towards rhodovulum sp dominance up to 50 during periods i and ii this dominance of rhodovulum sp has not been previously observed in domestic or agri industrial wastewater trials on non saline wastewaters hülsen et al 2016 2018a rhodovulum sp originally described as rhodopseudomonas was the first marine purple non sulfur genus discovered hansen and veldkamp 1973 and has selective advantages in saline environments due to higher optimum salt concentrations over typical freshwater genera such as rhodobacter or allochromatium imhoff 2001 freshwater genera can exist in marine habitats and compete with marine species but marine species cannot grow in freshwater habitats imhoff 2001 this likely is the cause for the gradual shift from a mix of allochromatium sp rhodobacter sp towards marine rhodovulum sp dominance after 190 d fig 2 the non phototrophic flanking community did not appear to change substantially during period 2 with saline tolerant organisms such as pseudomonadaceae and pseudoalteromonas maintained between 5 and 15 relative abundance ra where representatives of both families have been reported in anaerobic environments xiao et al 2009 cheng et al 2019 the hydrogenotrophic methanobrevibacter sp previously detected in marine sediments kita et al 2016 was present at low abundances 0 1 0 9 in the first 143d but was below 0 07 afterwards during the aerobic period iii thalassospira sp emerged while ppb species were completely depleted with thalossospira being 85 ra at day 295 these are known to utilise acetic acid lópez lópez et al 2002 and were likely responsible for the aerobic cod removal thalassospira sp have been reported to utilise nitrate or ammonia as n source lópez lópez et al 2002 with some species able to perform denitrification liu et al 2007 interestingly we did not detect typical ammonium oxidising bacteria e g nitrospira nitrosomomas nitrobacter in the community although up to 36 mgno3 n l 1 were detected during period iii figure s2 anaerobic conditions were re established in period iv after 3 0d the purple color returned and a mix of ppb including but not dominated by rhodovulum sp re emerged tn and tp removal performance was regained the h2s suppression was underlined by the very low relative abundances 0 15 of srb in periods i iv desulfobacteraceae at these low relative abundances was the only identified sulfate reducer 3 5 batch test in addition to the reactor operation batch tests at multiple conductivities 0 5 160 ms cm 1 with saline adapted and unadapted ppb biomass were done to assess acclimatisation extent and capacity at varying salt concentrations fig 3 provides acetate uptake activity for unadapted samples as well as adapted samples taken between days 209 and 248 the maximum acetate uptake rate for unadapted inoculum was approximately 40 higher than for adapted inoculum 1 35 vs 0 9 gcod gvss 1d 1 the unadapted inoculum had a threshold type response to increased salt concentration where inhibition initiates at a lower limit and is complete at an upper limit the 50 inhibitory concentration or ki50 is normally the average of these astals et al 2018 the onset threshold was 20 ms cm 1 and a half maximal inhibition ki50 of approximately 30 ms cm 1 with almost complete inhibition at 40 ms cm 1 i e seawater concentration the adapted inoculum taken from the panmbr between day 209 and 248 fig 3 had a stimulatory inhibitory response with a broad optimum between 30 and 70 ms cm 1 this therefore represents a halophilic community since activity was minimal below 20 ms cm 1 even at conductivities 80 ms cm 1 twice seawater hac cod was still consumed at around 20 reduced rates actually indicating the presence of hypersaline microbes rhodovulum species have been described as such imhoff 2003 fig 4 shows the microbial composition at the end of the saline adapted biomass batch tests the results provide interpretation for the trends by indicating that rhodovulum sp was with 60 relative abundance the main mediator between 40 and 80 ms cm 1 above 100 ms cm 1 decreasing rhodovulum sp abundances indicate a shift towards pseudoalteromonas sp 3 6 significance for industrial application this study showed that ppb can simultaneously remove and partition cod n and p from saline and potentially hypersaline wastewaters at similar strengths to domestic wastewater the use of either nacl or red sea salt with high sulfate did not affect treatment performance this study further confirmed a cod n p assimilation ratio of 100 6 5 1 0 previously reported for non saline domestic hülsen et al 2016 and a range of agri industrial wastewaters hülsen et al 2018a 2018b several other process parameters such as hrt yield cp content and removal rates are essentially the same in saline and non saline panmbrs as such we consider this work as transferrable to other saline streams while domestic streams have limited bioavailable cod and would require external cod addition to achieve nutrient discharge limits industrial saline streams have a more favourable ratio prime sources with suitable ratios are mainly generated by the agri food sector and include meat canning pickled vegetables dairy products and fish processing where the latter usually contains seawater with high sulfate concentrations other potential saline streams are generated by the petroleum and the leather industry in the context of industrial applications ppb can effectively be selected by ir and enriched from natural saline marine sources or the wastewater itself in less than two weeks with a reactor start up up time of less than one week this is considerably faster compared to saline tolerant aerobic and anaerobic enrichment and start up times 80d omil et al 1995 lefebvre et al 2005 and does not require any adaptation which is interesting for industrial saline wastewater treatment plants in addition to short start up times the cod removal of 86 1 7 at hrts around 1 0 d and organic loading rates around 0 8 gcod l 1 d 1 are comparable with saline aerobic treatment systems this includes sequencing batch reactors sbr hrt 20 240 h olr 0 4 0 7 gcod l 1 d 1 moon et al 2003 lefebvre et al 2004 and activated sludge systems hrt 35 72 h olr 0 9 3 2 gcod l 1 d 1 kargi et al 2000 khannous et al 2003 and to a lesser extent higher olr fed batch reactors rotating biodiscs and membrane bioreactors as summarised by lefebvre and moletta 2006 the tn and tp removal of 62 2 0 and 51 2 6 respectively are low compared to aerobic systems 90 of tkn and po4 p saline fed sbr 5 d hrt lefebvre et al 2005 we note that nitrifiers and denitrifiers are sensitive to salt levels and ppb nutrient removal efficiency may be increased with a higher cod n ratio a comparison with saline anaerobic technologies such as continuous stirred tank reactors cstr and upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb shows the ppb can achieve comparable hrts but generally lower olr gebauer 2004 aspé et al 1997 the main differences however are the removal of tn and tp as well as the absence of biogas and h2s in a panmbr the latter generally reduces the potential inhibition of the microbial community in the ppb system reduces h2s related odor problems and increases operational safety in the absence of methane production and given the increased costs of illumination 8 1 kwh m 3 treated vs anaerobic treatment the utilisation of ppb biomass as single cell protein might offer an alternative revenue stream for agri food streams when grown on saline food processing streams this is highly relevant we confirmed high crude protein content of the biomass 0 62 0 21 gcp gvs 1 in this study which is well in line with previous reported crude protein contents of ppb biomass hülsen et al 2018a shipman et al 1975 combined with yields around 0 8 gcod gcod 1 fed commercially relevant amounts of scp can be generated from saline high strength wastewaters utilising ppb technology ppb biomass has been tested as a feed ingredient at small inclusion rates in economically important species such as nile tilapia marble goby barramundi and tor tambroides banerjee et al 2000 chowdhury et al 2016 loo et al 2015 shapawi et al 2012 the use of ppb biomass as bulk substitute for fishmeal in commercial fish diets was reported by delamare deboutteville et al 2019 the latter would give the ppb biomass a theoretical value of fishmeal which is around between 1400 and 1800 usd tonne 1 asche et al 2013 the results further indicate a general robustness towards salt concentrations between 30 and 70 ms cm 1 which might be an advantage when treating industrial effluents as concentrations shifts gradually and rapid usually impact the cod removal due to reduced removal in addition to soluble cod release cellular materials kincannon and gaudy jr 1966 however the process requires anaerobic conditions for effective ppb selection 4 conclusions purple phototrophic bacteria are effective and dominant mediators for simultaneous and organics and nutrients removal from saline nacl amended and marine red sea salt amended wastewaters removal of cod n p is in the proportion of 100 6 5 1 0 with high yields 0 8 gcod gcod 1 fed similar to freshwater systems ppb limited electron availability for sulfate reducers when fed sea salt including high sulfate levels such that no substantial h2s was produced the reactor microbial community shifted from allochromatium sp and rhodobacter sp to rhodovulum sp in 190 d the adapted community was halophilic with batch tests having a broad optimum between 20 and 70 ms cm 1 with the potential to withstand hypersaline conditions up to 140 ms cm 1 at 50 decreased activity

18741,conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps clean wastewater and minimize water pollution but while doing so they also contribute to air pollution and need energy material input with associated emissions however energy recovery e g anaerobic digestion and resource recovery e g water reuse allow us to offset the adverse environmental impacts of wastewater treatment life cycle assessments lca have been used more and more to evaluate the environmental impacts of wwtps and to suggest improvement options there is a need to search for resource recovery applications that genuinely realize a net zero impact on the total environment of wwtps in this work a scheme with highly efficient energy and resource recovery especially for thermal energy is proposed and evaluated the environmental impact of a conventional wwtp in comparison with the scheme proposed here with energy resource recovery included was calculated and discussed with reference to lca methodology in the process of using lca it was necessary to choose a regional situation to focus on in this case a chinese situation was focused as a reference but the qualitative information gained is of worldwide relevance the results clearly revealed that conventional wwtp does not benefit the total environment as a whole while the new scheme benefited the total environment via resource energy recovery based processes among others thermal energy recovery played a significant role towards a net zero lca analysis contributing around 40 which suggests that more attention and research should be focused on it graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment plants wwtps resource recovery environmental impacts life cycle assessment lca thermal energy net zero impact 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment is an effective technology to remove oxygen demanding compounds cod and nutrients n and p from wastewater however the role of wastewater treatment plants wwtps is no longer merely constraint to protecting the aquatic environment e g eutrophication or solely evaluated based on the effluent quality on the contrary the holistic environmental impacts other than an aquatic environment have been highlighted in the construction and operation of wwtps guest et al 2009 corominas et al 2013 teodosiu et al 2016 for instance emissions of greenhouse gasses ghg have been recognized as a major negative impact of wwtp operation kampschreur et al 2009 foley et al 2010 fang et al 2016 the previous studies have explicitly demonstrated that the total environmental impacts of a typical wwtp is always negative corominas et al 2013 hellweg and milà i canals 2014 wwtps bring about a net global adverse impact on the environment when the external energy and chemical input and consumption are accounted for by life cycle assessment lca methods of course the local improved water quality is the main driver for treating wastewater according to estimations the annual electricity input for wwtps in the usa accounts for about 3 of the national total consumption eia 2010 apparently the health of the aquatic environment is achieved at the sacrifice of other environmental compartments because of materials and energy consumption roeleveld et al 1997 corominas et al 2013 from a holistic perspective wwtps could be considered to be a source of pollution rather than a barrier for emissions this situation is becoming worse along with increasingly stringent discharge standards such as the campaign for upgrading and reconstruction of wwtps in china hao 2006 zhu et al 2013 wang et al 2015b in order to minimize the overall impact of wastewater treatment and put wwtp design and operation on a more sustainable track several concepts and improvements have been proposed for instance energy balancing or carbon neutrality has been widely accepted as a concept and is already achieved in practice mo and zhang 2012 gao et al 2014 hao et al 2015 wang et al 2015a chen et al 2018 these concepts highlight the energy carrier feature of wastewater and the necessity of recovering energy anaerobic digestion on the one hand has long been a commonly applied process for extracting organic energy from wastewater in the form of biogas which can be converted to electricity green gas or thermal energy mo and zhang 2013 tomei et al 2015 shiu et al 2017 however organic energy is effectively barely enough to meet the energy demand of a wwtp the harvested energy via anaerobic digestion can only harvest around 10 of the total energy in wastewater shizas and bagley 2004 heidrich et al 2011 hao et al 2015 2018 nutrient n and p recovery from wastewater is another pathway to offset the adverse environmental impacts however more efficient recovery processes or high value added products are yet to be found if we are to achieve a full trade off with energy resource consumption mo and zhang 2013 thus further research into alternative energy resource recovery pathways is warranted thermal energy recovery from wastewater has largely been ignored but it may contribute significantly to offsetting the adverse environmental impacts of wwtps hao et al 2018 wastewater has a substantial thermal energy potential and is an excellent heat resource for effective and economical operation of heat pumps the heat recovered in situ is the best option as where the treatment plant itself needs much heat such as sludge drying niemela and saarela 2009 eneco delft 2010 nowak et al 2015 kollmann et al 2016 or is positioned close to an area that needs heating cooling energy an evaluation of heat recovery on the environmental impact of a wwtp is still lacking in recent years lca has been applied to evaluate the impact of wwtps on the environment lundin et al 2004 pasqualino et al 2009 loubet et al 2014 as well as to suggest improvement options buonocore et al 2016 remy et al 2016 including both domestic and industrial wastewater vlasopoulos et al 2006 in china lca studies often use some foreign normalized benchmark values and weights for calculation which produce results that often deviate from chinese conditions chen et al 2003 huang et al 2014 wang et al 2015b gallego schmid and tarpani 2019 in this study the current lca framework was adapted for chinese conditions by localizing the normalization factors and relative weights this allowed the regional impact of wastewater discharge to be calculated with this lca approach the overall environmental impacts of a wwtp in china were evaluated and compared to potential resource energy recovery options particularly highlighting thermal energy recovery it was expected that the present work can ascertain the effect of the thermal energy recovery on improving the impact of wwtps on the total environment 2 lca methodology based on the existing standard lca models iso 2006a iso 2006b goedkoop et al 2009 some adjustments were made to improve and optimize the accuracy by localizing normalization factors and relative weights to the chinese situation 2 1 goal and scope definition the targeted municipal wwtp consists of two parallel biological wastewater treatment lines an oxidation ditch and a 5 stage bardenpho process and a combined sludge treatment line the plant is located in changzhi city shanxi china the first wastewater line receives 59 200 m3 d designed inflow 100 000 m3 d and the second line handles 91 500 m3 d designed inflow 100 000 m3 d the secondary effluent from the parallel treatment lines is merged prior to tertiary treatment and discharge as the final combined effluent cod 18 mg l bod5 4 mg l ss 6 mg l tn 13 mg n l nh4 0 6 mg n l and po4 3 0 3 mg p l both treatment lines have an identical service term of 20 yrs in the wastewater treatment lines p removal is enhanced by dosing chemicals poly aluminum chloride and polyacrylamide in a high efficiency fiber filtration process on the effluent flow the plant must meet the discharge standard class i a of china gb 18918 2002 2002 cod 50 mg l bod5 10 mg l ss 10 mg l tn 15 mg n l nh4 5 mg n l and po4 3 0 5 mg p l excess sludge is after dewatering transported outside the plant for landfilling disposal a distance of 6 km from the plant the function unit fu used in this study is defined as person equivalent p e for a period of 1 year which is most commonly used in similar studies lundin et al 2000 hospido et al 2004 that is 1 fu 1 pe a according to the chinese standard gb 50014 2006 2016 the wastewater volume per pe was set at 0 1 m3 d in this study 2 2 scenario construction the base case scenario covers the construction operation and demolition stages of the targeted wwtp pennington et al 2004 iso 2006b all of the energy materials input output between the influent and effluent were considered in the lca application fig 1 a in contrast the resource recovery scenario was a proposed plant with highly efficient resource energy recovery as shown in fig 1b the tertiary effluent was firstly used for heat exchange by water source heat pump wshp and then reused for industrial cooling water in nearby power plants the harvested heat can be used for sludge drying inside in the wwtp as well as air conditioning instead of landfilling as in base case scenario the sludge in the resource recovery scenario was transported to an incineration plant with thermal energy recovery and electricity production capabilities finally phosphorus can be recovered from incineration ash following which the abstracted ash can be used in construction materials lynn et al 2018 świerczek et al 2018 2 3 inventory analysis life cycle inventory lci data was collected from operating reports for existing processes and databases the inventory data on materials or energy input and environmental discharge during construction operation and demolition was obtained from the internal data of the assessed plant see table s1 supplementary information background inventory data was obtained through the chinese life cycle database clcd ike 2010 that contains unit process data that is mainly valid for chinese markets in the assessment calculations methods of carbon emissions from wastewater treatment and sludge treatment disposal landfill and incineration are also based on the literature monteith et al 2005 ipcc 2006 yang 2013 among others input in the demolition phase is mainly for energy consumption 95 kw h m2 approximately 90 of the total energy consumption in the construction phase liu 2010 during the demolition process removed rebar could be recycled and remaining concrete would become waste the average recovery efficiency of removed rebar is 0 38 t t in china gao et al 2016 recycled rebar can offset consumption of building materials in a new construction phase thus the impact of recycled rebar on the environment is included in this assessment the calculation regarding the involved resource energy recovery was based on previous studies hao et al 2015 2018 2019 xu 2015 alyaseri and zhou 2017 amann et al 2018 among others egle et al 2015 and amann et al 2018 indicated that recovered p resource from sewage sludge ash ssa exhibited a higher potential for p recovery 70 90 of p at the wwtp s inlet 80 in this study than direct recovery at the wastewater treatment plant the related data see table s1 about the supplemented facilities for the resource energy recovery in both construction and demolition phases was estimated according to the existing literature jossa and remy 2015 egle et al 2015 alyaseri and zhou 2017 amann et al 2018 mcquay 2018 the base case scenario can meet the needs of the standards for effluent reuse and so no extra facilities will be needed in practice hao et al 2018 indicated that wshp could recover thermal energy 4 c temperature difference for heating with 1 77 kw h m3 net energy production which was adopted in this study incineration can completely destroy organic substances minimizing landfilling and generate electricity with 0 5 kw h m3 hao et al 2019 which was also adopted in this study all detailed data inventory is listed in table s1 2 4 impact assessment the life cycle impact assessment lcia is a crucial part of the lca process at present there is no generally accepted assessment approach due to its complexity and difficulty pennington et al 2004 dreyer et al 2008 generally accepted lcia approaches are environmental design of industrial edip from denmark life cycle assessment an operational guide to the iso standards 2001 cml2001 from the environmental research center of leiden university and the ecological index method eco indicator 99 and environmental priority strategies in product development eps from sweden dreyer et al 2008 luo et al 2013 respectively this study used lca method cml2001 with adaptations to make it suitable for the chinese context 2 4 1 classification based on the available data from the plant important indicators for the environmental impacts that are considered in the study are presented in table s2 at a mid point level goedkoop et al 2009 yang 2013 indicators include global warming potential gwp eutrophication potential ep acidification potential ap abiotic resources depletion potential adp human toxicity potential htp black and odor potential bop landfill space depletion potential lsd and freshwater use fwu respectively among others bop is not a necessary impact category defined in standard lca methods but it could reflect an urgent water pollution problem in china and is therefore included in this assessment 2 4 2 characterization according to the classification of the environmental impacts characterization factors cf can be used to calculate the environmental burden eb gallego schmid and tarpani 2019 eb is a weighted summation of the individual environmental impact factors eq 1 among others the calculation of bop and lsd was based on the previous literature deng and wang 2003 liang 2012 by eq 2 and eq 3 respectively 1 e b i 1 n m i c f i 2 b o p m c o d c f c o d m n h 4 c f n h 4 3 l s d i 1 n m i d i where i is the kinds of chemical substances contained in all the emission substances n is the total number of impact substances in the emission substances mi is the mass of i substance in the inventory analysis cfi is the characterization factor of the impact caused by i substance on each environmental category mcod is the biodegradable cod di is the average waste density 2 4 3 quantification normalization environmental burden neb can be evaluated from eb values compared to local benchmark values and relative values after comparison are usually taken ec jrc 2010 liang 2012 for the chinese situation localizing the benchmark values were conducted before normalization the gwp benchmark value was calculated according to china s average annual co2 emissions per capita the global carbon project peters et al 2015 the adp benchmark value was calculated according to china s consumption data on energy 2012 bp world energy statistics yearbook bp group 2013 the ep bop ap lsd and fwu benchmark values were calculated based on the statistical data national bureau of statistics 2018 ministry of ecology and environment 2018 htp benchmark values were still based on the cml2001 nov 2010 evaluation standard system huppes and van oers 2010 all of these benchmark calculations take their data from the same year 2010 the analytic hierarchy process ahp was applied to calculate weighting values ahp is a practical multi criteria and decision making method the process of ahp is to simplify complicated environmental problems into different combination factors according to the nature of the problem and the objectives to be achieved and then to form a top down dominating relationship liang 2012 yang 2013 the structuring process of the judgment matrix was divided into two steps i scaling importance based on table s3 and testing logical consistency according to the relative importance between the two two comparison of different environmental impacts liang 2012 yang 2013 ii calculating weighting values w according to the importance of the different environmental impacts from table s4 the literature and also local wwtps liang 2012 vera et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 the relative importance of the different environmental impacts can be expressed in a judgment matrix as shown in table s4 to make the judgment matrix logical it is necessary that its consistency is properly checked a calculation indicates that the consistency index cr consistency ratio of the matrix a is equal to 0 08 cr 0 1 demonstrating that the judgment matrix a is logical in its consistency the scaled matrix can be normalized according to its columns eq 4 and the normalized matrix is as follows eq 5 4 a i j a i j k 1 7 a k j i j 1 2 7 5 0 339 0 437 0 311 0 320 0 284 0 252 0 221 0 207 0 113 0 146 0 311 0 107 0 142 0 151 0 110 0 172 0 169 0 073 0 156 0 320 0 284 0 252 0 257 0 069 0

051 0 034 eq 8 presents the weighting values of every environmental impact in the total environment for the assessed plant finally the total environmental impact value of wwtps can be calculated according to eq 9 with which final results can be used to assess the impacts of different wwtps on the total environment 9 l c i a i n w i n e b i where lcia is the total index value of life cycle impact assessment wi is weighting values of environmental impacts and nebi is the normalized environmental burden 3 results and discussion 3 1 environmental impact of base case scenario 3 1 1 characteristic results and analysis according to the standard lca methods all the characteristic results for the same environmental impact have to be transformed into their equivalent units based on the statistical analysis the environmental impacts caused by material consumption energy consumption and direct environmental emissions can be calculated according to one unit of fu 1 pe a to meet the need of the discharge standard class i a as shown in table 1 the relative contributions of different phases of the plant s life cycle to the different environmental impacts are shown in fig 2 the environmental impact is largely most around 90 derived from the operational phase of the treatment plant fig 2 these results are consistent with previous studies foley et al 2010 pasqualino et al 2010 the environmental impacts for line 1 and line 2 are roughly similar but adp from line 2 was higher due to the complicated bardenpho process which resulted in higher consumptions of both materials and energy in construction 3 1 2 normalization results and analysis the normalization factors and normalized results for the chinese context are listed in table s5 as shown in table s5 global warming potential gwp and landfill space depletion potential lsd accounted for the highest environmental impacts while eutrophication potential ep and human toxicity potential htp had the lowest environmental impact the normalized environmental impacts indicate that the magnitude of gwp is the same as for bop although the total amount of gwp is larger its contribution to the total environmental impact index is actually comparable to that of bop table s5 the effluent quality has a reverse relationship with the greenhouse impact if the discharge standard continues to be upgraded bop and ep would certainly decline but gwp and other environmental impacts would increase sharply an effect that is consistent with other studies zhu et al 2013 wang et al 2015b 3 1 3 total environmental impact the normalized environmental impacts shown in table s5 can be expressed as row vectors as below 10 a 1 0 01 1 44 10 12 0 01 3 33 10 5 2 22 10 12 4 64 10 3 0 14 1 29 10 4 11 a 2 0 01 1 44 10 12 0 01 3 63 10 5 2 67 10 12 4 65 10 3 0 17 1 34 10 4 by calculating a1 w and a2 w w is the relative weight of the environmental impact which is described in section 2 4 3 the total environmental impact indexes of the two treatment lines are calculated respectively at lcia1 0 0118 and lcia2 0 0132 per fu obviously the plant does not benefit the total environment in which line 2 has a larger impact than line 1 mainly due to the longer wastewater treatment process of line 2 currently the plant consumes electricity generated from coal and so increasing energy consumption would inevitably lead to increasing the environmental impacts including indirect greenhouse gas emissions atmospheric acidification and depletion of non renewable resources caused by electricity generation for the foreseeable future china will be reliant on coal derived electricity without resource energy recovery involved in wwtps it is really difficult to acquire a net zero impact or even to create a benefit on the total environment impact index to make the wwtps approach to the net zero impact and or to benefit of wwtps on the total environment the contribution of potential resource energy recovery need to be included in the assessment 3 2 environmental impact of resource recovery scenario 3 2 1 characteristic results and analysis the calculations for this scenario were identical to those for the base case scenario section 3 1 1 after statistical analysis the characteristic results of the resource recovery scenario are listed in table 2 as shown in table 2 some values in the operation phase appear negative which also results in negative values mostly for the total characteristic results clearly the impacts of the resource energy recovery on the total environment are significant and the resource energy recovery helps to reach a net benefit for the total environment 3 2 2 normalization results and analysis the same normalization method was applied as described in section 3 1 2 the relative weights of the environmental impacts have been given in section 2 4 3 after the statistical analysis the normalized environmental impacts of the resource recovery scenario are listed in table s6 to make a comparison the normalized environmental impacts from the two processes are illustrated in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the impact reduction of lsd on the environment is highly significant caused from the resource recovery scenario in which the normalized environmental values are sharply reduced to 0 01 and 0 01 from 0 143 to 0 171 respectively for line 1 and line 2 obviously the large reduction in lsd is attributed to saving the landfill space by sludge incineration and ash utilization although the characteristic values fig 3 of the resource recovery scenario still emerge as positive on ep the normalized environmental impacts 1 43 10 12 have become a very small share into the total environmental impact a comparison of the percent contributions of the two processes to each impact category is illustrated in fig 4 clearly the base case scenario has only positive values on the environmental impacts fig 4a fig 4c while the resource recovery scenario process creates some negative values benefiting wwtps as shown in fig 4b and d phosphorus recovery avoided mining contributes to the reduction of the environmental impacts on adp by 21 and 26 respectively for line 1 and line 2 by saving phosphate rock mining ash utilization as construction materials bricks and or cement also contributes significantly to the reduction 40 and 38 of the environmental impacts on lsd due to no sludge landfilling needed moreover electricity generated by sludge incineration and thermal energy recovery by wshp is responsible for reducing the environmental impacts on gwp ap adp and htp by 46 77 fig 4b fig 4d even though both ep and bop in the resource recovery scenario process still have positive values on the environmental impacts due to the pollutants from the effluent the resource energy recovery can offset these impacts on the total environmental 3 2 3 total environmental impact based on the new assessment the indexes lcia of the total environmental impact for the resource recovery scenario are calculated at lcia1 3 50 10 3 and lcia2 3 72 10 3 per fu respectively for line 1 and line 2 3 3 comparison of base case scenario and resource recovery scenario compared to the base case scenario the impacts of the resource recovery scenario on the total environment can both be reduced by 128 130 in which the reduction of 100 is used to balance the impact approaching to the net zero impact on the total environment and the remaining 28 30 is the benefit created by the resource recovery scenario on the total environment the resource energy recovery can indeed alter the total environmental impact but greater benefits will be very difficult to attain unless electricity is supplied by such power sources as solar wind gas or nuclear energy as shown in fig 5 thermal energy recovery contributes to the largest share 38 41 in the increased benefit and organic energy recovery from sludge incineration is the second highest contributor to the increased benefit 30 33 in contrast incineration ash reuse for construction materials production only contributes marginally 5 in the increased benefit which is mainly due to the small amount of incineration ash in china organics cod in wwtps influent is less than in other countries so it is far from reaching net zero environmental impact through organic energy recovery of conventional anaerobic digestion or incineration the calculations concerning an actual wwtp in china cod 400 mg l demonstrate that ad associated with combined heat and power chp is only capable of generating 0 20 kw h m3 which could only supply 53 2 of the actual energy consumption of 0 37 kw h m3 hao et al 2018 although there are some wastewater treatment plants that have attained carbon neutral operation they did so with use of co digestion with organic waste wett et al 2007 srwtf 2012 reardon 2014 in this assessment thermal energy recovery can not only offset the energy deficit of direct sludge incineration but also realized energy neutral or even environmental net zero impact of wwtp overall energy recovery thermal energy chemical energy can attain more than half of the increased benefit furthermore water reuse the third largest contributor to the increased benefit at 16 18 provided slightly less than half of the thermal energy benefit it is worth mentioning that phosphorus recovery contributes more than incineration ash reuse which also proves the importance of phosphorus recovery in wastewater treatment in short fig 5 indicates that if no thermal energy recovery is associated with the resource energy recovery it would be difficult for the resource recovery scenario to attain the net zero impact on the total environment in practice thermal energy recovery is rarely applied in wwtps the scientific literature would seem to indicate anaerobic digestion as the preferred option for energy neutrality it is clear that an integral evaluation of options more objectively presents the way forward and calls for more attention for energy recovery and use from effluent heat 4 conclusions a full scale wwtp and a scheme with added energy resource recovery options were quantitatively assessed by an adapted lca model for its impacts on the total environment the main conclusions are resource energy recovery could help wwtps approach a net zero impact and even benefit the total environment the resource recovery based assessment revealed that common water reuse through effluent recycling is insufficient to reach a net zero impact of the wwtps on the total environment energy recovery can contribute significantly to benefiting the total environment 71 in this area thermal energy recovery plays a significant role contributing about 40 in improving the total impact phosphorus recovery makes limited contributions 6 8 although more than incineration ash reuse for construction materials does 5 in improving the environmental impact nevertheless since phosphate is a

18741,conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps clean wastewater and minimize water pollution but while doing so they also contribute to air pollution and need energy material input with associated emissions however energy recovery e g anaerobic digestion and resource recovery e g water reuse allow us to offset the adverse environmental impacts of wastewater treatment life cycle assessments lca have been used more and more to evaluate the environmental impacts of wwtps and to suggest improvement options there is a need to search for resource recovery applications that genuinely realize a net zero impact on the total environment of wwtps in this work a scheme with highly efficient energy and resource recovery especially for thermal energy is proposed and evaluated the environmental impact of a conventional wwtp in comparison with the scheme proposed here with energy resource recovery included was calculated and discussed with reference to lca methodology in the process of using lca it was necessary to choose a regional situation to focus on in this case a chinese situation was focused as a reference but the qualitative information gained is of worldwide relevance the results clearly revealed that conventional wwtp does not benefit the total environment as a whole while the new scheme benefited the total environment via resource energy recovery based processes among others thermal energy recovery played a significant role towards a net zero lca analysis contributing around 40 which suggests that more attention and research should be focused on it

environment have been highlighted in the construction and operation of wwtps guest et al 2009 corominas et al 2013 teodosiu et al 2016 for instance emissions of greenhouse gasses ghg have been recognized as a major negative impact of wwtp operation kampschreur et al 2009 foley et al 2010 fang et al 2016 the previous studies have explicitly demonstrated that the total environmental impacts of a typical wwtp is always negative corominas et al 2013 hellweg and milà i canals 2014 wwtps bring about a net global adverse impact on the environment when the external energy and chemical input and consumption are accounted for by life cycle assessment lca methods of course the local improved water quality is the main driver for treating wastewater according to estimations the annual electricity input for wwtps in the usa accounts for about 3 of the national total consumption eia 2010 apparently the health of the aquatic environment is achieved at the sacrifice of other environmental compartments because of materials and energy consumption roeleveld et al 1997 corominas et al 2013 from a holistic perspective wwtps could be considered to be a source of pollution rather than a barrier for emissions this situation is becoming worse along with increasingly stringent discharge standards such as the campaign for upgrading and reconstruction of wwtps in china hao

discharge during construction operation and demolition was obtained from the internal data of the assessed plant see table s1 supplementary information background inventory data was obtained through the chinese life cycle database clcd ike 2010 that contains unit process data that is mainly valid for chinese markets in the assessment calculations methods of carbon emissions from wastewater treatment and sludge treatment disposal landfill and incineration are also based on the literature monteith et al 2005 ipcc 2006 yang 2013 among others input in the demolition phase is mainly for energy consumption 95 kw h m2 approximately 90 of the total energy consumption in the construction phase liu 2010 during the demolition process removed rebar could be recycled and remaining concrete would become waste the average recovery efficiency of removed rebar is 0 38 t t in china gao et al 2016 recycled rebar can offset consumption of building materials in a new construction phase thus the impact of recycled rebar on the environment is included in this assessment the calculation regarding the involved resource energy recovery was based on previous studies hao et al 2015 2018 2019 xu 2015 alyaseri and zhou 2017 amann et al 2018 among others egle et al 2015 and amann et al 2018 indicated that recovered p resource from sewage sludge ash ssa exhibited a higher potential for p recovery 70 90 of p at the wwtp s inlet 80 in this study than direct recovery at the wastewater treatment plant the related data see table s1 about the supplemented facilities for the resource energy recovery in both construction and demolition phases was estimated according to the existing literature jossa and remy 2015 egle et al 2015 alyaseri and zhou 2017 amann et al 2018 mcquay 2018 the base case scenario can meet the needs of the standards for effluent reuse and so no extra facilities will be needed in practice hao et al 2018 indicated that wshp could recover thermal energy 4 c temperature difference for heating with 1 77 kw h m3 net energy production which was adopted in this study incineration can completely destroy organic substances minimizing landfilling and generate electricity with 0 5 kw h m3 hao et al 2019 which was also adopted in this study all detailed data inventory is listed in table s1 2 4 impact assessment the life cycle impact assessment lcia is a crucial part of the lca process at present there is no generally accepted assessment approach due to its complexity and difficulty pennington et al 2004 dreyer et al 2008 generally accepted lcia approaches are environmental design of industrial edip from denmark life cycle assessment an operational guide to the iso standards 2001 cml2001 from the environmental research center of leiden university and the ecological index method eco indicator 99 and environmental priority strategies in product development eps from sweden dreyer et al 2008 luo et al 2013 respectively this study used lca method cml2001 with adaptations to make it suitable for the chinese context 2 4 1 classification based on the available data from the plant important indicators for the environmental impacts that are considered in the study are presented in table s2 at a mid point level goedkoop et al 2009 yang 2013 indicators include global warming potential gwp eutrophication potential ep acidification potential ap abiotic resources depletion potential adp human toxicity potential htp black and odor potential bop landfill space depletion potential lsd and freshwater use fwu respectively among others bop is not a necessary impact category defined in standard lca methods but it could reflect an urgent water pollution problem in china and is therefore included in this assessment 2 4 2 characterization according to the classification of the environmental impacts characterization factors cf can be used to calculate the environmental burden eb gallego schmid and tarpani 2019 eb is a weighted summation of the individual environmental impact factors eq 1 among others the calculation of bop and lsd was based on the previous literature deng and wang 2003 liang 2012 by eq 2 and eq 3 respectively 1 e b i 1 n m i c f i 2 b o p m c o d c f c o d m n h 4 c f n h 4 3 l s d i 1 n m i d i where i is the kinds of chemical substances contained in all the emission substances n is the total

environmental category mcod is the biodegradable cod di is the average waste density 2 4 3 quantification normalization environmental burden neb can be evaluated from eb values compared to local benchmark values and relative values after comparison are usually taken ec jrc 2010 liang 2012 for the chinese situation localizing the benchmark values were conducted before normalization the gwp benchmark value was calculated according to china s average annual co2 emissions per capita the global carbon project peters et al 2015 the adp benchmark value was calculated according to china s consumption data on energy 2012 bp world energy statistics yearbook bp group 2013 the ep bop ap lsd and fwu benchmark values were calculated based on the statistical data national bureau of statistics 2018 ministry of ecology and environment 2018 htp benchmark values were still based on the cml2001 nov 2010 evaluation standard system huppes and van oers 2010 all of these benchmark calculations take their data from the same year 2010 the analytic hierarchy process ahp was applied to calculate weighting values ahp is a practical multi criteria and decision making method the process of ahp is to simplify complicated environmental problems into different combination factors according to the nature of the problem and the objectives to be achieved and then to form a top down dominating relationship liang 2012 yang 2013 the structuring process of the judgment matrix was divided into two steps i scaling importance based on table s3 and testing logical consistency according to the relative importance between the two two comparison of different environmental impacts liang 2012 yang 2013 ii calculating weighting values w according to the importance of the different environmental impacts from table s4 the literature and also local wwtps liang 2012 vera et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 the relative importance of the different environmental impacts can be expressed in a judgment matrix as shown in table s4 to make the judgment matrix logical it is necessary that its consistency is properly checked a calculation indicates that the consistency index cr consistency ratio of the matrix a is equal to 0 08 cr 0 1 demonstrating that the judgment matrix a is logical in its consistency the scaled matrix can be normalized according to its columns eq 4 and the normalized matrix is as follows eq 5 4 a i j a i j k 1 7 a k j i j 1 2 7 5 0 339 0 437 0 311 0 320 0 284 0 252 0 221 0 207 0 113 0 146 0 311 0 107 0 142 0 151 0 110 0 172 0 169 0 073 0 156 0 320 0 284 0 252 0 257 0 069 0

impact assessment wi is weighting values of environmental impacts and nebi is the normalized environmental burden 3 results and discussion 3 1 environmental impact of base case scenario 3 1 1 characteristic results and analysis according to the standard lca methods all the characteristic results for the same environmental impact have to be transformed into their equivalent units based on the statistical analysis the environmental impacts caused by material consumption energy consumption and direct environmental emissions can be calculated according to one unit of fu 1 pe a to meet the need of the discharge standard class i a as shown in table 1 the relative contributions of different phases of the plant s life cycle to the different environmental impacts are shown in fig 2 the environmental impact is largely most around 90 derived from the operational phase of the treatment plant fig 2 these results are consistent with previous studies foley et al 2010 pasqualino et al 2010 the environmental impacts for line 1 and line 2 are roughly similar but adp from line 2 was higher due to the complicated bardenpho process which resulted in higher consumptions of both materials and energy in construction 3 1 2 normalization results and analysis the normalization factors and normalized results for the chinese context are listed in table s5 as shown in table s5 global warming potential gwp and landfill space depletion potential lsd accounted for the highest environmental impacts while eutrophication potential ep and human toxicity potential htp had the lowest environmental impact the normalized environmental impacts indicate that the magnitude of gwp is the same as for bop although the total amount of gwp is larger its contribution to the total environmental impact index is actually comparable to that of bop table s5 the effluent quality has a reverse relationship with the greenhouse impact if the discharge standard continues to be upgraded bop and ep would certainly decline but gwp and other environmental impacts would increase sharply an effect that is consistent with other studies zhu et al 2013 wang et al 2015b 3 1 3 total environmental impact the normalized environmental impacts shown in table s5 can be expressed as row vectors as below 10 a 1 0 01 1 44 10 12 0 01 3 33 10 5 2 22 10 12 4 64 10 3 0 14 1 29 10 4 11 a 2 0 01 1 44 10 12 0 01 3 63 10 5 2 67 10 12 4 65 10 3 0 17 1 34 10 4 by calculating a1 w and a2 w w is the relative weight of the environmental impact which is described in section 2 4 3 the total environmental impact indexes of the two treatment lines are calculated respectively at lcia1 0 0118 and lcia2 0 0132 per fu obviously the plant does not benefit the total environment in which line 2 has a larger impact than line 1 mainly due to the longer wastewater treatment process of line 2 currently the plant consumes electricity generated from coal and so increasing energy consumption would inevitably lead to increasing the environmental impacts including indirect greenhouse gas emissions atmospheric acidification and depletion of non renewable resources caused by electricity generation for the foreseeable future china will be reliant on coal derived electricity without resource energy recovery involved in wwtps it is really difficult to acquire a net zero impact or even to create a benefit on the total environment impact index to make the wwtps approach to the net zero impact and or to benefit of wwtps on the total environment the contribution of potential resource energy recovery need to be included in the assessment 3 2 environmental impact of resource recovery scenario 3 2 1 characteristic results and analysis the calculations for this scenario were identical to those for the base case scenario section 3 1 1 after statistical analysis the characteristic results of the resource recovery scenario are listed in table 2 as shown in table 2 some values in the operation phase appear negative which also results in negative values mostly for the total characteristic results clearly the impacts of the resource energy recovery on the total environment are significant and the resource energy recovery helps to reach a net benefit for the total environment 3 2 2 normalization results and analysis the same normalization method was applied as described in section 3 1 2 the relative weights of the environmental impacts have been given in section 2 4 3 after the statistical analysis the normalized environmental impacts of the resource recovery scenario are listed in table s6 to make a comparison the normalized environmental impacts from the two processes are illustrated in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the impact reduction of lsd on the environment is highly significant caused from the resource recovery scenario in which the normalized environmental values are sharply reduced to 0 01 and 0 01 from 0 143 to 0 171 respectively for line 1 and line 2 obviously the large reduction in lsd is attributed to saving the landfill space by sludge incineration and ash utilization although the characteristic values fig 3 of the resource recovery scenario still emerge as positive on ep the normalized environmental impacts 1 43 10 12 have become a very small share into the total environmental impact a comparison of the percent contributions of the two processes to each impact category is illustrated in fig 4 clearly the base case scenario has only positive values on the environmental impacts fig 4a fig 4c while the resource recovery scenario process creates some negative values benefiting wwtps as shown in fig 4b and d phosphorus recovery avoided mining contributes to the reduction of the environmental impacts on adp by 21 and 26 respectively for line 1 and line 2 by saving phosphate rock mining ash utilization as construction materials bricks and or cement also contributes significantly to the reduction 40 and 38 of the environmental impacts on lsd due to no sludge landfilling needed moreover electricity generated by sludge incineration and thermal energy recovery by wshp is responsible for reducing the environmental impacts on gwp ap adp and htp by 46 77 fig 4b fig 4d even though both ep and bop in the resource recovery scenario process still have positive values on the environmental impacts due to the pollutants from the effluent the resource energy recovery can offset these impacts on the total environmental 3 2 3 total environmental impact based on the new assessment the indexes lcia of the total environmental impact for the resource recovery scenario are calculated at lcia1 3 50 10 3 and lcia2 3 72 10 3 per fu respectively for line 1 and line 2 3 3 comparison of base case scenario and resource recovery scenario compared to the base case scenario the impacts of the resource recovery scenario on the total environment can both be reduced by 128 130 in which the reduction of 100 is used to balance the impact approaching to the net zero impact on the total environment and the remaining 28 30 is the benefit created by the resource recovery scenario on the total environment the resource energy recovery can indeed alter the total environmental impact but greater benefits will be very difficult to attain unless electricity is supplied by such power sources as solar wind gas or nuclear energy as shown in fig 5 thermal energy recovery contributes to the largest share 38 41 in the increased benefit and organic energy recovery from sludge incineration is the second highest contributor to the increased benefit 30 33 in contrast incineration ash reuse for construction materials production only contributes marginally 5 in the increased benefit which is mainly due to the small amount of incineration ash in china organics cod in wwtps influent is less than in other countries so it is far from reaching net zero environmental impact through organic energy recovery of conventional anaerobic digestion or incineration the calculations concerning an actual wwtp in china cod 400 mg l demonstrate that ad associated with combined heat and power chp is only capable of generating 0 20 kw h m3 which could only supply 53 2 of the actual energy consumption of 0 37 kw h m3 hao et al 2018 although there are some wastewater treatment plants that have attained carbon neutral operation they did so with use of co digestion with organic waste wett et al 2007 srwtf 2012 reardon 2014 in this assessment thermal energy recovery can not only offset the energy deficit of direct sludge incineration but also realized energy neutral or even environmental net zero impact of wwtp overall energy recovery thermal energy chemical energy can attain more than half of the increased benefit furthermore water reuse the third largest contributor to the increased benefit at 16 18 provided slightly less than half of the thermal energy benefit it is worth mentioning that phosphorus recovery contributes more than incineration ash reuse which also proves the importance of phosphorus recovery in wastewater treatment in short fig 5 indicates that if no thermal energy recovery is associated with the resource energy recovery it would be difficult for the resource recovery scenario to attain the net zero impact on the total environment in practice thermal energy recovery is rarely applied in wwtps the scientific literature would seem to indicate anaerobic digestion as the preferred option for energy neutrality it is clear that an integral evaluation of options more objectively presents the way forward and calls for more attention for energy recovery and use from effluent heat 4 conclusions a full scale wwtp and a scheme with added energy resource recovery options were quantitatively assessed by an adapted lca model for its impacts on the total environment the main conclusions are resource energy recovery could help wwtps approach a net zero impact and even benefit the total environment the resource recovery based assessment revealed that common water reuse through effluent recycling is insufficient to reach a net zero impact of the wwtps on the total environment energy recovery can contribute significantly to benefiting the total environment 71 in this area thermal energy recovery plays a significant role contributing about 40 in improving the total impact phosphorus recovery makes limited contributions 6 8 although more than incineration ash reuse for construction materials does 5 in improving the environmental impact nevertheless since phosphate is a

18742,quantitative structure biodegradation relationships qsbrs are a tool to predict the biodegradability of chemicals the objective of this work was to generate reliable biodegradation data for mono aromatic chemicals in order to evaluate and verify previously developed qsbrs models a robust biodegradation test method was developed to estimate specific substrate utilization rates which were used as a proxy for biodegradation rates of chemicals in pure culture five representative mono aromatic chemicals were selected that spanned a wide range of biodegradability aerobic biodegradation experiments were performed for each chemical in batch reactors seeded with known degraders chemical removal degrader growth and co2 production were monitored over time experimental data were interpreted using a full carbon mass balance model and monod kinetic parameters y ks qmax and μmax for each chemical were determined in addition stoichiometric equations for aerobic mineralization of the test chemicals were developed the theoretically estimated biomass and co2 yields were similar to those experimentally observed 35 s d 8 of the recovered substrate carbon was converted to biomass and 65 s d 8 was mineralised to co2 significant correlations were observed between the experimentally determined specific substrate utilization rates as represented by qmax and qmax ks at high and low substrate concentrations respectively and the first order biodegradation rate constants predicted by a previous qsbr study similarly the correlation between qmax and selected molecular descriptors characterizing the chemicals structure in a previous qsbr study was also significant these results suggest that qsbr models can be reliable and robust in prioritising chemical half lives for regulatory screening purposes graphical abstract image 1 keywords biodegradation rates qsbr quantitative structure biodegradation relationships carbon mass balance risk assessment 1 introduction

need for experimental tests on animals and their associated costs höfer et al 2004 martin et al 2017a however the acceptance of qsbr model predictions depend on their reliability and relevance nendza

aromatic chemicals were developed in accordance with oecd principles the models related molecular descriptors to the natural logarithm of first order biodegradation rate constants these first order biodegradation rate constants were calculated using semi quantitative biodegradation data encompassed in the biowin3 model us epa 2012 which are based on the ratings given by experts to evaluate the relative biodegradability of chemicals and are unlikely to represent true biodegradation rates the biodegradation data included in biowin models are derived from ready biodegradability tests rbts however rbts exhibit a number of limitations that are particularly pertinent to their use in persistence assessment kowalczyk et al 2015 these limitations include i high levels of variation inter replicate inter test inter facility and temporal ii a large number of test fails iii an arbitrary time restriction the pass criterion is reached in a 10 days window within the 28 days test period the test pass criteria being 70 removal of dissolved organic carbon doc and 60 of theoretical oxygen demand thod or theoretical carbon dioxide thco2 production and iv the lack of a requirement to provide information on rates of biodegradation or parameters related to such rates kowalczyk et al 2015 rbts are pass fail tests that provide no accurate information on rates or half life endpoints used for persistence assessments the qualitative data produced by rbts thus needed regression models to convert them into quantitative half life data the accuracy and reliability of which could be questioned arnot et al 2005 acharya et al 2019 reliable estimation of biodegradation kinetics depends on the test protocol the experimental system used for the biodegradation assay and the kinetic models used to fit the experimental data before attempting to predict biodegradation rates or their associated indices e g half lives rate constants substrate utilization rates from the structure of chemicals for environments with complex biology e g natural and engineered ecosystems it would be informative to explore how well the biodegradability of chemicals can be predicted from their structures in more constrained systems where biological complexity is minimised therefore a good starting point is to work with well defined constrained systems with known degraders at high inoculum load to reduce biological complexity in such a system the probable acclimation effect of a chemical in microbial growth is minimised while variation in observed biodegradation results can be reduced to obtain reproducible rates in contrast biodegradation rates obtained from experiments performed with mixed consortia e g activated sludge inocula might be difficult to interpret due to complexity microbial anonymity and sample variation of inocula used experimental rates e g substrate utilization rates from simplified systems can be fitted to a number of models such as the monod kinetic model which enable estimation of the biodegradation biotransformation rate constants of specific chemicals simkins and alexander 1984 pitter and chudoba 1990 mccarty 2012 the main objective of this study was to generate substrate utilization rates from batch experiments with pure cultures of degraders to validate the principles of a previously developed qsbr models acharya et al 2019 for simple aromatic chemicals to ensure that the measured substrate utilization rates from batch experiments with pure culture are reliable and to explore potential uncertainties in their experimental determination biomass concentrations and co2 were monitored in parallel with the substrate degradation and a carbon mass balance model was developed to rigorously interlink these experimental observations when interpreting the data with respect to monod kinetics while the carbon mass balance does not reduce the uncertainty in the experimental data it can reduce uncertainty in the fitting of multiple parameters from the data because it establishes a quantitative relationship between the observed changes in the three variables substrate biomass and co2 concentration to add further rigour the experimentally determined biomass yields were compared to theoretical predictions based on stoichiometric equations for microbial growth on each single substrate to provide in depth understanding of the biodegradation process and ensure universality finally the validation and verification of a previously developed qsbr model acharya et al 2019 was performed by conducting a correlation analysis between the biodegradation rates predicted by qsbr model and the experimentally determined specific substrate utilization rates 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and bacterial strains five test chemicals were selected from a previous chemical dataset acharya et al 2019 by considering three criteria 1 the representation of a wide range of biodegradation rate constants i e 1st order rate 2 the availability of detailed aerobic biodegradation pathways and 3 use of a minimal number of microorganisms in biodegradation assays so that the confounding factors due to different physiologies would be reduced based on the aforementioned criteria phenol 2 4 dichlorophenol 4 chlorophenol m cresol and toluene were selected chemicals with known aerobic biodegradation pathways having the highest phenol

occur with one unique pathway e g 2 4 dichlorophenol and or multiple pathways e g 4 chlorophenol phenol toluene and m cresol depending upon the type of degrader and environmental conditions i e

final volume 580 ml please refer section 8 in supporting information for more details the biodegradation studies for each of the chemicals were carried out one at a time in the above batch reactors

toluene in the reactor was also quantified over the duration of the experiment by gc fid section 3 in si the remaining cell solution was resuspended 0 5 ml of which was analysed using a flow cytometer becton dickinson california to quantify cell growth in the reactors section 4 in si the headspace co2 development during the experiment was quantified by gc ms section 5 in si 2 3 carbon mass balance a mass balance for carbon was carried out for each batch reactor of pure degrader culture the initial and final total carbon content were determined the total carbon in the reactor consisted of carbon present in the biomass the headspace and the dissolved substrate and headspace and dissolved co2 including carbonate and bicarbonate the carbon content of the biomass was estimated using the carbon content per bacterial cell i e 9 4 10 14 g c cell mentioned elsewhere vrede et al 2002 according to equation 6 18 section 6 in si the total co2 carbon content in the batch was estimated using equation 6 7 section 6 in si which is based on carbon dioxide and carbonic acid base equilibria stumm and morgan 1970 a theoretical carbon mass balance for each chemical mineralization was also performed to achieve this stoichiometric equations for microbial growth from chemical biodegradation were developed with the assumption that nh4 was the sole nitrogen source using the method suggested by mccarty 2012 briefly bacterial growth involves two basic reactions one for energy production and one for cellular synthesis the electron donor provides electrons to the electron acceptor for energy production a portion of its electrons f e is transferred to the electron acceptor to provide energy for the conversion of another portion of electrons f s into microbial cells on a net yield basis an assumption was made that 40 of the electron equivalent in electron donor substrate is used for synthesis f s 0 4 mccarty 2012 while 60 is used for energy f e 0 6 then the overall energy and synthesis reactions were developed using the half reaction approach as described in section 9 in si 2 4 modelling biodegradation and estimation of kinetic parameters for pure culture experiments for simplicity most qsrb models are based on the concept of first order biodegradation kinetics which relate the substrate or chemical half life t1 2 h or similar empirical observations to a first order biodegradation rate constant kdeg h 1 1 k d e g ln 2 t 1 2 this approach ignores the dependency of the biodegradation process on the concentration of substrate utilizing biomass in the system the change in the substrate concentration s moles c substrate m 3 is simply described by 2 d d t s k d e g s however as a minimum a realistic model of microbial processes should relate changes in the active biomass b mole c biomass m 3 in the system to the utilization of the primary substrate s that limits the growth of the biomass the relationship most frequently used is the model of jacques monod pitter and chudoba 1990 mccarty 2012 which relates the specific growth rate of bacteria μ h 1 and specific substrate utilization removal rate q mole c substrate mole c biomass 1 h 1 as follows 3 μ μ max s k s s 4 q μ

this study the batch study data i e substrate removal biomass growth and headspace co2 development with time was used to estimate kinetic growth parameters μmax y and ks for each chemical degraded these parameters were estimated by fitting the experimental data with a carbon mass balance model simulating the pollutant biodegradation according to monod kinetics simkins and alexander 1984 the model evaluates the agreement between predictions and data for a given y determined from the end point biomass and co2 data and a range of μmax and ks parameter value combinations considering substrate biomass and co2 data and identifies as the best fit model parameters those that give the minimum sum of squared residuals for the combined data the model also includes a biodegradation lag phase tlag h as an option the parameter qmax was calculated according from equation 5 the model was implemented in matlab and the underpinning equations and parameters are provided in the si section 6 and 7 2 5 statistical analysis all statistical analysis were performed using excel the coefficient of determination r2 and its significance was obtained from a simple linear regression model to determine the relationship between qmax and qmax ks and first order biodegradation rate constants kdeg predicted by a previously proposed qsbr model acharya et al 2019 a univariate regression analysis between qmax and molecular descriptors characterizing the chemicals in a previous qsbr study acharya et al 2019 was also performed 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch biodegradation of chemicals the concentration profiles of biomass chemicals and co2 during aerobic biodegradation of five different chemicals at a fixed initial concentration i e 50 mg l are shown in fig 2 and si section 13 fig s3 biodegradation of phenol toluene and m cresol proceeded without any lag phase while lag phases were observed for 4 chlorophenol and 2 4 dichlorophenol biodegradation the biodegradation of test chemicals predominantly occurred during the exponential phase of microbial growth as is commonly observed reardon et al 2000 this can be explained by the abundance of space nutrients and desired conditions for growth pitter and chudoba 1990 rolfe et al 2012 immediately following the lag phase allowing microorganisms to grow at their maximum rate all chemicals were mineralised as illustrated by a continual decrease in the chemical concentration and increase in the headspace co2 and biomass concentration furthermore biomass growth in all the reactors was mirrored by chemical i e carbon substrate consumption substrate utilization the time required for complete biodegradation of each chemical differed fig 2 and section 13 in si fig s3 in all reactors there was no significant difference between the initial and final ph values two sample t test p value 0 05 since a ph buffer had been added to the growth medium in the control experiments results not shown conducted in the absence of the inoculum no change in the concentration of chemicals was observed indicating abiotic removal processes were insignificant 3 2 monod kinetics parameters the different components and parameters associated with test chemical biodegradation in the batch reactors are presented in fig s2 in si along with the monod kinetic model predictions which show how the best fit kinetic parameters for each chemical degradation were estimated all the components are expressed in moles carbon per m3 to enable a carbon mass balance examination of fig s2 section 10 in si suggests that the monod model provided a reasonable fit to the acquired experimental data especially for substrate removal however the fit for co2 was not so good this could be attributed to a co2 yield that varies as a function of time at different stages of the bacterial growth the experimental data sometimes appears to show two phases of biodegradation demonstrating more complexity in the biodegradation process than considered by monod this might be due the partial degradation of substrate initially to a metabolite so there is a delay between the substrate degradation and the fully equivalent biomass and co2 production on the other hand the assumed partitioning equilibrium between co2 in headspace and aqueous medium may not always be instantaneous as assumed by the model to obtain a model fit good knowledge of initial values for monod parameters was required as convergence can often not be readily achieved in the data fitting zhang and hughes 2004 it should be noted that the range of fitting parameters i e μ max and ks used in the model was based on the initial fitting parameters calculated with experimental biodegradation results using a method mentioned elsewhere simulator 2018 however when fitting the monod model directly to experimental data ks values varied with μ max indicating optimization of the two parameters was not completely independent rather they draw each other during the fitting kovárová kovar and egli 1998 in fact a fixed ratio of μ max to ks tends to give very similar agreements between measured and modelled data table 2 presents the various kinetic and biological parameters obtained from the modelling of the biodegradation of each of the test chemicals in closed reactors the value of the maximum specific growth rate i e μmax which describes the biomass growth under ideal conditions was slightly higher for pseudomonas putida f1 when toluene 0 888 h 1 was used as a substrate followed by m cresol 0 755 h 1 and phenol 0 666 h 1 whereas the μmax value for cupriavidus baselensis was higher when 4 chlorophenol 0 266 h 1 was used as substrate compared to 2 4 dichlorophenol 0 036 h 1 the two organisms used in the biodegradation assays are different and may have different transport and metabolic efficiencies however studies have shown that when glucose was used as a sole carbon source in mineral medium pseudomonas putida f1 and ralstonia eutropha 95 7 homology i e sequence similarity with cupriavidus baseliensis formerly ralstonia sp strain rk1 steinle et al 1998 vandamme and coenye 2004 have maximum specific growth rates i e μmax of 0 20 h 1 oliveira et al 2009 and 0 23 h 1 marangoni et al 2001 respectively indicating a similar metabolic efficiency for at least glucose degradation the kinetics of microbial growth under limiting substrate conditions the scenario commonly prevalent in the environment is assessed by the ratio of μmax and ks i e μmax ks also termed specific affinity kovárová kovar and egli 1998 this ratio reflects the competitiveness of a microbial population to grow on a low concentration of limiting resource the higher the value of μmax ks the better the microbial population grows on a limiting resource resulting in rapid substrate depletion healey 1980 the specific affinity μmax ks obtained for test chemicals table 2 showed that at low substrate concentration microbial growth on toluene was the fastest followed by phenol m cresol and 4 chlorophenol and finally 2 4 dichlorophenol for toluene it was noted that the fitted value of μmax ks was strongly dependant on the measurements at time 5 5 h as elimination of this single time point from the set altered the fitted ks and μmax ks by a factor of 2 table 2 the measured concentrations at time 5 5 h look somewhat suspicious as there appeared to be no further reduction in the substrate concentration until time 13 75 h but a small amount of co2 production and significant biomass growth during that same time interval fig 2 hence while the toluene μmax parameter value appears to be robust there is considerable uncertainty about the correct toluene parameter values for ks and μmax ks with implications for the toluene substrate utilization rate at low substrate concentration as will be discussed further below the yield coefficient for the biodegradation of each chemical was measured using the experimental results which is the mass of biomass formed per unit mass of chemical consumed at the end of the experiment table 2 yield coefficient data revealed that pseudomonas putida f1 can produce higher amounts of biomass carbon per unit mass of toluene carbon than per unit masses of phenol and m cresol carbon this is in agreement with the pattern observed in the case of aerobic biodegradation of toluene and phenol by pseudomonas putida f1 where the higher yield coefficient was achieved for toluene at 30 c reardon et al 2000 4 chlorophenol and 2 4 dcp biodegradation data revealed that for cupriavidus baseliensis the efficiency was better for 2 4 dichlorophenol than for 4 chlorophenol the kinetics of substrate utilization under ideal conditions are described by qmax the pattern of qmax for the studied chemicals was m cresol phenol toluene 4 chlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol however qmax for toluene m cresol and phenol were similar to each other and higher than for 4 chlorophenol and 2 4 dichlorophenol the value of qmax ks relates to the substrate utilization at low substrate concentration the pattern of qmax ks for the studied chemicals was toluene phenol m cresol 4 chlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol however there is uncertainty around the parameter value for the ratio qmax ks of toluene due to the same issues as were discussed above for the ratio μmax ks 3 3 carbon mass balance and stoichiometry to assess compatibility of data sets in the biodegradation experiments complete degradation of test chemicals was observed although the time required for complete degradation differed for each test chemical fig 3 presents the carbon mass balance of the test chemical biodegradation in the reactors the mass balance showed an average recovery of 80 7 of the initially applied carbon ranging from 77 9 to 81 5 recovery depending on the test chemical variation between replicates for carbon mass balance recovery was typically low the ability to account for 80 of the introduced carbon in reactors provided an opportunity to determine the fate and partitioning of the test chemicals during the biodegradation process either to inorganic carbon co2 or its incorporation within the biomass the production of metabolities is a significant phenomenon in the biodegradation of chemicals martin et al 2017b and can potentially account for the remaining fraction of missing carbon in the mass balance despite this the phenomenon is probably insignificant in this study oxygen availability was not limiting so that complete mineralization of each chemical in the biodegradation tests was possible section 12 in si table s5 in addition thermodynamic analysis suggested that the complete biodegradation of each chemical was feasible section 9 in si furthermore the absence of leaks from the reactor glass bottle section 8 in si fig s1 ensured that observations were not confounded by potential losses through volatility or leakage however uncertainty in the henry constant and the cell carbon content value used in the model could have a significant effect on the calculation of the final carbon content of the reactor in our study a cell carbon content value of 9 4 10 14 g c cell vrede et al 2002 was used and biomass carbon on average accounted for 43 of the carbon in the final amount of total carbon in general the elemental composition and cell volume of bacteria varies among species and is also influenced by environmental conditions trousselier et al 1997 vrede et al 2002 elazhari ali et al 2013 previous studies have shown that the elemental content of bacterial cells varies across the different phases of growth the highest carbon content was observed in exponentially growing cells whereas the lowest was observed when the substrate starts to get limited vrede et al 2002 carbon content per cell was therefore also estimated in this study after complete degradation of the chemicals by assuming that all the substrate was converted into biomass and co2 that the phase partitioning and co2 speciation in the aqueous medium was accurately described and that co2 was measured accurately refer section 14 in si for calculation we observed different carbon contents per cell in pseudomonas putida f1 for the degradation of different test chemicals the highest values were observed during m cresol 1 84 10 13 g c cell degradation compared to phenol 1 75 10 13 g c cell and toluene 1 46 10 13 g c cell degradation similarly the carbon content per cell for cupriavidus baselensis during 2 4 dichlorophenol and 4 chlorophenol degradation were 9 11 10 14 and 1 31 10 13 g c cell respectively therefore mass balance data would potentially be more rigorous if carbon content of different strains can be determined experimentally for each chemical biodegradation test however quantifying the cell carbon content of individual bactaria was outside the scope of this study on average 65 of test chemical was mineralised to co2 ranging from 53 9 to 74 8 depending on the test chemical table 3 whereas 35 of test chemical carbon was incorporated into biomass ranging 25 1 46 table 3 the amount of substrate carbon going to biomass reported in the literature varies considerably ranging from 25 to 45 zhang and hughes 2004 elazhari ali et al 2013 it should be noted that a major proportion of nutrients taken up by bacteria are normally used for energy generation simply to maintain cellular function e g maintain membrane potential maintain an osmotic pressure across bacterial membrane synthesizing building blocks take up or excrete some compounds against the concentation gradients hu 2017 in this study a stoichiometric equation was developed section 9 in si for the biodegradation of a series of test chemicals and the theoretical yield biomass and co2 was compared with experimentally observed results table 3 shows the theoretically estimated and experimentally observed co2 and biomass amount for each test chemical the average theoretical amount of biomass formation and co2 production were 0 46 mol of biomass c mole of substrate carbon and 0 54 mol of co2 c mole of substrate carbon respectively ranging from 0 4 to 0 514 mol of biomass c mole of substrate carbon and 0 486 0 6 mol of co2 c mole of substrate carbon depending on the test chemical the average experimental amount for biomass and co2 formation were 0 3015 mol biomass c mole of substrate carbon range 0 218 0 411 mol of biomass c mole of substrate carbon and 0 557 mol of co2 c mole of substrate carbon 0 481 0 649 mol of co2 c mole of substrate carbon respectively depending on the test chemical thus the experimentally observed biomass formation was typically lower than the theoretically estimated biomass formation except for 2 4 dcp biodegradation although the range of values measured encompasses the range of theoretical predictions it has to be noted that the theoretically estimated yield i e true yield is based on the material balance equation between cells substrate and the products and excludes biomass loss due to cell decay or endogenous respiration and also the energy consumed by cells for the maintenance and is therefore always higher than net yield i e experimentally observed yield 3 4 verification and calibration of a qsbr model in the environment the rate of chemical biodegradation is uncertain and difficult to reproduce as it is influenced by spatial and temporal variability of a combination of different factors i e abundance and activity of degrading microorganism environmental conditions structure and concentration of chemicals pavan and worth 2008 in contrast the different parameters influencing biodegradation can be more controlled in laboratory biodegradation tests particularly the biodegradation rates obtained from simplified biodegradation system i e batch biodegradation assays where the chemical acts as the only source of carbon and energy are easily interpretable and comparatively reproducible as compared to biodegradation rates obtained from mixed culture assays batch biodegradation studies might therefore be suitable towards calibrating theoretical qsbr models however it must be noted that several factors can effect degradation of chemicals in pure culture studies which could ultimately have influence on the estimated biodegradation rate and thus on calibration of qsbr models for example culturing degraders in nutrient broth media prior to inoculating them into the mineral medium with a specific chemical might contribute in the possible momentary loss in the biodegradation capacity of the degrader therefore a lag phase can be observed during the biodegradation assays whereby bacteria take time to adapt to the new environment which can include the induction of enzymes needed for catalyzing degradation reactions direct comparison of the first order rate constants i e kdeg used in the previous qsbr study acharya et al 2019 and experimentally determined substrate utilization rates i e q from this study for selected test chemicals may be misleading as there is no direct equivalence between the monod kinetic model parameters which link the substrate utilization to the growth of biomass and first order biodegradation rate constants which ignore the dependency of the rate on the growth of biomass during the biodegradation assay the previous rate constants were derived from the biowin3 model pass fail model for biodegradibility and transformed into rate constants that do not reflect those measured experimentally in this study on the other hand the majority of existing qsbrs including that in our previous study are developed with rate constants from different biodegradation databases which are often based on another form of qsbr the chemical biodegradation rate constants used in the development of such databases are derived from first tier biodegradation screening tests typically oecd 301 or 302 tests and rarely represent the true rates the reliability of the predicted chemical degradation rate constant in different environmental compartments with existing qsbr models is a major concern peijnenburg and damborský 2012 this demands a method approach that can be used to validate and or calibrate the existing models so that it is possible to apply the existing qsbr models to predict the chemical degradation rate constant in any environmental compartment biomass growth is fueled by substrate utilization and therefore the rate of substrate utilization or removal i e q in eq 4 is regarded as the basic rate in the biodegradation process mccarty 2012 hence correlation analysis between the first order biodegradation rate constant of the qsbr models and the experimentally determined substrate utilization rates in this study are of interest from eq 4 it can be seen that at high substrate concentration the utilization of different substrates can be compared based on the maximum substrate utilization rates qmax at low substrate concentration the utilization of different substrates can be compared based on the ratios qmax ks a strong and significant correlation p 0 05 r2 0 85 along with similar patterns were observed between the qmax and those first order biodegradation rate constants kdeg from previously developed qsbr models for five of the test chemicals fig 4 a similarly the correlation between qmax ks and the first order biodegradation rate constants kdeg for 4 chemicals were also significant p value 0 05 r2 0 97 fig 4b due to the uncertainty in the qmax ks parameter value of toluene which were discussed above toluene was not included in this regression analysis if toluene is included with a qmax ks ratio of 0 703 table 2 the correlation coefficient r2 would be 0 245 p value 0 05 and the toluene data point would be a clear outlier in the data set see fig s6 if toluene is included with a qmax ks ratio of 0 349 table 2 the r2 would be 0 71 p value 0 05 even though the biodegradation modelling concepts differ significantly between first order rate kinetics and monod kinetics any of the rates determining parameters compared in fig 4 reflects the relative biodegradability of the different compounds and this can explain the observed correlations however further validation and calibration of the principles behind in silico qsbrs with biodegradation rates obtained from a mixed microbial community for example activated sludge a similar type of inoculum as used in rbts are needed in addition it would be useful to extend such validations for biodegradation rates from a broad range of aromatic chemicals with different types of substituent groups including non halogenated moities another fundamental way in which the principles of previously derived qsbr models acharya et al 2019 could be verified is through correlation analysis between the molecular descriptors from those qsbr models and the experimentally determined parameters in this study table 4 we therefore also tested the statistical association between qmax of the five chemicals obtained from pure culture degrader experiments and each of the molecular descriptors by conducting univariate regression analysis table 4 and table s4 in si for details in short reported correlation coefficients revealed a significant correlation between qmax and most of the descriptors listed in the previous study for monoaromatic chemicals some at p value 0 05 and most at p value 0 1 because of the small number of samples it was not feasible to perform multivariate regression using combinations of two or three descriptors it is interesting to note that molecular descriptors given in table 4 represent a variety of physicochemical structural and quantum mechanical properties of chemicals that have previously shown an association with biodegradation rates okey and stensel 1993 1996 yang et al 2006 more specifically enzyme binding chemical transformation kinetics and thermodynamic factors are pivotal during the biodegradation of chemicals as discussed elsewhere parsons and govers 1990 pitter and chudoba 1990 wammer and peters 2005 arnosti 2011 acharya et al 2019 briefly the observed statistically significant correlation p value 0 1 between the qmax and hammett substituent constant suggests that the rate limiting steps in the chemical transformation reaction of an aromatic chemical is an electrophilic substitution in such cases the chemical reaction is slowed down when the electron density of the reaction centre is reduced by the substituents possessing positive values e g halogen and nitro substituents on the substituent constant pitter and chudoba 1990 conversely the reaction rate is accelerated by electron donating or activating groups such as hydroxyl or methyl groups pitter and chudoba 1990 the results in this study are in agreement with the results demonstrated by alexander and lustigman 1966 martin et al 2017a b and pitter and chudoba 1990 alexander and lustigman 1966 showed slower rates of biodegradation of mono and di substituted benzene by soil microorganisms with chloro nitro and sulfonate substituents whereas an increased rate was recorded in the presence of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups similarly martin et al 2017a showed that phenol substituent groups at position 3 meta position have significant effects on the biodegradation potential of chemicals where the sequential order of biodegradation by substituent groups was carboxylic acid cooh hydroxyl oh methyl ch3 methoxy ch3o chloro cl nitro no2 bromo br fluoro f likewise a similar trend was observed in a study performed by pitter and chaudoba pitter and chudoba 1990 furthermore the statistically significant p value 0 1 correlation between qmax with steric vdw v mr and mw and topological vx1 and vx2 descriptors indicates the importance of chemical fit in to the enzyme active site during biotransformation of chemicals in most chemical reactions an energy barrier exists that must be surmounted for the reaction to occur wammer and peters 2005 descriptors like total energy electrical energy and ehomo are quantum chemical descriptors that generally provide information on energy associated with a chemical entity parsons and govers 1990 the significant correlation p value 0 1 between qmax with quantum chemical descriptors suggests that the kinetics of biotransformation of aromatic chemicals is slower when the value of these quantum chemical descriptors is higher for example the higher the ehomo energy of highest occupied molecular orbital for a particular chemical the higher the amount of energy needed during the chemical reaction to remove an electron from the molecule which ultimately slows down the chemical reaction similarly if the electrical energy and total energy of the molecule is high there is strong attraction between electrons and the atomic nuclei this implies that high energy is required to degrade such a molecule which as a consequence is more resistant to degradation than a molecule with lower electrical and total energy furthermore the qmax values were not correlated with the lipophilic parameter i e logp of the test chemicals suggesting that at high substrate concentration lipophilicity might not be the rate limiting factor thus all together these results suggest that the rate of biodegradation of mono aromatic chemicals seems to be governed by the electronic effects of substituents kinetic and thermodynamic factors associated with chemical biotransformation and the shape and size of the chemicals 4 conclusions the biodegradation experiments including a rigorous carbon mass balance and theoretical yield predictions enabled the generation of well substantiated substrate utilization rates and related parameters qmax and qmax ks experimentally determined qmax and qmax ks can be used to validate and calibrate the principles behind in silico qsbrs the substrate utilization rates derived from pure culture experiments demonstrate that the same rank prioritisation existed with biodegradation rates derived from ready biodegradability tests even if the rate metrics and values were different the simple but rigorous experimental and theoretical approach used in this study could form the basis towards calibrating the qsbr models with real biological data acknowledgement this work was funded by engineering and physical sciences

18742,quantitative structure biodegradation relationships qsbrs are a tool to predict the biodegradability of chemicals the objective of this work was to generate reliable biodegradation data for mono aromatic chemicals in order to evaluate and verify previously developed qsbrs models a robust biodegradation test method was developed to estimate specific substrate utilization rates which were used as a proxy for biodegradation rates of chemicals in pure culture five representative mono aromatic chemicals were selected that spanned a wide range of biodegradability aerobic biodegradation experiments were performed for each chemical in batch reactors seeded with known degraders chemical removal degrader growth and co2 production were monitored over time experimental data were interpreted using a full carbon mass balance model and monod kinetic parameters y ks qmax and μmax for each chemical were determined in addition stoichiometric equations for aerobic mineralization of the test chemicals were developed the theoretically estimated biomass and co2 yields were similar to those experimentally observed 35 s d 8 of the recovered substrate carbon was converted to biomass and 65 s d 8 was mineralised to co2 significant correlations were observed between the experimentally determined specific substrate utilization rates as represented by qmax and qmax ks at high and low substrate concentrations respectively and the first order biodegradation rate constants predicted by a previous qsbr study similarly the correlation between qmax and selected molecular descriptors characterizing the chemicals structure in a previous qsbr study was also significant these results suggest that qsbr models can be reliable and robust in prioritising chemical half lives for regulatory screening purposes graphical abstract image 1 keywords biodegradation rates qsbr quantitative structure biodegradation relationships carbon mass balance risk assessment 1 introduction

aromatic chemicals were developed in accordance with oecd principles the models related molecular descriptors to the natural logarithm of first order biodegradation rate constants these first order biodegradation rate constants were calculated using semi quantitative biodegradation data encompassed in the biowin3 model us epa 2012 which are based on the ratings given by experts to evaluate the relative biodegradability of chemicals and are unlikely to represent true biodegradation rates the biodegradation data included in biowin models are derived from ready biodegradability tests rbts however rbts exhibit a number of limitations that are particularly pertinent to their use in persistence assessment kowalczyk et al 2015 these limitations include i high levels of variation inter replicate inter test inter facility and temporal ii a large number of test fails iii an arbitrary time restriction the pass criterion is reached in a 10 days window within the 28 days test period the test pass criteria being 70 removal of dissolved organic carbon doc and 60 of theoretical oxygen demand thod or theoretical carbon dioxide thco2 production and iv the lack of a requirement to provide information on rates of biodegradation or parameters related to such rates kowalczyk et al 2015 rbts are pass fail tests that provide no accurate information on rates or half life endpoints used for persistence assessments the qualitative data produced by rbts thus needed regression models to convert them into quantitative half life data the accuracy and reliability of which could be questioned arnot et al 2005 acharya et al 2019 reliable estimation of biodegradation kinetics depends on the test protocol the experimental system used for the biodegradation assay and the kinetic models used to fit the experimental data before attempting to predict biodegradation rates or their associated indices e g half lives rate constants substrate utilization rates from the structure of chemicals for environments with complex biology e g natural and engineered ecosystems it would be informative to explore how well the biodegradability of chemicals can be predicted from their structures in more constrained systems where biological complexity is minimised therefore a good starting point is to work with well defined constrained systems with known degraders at high inoculum load to reduce biological complexity in such a system the probable acclimation effect of a chemical in microbial growth is minimised while variation in observed biodegradation results can be reduced to obtain reproducible rates in contrast biodegradation rates obtained from experiments performed with mixed consortia e g activated sludge inocula might be difficult to interpret due to complexity microbial anonymity and sample variation of inocula used experimental rates e g substrate utilization rates from simplified systems can be fitted to a number of models such as the monod kinetic model which enable estimation of the biodegradation biotransformation rate constants of specific chemicals simkins and alexander 1984 pitter and chudoba 1990 mccarty 2012 the main objective of this study was to generate substrate utilization rates from batch experiments with pure cultures of degraders to validate the principles of a previously developed qsbr models acharya et al 2019 for simple aromatic chemicals to ensure that the measured substrate utilization rates from batch experiments with pure culture are reliable and to explore potential uncertainties in their experimental determination biomass concentrations and co2 were monitored in parallel with the substrate degradation and a carbon mass balance model was developed to rigorously interlink these experimental observations when interpreting the data with respect to monod kinetics while the carbon mass balance does not reduce the uncertainty in the experimental data it can reduce uncertainty in the fitting of multiple parameters from the data because it establishes a quantitative relationship between the observed changes in the three variables substrate biomass and co2 concentration to add further rigour the experimentally determined biomass yields were compared to theoretical predictions based on stoichiometric equations for microbial growth on each single substrate to provide in depth understanding of the biodegradation process and ensure universality finally the validation and verification of a previously developed qsbr model acharya et al 2019 was performed by conducting a correlation analysis between the biodegradation rates predicted by qsbr model and the experimentally determined specific substrate utilization rates 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and bacterial strains five test chemicals were selected from a previous chemical dataset acharya et al 2019 by considering three criteria 1 the representation of a wide range of biodegradation rate constants i e 1st order rate 2 the availability of detailed aerobic biodegradation pathways and 3 use of a minimal number of microorganisms in biodegradation assays so that the confounding factors due to different physiologies would be reduced based on the aforementioned criteria phenol 2 4 dichlorophenol 4 chlorophenol m cresol and toluene were selected chemicals with known aerobic biodegradation pathways having the highest phenol

achieve this stoichiometric equations for microbial growth from chemical biodegradation were developed with the assumption that nh4 was the sole nitrogen source using the method suggested by mccarty 2012 briefly bacterial growth involves two basic reactions one for energy production and one for cellular synthesis the electron donor provides electrons to the electron acceptor for energy production a portion of its electrons f e is transferred to the electron acceptor to provide energy for the conversion of another portion of electrons f s into microbial cells on a net yield basis an assumption was made that 40 of the electron equivalent in electron donor substrate is used for synthesis f s 0 4 mccarty 2012 while 60 is used for energy f e 0 6 then the overall energy and synthesis reactions were developed using the half reaction approach as described in section 9 in si 2 4 modelling biodegradation and estimation of kinetic parameters for pure culture experiments for simplicity most qsrb models are based on the concept of first order biodegradation kinetics which relate the substrate or chemical half life t1 2 h or similar empirical observations to a first order biodegradation rate constant kdeg h 1 1 k d e g ln 2 t 1 2 this approach ignores the dependency of the biodegradation process on the concentration of substrate utilizing biomass in the system the change in the substrate concentration s moles c substrate m 3 is simply described by 2 d d t s k d e g s however as a minimum a realistic model of microbial processes should relate changes in the active biomass b mole c biomass m 3 in the system to the utilization of the primary substrate s that limits the growth of the biomass the relationship most frequently used is the model of jacques monod pitter and chudoba 1990 mccarty 2012 which relates the specific growth rate of bacteria μ h 1 and specific substrate utilization removal rate q mole c substrate mole c biomass 1 h 1 as follows 3 μ μ max s k s s 4 q μ

this study the batch study data i e substrate removal biomass growth and headspace co2 development with time was used to estimate kinetic growth parameters μmax y and ks for each chemical degraded these parameters were estimated by fitting the experimental data with a carbon mass balance model simulating the pollutant biodegradation according to monod kinetics simkins and alexander 1984 the model evaluates the agreement between predictions and data for a given y determined from the end point biomass and co2 data and a range of μmax and ks parameter value combinations considering substrate biomass and co2 data and identifies as the best fit model parameters those that give the minimum sum of squared residuals for the combined data the model also includes a biodegradation lag phase tlag h as an option the parameter qmax was calculated according from equation 5 the model was implemented in matlab and the underpinning equations and parameters are provided in the si section 6 and 7 2 5 statistical analysis all statistical analysis were performed using excel the coefficient of determination r2 and its significance was obtained from a simple linear regression model to determine the relationship between qmax and qmax ks and first order biodegradation rate constants kdeg predicted by a previously proposed qsbr model acharya et al 2019 a univariate regression analysis between qmax and molecular descriptors characterizing the chemicals in a previous qsbr study acharya et al 2019 was also performed 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch biodegradation of chemicals the concentration profiles of biomass chemicals and co2 during aerobic biodegradation of five different chemicals at a fixed initial concentration i e 50 mg l are shown in fig 2 and si section 13 fig s3 biodegradation of phenol toluene and m cresol proceeded without any lag phase while lag phases were observed for 4 chlorophenol and 2 4 dichlorophenol biodegradation the biodegradation of test chemicals predominantly occurred during the exponential phase of microbial growth as is commonly observed reardon et al 2000 this can be explained by the abundance of space nutrients and desired conditions for growth pitter and chudoba 1990 rolfe et al 2012 immediately following the lag phase allowing microorganisms to grow at their maximum rate all chemicals were mineralised as illustrated by a continual decrease in the chemical concentration and increase in the headspace co2 and biomass concentration furthermore biomass growth in all the reactors was mirrored by chemical i e carbon substrate consumption substrate utilization the time required for complete biodegradation of each chemical differed fig 2 and section 13 in si fig s3 in all reactors there was no significant difference between the initial and final ph values two sample t test p value 0 05 since a ph buffer had been added to the growth medium in the control experiments results not shown conducted in the absence of the inoculum no change in the concentration of chemicals was observed indicating abiotic removal processes were insignificant 3 2 monod kinetics parameters the different components and parameters associated with test chemical biodegradation in the batch reactors are presented in fig s2 in si along with the monod kinetic model predictions which show how the best fit kinetic parameters for each chemical degradation were estimated all the components are expressed in moles carbon per m3 to enable a carbon mass balance examination of fig s2 section 10 in si suggests that the monod model provided a reasonable fit to the acquired experimental data especially for substrate removal however the fit for co2 was not so good this could be attributed to a co2 yield that varies as a function of time at different stages of the bacterial growth the experimental data sometimes appears to show two phases of biodegradation demonstrating more complexity in the biodegradation process than considered by monod this might be due the partial degradation of substrate initially to a metabolite so there is a delay between the substrate degradation and the fully equivalent biomass and co2 production on the other hand the assumed partitioning equilibrium between co2 in headspace and aqueous medium may not always be instantaneous as assumed by the model to obtain a model fit good knowledge of initial values for monod parameters was required as convergence can often not be readily achieved in the data fitting zhang and hughes 2004 it should be noted that the range of fitting parameters i e μ max and ks used in the model was based on the initial fitting parameters calculated with experimental biodegradation results using a method mentioned elsewhere simulator 2018 however when fitting the monod model directly to experimental data ks values varied with μ max indicating optimization of the two parameters was not completely independent rather they draw each other during the fitting kovárová kovar and egli 1998 in fact a fixed ratio of μ max to ks tends to give very similar agreements between measured and modelled data table 2 presents the various kinetic and biological parameters obtained from the modelling of the biodegradation of each of the test chemicals in closed reactors the value of the maximum specific growth rate i e μmax which describes the biomass growth under ideal conditions was slightly higher for pseudomonas putida f1 when toluene 0 888 h 1 was used as a substrate followed by m cresol 0 755 h 1 and phenol 0 666 h 1 whereas the μmax value for cupriavidus baselensis was higher when 4 chlorophenol 0 266 h 1 was used as substrate compared to 2 4 dichlorophenol 0 036 h 1 the two organisms used in the biodegradation assays are different and may have different transport and metabolic efficiencies however studies have shown that when glucose was used as a sole carbon source in mineral medium pseudomonas putida f1 and ralstonia eutropha 95 7 homology i e sequence similarity with cupriavidus baseliensis formerly ralstonia sp strain rk1 steinle et al 1998 vandamme and coenye 2004 have maximum specific growth rates i e μmax of 0 20 h 1 oliveira et al 2009 and 0 23 h 1 marangoni et al 2001 respectively indicating a similar metabolic efficiency for at least glucose degradation the kinetics of microbial growth under limiting substrate conditions the scenario commonly prevalent in the environment is assessed by the ratio of μmax and ks i e μmax ks also termed specific affinity kovárová kovar and egli 1998 this ratio reflects the competitiveness of a microbial population to grow on a low concentration of limiting resource the higher the value of μmax ks the better the microbial population grows on a limiting resource resulting in rapid substrate depletion healey 1980 the specific affinity μmax ks obtained for test chemicals table 2 showed that at low substrate concentration microbial growth on toluene was the fastest followed by phenol m cresol and 4 chlorophenol and finally 2 4 dichlorophenol for toluene it was noted that the fitted value of μmax ks was strongly dependant on the measurements at time 5 5 h as elimination of this single time point from the set altered the fitted ks and μmax ks by a factor of 2 table 2 the measured concentrations at time 5 5 h look somewhat suspicious as there appeared to be no further reduction in the substrate concentration until time 13 75 h but a small amount of co2 production and significant biomass growth during that same time interval fig 2 hence while the toluene μmax parameter value appears to be robust there is considerable uncertainty about the correct toluene parameter values for ks and μmax ks with implications for the toluene substrate utilization rate at low substrate concentration as will be discussed further below the yield coefficient for the biodegradation of each chemical was measured using the experimental results which is the mass of biomass formed per unit mass of chemical consumed at the end of the experiment table 2 yield coefficient data revealed that pseudomonas putida f1 can produce higher amounts of biomass carbon per unit mass of toluene carbon than per unit masses of phenol and m cresol carbon this is in agreement with the pattern observed in the case of aerobic biodegradation of toluene and phenol by pseudomonas putida f1 where the higher yield coefficient was achieved for toluene at 30 c reardon et al 2000 4 chlorophenol and 2 4 dcp biodegradation data revealed that for cupriavidus baseliensis the efficiency was better for 2 4 dichlorophenol than for 4 chlorophenol the kinetics of substrate utilization under ideal conditions are described by qmax the pattern of qmax for the studied chemicals was m cresol phenol toluene 4 chlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol however qmax for toluene m cresol and phenol were similar to each other and higher than for 4 chlorophenol and 2 4 dichlorophenol the value of qmax ks relates to the substrate utilization at low substrate concentration the pattern of qmax ks for the studied chemicals was toluene phenol m cresol 4 chlorophenol 2 4 dichlorophenol however there is uncertainty around the parameter value for the ratio qmax ks of toluene due to the same issues as were discussed above for the ratio μmax ks 3 3 carbon mass balance and stoichiometry to assess compatibility of data sets in the biodegradation experiments complete degradation of test chemicals was observed although the time required for complete degradation differed for each test chemical fig 3 presents the carbon mass balance of the test chemical biodegradation in the reactors the mass balance showed an average recovery of 80 7 of the initially applied carbon ranging from 77 9 to 81 5 recovery depending on the test chemical variation between replicates for carbon mass balance recovery was typically low the ability to account for 80 of the introduced carbon in reactors provided an opportunity to determine the fate and partitioning of the test chemicals during the biodegradation process either to inorganic carbon co2 or its incorporation within the biomass the production of metabolities is a significant phenomenon in the biodegradation of chemicals martin et al 2017b and can potentially account for the remaining fraction of missing carbon in the mass balance despite this the phenomenon is probably insignificant in this study oxygen availability was not limiting so that complete mineralization of each chemical in the biodegradation tests was possible section 12 in si table s5 in addition thermodynamic analysis suggested that the complete biodegradation of each chemical was feasible section 9 in si furthermore the absence of leaks from the reactor glass bottle section 8 in si fig s1 ensured that observations were not confounded by potential losses through volatility or leakage however uncertainty in the henry constant and the cell carbon content value used in the model could have a significant effect on the calculation of the final carbon content of the reactor in our study a cell carbon content value of 9 4 10 14 g c cell vrede et al 2002 was used and biomass carbon on average accounted for 43 of the carbon in the final amount of total carbon in general the elemental composition and cell volume of bacteria varies among species and is also influenced by environmental conditions trousselier et al 1997 vrede et al 2002 elazhari ali et al 2013 previous studies have shown that the elemental content of bacterial cells varies across the different phases of growth the highest carbon content was observed in exponentially growing cells whereas the lowest was observed when the substrate starts to get limited vrede et al 2002 carbon content per cell was therefore also estimated in this study after complete degradation of the chemicals by assuming that all the substrate was converted into biomass and co2 that the phase partitioning and co2 speciation in the aqueous medium was accurately described and that co2 was measured accurately refer section 14 in si for calculation we observed different carbon contents per cell in pseudomonas putida f1 for the degradation of different test chemicals the highest values were observed during m cresol 1 84 10 13 g c cell degradation compared to phenol 1 75 10 13 g c cell and toluene 1 46 10 13 g c cell degradation similarly the carbon content per cell for cupriavidus baselensis during 2 4 dichlorophenol and 4 chlorophenol degradation were 9 11 10 14 and 1 31 10 13 g c cell respectively therefore mass balance data would potentially be more rigorous if carbon content of different strains can be determined experimentally for each chemical biodegradation test however quantifying the cell carbon content of individual bactaria was outside the scope of this study on average 65 of test chemical was mineralised to co2 ranging from 53 9 to 74 8 depending on the test chemical table 3 whereas 35 of test chemical carbon was incorporated into biomass ranging 25 1 46 table 3 the amount of substrate carbon going to biomass reported in the literature varies considerably ranging from 25 to 45 zhang and hughes 2004 elazhari ali et al 2013 it should be noted that a major proportion of nutrients taken up by bacteria are normally used for energy generation simply to maintain cellular function e g maintain membrane potential maintain an osmotic pressure across bacterial membrane synthesizing building blocks take up or excrete some compounds against the concentation gradients hu 2017 in this study a stoichiometric equation was developed section 9 in si for the biodegradation of a series of test chemicals and the theoretical yield biomass and co2 was compared with experimentally observed results table 3 shows the theoretically estimated and experimentally observed co2 and biomass amount for each test chemical the average theoretical amount of biomass formation and co2 production were 0 46 mol of biomass c mole of substrate carbon and 0 54 mol of co2 c mole of substrate carbon respectively ranging from 0 4 to 0 514 mol of biomass c mole of substrate carbon and 0 486 0 6 mol of co2 c mole of substrate carbon depending on the test chemical the average experimental amount for biomass and co2 formation were 0 3015 mol biomass c mole of substrate carbon range 0 218 0 411 mol of biomass c mole of substrate carbon and 0 557 mol of co2 c mole of substrate carbon 0 481 0 649 mol of co2 c mole of substrate carbon respectively depending on the test chemical thus the experimentally observed biomass formation was typically lower than the theoretically estimated biomass formation except for 2 4 dcp biodegradation although the range of values measured encompasses the range of theoretical predictions it has to be noted that the theoretically estimated yield i e true yield is based on the material balance equation between cells substrate and the products and excludes biomass loss due to cell decay or endogenous respiration and also the energy consumed by cells for the maintenance and is therefore always higher than net yield i e experimentally observed yield 3 4 verification and calibration of a qsbr model in the environment the rate of chemical biodegradation is uncertain and difficult to reproduce as it is influenced by spatial and temporal variability of a combination of different factors i e abundance and activity of degrading microorganism environmental conditions structure and concentration of chemicals pavan and worth 2008 in contrast the different parameters influencing biodegradation can be more controlled in laboratory biodegradation tests particularly the biodegradation rates obtained from simplified biodegradation system i e batch biodegradation assays where the chemical acts as the only source of carbon and energy are easily interpretable and comparatively reproducible as compared to biodegradation rates obtained from mixed culture assays batch biodegradation studies might therefore be suitable towards calibrating theoretical qsbr models however it must be noted that several factors can effect degradation of chemicals in pure culture studies which could ultimately have influence on the estimated biodegradation rate and thus on calibration of qsbr models for example culturing degraders in nutrient broth media prior to inoculating them into the mineral medium with a specific chemical might contribute in the possible momentary loss in the biodegradation capacity of the degrader therefore a lag phase can be observed during the biodegradation assays whereby bacteria take time to adapt to the new environment which can include the induction of enzymes needed for catalyzing degradation reactions direct comparison of the first order rate constants i e kdeg used in the previous qsbr study acharya et al 2019 and experimentally determined substrate utilization rates i e q from this study for selected test chemicals may be misleading as there is no direct equivalence between the monod kinetic model parameters which link the substrate utilization to the growth of biomass and first order biodegradation rate constants which ignore the dependency of the rate on the growth of biomass during the biodegradation assay the previous rate constants were derived from the biowin3 model pass fail model for biodegradibility and transformed into rate constants that do not reflect those measured experimentally in this study on the other hand the majority of existing qsbrs including that in our previous study are developed with rate constants from different biodegradation databases which are often based on another form of qsbr the chemical biodegradation rate constants used in the development of such databases are derived from first tier biodegradation screening tests typically oecd 301 or 302 tests and rarely represent the true rates the reliability of the predicted chemical degradation rate constant in different environmental compartments with existing qsbr models is a major concern peijnenburg and damborský 2012 this demands a method approach that can be used to validate and or calibrate the existing models so that it is possible to apply the existing qsbr models to predict the chemical degradation rate constant in any environmental compartment biomass growth is fueled by substrate utilization and therefore the rate of substrate utilization or removal i e q in eq 4 is regarded as the basic rate in the biodegradation process mccarty 2012 hence correlation analysis between the first order biodegradation rate constant of the qsbr models and the experimentally determined substrate utilization rates in this study are of interest from eq 4 it can be seen that at high substrate concentration the utilization of different substrates can be compared based on the maximum substrate utilization rates qmax at low substrate concentration the utilization of different substrates can be compared based on the ratios qmax ks a strong and significant correlation p 0 05 r2 0 85 along with similar patterns were observed between the qmax and those first order biodegradation rate constants kdeg from previously developed qsbr models for five of the test chemicals fig 4 a similarly the correlation between qmax ks and the first order biodegradation rate constants kdeg for 4 chemicals were also significant p value 0 05 r2 0 97 fig 4b due to the uncertainty in the qmax ks parameter value of toluene which were discussed above toluene was not included in this regression analysis if toluene is included with a qmax ks ratio of 0 703 table 2 the correlation coefficient r2 would be 0 245 p value 0 05 and the toluene data point would be a clear outlier in the data set see fig s6 if toluene is included with a qmax ks ratio of 0 349 table 2 the r2 would be 0 71 p value 0 05 even though the biodegradation modelling concepts differ significantly between first order rate kinetics and monod kinetics any of the rates determining parameters compared in fig 4 reflects the relative biodegradability of the different compounds and this can explain the observed correlations however further validation and calibration of the principles behind in silico qsbrs with biodegradation rates obtained from a mixed microbial community for example activated sludge a similar type of inoculum as used in rbts are needed in addition it would be useful to extend such validations for biodegradation rates from a broad range of aromatic chemicals with different types of substituent groups including non halogenated moities another fundamental way in which the principles of previously derived qsbr models acharya et al 2019 could be verified is through correlation analysis between the molecular descriptors from those qsbr models and the experimentally determined parameters in this study table 4 we therefore also tested the statistical association between qmax of the five chemicals obtained from pure culture degrader experiments and each of the molecular descriptors by conducting univariate regression analysis table 4 and table s4 in si for details in short reported correlation coefficients revealed a significant correlation between qmax and most of the descriptors listed in the previous study for monoaromatic chemicals some at p value 0 05 and most at p value 0 1 because of the small number of samples it was not feasible to perform multivariate regression using combinations of two or three descriptors it is interesting to note that molecular descriptors given in table 4 represent a variety of physicochemical structural and quantum mechanical properties of chemicals that have previously shown an association with biodegradation rates okey and stensel 1993 1996 yang et al 2006 more specifically enzyme binding chemical transformation kinetics and thermodynamic factors are pivotal during the biodegradation of chemicals as discussed elsewhere parsons and govers 1990 pitter and chudoba 1990 wammer and peters 2005 arnosti 2011 acharya et al 2019 briefly the observed statistically significant correlation p value 0 1 between the qmax and hammett substituent constant suggests that the rate limiting steps in the chemical transformation reaction of an aromatic chemical is an electrophilic substitution in such cases the chemical reaction is slowed down when the electron density of the reaction centre is reduced by the substituents possessing positive values e g halogen and nitro substituents on the substituent constant pitter and chudoba 1990 conversely the reaction rate is accelerated by electron donating or activating groups such as hydroxyl or methyl groups pitter and chudoba 1990 the results in this study are in agreement with the results demonstrated by alexander and lustigman 1966 martin et al 2017a b and pitter and chudoba 1990 alexander and lustigman 1966 showed slower rates of biodegradation of mono and di substituted benzene by soil microorganisms with chloro nitro and sulfonate substituents whereas an increased rate was recorded in the presence of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups similarly martin et al 2017a showed that phenol substituent groups at position 3 meta position have significant effects on the biodegradation potential of chemicals where the sequential order of biodegradation by substituent groups was carboxylic acid cooh hydroxyl oh methyl ch3 methoxy ch3o chloro cl nitro no2 bromo br fluoro f likewise a similar trend was observed in a study performed by pitter and chaudoba pitter and chudoba 1990 furthermore the statistically significant p value 0 1 correlation between qmax with steric vdw v mr and mw and topological vx1 and vx2 descriptors indicates the importance of chemical fit in to the enzyme active site during biotransformation of chemicals in most chemical reactions an energy barrier exists that must be surmounted for the reaction to occur wammer and peters 2005 descriptors like total energy electrical energy and ehomo are quantum chemical descriptors that generally provide information on energy associated with a chemical entity parsons and govers 1990 the significant correlation p value 0 1 between qmax with quantum chemical descriptors suggests that the kinetics of biotransformation of aromatic chemicals is slower when the value of these quantum chemical descriptors is higher for example the higher the ehomo energy of highest occupied molecular orbital for a particular chemical the higher the amount of energy needed during the chemical reaction to remove an electron from the molecule which ultimately slows down the chemical reaction similarly if the electrical energy and total energy of the molecule is high there is strong attraction between electrons and the atomic nuclei this implies that high energy is required to degrade such a molecule which as a consequence is more resistant to degradation than a molecule with lower electrical and total energy furthermore the qmax values were not correlated with the lipophilic parameter i e logp of the test chemicals suggesting that at high substrate concentration lipophilicity might not be the rate limiting factor thus all together these results suggest that the rate of biodegradation of mono aromatic chemicals seems to be governed by the electronic effects of substituents kinetic and thermodynamic factors associated with chemical biotransformation and the shape and size of the chemicals 4 conclusions the biodegradation experiments including a rigorous carbon mass balance and theoretical yield predictions enabled the generation of well substantiated substrate utilization rates and related parameters qmax and qmax ks experimentally determined qmax and qmax ks can be used to validate and calibrate the principles behind in silico qsbrs the substrate utilization rates derived from pure culture experiments demonstrate that the same rank prioritisation existed with biodegradation rates derived from ready biodegradability tests even if the rate metrics and values were different the simple but rigorous experimental and theoretical approach used in this study could form the basis towards calibrating the qsbr models with real biological data acknowledgement this work was funded by engineering and physical sciences

18743,the sulfidogenic process driven by sulfate reducing bacteria srb is not suitable for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment due to the highly toxic methyl mercury mehg produced by srb in our previous study we observed in short term batch tests that sulfur reducing bacteria s0rb could remove mercury ions without mehg production thus the aim of this study is to develop a biological sulfur reduction process driven by s0rb for mercury contaminated wastewater and investigate its long term performance on mercury removal and mehg accumulation receiving mercury contaminated wastewater containing 0 50 mg hg ii l for 326 days s0rb in the sulfur reducing bioreactor showed high tolerance with mercury toxicity and removed 99 4 1 4 of the influent hg ii by biogenic sulfide mehg was always found to be undetectable in the bioreactor even though the sulfidogenic bacteria were exposed to high levels of hg ii in long term trials the result of qpcr analysis further revealed that the mercury methylation functional gene hgca concentration in the bioreactor sludge was found to be extremely lower than in the srb enriched sludge geobacter sulfurreducens pca and desulfomicrobium baculatum dsm 4028 implying that there was no or few mercury methylators in the bioreactor in short the biological sulfur reduction process using s0rb can efficiently treat mercury contaminated wastewater with high hg ii removal efficiency and no mehg accumulation graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfidogenic bacteria sulfur reducing bacteria mercury removal methylmercury geobacter 1 introduction mercury ions are extremely toxic to human beings and aquatic life bernhoft 2012 the wastewater from the chloralkali and battery industries contains high levels of mercury ions and seriously threatens aquatic ecosystems which must be treated before discharge huang et al 2015 oehmen et al 2014 compared to the expensive chemical methods biological approaches for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment are attractive due to the high cost effectiveness kikuchi and tanaka 2012 theoretically sulfidogenic process is an ideal bio technology for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment le pape et al 2017 muyzer and stams 2008 because the biogenic sulfide can precipitate hg ii to form a safe byproduct hgs ksp 10 36 at 20 c ravichandran et al 1999 j sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a b the reactions in entire sulfidogenic process follow eq 1 3 muyzer and stams 2008 however most sulfate reducing bacteria srb can methylate hg ii to form neurotoxic methylmercury mehg that accumulates in aquatic food chain resulting in severe health hazards to human beings gilmour et al 2011 yorifuji et al 2015 yu et al 2018 thus conventional sulfidogenic processes driven by srb are not suitable for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment harmon et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 1 s o 4 2 2 h 8 h h 2 s 4 h 2 o 2 2 s 0 2 h 2 h 2 h 2 s 3 h 2 s m e 2 m e s 2 h alternatively our previous study in short term batch tests confirmed that sulfur reducing bacteria s0rb can efficiently remove hg ii ions from the solution without mehg production wang et al 2018 implying that a sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb is a safe technology for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment however mercury is toxic to microbes and even known mercury resistant bacteria can only tolerate 10 mg l of hg ii wagner döbler 2003 but hg ii concentration from the chloralkali industry can reach 30 mg l manohar et al 2002 at a high hg ii concentration bio technologies for hg ii contaminated wastewater treatment may fail therefore stable sulfur reduction during long term operation of mercury contaminated wastewater treatment process driven by s0rb is an enormous challenge moreover although our previous study showed that the mercury methylation capability of the sulfidogenic bacteria could be eliminated by long term elemental sulfur feeding wang et al 2018 it is not yet known whether the mercury methylation capability would recover when the bio system exposes to mercury in long term operation thus the applicability and safety of the sulfur reduction process are determined by mehg accumulation potential in long term trails therefore in this study we aimed to determine the long term performance of a biological process based on sulfur reducing bacteria for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment the short term toxic effects of hg ii on sulfur reducing activities were firstly evaluated by batch tests a laboratory scale sulfur reducing bioreactor was then established to investigate its long term performance on hg ii removal and mehg production with 0 50 mg l of hg ii in the feeding solution the evolving microbial communities and functional gene associating with mercury methylation hgca were also analyzed in the bioreactor with long term exposure of hg ii 2 materials and methods 2 1 the sulfur reducing bioreactor setup and operation fig s1

scatter signal and photomultiplier tubes to quantify the fluorescence and side scatter signals the amplified logarithmic fluorescence signals were recorded the data were collected using the cellquest software beckman coulter in order to establish a link between s0rb and the pure mercury methylator another set of batch tests were conducted using the bioreactor sludge phase v and two pure strains

influent hg ii concentration on sulfur reducing activity to evaluate the effect of mercury toxicity on sulfur reducing activity before the long term trials the seeding sludge was used in a 48 h batch test the sulfur reducing activities with varied influent hg ii concentrations are shown in fig 1 which expressed as the sulfide production rate and bacterial viability the viable cell fraction was similar with a hg ii concentration below 10 mg l the activity gradually decreased to 9 4 as the hg ii concentration increased from 10 to 100 mg l the observed sulfide production rate increased as the hg ii concentration increased from 0 to 6 mg l reaching a maximum of 1 6 0 1 mg s g volatile suspended solids vss h when the hg ii concentration increased from 10 to 100 mg l the sulfide production rate gradually decreased sulfide 131 17 mg l was still detectable within 48 h when the hg ii concentration was 50 mg l but the sulfur was barely reduced with 100 mg l hg ii addition these results suggested that s0rb could treat mercury contaminated wastewater in a wide range of 0 50 mg hg ii l 3 2 long term performance of the sulfur reducing bioreactor the sulfur reducing bioreactor was successfully operated for 326 days in five phases in phase i a start up stage without hg ii ion feeding on average 405 mg l of sulfide was produced showing the prevalence of sulfidogenic activities in the sulfur reducing bioreactor in phase ii iii iv and v the amount 5 10 20 and 50 mg l of hg ii ions were fed into the bioreactor respectively on average 410 mg l 519 mg l 339 mg l and 577 mg l sulfide were generated through sulfur reduction in the bioreactor in phase ii iii iv and v fig 2 a ensuring the efficient removal of the influent hg ii in long term trials fig 2b fig 2 shows that the influent hg ii concentration as high as 50 mg l did not inhibit sulfur reducing activities however the sulfide production rate spr significantly fluctuated at different hg ii feeding concentrations in phase ii the mercury contaminated wastewater strongly interfered the sulfur reducing activity especially the spr dropped to zero immediately as soon as 30 mg l of hg ii was incidentally spiked in the system at day 117 but then the sulfur reducing activity gradually recovered which ensured the low concentration of hg ii in the effluent below 50 μg l in the beginnings of phase iii iv and v receiving higher levels of hg ii influent always led to the sharp drops of sprs in the bioreactor but the sprs recovered to the original levels after short recovery periods the recovery periods in phases ii iii iv and v were found to be 29 9 9 and 7 days respectively implying that the tolerance of the s0rb to hg ii ions was enhanced during long term operation on average 99 4 1 4 of the influent hg ii were removed from the wastewater in the sulfur reducing bioreactor in 326 day trials regardless of the influent hg ii concentration except for a few days in the recovery periods after the hg ii shocks all the residual effluent hg ii concentrations were below 50 μg l which meets the european discharge standard for chloralkali industrial wastewater wagner döbler et al 2000 fig 2b remarkably the average hg ii removal efficiency reached 99 9 0 03 in phase v with the highest influent hg ii concentration 50 mg l at the end of each phase the mixed liquid samples were taken for mehg analysis and the results showed that all the mehg concentrations were lower than the limit of detection lod 0 01 μg l a typical spectrum of hplc icp ms for mehg measurement is presented in fig s4 this result indicates that mehg was not accumulated in the bioreactor during the whole operation period after long term exposure to high levels of hg ii 3 3 mercury species in the sludge from the sulfur reducing bioreactor the analysis of the fate of mercury in the sludge showed that over 88 of the removed hg ii was converted to insoluble hgs by biogenic sulfide the proportions of oxide bound hg and organic bound hg were 7 and 5 respectively while the concentrations of exchangeable hg and specifically sorbed hg were lower than the lod 0 002 μg l the xrd spectrum of the freeze dried sludge was compared with reference to jcpds database in fig s5 showing that the peaks are in good agreement with the hgs standard spectrum jcpds no 99 0031 3 4 microbial community structure identification the sludge samples taken from the bioreactor at the end of each phase were analyzed by illumina miseq sequencing to investigate the influence of mercury feeding on the microbial community the rarefaction curves of the sludge samples based on the otus at 3 dissimilarity fig s6 are drawn to indicate sufficient sequencing depth for analyzing the diversity of the microbial communities in phase i the seeding sludge was fed with elemental sulfur and organic substrates without hg ii to enrich the sulfur reducing bacteria after 103 days cultivation in the bioreactor the relative abundance of total sulfur reducing bacteria increased from 11 1 seeding sludge to 16 2 in phase i the microbial community was dominated by the genus of geobacter 14 4 paludibacter 10 7 t78 7 9 vadinca02 6 4 sulfurospirillum 0 9 fig 3 with 5 50 mg l hg ii in the feeding solution the diversities of the microbial community did not change significantly pcoa analysis also shows the β diversity of the microbial community in each phase fig s7 revealing that the microbial community in the level of genus in each phase was similar the relative abundances of geobacter vadinca02 and t78 gradually increased with the increasing influent hg ii concentrations and finally reached 25 6 19 3 and 13 9 respectively at the end of phase v vadinca02 genus were identified to be related to toxic compounds degradation braga et al 2016 t78 genus were found to be the thermophilic digesters petriglieri et al 2018 thus t78 might help the sulfur reducing bacteria consume organic matter together and vadinca02 could alleviate the mercury toxicity 3 5 qpcr analysis of the hgca gene the functional gene associated with mercury methylation hgca was analyzed for the samples taken from the bioreactor sludge srb enriched sludge g sulfurreducens pca and d baculatum dsm 4028 samples using qpcr the hgca concentrations in the bioreactor sludge srb enriched sludge g sulfurreducens pca and d baculatum dsm 4028 were 6 8 1 6 103 hgca gene copies per ng of template genomic dna gdna 1 2 0 4 105 gene copies ng gdna 4 7 0 1 106 gene copies ng gdna and 1 5 0 02 105 gene copies ng gdna respectively fig 4 the hgca gene concentration in the bioreactor sludge was much lower than that in the other tested samples 4 discussion in this study the long term performance of a sulfidogenic process driven by sulfur reducing bacteria for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment without mehg production was demonstrated the results clearly showed that sulfur reducing bacteria have high tolerance to mercury toxicity moreover the biological sulfur reduction process effectively removed the influent hg ii even at a high concentration of 50 mg l even though the sulfur reducing activities were suppressed by hg ii shocks the sulfide production rates recovered soon to ensure the efficient removal of hg ii to a safe level fig 2a the high tolerance of s0rb to mercury could be attributed to high level of biogenic sulfide for hg ii precipitation and the stimulating effect of mercury on sulfidogenic activities many studies have reported that hg ii stimulated the activity of srb bharathi et al 1990 capone et al 1983 harithsa et al 2002 utgikar et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 in this study a similar phenomenon was also observed when hg ii was below 10 mg l see fig 1b as shown in fig 2 the sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb efficiently generated sulfide to remove hg ii from the wastewater in the range of 5 50 mg l hg ii showing that biological mercury removal is effective in previous studies the hg ii removal efficiencies with bio technologies were not effective in the treatment of mercury contaminated industrial wastewater such as chloralkali wastewater wagner döbler et al and von canstein et al reported that laboratory bioreactor contained mercury resistant bacteria were capable of removing 90 98 of 10 mg l influent hg ii from chloralkali wastewater von canstein et al 1999 wagner döbler et al 2000 a biofilm reactor was reported to remove 91 94 4 of the 30 mg l influent hg ii so that a subsequent carbon filter was required to increase the removal efficiency to 95 96 4 ghoshal et al 2011 mercury resistant bacterial isolates were also studied for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment but mercury removal efficiencies were below 90 giovanella et al 2016 muneer et al 2013 it s also reported that conventional activated sludge in wastewater treatment plant wwtp can only remove about 92 of the influent hg ii gbondo tugbawa et al 2010 mao et al 2016 therefore the sulfur reduction process driven by s0rb is a promising bio technology for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment with a much higher removal efficiency 99 9 at an extremely high influent hg ii concentration 50 mg l the concentrations of extremely toxic byproduct in the sulfur reducing bioreactor mehg were all lower than detection limit in this study even with long term exposure to high levels of hg ii for 223 days this finding is consistent with our previous study in which no mehg was accumulated in the s0rb enriched sludge when exposed to hg ii in 48 h wang et al 2018 this is quite different from other studies which reported that mehg was always produced in sulfidogenic processes driven by srb harmon et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 the difference could be attributed to the disappearance of mercury methylating srb in the microbial community in the sulfur reducing bioreactor because the concentration of hgca gene in the bioreactor sludge was much lower than that in the srb enriched sludge which is essential for microbial mercury methylation parks et al 2013 podar et al 2015 the results of microbial community analysis demonstrate that geobacter was enriched and became dominant genus after long term hg ii feeding fig 3 some species of geobacter can respire elemental sulfur including geobacter sulfurreducens and geobacter lovleyi flynn et al 2014 sung et al 2006 so the enrichment of geobacter spp after long term sulfur feeding is reasonable however geobacter spp were reported to be involved in mercury bio transformation especially mercury methylation lin et al 2014 lu et al 2016 most of the known geobacter spp were previously reported to be mercury methylators fleming et al 2006 gilmour et al 2013 lu et al 2016 but no mercury methylation was observed in the sulfur reducing bioreactor in all five phases over 99 of the geobacter otus in the bioreactor sludge were identified to be geobacter lovleyi to the best of our knowledge no pure culture study reported the mercury methylation ability of geobacter lovleyi hence the mercury methylation ability of this strain is not clear yet however the batch tests with the pure cultures and bioreactor sludge show that there is no strong mercury methylators in the bioreactor sludge compared to the g sulfurreducens pca and d baculatum dsm 4028 because no mehg was detected in the bioreactor sludge regardless of the hg ii concentrations whereas the mehg accumulations in g sulfurreducens pca and d baculatum dsm 4028 were increased with hg ii concentrations fig s10 moreover the qpcr results show that the hgca concentration in the bioreactor sludge was extremely low implying that the enriched geobacter sp in the bioreactor might not be capable to methylate mercury under the sulfur reducing conditions the zero valent sulfur and dom might also play a role in inhibiting mehg production in the studied system elemental sulfur in the bioreactor is reduced to sulfide via polysulfide by geobacter sun et al 2018 resulting in a high polysulfide concentration up to 45 4 mg s l in this study considering that mercury methylation is an intracellular reaction hsu kim et al 2013 the mercury uptake was modelled by the passive diffusion of the neutrally charged complexes hg sh 2 and hgs aq hsu kim et al 2013 thus the charged hg polysulfide complexes hg sn 2 2 cannot enter the cells to methylate mercury jay et al 2002 dissolved organic matters dom could be another factor to hinder mercury methylation zhao et al suggested that dom could bind the hg ii ions and restrict the mercury methylation by g sulfurreducens pca zhao et al 2017 the dom in the sulfur reducing bioreactor was also determined as suva254 29 2 on average according to the method provided by wu et al and jamieson et al wu et al 2010 jamieson et al 2014 which turned to be high the interaction between geobacter spp and mercury in the sulfur reducing bacteria abundant sludge merits further investigation with the long term suppression of mercury methylation the geobacter spp encoded hgca may be out competed by geobacter lovleyi in the long term cultivation the disappearance of mercury methylation potential with the simultaneous growth of geobacter was not only observed in this study in our previous study it was found that hg ii could be rapidly removed without mehg production with s0rb enriched sludge cultivated without hg feeding when exposed to hg ii in short term assays wang et al 2018 the s0rb enrichment was conducted twice with different seeding sludge but the similar results were obtained both the s0rb enriched sludge contained abundant geobacter without mercury methylation the results of this study reveal that the sulfur reduction process can efficiently remove mercury without mehg production even with long term exposure to high level of hg ii 5 50 mg l moreover high abundance of geobacter in the bioreactor in this study was observed therefore this finding is repeatable and its mechanism deserves further investigation 5 conclusions a laboratory scale sulfur reducing bioreactor was operated for 326 days by feeding with organic matter elemental sulfur and hg ii contaminated wastewater in order to investigate the long term performance of the biological sulfur reduction process for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment the main findings are sulfur reducing bacteria showed high tolerance to mercury toxicity the sulfur reducing activities remained high when the sludge was exposed to 50 mg l hg ii in the batch test in long term lab scale test the sulfur reducing activities were interfered by the hg ii shocks but soon recovered in a few days high hg ii removal efficiency was achieved in the sulfur reducing bioreactor in long term trials the system stably produced sufficient sulfide to remove influent hg ii at a concentration range of 5 50 mg l except for a few days for adapting hg ii shocks the average removal efficiency reached 99 9 at the condition of 50 mg l hg ii influent no mehg accumulation in the bioreactor was observed in long term trials though the sulfidogenic sludge exposed to hg ii for 223 days therefore this study demonstrated a novel sulfur reduction process as a promising bio

18743,the sulfidogenic process driven by sulfate reducing bacteria srb is not suitable for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment due to the highly toxic methyl mercury mehg produced by srb in our previous study we observed in short term batch tests that sulfur reducing bacteria s0rb could remove mercury ions without mehg production thus the aim of this study is to develop a biological sulfur reduction process driven by s0rb for mercury contaminated wastewater and investigate its long term performance on mercury removal and mehg accumulation receiving mercury contaminated wastewater containing 0 50 mg hg ii l for 326 days s0rb in the sulfur reducing bioreactor showed high tolerance with mercury toxicity and removed 99 4 1 4 of the influent hg ii by biogenic sulfide mehg was always found to be undetectable in the bioreactor even though the sulfidogenic bacteria were exposed to high levels of hg ii in long term trials the result of qpcr analysis further revealed that the mercury methylation functional gene hgca concentration in the bioreactor sludge was found to be extremely lower than in the srb enriched sludge geobacter sulfurreducens pca and desulfomicrobium baculatum dsm 4028 implying that there was no or few mercury methylators in the bioreactor in short the biological sulfur reduction process using s0rb can efficiently treat mercury contaminated wastewater with high hg ii removal efficiency and no mehg accumulation graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfidogenic bacteria sulfur reducing bacteria mercury removal methylmercury geobacter 1 introduction mercury ions are extremely toxic to human beings and aquatic life bernhoft 2012 the wastewater from the chloralkali and battery industries contains high levels of mercury ions and seriously threatens aquatic ecosystems which must be treated before discharge huang et al 2015 oehmen et al 2014 compared to the expensive chemical methods biological approaches for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment are attractive due to the high cost effectiveness kikuchi and tanaka 2012 theoretically sulfidogenic process is an ideal bio technology for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment le pape et al 2017 muyzer and stams 2008 because the biogenic sulfide can precipitate hg ii to form a safe byproduct hgs ksp 10 36 at 20 c ravichandran et al 1999 j sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a b the reactions in entire sulfidogenic process follow eq 1 3 muyzer and stams 2008 however most sulfate reducing bacteria srb can methylate hg ii to form neurotoxic methylmercury mehg that accumulates in aquatic food chain resulting in severe health hazards to human beings gilmour et al 2011 yorifuji et al 2015 yu et al 2018 thus conventional sulfidogenic processes driven by srb are not suitable for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment harmon et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 1 s o 4 2 2 h 8 h h 2 s 4 h 2 o 2 2 s 0 2 h 2 h 2 h 2 s 3 h 2 s m e 2 m e s 2 h alternatively our previous study in short term batch tests confirmed that sulfur reducing bacteria s0rb can efficiently remove hg ii ions from the solution without mehg production wang et al 2018 implying that a sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb is a safe technology for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment however mercury is toxic to microbes and even known mercury resistant bacteria can only tolerate 10 mg l of hg ii wagner döbler 2003 but hg ii concentration from the chloralkali industry can reach 30 mg l manohar et al 2002 at a high hg ii concentration bio technologies for hg ii contaminated wastewater treatment may fail therefore stable sulfur reduction during long term operation of mercury contaminated wastewater treatment process driven by s0rb is an enormous challenge moreover although our previous study showed that the mercury methylation capability of the sulfidogenic bacteria could be eliminated by long term elemental sulfur feeding wang et al 2018 it is not yet known whether the mercury methylation capability would recover when the bio system exposes to mercury in long term operation thus the applicability and safety of the sulfur reduction process are determined by mehg accumulation potential in long term trails therefore in this study we aimed to determine the long term performance of a biological process based on sulfur reducing bacteria for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment the short term toxic effects of hg ii on sulfur reducing activities were firstly evaluated by batch tests a laboratory scale sulfur reducing bioreactor was then established to investigate its long term performance on hg ii removal and mehg production with 0 50 mg l of hg ii in the feeding solution the evolving microbial communities and functional gene associating with mercury methylation hgca were also analyzed in the bioreactor with long term exposure of hg ii 2 materials and methods 2 1 the sulfur reducing bioreactor setup and operation fig s1 shows the laboratory scale sulfur reducing bioreactor which was a cylindrical reactor with an effective volume of 2 4 l 10 cm in diameter and 30 cm in height the seeding sludge of the bioreactor was

bottles were placed in a thermostatic oscillator zwy 2102c zhi cheng co ltd at 27 c and continuously stirred at 300 rpm the batch tests lasted 48 h during which sulfide concentrations at different hg ii concentrations were measured every 8 h two serum bottles were sacrificed for each measurement to ensure duplicated sampling and analysis at the end of the toxicity batch tests the sludge samples were collected for live dead staining analysis the bacterial viability was measured using the cell permeable nucleic acid dye syto 9 and propidium iodide pi in the live dead baclight bacterial

scatter signal and photomultiplier tubes to quantify the fluorescence and side scatter signals the amplified logarithmic fluorescence signals were recorded the data were collected using the cellquest software beckman coulter in order to establish a link between s0rb and the pure mercury methylator another set of batch tests were conducted using the bioreactor sludge phase v and two pure strains

influent hg ii concentration on sulfur reducing activity to evaluate the effect of mercury toxicity on sulfur reducing activity before the long term trials the seeding sludge was used in a 48 h batch test the sulfur reducing activities with varied influent hg ii concentrations are shown in fig 1 which expressed as the sulfide production rate and bacterial viability the viable cell fraction was similar with a hg ii concentration below 10 mg l the activity gradually decreased to 9 4 as the hg ii concentration increased from 10 to 100 mg l the observed sulfide production rate increased as the hg ii concentration increased from 0 to 6 mg l reaching a maximum of 1 6 0 1 mg s g volatile suspended solids vss h when the hg ii concentration increased from 10 to 100 mg l the sulfide production rate gradually decreased sulfide 131 17 mg l was still detectable within 48 h when the hg ii concentration was 50 mg l but the sulfur was barely reduced with 100 mg l hg ii addition these results suggested that s0rb could treat mercury contaminated wastewater in a wide range of 0 50 mg hg ii l 3 2 long term performance of the sulfur reducing bioreactor the sulfur reducing bioreactor was successfully operated for 326 days in five phases in phase i a start up stage without hg ii ion feeding on average 405 mg l of sulfide was produced showing the prevalence of sulfidogenic activities in the sulfur reducing bioreactor in phase ii iii iv and v the amount 5 10 20 and 50 mg l of hg ii ions were fed into the bioreactor respectively on average 410 mg l 519 mg l 339 mg l and 577 mg l sulfide were generated through sulfur reduction in the bioreactor in phase ii iii iv and v fig 2 a ensuring the efficient removal of the influent hg ii in long term trials fig 2b fig 2 shows that the influent hg ii concentration as high as 50 mg l did not inhibit sulfur reducing activities however the sulfide production rate spr significantly fluctuated at different hg ii feeding concentrations in phase ii the mercury contaminated wastewater strongly interfered the sulfur reducing activity especially the spr dropped to zero immediately as soon as 30 mg l of hg ii was incidentally spiked in the system at day 117 but then the sulfur reducing activity gradually recovered which ensured the low concentration of hg ii in the effluent below 50 μg l in the beginnings of phase iii iv and v receiving higher levels of hg ii influent always led to the sharp drops of sprs in the bioreactor but the sprs recovered to the original levels after short recovery periods the recovery periods in phases ii iii iv and v were found to be 29 9 9 and 7 days respectively implying that the tolerance of the s0rb to hg ii ions was enhanced during long term operation on average 99 4 1 4 of the influent hg ii were removed from the wastewater in the sulfur reducing bioreactor in 326 day trials regardless of the influent hg ii concentration except for a few days in the recovery periods after the hg ii shocks all the residual effluent hg ii concentrations were below 50 μg l which meets the european discharge standard for chloralkali industrial wastewater wagner döbler et al 2000 fig 2b remarkably the average hg ii removal efficiency reached 99 9 0 03 in phase v with the highest influent hg ii concentration 50 mg l at the end of each phase the mixed liquid samples were taken for mehg analysis and the results showed that all the mehg concentrations were lower than the limit of detection lod 0 01 μg l a typical spectrum of hplc icp ms for mehg measurement is presented in fig s4 this result indicates that mehg was not accumulated in the bioreactor during the whole operation period after long term exposure to high levels of hg ii 3 3 mercury species in the sludge from the sulfur reducing bioreactor the analysis of the fate of mercury in the sludge showed that over 88 of the removed hg ii was converted to insoluble hgs by biogenic sulfide the proportions of oxide bound hg and organic bound hg were 7 and 5 respectively while the concentrations of exchangeable hg and specifically sorbed hg were lower than the lod 0 002 μg l the xrd spectrum of the freeze dried sludge was compared with reference to jcpds database in fig s5 showing that the peaks are in good agreement with the hgs standard spectrum jcpds no 99 0031 3 4 microbial community structure identification the sludge samples taken from the bioreactor at the end of each phase were analyzed by illumina miseq sequencing to investigate the influence of mercury feeding on the microbial community the rarefaction curves of the sludge samples based on the otus at 3 dissimilarity fig s6 are drawn to indicate sufficient sequencing depth for analyzing the diversity of the microbial communities in phase i the seeding sludge was fed with elemental sulfur and organic substrates without hg ii to enrich the sulfur reducing bacteria after 103 days cultivation in the bioreactor the relative abundance of total sulfur reducing bacteria increased from 11 1 seeding sludge to 16 2 in phase i the microbial community was dominated by the genus of geobacter 14 4 paludibacter 10 7 t78 7 9 vadinca02 6 4 sulfurospirillum 0 9 fig 3 with 5 50 mg l hg ii in the feeding solution the diversities of the microbial community did not change significantly pcoa analysis also shows the β diversity of the microbial community in each phase fig s7 revealing that the microbial community in the level of genus in each phase was similar the relative abundances of geobacter vadinca02 and t78 gradually increased with the increasing influent hg ii concentrations and finally reached 25 6 19 3 and 13 9 respectively at the end of phase v vadinca02 genus were identified to be related to toxic compounds degradation braga et al 2016 t78 genus were found to be the thermophilic digesters petriglieri et al 2018 thus t78 might help the sulfur reducing bacteria consume organic matter together and vadinca02 could alleviate the mercury toxicity 3 5 qpcr analysis of the hgca gene the functional gene associated with mercury methylation hgca was analyzed for the samples taken from the bioreactor sludge srb enriched sludge g sulfurreducens pca and d baculatum dsm 4028 samples using qpcr the hgca concentrations in the bioreactor sludge srb enriched sludge g sulfurreducens pca and d baculatum dsm 4028 were 6 8 1 6 103 hgca gene copies per ng of template genomic dna gdna 1 2 0 4 105 gene copies ng gdna 4 7 0 1 106 gene copies ng gdna and 1 5 0 02 105 gene copies ng gdna respectively fig 4 the hgca gene concentration in the bioreactor sludge was much lower than that in the other tested samples 4 discussion in this study the long term performance of a sulfidogenic process driven by sulfur reducing bacteria for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment without mehg production was demonstrated the results clearly showed that sulfur reducing bacteria have high tolerance to mercury toxicity moreover the biological sulfur reduction process effectively removed the influent hg ii even at a high concentration of 50 mg l even though the sulfur reducing activities were suppressed by hg ii shocks the sulfide production rates recovered soon to ensure the efficient removal of hg ii to a safe level fig 2a the high tolerance of s0rb to mercury could be attributed to high level of biogenic sulfide for hg ii precipitation and the stimulating effect of mercury on sulfidogenic activities many studies have reported that hg ii stimulated the activity of srb bharathi et al 1990 capone et al 1983 harithsa et al 2002 utgikar et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 in this study a similar phenomenon was also observed when hg ii was below 10 mg l see fig 1b as shown in fig 2 the sulfidogenic process driven by s0rb efficiently generated sulfide to remove hg ii from the wastewater in the range of 5 50 mg l hg ii showing that biological mercury removal is effective in previous studies the hg ii removal efficiencies with bio technologies were not effective in the treatment of mercury contaminated industrial wastewater such as chloralkali wastewater wagner döbler et al and von canstein et al reported that laboratory bioreactor contained mercury resistant bacteria were capable of removing 90 98 of 10 mg l influent hg ii from chloralkali wastewater von canstein et al 1999 wagner döbler et al 2000 a biofilm reactor was reported to remove 91 94 4 of the 30 mg l influent hg ii so that a subsequent carbon filter was required to increase the removal efficiency to 95 96 4 ghoshal et al 2011 mercury resistant bacterial isolates were also studied for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment but mercury removal efficiencies were below 90 giovanella et al 2016 muneer et al 2013 it s also reported that conventional activated sludge in wastewater treatment plant wwtp can only remove about 92 of the influent hg ii gbondo tugbawa et al 2010 mao et al 2016 therefore the sulfur reduction process driven by s0rb is a promising bio technology for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment with a much higher removal efficiency 99 9 at an extremely high influent hg ii concentration 50 mg l the concentrations of extremely toxic byproduct in the sulfur reducing bioreactor mehg were all lower than detection limit in this study even with long term exposure to high levels of hg ii for 223 days this finding is consistent with our previous study in which no mehg was accumulated in the s0rb enriched sludge when exposed to hg ii in 48 h wang et al 2018 this is quite different from other studies which reported that mehg was always produced in sulfidogenic processes driven by srb harmon et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 the difference could be attributed to the disappearance of mercury methylating srb in the microbial community in the sulfur reducing bioreactor because the concentration of hgca gene in the bioreactor sludge was much lower than that in the srb enriched sludge which is essential for microbial mercury methylation parks et al 2013 podar et al 2015 the results of microbial community analysis demonstrate that geobacter was enriched and became dominant genus after long term hg ii feeding fig 3 some species of geobacter can respire elemental sulfur including geobacter sulfurreducens and geobacter lovleyi flynn et al 2014 sung et al 2006 so the enrichment of geobacter spp after long term sulfur feeding is reasonable however geobacter spp were reported to be involved in mercury bio transformation especially mercury methylation lin et al 2014 lu et al 2016 most of the known geobacter spp were previously reported to be mercury methylators fleming et al 2006 gilmour et al 2013 lu et al 2016 but no mercury methylation was observed in the sulfur reducing bioreactor in all five phases over 99 of the geobacter otus in the bioreactor sludge were identified to be geobacter lovleyi to the best of our knowledge no pure culture study reported the mercury methylation ability of geobacter lovleyi hence the mercury methylation ability of this strain is not clear yet however the batch tests with the pure cultures and bioreactor sludge show that there is no strong mercury methylators in the bioreactor sludge compared to the g sulfurreducens pca and d baculatum dsm 4028 because no mehg was detected in the bioreactor sludge regardless of the hg ii concentrations whereas the mehg accumulations in g sulfurreducens pca and d baculatum dsm 4028 were increased with hg ii concentrations fig s10 moreover the qpcr results show that the hgca concentration in the bioreactor sludge was extremely low implying that the enriched geobacter sp in the bioreactor might not be capable to methylate mercury under the sulfur reducing conditions the zero valent sulfur and dom might also play a role in inhibiting mehg production in the studied system elemental sulfur in the bioreactor is reduced to sulfide via polysulfide by geobacter sun et al 2018 resulting in a high polysulfide concentration up to 45 4 mg s l in this study considering that mercury methylation is an intracellular reaction hsu kim et al 2013 the mercury uptake was modelled by the passive diffusion of the neutrally charged complexes hg sh 2 and hgs aq hsu kim et al 2013 thus the charged hg polysulfide complexes hg sn 2 2 cannot enter the cells to methylate mercury jay et al 2002 dissolved organic matters dom could be another factor to hinder mercury methylation zhao et al suggested that dom could bind the hg ii ions and restrict the mercury methylation by g sulfurreducens pca zhao et al 2017 the dom in the sulfur reducing bioreactor was also determined as suva254 29 2 on average according to the method provided by wu et al and jamieson et al wu et al 2010 jamieson et al 2014 which turned to be high the interaction between geobacter spp and mercury in the sulfur reducing bacteria abundant sludge merits further investigation with the long term suppression of mercury methylation the geobacter spp encoded hgca may be out competed by geobacter lovleyi in the long term cultivation the disappearance of mercury methylation potential with the simultaneous growth of geobacter was not only observed in this study in our previous study it was found that hg ii could be rapidly removed without mehg production with s0rb enriched sludge cultivated without hg feeding when exposed to hg ii in short term assays wang et al 2018 the s0rb enrichment was conducted twice with different seeding sludge but the similar results were obtained both the s0rb enriched sludge contained abundant geobacter without mercury methylation the results of this study reveal that the sulfur reduction process can efficiently remove mercury without mehg production even with long term exposure to high level of hg ii 5 50 mg l moreover high abundance of geobacter in the bioreactor in this study was observed therefore this finding is repeatable and its mechanism deserves further investigation 5 conclusions a laboratory scale sulfur reducing bioreactor was operated for 326 days by feeding with organic matter elemental sulfur and hg ii contaminated wastewater in order to investigate the long term performance of the biological sulfur reduction process for mercury contaminated wastewater treatment the main findings are sulfur reducing bacteria showed high tolerance to mercury toxicity the sulfur reducing activities remained high when the sludge was exposed to 50 mg l hg ii in the batch test in long term lab scale test the sulfur reducing activities were interfered by the hg ii shocks but soon recovered in a few days high hg ii removal efficiency was achieved in the sulfur reducing bioreactor in long term trials the system stably produced sufficient sulfide to remove influent hg ii at a concentration range of 5 50 mg l except for a few days for adapting hg ii shocks the average removal efficiency reached 99 9 at the condition of 50 mg l hg ii influent no mehg accumulation in the bioreactor was observed in long term trials though the sulfidogenic sludge exposed to hg ii for 223 days therefore this study demonstrated a novel sulfur reduction process as a promising bio

18744,ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds are promising alternatives to conventional low pressure uv lpuv lamps mainly because they contain no toxic mercury and have a potential for less energy consumption and longer lifetime in this study uv sources including uv leds 265 275 and 285 nm and lpuv 254 nm were compared in uv chlorine degradation of an organic contaminant ronidazole rnz uv led chlorine performed better than lpuv chlorine at neutral and alkaline ph values for rnz degradation considering the fluence based rate constant however the wall plug efficiencies of uv leds are relatively low at present and must reach about 20 25 to achieve the same electrical energy per order as the lpuv in uv chlorine degradation of rnz at ph 7 5 and 9 neither the contribution of radical ho or cl nor the quantum yield of chlorine could explain the different rnz degradation rate by uv chlorine at different wavelengths and ph values while the chlorine photolysis rate should be the key factor for these phenomena the effects of common co existing substances in real water chloride bicarbonate and natural organic matter on uv chlorine degradation of rnz were similar at different uv wavelengths opposite to other oxidants or reductants the molar absorption coefficient of chlorine increases when the uv wavelength increases from 254 to 285 nm at neutral and alkaline ph which makes uv led chlorine one of the best choices for uv led based advanced oxidation reduction processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led uv chlorine advanced oxidation reduction processes ao rps chlorine photolysis ronidazole rnz 1 introduction the ultraviolet chlorine uv chlorine advanced oxidation process aop has received increasing attention in recent years as an alternative to the uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 aop the uv h2o2 has been widely applied for micropollutant degradation in drinking water purification and potable water reuse yin et al 2018 however the uv h2o2 requires extra addition and quenching of chemical h2o2 while the uv chlorine can utilize the chlorine residual in water chuang et al 2017 besides the radical production from uv chlorine may be more efficient than from uv h2o2 as the molar absorption coefficient the absorbance of a solution when the light travels 1 cm through a solution of 1 m and quantum yield are higher for chlorine than h2o2 during uv based aops chuang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 conventional uv sources for uv based aops are low pressure and medium pressure mercury lamps there are some critical problems regarding these uv mercury lamps such as toxic mercury containing relatively low wall plug efficiency wpe the energy conversion efficiency from electrical power to optical power and relatively short lifetime autin et al 2013 chatterley and linden 2010 chevremont et al 2013 close et al 2006 as promising uv sources uv light emitting diodes uv leds present a possibility to address the problems of conventional uv mercury lamps uv leds contain no mercury and have a potential for less energy consumption and longer lifetime song et al 2016 würtele et al 2011 another superiority of uv leds is that they can be manufactured to have emission spectra peak at any desired wavelength in the range from 210 to 365 nm by combining semiconducting materials in proper proportions taniyasu and kasu 2010 which is beneficial for disinfection because uv disinfection efficiency is highly dependent on uv wavelength li et al 2017 rattanakul and oguma 2018 song et al 2016 vilhunen et al 2009 besides uv leds can be turned on and off with a high and adjustable frequency which makes them an attractive alternative to conventional pulsed uv sources such as xenon lamps for possible enhancement of water disinfection efficiency bohrerova et al 2008 song et al 2016 würtele et al 2011 zou et al 2019 these advantages have attracted increasing attention on water disinfection by uv leds in recent years beck et al 2017 li et al 2017 rattanakul and oguma 2018 song et al 2016 würtele et al 2011 zou et al 2019 which means that uv leds have the potential to be widely applied in practical water treatment in the future uv leds are also regarded as promising uv sources for uv based aops and have attracted quite a few studies over the last decade however most of these studies applied uv leds with wavelength 360 nm which are highly inefficient for water disinfection matafonova and batoev 2018 song et al 2016 besides the oxidants used in most studies e g h2o2 peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds did not present the advantage of uv leds over conventional uv mercury lamps for uv based aops because the molar absorption coefficients of these oxidants decrease with the increase of wavelength when the wavelength 254 nm anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 which is the typical case for uv leds nowadays on the contrary the molar absorption coefficient of chlorine increases when the uv wavelength increases from 254 to 285 nm at neutral and alkaline ph values thus uv led chlorine is expected to perform better than conventional low pressure uv chlorine lpuv chlorine with uv wavelength at 254 nm at neutral and alkaline ph values in addition chlorine is originally a widely applied disinfectant and uv chlorine process could have better disinfection performance for uv resistant microorganisms such as human adenoviruses rattanakul and oguma 2017 therefore uv led chlorine has a notable prospect for water treatment and deserves comprehensive investigation however information about uv led chlorine is still insufficient at present wang et al 2017 compared carbamazepine degradation by uv led chlorine between two uv sources 280 and 310 nm leds gao et al 2019a evaluated the potential dual wavelength 265 and 280 nm synergy of iopamidol degradation by uv led chlorine however in these two studies lpuv chlorine performance was not reported or compared with uv led chlorine yin et al 2018 confirmed the potential of uv led chlorine considering the increasing photolysis rate of chlorine at increasing uv wavelength from 255 to 285 nm at neutral and alkaline ph values but pollutant degradation was not emphasized this study investigated the uv chlorine degradation of an organic pollutant ronidazole rnz comparing the performance of different uv sources

uv wavelengths and ph values the fluence based rate constant was calculated by eq 1 1 k 1 d ln c 0 c t where k is the fluence based rate constant cm2 mj d is the uv dose mj cm2 and c 0 and c t are the concentrations of substrate e g rnz pds and chlorine before and after uv irradiation μm the fluence based rate constants of rnz k rnz degradation by uv chlorine at different wavelengths and ph values are displayed in fig 1 a at ph 6 5 the k rnz was the highest at 254 nm among the four wavelengths however when the ph increased from 5 5 to 7 the k rnz at 254 nm decreased remarkably while the k rnz at 265 275 and 285 nm only decreased moderately as the ph further increased from 7 to 9 the k rnz at 265 nm increased gradually while no obvious change were observed for the k rnz at other wavelengths as a result at ph from 7 to 9 the k rnz at 254 nm was the lowest among the four wavelengths these phenomena could be partly explained by the molar absorption coefficient of chlorine ε chlorine at different wavelengths and ph values fig 1 b as the ph increased from 5 5 to 9 the ε chlorine at 265 275 and 285 nm increased remarkably while the ε chlorine at 254 nm almost remains the same the reason for the increase of ε chlorine with increasing ph will be further discussed in section 3 3 however the variation trend of the k rnz were different from that of ε chlorine as the ph increased from 5 5 to 9 fig 1 a and b thus more factors were investigated including radical formation as well as fluence based rate constants and quantum yields of chlorine photolysis during rnz degradation by uv chlorine 3 2 effect of radical formation on rnz degradation by uv chlorine radical formation is an important factor during uv based aops which may have considerable effects on organic compound degradation to investigate the effect of radical formation on the k rnz at different wavelengths and ph values tba and nb were added as radical probes to scavenge different radicals in solutions tba can scavenge both ho and cl while nb can scavenge ho but barely scavenge cl fang et al 2014 when tba was dosed in the solutions at ph 5 5 7 5 and 9 the k rnz at 254 nm decreased by 81 32 and 14 while the k rnz at 265 nm decreased by 75 35 and 20 fig 2 a for both wavelengths the variances of the k rnz at different ph values were similar when tba was added which suggested that the contributions of the total effect of ho and cl were similar for both wavelengths at different ph values therefore when both effects of ho and cl were considered the different variation trends of the k rnz at different wavelengths and ph values could not be explained on the other hand when nb was dosed in the solutions at ph 5 5 7 5 and 9 the k rnz at 254 nm decreased by 57 22 and 13 while the k rnz at 265 nm decreased by 61 21 and 10 fig 2 b for both wavelengths the variance of the k rnz at different ph were similar when nb was added which was the case when tba was added therefore when only the effect of ho were considered the different variation trends of the k rnz at different wavelengths and ph values still could not be explained besides the contribution of ho or cl on the k rnz of both wavelengths decreased as ph increased from 5 5 to 9 which was in accordance with fang et al 2014 3 3 effects of fluence based rate constant and quantum yield of chlorine photolysis on rnz degradation by uv chlorine fluence based rate constant and quantum yield of chlorine photolysis k chlorine and φ chlorine are two factors that may also have considerable effects on organic compound degradation during uv based aop therefore the k chlorine and φ chlorine during rnz degradation by uv chlorine at different wavelengths and ph values were studied fig 3 the quantum yield of chlorine was calculated by eqs 2 and 3 watts and linden 2007 2 φ chlorine k chlorine u λ ln 10 ε 3 u λ h c n a λ where φ chlorine is the quantum yield of chlorine mol einstein k chlorine is the fluence based rate constant of chlorine photolysis cm2 mj u λ is the molar photon energy j einstein ε is the molar absorption coefficient of chlorine h is the planck constant 6 626 10 34 j s c is the light speed 3 108 m s n a is the avogadro constant 6 022 1023 and λ is the wavelength m at ph 5 5 the k chlorine at 254 nm was much higher than that at 265 nm but decreased rapidly as ph increased from 5 5 to 9 fig 3 a by contrast the k chlorine at 265 nm increased slightly as ph increased from 5 5 to 9 and exceeded that at 254 nm as ph 7 5 this trend is in accordance with that of the k rnz variation at different wavelengths and ph values fig 1 a therefore the variation of k chlorine should be the key factor to explain the variation trend of k rnz at different wavelengths and ph values at both 254 and 265 nm the φ chlorine decreased rapidly as ph increased from 5 5 to 7 5 and kept decreasing as ph further increased to 9 however even at ph 7 5 and 9 the φ chlorine at 254 and 265 nm were similar therefore the φ chlorine should not be the key factor to explain the variation trend of k rnz at different wavelengths and ph values in addition as the φ chlorine at 254 and 265 nm were similar at ph 7 5 and 9 the variation trend of k chlorine at different wavelengths and ph values should be explained by the variation trend of the ε chlorine at different wavelengths and ph values fig 1 b a model was applied to simulate the ε chlorine and the k chlorine at different wavelengths and ph values using eqs 4 7 feng et al 2007 yin et al 2018 4 k chlorine ln 10 φ ε chlorine u λ 5 ε chlorine f ε 5 1 f ε 10 6 φ chlorine f ε 5 φ 5 1 f ε 10 φ 10 ε chlorine 7 f 1 1 10 p h p k a where ε 5 and ε 10 are the experimental molar absorption coefficients of chlorine at ph 5 and 10 for hocl and ocl respectively f is the fraction of hocl in the solution at a given ph value φ 5 and φ 10 are the experimental quantum yields of chlorine at ph 5 and 10 and pk a is the acid dissociation constant of hocl pk a 7 5 the simulated and experimental results fitted very well for the ε chlorine at different wavelengths and ph values fig 1 b which demonstrated that the different molar absorption coefficients of hocl and ocl at ph 5 and 10 respectively were the dominant reason for the variation of ε chlorine at different ph values therefore the increase of ε chlorine with increasing ph at 265 275 and 285 nm is due to the much higher molar absorption coefficients of ocl compared to hocl at these wavelengths at 254 nm the molar absorption coefficients of ocl and hocl are almost the same so the ε chlorine almost remains unchanged with increasing ph in addition the molar absorption coefficients of ocl are much higher at 265 275 and 285 nm than at 254 nm so the ε chlorine increases with increasing uv wavelength from 254 to 285 nm at neutral and alkaline ph values both chlorine photolysis with and without rnz addition were studied fig 4 as ph increased from 5 to 10 the k chlorine decreased at 254 nm but increased at 265 275 and 285 nm compared with the k chlorine without rnz addition the increase of k chlorine with rnz addition was much higher at ph 5 and 7 5 than that at ph 9 without rnz the model fitted well at all wavelengths with rnz the model fitted well at 254 and 265 nm but not well at 275 and 285 nm the difference between experimental and simulated results increased as wavelength increased from 254 to 285 nm which should be considered when optimizing the model in future 3 4 effects of chloride bicarbonate and nom on rnz degradation by uv chlorine chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 and nom are common co existing substances in real water the effects of these co existing substances on rnz degradation by uv chlorine at different uv wavelengths were displayed in fig 5 with the co existence of chloride the k rnz almost remained unchanged at 254 nm while decreased slightly at 265 nm as the chloride increased from 0 to 10 mm fig 5 a however even at chloride concentration of 10 mm 355 mg l which was relatively high compared to that in real water the k rnz at 265 nm did not change greatly chloride can react with both cl and ho but these reactions are reversible which may explain the little effect of chloride on the degradation fang et al 2014 at bicarbonate concentration of 0 5 mm 30 5 mg l the k rnz decreased by 32 and 27 at 254 and 265 nm respectively fig 5 b as bicarbonate concentration further increased to 2 mm the k rnz at both wavelengths almost remained the same bicarbonate preferentially scavenges cl compared with ho fang et al 2014 and bicarbonate concentration of 0 5 mm may be enough to scavenge most cl in the solution in this study at nom concentration of 1 mg l the k rnz decreased by 37 and 25 at 254 and 265 nm respectively as nom concentration further increased to 5 mg l the k rnz at 254 nm almost remained unchanged while the k rnz at 265 nm continued to decrease slightly finally decreased by 37 compared with no nom condition fig 5 c nom can absorb uv light and act as an inner filter to slow down the cl and ho production from chlorine photolysis fang et al 2014 besides nom reacts with radicals produced in uv chlorine at various uv wavelengths gao et al 2019b and may compete with rnz during the reaction over all the effects of common co existing substances in real water were similar for different uv wavelengths this was reasonable as the key factor affecting the k rnz variation between different uv wavelengths was the variation of k chlorine according to the discussion above 3 5 energy efficiency comparison between uv led chlorine and lpuv chlorine for comparison of energy based efficiency between uv led chlorine and lpuv chlorine electrical energy per order eeo at different ph values was calculated and the wpe required for uv leds to achieve better energy efficiency than lpuv was discussed eeo kwh m 3 order 1 characterizes the electric energy kwh required to decrease contaminant concentration per order of magnitude in a unit volume 1 m3 which was calculated by eq 10 derived from eqs 8 and 9 gao et al 2019a wang et al 2017 as we mainly focused on the comparison between different uv sources and the chlorine doses used in rnz degradation by uv chlorine were the same the equivalent electrical energy of oxidant chlorine was not included in the calculation 8 e e o 1000 p t v lg c 0 c t 9 p i a 10 6 η 10 e e o 1000 t v lg c 0 c t i a 10 6 η ln 10 i t ln c 0 c t 1000 a 10 6 η v 0 64 a 10 6 η v k r n z where p is the incident power on water surface kw t is the irradiation time h v is the solution volume 0 05l in this study c 0 and c t are the solution concentrations before and after uv irradiation μm i is the average uv irradiance on water surface mw cm2 a is the surface area of solution 56 7 cm2 in this study η is the wpe of the uv source 35 for lpuv 0 76 and 1 2 for 265 and 285 nm led and k r n z is the fluence based rate constants of rnz degradation cm2 mj as calculated by eq 1 as presented in fig 6 although the eeo of lpuv increased substantially as ph increased from 5 5 to 7 5 and 9 from 0 67 to 2 49 and 2 12 kwh m 3 order 1 respectively it was much lower than uv leds at all 3 ph values this was expected because of the much higher wpe of lpuv than uv leds especially uvc leds wavelength 280 nm one of the major limitations of uvc leds is the relatively low wpe at present the typical wpe is around 35 for lpuv lamps while only about 1 3 for uvc leds currently but the wpe of uv leds is expected to improve quickly in the near future following a similar pattern of visible leds beck et al 2017 therefore the widespread application of uv led chlorine depends on the wpe improvement of uv leds the eeo comparison between uv leds and lpuv for rnz degradation by uv chlorine at different ph values were shown in table 1 beck et al 2017 to achieve the same eeo as the lpuv at ph 7 5 the wpe of uv leds would have to improve by about 20 30 times namely improving to about 20 25 3 6 advantages of uv led chlorine over other uv led based advanced oxidation reduction processes for comparison between uv led chlorine and other uv led based ao rps rnz degradation by uv pds was studied as an example the degradation of rnz by pds uv led alone and uv led pds are shown in fig s2 no degradation of rnz could be observed by pds alone after 30 min and the degradation by uv led alone was much slower than uv led pds fig s2 a both degradation of rnz by uv led alone and uv led pds could be described by pseudo first order kinetics fig s2 b the degradation of rnz by uv led pds could also be described approximately by pseudo second order kinetics fig s3 the degradation of rnz by uv pds at different wavelengths was investigated the fluence based rate constant of rnz degradation decreased nearly linearly as the uv wavelength increased from 254 nm to 285 nm fig 7 a a similar variation trend of the molar absorption coefficient of pds ε pds at different wavelengths could be observed fig 7 b there was a good linear correlation between the rnz degradation rates and ε pds fig 8 a comparable result was found in a previous study that there was a linear correlation between the organic compound degradation rate by uv pms and the molar absorption coefficient of pms at different ph values guan et al 2011 the organic compound degradation rate by uv pds or uv pms relies on the molar absorption coefficient of oxidant pds or pms which decreases with the increase of uv wavelength when the wavelength 254 nm therefore uv leds with wavelength 254 nm the commonly applied wavelengths nowadays have no advantage in uv based aop over lpuv this is the case for most commonly used oxidants or reductants during ao rps such as h2o2 and so3 2 as their molar absorption coefficients decrease with the increase of wavelength when the wavelength 254 nm anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 xiao et al 2017 on the contrary the ε chlorine increases when the uv wavelength increases from 254 to 285 nm at neutral and alkaline ph which makes uv led chlorine one of the best choices for uv led based ao rps 4 conclusions the uv led chlorine has a notable prospect for water treatment and deserves comprehensive investigations as we confirmed that it performed better than conventional lpuv chlorine at neutral and alkaline ph values for aqueous degradation of an organic contaminant rnz in this research the rnz degradation rate by uv chlorine was highly dependent on uv wavelength and ph the enhancement of uv led chlorine compared with lpuv chlorine at neutral and alkaline ph was mainly due to the variation trend of chlorine photolysis rate at different wavelengths and ph values instead of the variation trend of radical formation or quantum yield of chlorine for uv led chlorine and lpuv chlorine the effects of common co existing substances in real water chloride bicarbonate and nom on rnz degradation were similar as the ph of real water is normally neutral or alkaline 265 nm led chlorine can substantially improve rnz degradation compared with lpuv chlorine considering the fluence based rate constant especially at ph 9 however the wpes of uv leds are relatively low at present and must reach about 20 25 to achieve the same electrical energy per order as the lpuv in uv chlorine degradation of rnz at ph 7 5 and 9 the enhancement of uv led chlorine compared with lpuv chlorine was based on the fact that the molar absorption coefficient of chlorine increases with increasing uv wavelength from 254 to 285 nm at neutral and alkaline ph values by contrast the molar absorption coefficients of oxidants in most other uv based ao rps e g peroxydisulfate peroxymonosulfate hydrogen peroxide and sulfite decrease with the increase of uv wavelength at wavelength 254 nm which makes uv leds with wavelength 254 nm the commonly applied wavelengths nowadays have no advantage over conventional lpuv in these uv based ao rps therefore uv led chlorine should be one of the best choices

18744,ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds are promising alternatives to conventional low pressure uv lpuv lamps mainly because they contain no toxic mercury and have a potential for less energy consumption and longer lifetime in this study uv sources including uv leds 265 275 and 285 nm and lpuv 254 nm were compared in uv chlorine degradation of an organic contaminant ronidazole rnz uv led chlorine performed better than lpuv chlorine at neutral and alkaline ph values for rnz degradation considering the fluence based rate constant however the wall plug efficiencies of uv leds are relatively low at present and must reach about 20 25 to achieve the same electrical energy per order as the lpuv in uv chlorine degradation of rnz at ph 7 5 and 9 neither the contribution of radical ho or cl nor the quantum yield of chlorine could explain the different rnz degradation rate by uv chlorine at different wavelengths and ph values while the chlorine photolysis rate should be the key factor for these phenomena the effects of common co existing substances in real water chloride bicarbonate and natural organic matter on uv chlorine degradation of rnz were similar at different uv wavelengths opposite to other oxidants or reductants the molar absorption coefficient of chlorine increases when the uv wavelength increases from 254 to 285 nm at neutral and alkaline ph which makes uv led chlorine one of the best choices for uv led based advanced oxidation reduction processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led uv chlorine advanced oxidation reduction processes ao rps chlorine photolysis ronidazole rnz 1 introduction the ultraviolet chlorine uv chlorine advanced oxidation process aop has received increasing attention in recent years as an alternative to the uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 aop the uv h2o2 has been widely applied for micropollutant degradation in drinking water purification and potable water reuse yin et al 2018 however the uv h2o2 requires extra addition and quenching of chemical h2o2 while the uv chlorine can utilize the chlorine residual in water chuang et al 2017 besides the radical production from uv chlorine may be more efficient than from uv h2o2 as the molar absorption coefficient the absorbance of a solution when the light travels 1 cm through a solution of 1 m and quantum yield are higher for chlorine than h2o2 during uv based aops chuang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 conventional uv sources for uv based aops are low pressure and medium pressure mercury lamps there are some critical problems regarding these uv mercury lamps such as toxic mercury containing relatively low wall plug efficiency wpe the energy conversion efficiency from electrical power to optical power and relatively short lifetime autin et al 2013 chatterley and linden 2010 chevremont et al 2013 close et al 2006 as promising uv sources uv light emitting diodes uv leds present a possibility to address the problems of conventional uv mercury lamps uv leds contain no mercury and have a potential for less energy consumption and longer lifetime song et al 2016 würtele et al 2011 another superiority of uv leds is that they can be manufactured to have emission spectra peak at any desired wavelength in the range from 210 to 365 nm by combining semiconducting materials in proper proportions taniyasu and kasu 2010 which is beneficial for disinfection because uv disinfection efficiency is highly dependent on uv wavelength li et al 2017 rattanakul and oguma 2018 song et al 2016 vilhunen et al 2009 besides uv leds can be turned on and off with a high and adjustable frequency which makes them an attractive alternative to conventional pulsed uv sources such as xenon lamps for possible enhancement of water disinfection efficiency bohrerova et al 2008 song et al 2016 würtele et al 2011 zou et al 2019 these advantages have attracted increasing attention on water disinfection by uv leds in recent years beck et al 2017 li et al 2017 rattanakul and oguma 2018 song et al 2016 würtele et al 2011 zou et al 2019 which means that uv leds have the potential to be widely applied in practical water treatment in the future uv leds are also regarded as promising uv sources for uv based aops and have attracted quite a few studies over the last decade however most of these studies applied uv leds with wavelength 360 nm which are highly inefficient for water disinfection matafonova and batoev 2018 song et al 2016 besides the oxidants used in most studies e g h2o2 peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds did not present the advantage of uv leds over conventional uv mercury lamps for uv based aops because the molar absorption coefficients of these oxidants decrease with the increase of wavelength when the wavelength 254 nm anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 which is the typical case for uv leds nowadays on the contrary the molar absorption coefficient of chlorine increases when the uv wavelength increases from 254 to 285 nm at neutral and alkaline ph values thus uv led chlorine is expected to perform better than conventional low pressure uv chlorine lpuv chlorine with uv wavelength at 254 nm at neutral and alkaline ph values in addition chlorine is originally a widely applied disinfectant and uv chlorine process could have better disinfection performance for uv resistant microorganisms such as human adenoviruses rattanakul and oguma 2017 therefore uv led chlorine has a notable prospect for water treatment and deserves comprehensive investigation however information about uv led chlorine is still insufficient at present wang et al 2017 compared carbamazepine degradation by uv led chlorine between two uv sources 280 and 310 nm leds gao et al 2019a evaluated the potential dual wavelength 265 and 280 nm synergy of iopamidol degradation by uv led chlorine however in these two studies lpuv chlorine performance was not reported or compared with uv led chlorine yin et al 2018 confirmed the potential of uv led chlorine considering the increasing photolysis rate of chlorine at increasing uv wavelength from 255 to 285 nm at neutral and alkaline ph values but pollutant degradation was not emphasized this study investigated the uv chlorine degradation of an organic pollutant ronidazole rnz comparing the performance of different uv sources

uv wavelengths and ph values the fluence based rate constant was calculated by eq 1 1 k 1 d ln c 0 c t where k is the fluence based rate constant cm2 mj d is the uv dose mj cm2 and c 0 and c t are the concentrations of substrate e g rnz pds and chlorine before and after uv irradiation μm the fluence based rate constants of rnz k rnz degradation by uv chlorine at different wavelengths and ph values are displayed in fig 1 a at ph 6 5 the k rnz was the highest at 254 nm among the four wavelengths however when the ph increased from 5 5 to 7 the k rnz at 254 nm decreased remarkably while the k rnz at 265 275 and 285 nm only decreased moderately as the ph further increased from 7 to 9 the k rnz at 265 nm increased gradually while no obvious change were observed for the k rnz at other wavelengths as a result at ph from 7 to 9 the k rnz at 254 nm was the lowest among the four wavelengths these phenomena could be partly explained by the molar absorption coefficient of chlorine ε chlorine at different wavelengths and ph values fig 1 b as the ph increased from 5 5 to 9 the ε chlorine at 265 275 and 285 nm increased remarkably while the ε chlorine at 254 nm almost remains the same the reason for the increase of ε chlorine with increasing ph will be further discussed in section 3 3 however the variation trend of the k rnz were different from that of ε chlorine as the ph increased from 5 5 to 9 fig 1 a and b thus more factors were investigated including radical formation as well as fluence based rate constants and quantum yields of chlorine photolysis during rnz degradation by uv chlorine 3 2 effect of radical formation on rnz degradation by uv chlorine radical formation is an important factor during uv based aops which may have considerable effects on organic compound degradation to investigate the effect of radical formation on the k rnz at different wavelengths and ph values tba and nb were added as radical probes to scavenge different radicals in solutions tba can scavenge both ho and cl while nb can scavenge ho but barely scavenge cl fang et al 2014 when tba was dosed in the solutions at ph 5 5 7 5 and 9 the k rnz at 254 nm decreased by 81 32 and 14 while the k rnz at 265 nm decreased by 75 35 and 20 fig 2 a for both wavelengths the variances of the k rnz at different ph values were similar when tba was added which suggested that the contributions of the total effect of ho and cl were similar for both wavelengths at different ph values therefore when both effects of ho and cl were considered the different variation trends of the k rnz at different wavelengths and ph values could not be explained on the other hand when nb was dosed in the solutions at ph 5 5 7 5 and 9 the k rnz at 254 nm decreased by 57 22 and 13 while the k rnz at 265 nm decreased by 61 21 and 10 fig 2 b for both wavelengths the variance of the k rnz at different ph were similar when nb was added which was the case when tba was added therefore when only the effect of ho were considered the different variation trends of the k rnz at different wavelengths and ph values still could not be explained besides the contribution of ho or cl on the k rnz of both wavelengths decreased as ph increased from 5 5 to 9 which was in accordance with fang et al 2014 3 3 effects of fluence based rate constant and quantum yield of chlorine photolysis on rnz degradation by uv chlorine fluence based rate constant and quantum yield of chlorine photolysis k chlorine and φ chlorine are two factors that may also have considerable effects on organic compound degradation during uv based aop therefore the k chlorine and φ chlorine during rnz degradation by uv chlorine at different wavelengths and ph values were studied fig 3 the quantum yield of chlorine was calculated by eqs 2 and 3 watts and linden 2007 2 φ chlorine k chlorine u λ ln 10 ε 3 u λ h c n a λ where φ chlorine is the quantum yield of chlorine mol einstein k chlorine is the fluence based rate constant of chlorine photolysis cm2 mj u λ is the molar photon energy j einstein ε is the molar absorption coefficient of chlorine h is the planck constant 6 626 10 34 j s c is the light speed 3 108 m s n a is the avogadro constant 6 022 1023 and λ is the wavelength m at ph 5 5 the k chlorine at 254 nm was much higher than that at 265 nm but decreased rapidly as ph increased from 5 5 to 9 fig 3 a by contrast the k chlorine at 265 nm increased slightly as ph increased from 5 5 to 9 and exceeded that at 254 nm as ph 7 5 this trend is in accordance with that of the k rnz variation at different wavelengths and ph values fig 1 a therefore the variation of k chlorine should be the key factor to explain the variation trend of k rnz at different wavelengths and ph values at both 254 and 265 nm the φ chlorine decreased rapidly as ph increased from 5 5 to 7 5 and kept decreasing as ph further increased to 9 however even at ph 7 5 and 9 the φ chlorine at 254 and 265 nm were similar therefore the φ chlorine should not be the key factor to explain the variation trend of k rnz at different wavelengths and ph values in addition as the φ chlorine at 254 and 265 nm were similar at ph 7 5 and 9 the variation trend of k chlorine at different wavelengths and ph values should be explained by the variation trend of the ε chlorine at different wavelengths and ph values fig 1 b a model was applied to simulate the ε chlorine and the k chlorine at different wavelengths and ph values using eqs 4 7 feng et al 2007 yin et al 2018 4 k chlorine ln 10 φ ε chlorine u λ 5 ε chlorine f ε 5 1 f ε 10 6 φ chlorine f ε 5 φ 5 1 f ε 10 φ 10 ε chlorine 7 f 1 1 10 p h p k a where ε 5 and ε 10 are the experimental molar absorption coefficients of chlorine at ph 5 and 10 for hocl and ocl respectively f is the fraction of hocl in the solution at a given ph value φ 5 and φ 10 are the experimental quantum yields of chlorine at ph 5 and 10 and pk a is the acid dissociation constant of hocl pk a 7 5 the simulated and experimental results fitted very well for the ε chlorine at different wavelengths and ph values fig 1 b which demonstrated that the different molar absorption coefficients of hocl and ocl at ph 5 and 10 respectively were the dominant reason for the variation of ε chlorine at different ph values therefore the increase of ε chlorine with increasing ph at 265 275 and 285 nm is due to the much higher molar absorption coefficients of ocl compared to hocl at these wavelengths at 254 nm the molar absorption coefficients of ocl and hocl are almost the same so the ε chlorine almost remains unchanged with increasing ph in addition the molar absorption coefficients of ocl are much higher at 265 275 and 285 nm than at 254 nm so the ε chlorine increases with increasing uv wavelength from 254 to 285 nm at neutral and alkaline ph values both chlorine photolysis with and without rnz addition were studied fig 4 as ph increased from 5 to 10 the k chlorine decreased at 254 nm but increased at 265 275 and 285 nm compared with the k chlorine without rnz addition the increase of k chlorine with rnz addition was much higher at ph 5 and 7 5 than that at ph 9 without rnz the model fitted well at all wavelengths with rnz the model fitted well at 254 and 265 nm but not well at 275 and 285 nm the difference between experimental and simulated results increased as wavelength increased from 254 to 285 nm which should be considered when optimizing the model in future 3 4 effects of chloride bicarbonate and nom on rnz degradation by uv chlorine chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 and nom are common co existing substances in real water the effects of these co existing substances on rnz degradation by uv chlorine at different uv wavelengths were displayed in fig 5 with the co existence of chloride the k rnz almost remained unchanged at 254 nm while decreased slightly at 265 nm as the chloride increased from 0 to 10 mm fig 5 a however even at chloride concentration of 10 mm 355 mg l which was relatively high compared to that in real water the k rnz at 265 nm did not change greatly chloride can react with both cl and ho but these reactions are reversible which may explain the little effect of chloride on the degradation fang et al 2014 at bicarbonate concentration of 0 5 mm 30 5 mg l the k rnz decreased by 32 and 27 at 254 and 265 nm respectively fig 5 b as bicarbonate concentration further increased to 2 mm the k rnz at both wavelengths almost remained the same bicarbonate preferentially scavenges cl compared with ho fang et al 2014 and bicarbonate concentration of 0 5 mm may be enough to scavenge most cl in the solution in this study at nom concentration of 1 mg l the k rnz decreased by 37 and 25 at 254 and 265 nm respectively as nom concentration further increased to 5 mg l the k rnz at 254 nm almost remained unchanged while the k rnz at 265 nm continued to decrease slightly finally decreased by 37 compared with no nom condition fig 5 c nom can absorb uv light and act as an inner filter to slow down the cl and ho production from chlorine photolysis fang et al 2014 besides nom reacts with radicals produced in uv chlorine at various uv wavelengths gao et al 2019b and may compete with rnz during the reaction over all the effects of common co existing substances in real water were similar for different uv wavelengths this was reasonable as the key factor affecting the k rnz variation between different uv wavelengths was the variation of k chlorine according to the discussion above 3 5 energy efficiency comparison between uv led chlorine and lpuv chlorine for comparison of energy based efficiency between uv led chlorine and lpuv chlorine electrical energy per order eeo at different ph values was calculated and the wpe required for uv leds to achieve better energy efficiency than lpuv was discussed eeo kwh m 3 order 1 characterizes the electric energy kwh required to decrease contaminant concentration per order of magnitude in a unit volume 1 m3 which was calculated by eq 10 derived from eqs 8 and 9 gao et al 2019a wang et al 2017 as we mainly focused on the comparison between different uv sources and the chlorine doses used in rnz degradation by uv chlorine were the same the equivalent electrical energy of oxidant chlorine was not included in the calculation 8 e e o 1000 p t v lg c 0 c t 9 p i a 10 6 η 10 e e o 1000 t v lg

although the eeo of lpuv increased substantially as ph increased from 5 5 to 7 5 and 9 from 0 67 to 2 49 and 2 12 kwh m 3 order 1 respectively it was much lower than uv leds at all 3 ph values this was expected because of the much higher wpe of lpuv than uv leds especially uvc leds wavelength 280 nm one of the major limitations of uvc leds is the relatively low wpe at present the typical wpe is around 35 for lpuv lamps while only about 1 3 for uvc leds currently but the wpe of uv leds is expected to improve quickly in the near future following a similar pattern of visible leds beck et al 2017 therefore the widespread application of uv led chlorine depends on the wpe improvement of uv leds the eeo comparison between uv leds and lpuv for rnz degradation by uv chlorine at different ph values were shown in table 1 beck et al 2017 to achieve the same eeo as the lpuv at ph 7 5 the wpe of uv leds would have to improve by about 20 30 times namely improving to about 20 25 3 6 advantages of uv led chlorine over other uv led based advanced oxidation reduction processes for comparison between uv led chlorine and other uv led based ao rps rnz degradation by uv pds was studied as an example the degradation of rnz by pds uv led alone and uv led pds are shown in fig s2 no degradation of rnz could be observed by pds alone after 30 min and the degradation by uv led alone was much slower than uv led pds fig s2 a both degradation of rnz by uv led alone and uv led pds could be described by pseudo first order kinetics fig s2 b the degradation of rnz by uv led pds could also be described approximately by pseudo second order kinetics fig s3 the degradation of rnz by uv pds at different wavelengths was investigated the fluence based rate constant of rnz degradation decreased nearly linearly as the uv wavelength increased from 254 nm to 285 nm fig 7 a a similar variation trend of the molar absorption coefficient of pds ε pds at different wavelengths could be observed fig 7 b there was a good linear correlation between the rnz degradation rates and ε pds fig 8 a comparable result was found in a previous study that there was a linear correlation between the organic compound degradation rate by uv pms and the molar absorption coefficient of pms at different ph values guan et al 2011 the organic compound degradation rate by uv pds or uv pms relies on the molar absorption coefficient of oxidant pds or pms which decreases with the increase of uv wavelength when the wavelength 254 nm therefore uv leds with wavelength 254 nm the commonly applied wavelengths nowadays have no advantage in uv based aop over lpuv this is the case for most commonly used oxidants or reductants during ao rps such as h2o2 and so3 2 as their molar absorption coefficients decrease with the increase of wavelength when the wavelength 254 nm anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 xiao et al 2017 on the contrary the ε chlorine increases when the uv wavelength increases from 254 to 285 nm at neutral and alkaline ph which makes uv led chlorine one of the best choices for uv led based ao rps 4 conclusions the uv led chlorine has a notable prospect for water treatment and deserves comprehensive investigations as we confirmed that it performed better than conventional lpuv chlorine at neutral and alkaline ph values for aqueous degradation of an organic contaminant rnz in this research the rnz degradation rate by uv chlorine was highly dependent on uv wavelength and ph the enhancement of uv led chlorine compared with lpuv chlorine at neutral and alkaline ph was mainly due to the variation trend of chlorine photolysis rate at different wavelengths and ph values instead of the variation trend of radical formation or quantum yield of chlorine for uv led chlorine and lpuv chlorine the effects of common co existing substances in real water chloride bicarbonate and nom on rnz degradation were similar as the ph of real water is normally neutral or alkaline 265 nm led chlorine can substantially improve rnz degradation compared with lpuv chlorine considering the fluence based rate constant especially at ph 9 however the wpes of uv leds are relatively low at present and must reach about 20 25 to achieve the same electrical energy per order as the lpuv in uv chlorine degradation of rnz at ph 7 5 and 9 the enhancement of uv led chlorine compared with lpuv chlorine was based on the fact that the molar absorption coefficient of chlorine increases with increasing uv wavelength from 254 to 285 nm at neutral and alkaline ph values by contrast the molar absorption coefficients of oxidants in most other uv based ao rps e g peroxydisulfate peroxymonosulfate hydrogen peroxide and sulfite decrease with the increase of uv wavelength at wavelength 254 nm which makes uv leds with wavelength 254 nm the commonly applied wavelengths nowadays have no advantage over conventional lpuv in these uv based ao rps therefore uv led chlorine should be one of the best choices for uv led based ao rps especially at neutral and alkaline ph values declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that
