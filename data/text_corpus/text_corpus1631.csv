8155,study region little kinyasungwe catchment within the river wami basin of central semi arid tanzania study focus groundwater and its replenishment via recharge are critical to sustaining livelihoods and poverty alleviation in tropical drylands yet the processes by which groundwater is replenished remain inadequately observed and resolved detailed observations are examined from central tanzania where the makutapora wellfield supplies freshwater to the rapidly growing capital city of dodoma new hydrological insights for the region the prominence of focused recharge from ephemeral stream discharges is shown from 1 groundwater recharge correlates more strongly with the seasonal duration of ephemeral stream stage exceeding a threshold than seasonal rainfall 2 hourly monitoring of groundwater levels and stream stage shows that sustained groundwater level rises indicative of groundwater recharge correspond better to observed pulses of stream discharge from intensive rainfall observed upstream of the wellfield than rainfall recorded proximate to piezometers and 3 stable isotope ratios of o and h indicate similar compositions of groundwater and ephemeral streamflow both have undergone evaporative enrichment and are linked to intensive 90th percentile daily rainfall this characterisation of focused groundwater recharge from intensive rainfall in this tropical dryland highlights the potential resilience of groundwater resources to climate change amplifying precipitation extremes and informs strategies to augment replenishment of groundwater supplying the city of

groundwater storage macdonald et al 2012 the sustainable use and optimal management of groundwater require knowledge of long term groundwater recharge and discharge rates and potential changes to these rates due to climate change and freshwater withdrawals understanding this balance and how it may change are predicated on knowledge of the mechanisms by which meteoric water replenishes aquifers as well as the conditions and pathways which generate groundwater recharge current understanding of groundwater recharge processes in semi arid areas is constrained by a lack of observational data recent continental to global scale analyses macdonald et al 2021 moeck et al 2020 mohan et al 2018 have highlighted broad associations between groundwater recharge and both climate and land cover characteristics but little insight to the processes that transmit precipitation to groundwater systems jasechko and taylor 2015 macdonald et al 2021 knowledge gaps are most acute in drylands cuthbert et al 2019 somaratne and smettem 2014 groundwater recharge can broadly be considered to derive from processes that are diffuse taking place throughout a landscape from the direct or near direct infiltration of precipitation or focused occurring from the leakage of ephemeral or perennial surface water at specific locations such as a drainage channel or depression within a landscape diffuse and focused recharge processes occur in most groundwater systems the prevalence of focused recharge is generally considered to increase with aridity alley 2009 cuthbert et al 2019 limited research has shown groundwater recharge in semi arid areas commonly occurs via leakage from ephemeral streams acworth et al 2021 cuthbert et al 2016 dahan et al 2008 villeneuve et al 2015 or ponds favreau et al 2009 however studies throughout tropical africa have shown considerable variation in predominant groundwater recharge processes carter and alkali 1996 favreau et al 2009 faye et al 2019 goni et al 2021 this variation is attributed to the wide range of geological climatological and terrestrial environments cuthbert et al 2019 scanlon et al 2006 taylor et al 2013a that characterise this region the makutapora wellfield within the little kinyasungwe catchment of central tanzania fig 1 features one of the longest near continuous time series of groundwater level observation in tropical africa fig 2 the record is characterised by episodic groundwater level rises that interrupt multiannual recessionary trends whose magnitude has increased in response to sustained rises in wellfield abstraction perceptions regarding the predominant process by which groundwater recharge to the makutapora wellfield occurs have changed over time groundwater recharge was initially considered to be primarily diffuse nkotagu 1996a shindo et al 1989 with soil macropores transmitting the majority of infiltrating water through the unsaturated zone shindo et al 1989 more recently taylor et al 2013b hypothesised that focused recharge via leakage from ephemeral streams features centrally in highly episodic recharge events often associated with extreme seasonal rainfall during el niño events e g 1997 1998 this latter assertion has however remained untested by limitations in observational datasets here we seek to examine the processes by which heavy rainfall generates groundwater recharge this analysis examines 1 statistical relationships between groundwater recharge and both daily records of rainfall and ephemeral stream stage over hydrological years i e 1st october to 30th september from 2006 2007 to 2016 2017 2 temporal relationships between hourly observations of groundwater levels and stream stage together with daily rainfall from 2015 2016 to 2017 2018 and 3 associations among stable isotope ratios of o and h in rainfall surface waters and groundwater high frequency monitoring of groundwater levels and stream stage was initiated in advance of the 2015 2016 wet season as it was predicted to coincide with one of the strongest el niño events on record 2 study area the makutapora wellfield and little kinyasungwe catchment are located on the east african plateau of central tanzania they are located at the southern end of the eastern branch of the east african rift system ears approximately 20 km north of tanzania s capital city dodoma fig 1 surface drainage occupies an area of 698 km2 upstream of the chihanga stream gauge the outlet of the river little kinyasungwe tectonic activity associated with the ears has strongly influenced the basin and surrounding areas linear drainage features including lakes rivers and swamps generally trend ne sw and nw se and reflect extensive tectonically induced faulting nkotagu 1996a major lineaments include the mlemu and kitope faults which follow a ne sw trend fig 1 the makutapora wellfield experiences a hot semi arid climate that is characterised by distinct wet and dry seasons and perennially high temperatures mean of 27 c from in situ observations 2017 2019 mean annual rainfall of 527 mm 2006 2018 falls during a unimodal wet season between november and april mean annual potential evapotranspiration is estimated to be 2120 mm lowland land cover is dominated by grassland and dwarf shrubs taylor et al 2013b whereas catchment uplands are mostly covered by thick shrubland and forest de pauw et al 1983 agriculture is restricted due to the importance of the wellfield a nearby military base and a soil preservation policy kangalawe 2009 there is consequently little evidence of substantial changes in land use taylor et al 2013b water bearing formations comprise the regolith and weathered and fractured crystalline bedrock of the dodoma system fawley 1955 shindo et al 1989 the crystalline basement comprises migmatite granite and disconnected fragments of older more basic basement rocks such as amphibolites schists and gneisses de pauw et al 1983 younger intrusions are also present in the form of basic and ultrabasic dykes in the seasonally inundated lowland depression in the vicinity of the wellfield the regolith is covered by a generally thick 10 m layer of mbuga clay a black clay like deposit fawley 1955 fig 3 this surface clay layer restricts diffuse recharge and promotes ponding of ephemeral stream discharges leading to transmission losses not only to the atmosphere but also conceivably to the subsurface as recharge through slow piston flow or preferential pathways such as vertical fractures zarate et al 2021 depths to groundwater in the wellfield in range from 25 to 35 m below ground level and are considered largely to reside below the mbuga clay though locally confining conditions can occur seddon 2019 further details of the layering and geometry of the superficial geology in this area are outlined by zarate et al 2021 regolith thickness varies between 50 m and 100 m fawley 1955 anomalously high transmissivities found in the makutapora wellfield are thought to result from enhanced weathering associated with the network of faults present in the saturated zone maurice et al 2019 taylor et al 2013b pumping tests indicate that transmissivities range from 400 to 4000 m2 d 1 maurice et al 2019 which are greater than typically observed in deeply weathered crystalline rock aquifer systems taylor and howard 2000 bianchi et al 2020 high yielding wells are proximate to major faults the wellfield currently comprises 24 production wells duwasa 2017 and is the sole source of the public piped water supply to dodoma the capital city of tanzania in 2016 the makutapora wellfield supplied water at an average rate of 50 000 m3 per day to dodoma groundwater abstraction from the wellfield has increased since the resources were first developed in the 1940s drainage within the little kinyasungwe catchment is strongly influenced by faulting taylor et al 2013b zarate et al 2021 there are no perennial streams in the catchment surface drainage is ephemeral and can vary spatially from year to year the largest ephemeral stream channel river little kinyasungwe drains part of the upland catchment and flows in the direction of the major faults into the wellfield fig 1 surface water exits the catchment at chihanga and into a controlled reservoir hombolo the closest perennial surface water to the wellfield shindo et al 1989 3 data and methods 3 1 hydrometric observations from 2006 2007 to 2017 2018 statistical relationships were examined between groundwater recharge derived from piezometry and hydrological observations compiled by the ministry of water and irrigation wami ruvu basin water board comprising 1 daily rainfall representing a local source of groundwater recharge in the vicinity of monitoring wells within the makutapora wellfield and 2 daily stream stage at meya meya drainage area 167 km2 and chihanga drainage area 698 km2 representing a potential source of focused groundwater recharge fig 1 gauging stations at meya meya upstream of the wellfield and chihanga downstream of the wellfield were established by shindo et al 1989 with daily records available since january 2006 fig 1 daily precipitation has been recorded at the makutapora meteorological station elevation 1081 m above mean sea level mamsl which is proximate to the wellfield in the lowland since january 2007 daily precipitation has also been collected at upland rain gauges meya meya 1121 mamsl and zanka 1159 mamsl since june 2008 and itiso 1103 mamsl since november 2007 fig 1 unlike the other 3 rain gauges itiso is situated 10 km outside of the catchment fig 1 groundwater levels have been monitored since 1954 at various locations throughout the wellfield fig 2 the strength of the statistical relationships between groundwater recharge and variables of both local rainfall and stream stage over hydrological years were tested using correlation analyses employing both non parametric i e spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs kendall tau b correlation coefficient τb and parametric i e pearson correlation coefficient r measures p values are reported where the statistical significance of correlation coefficients is at a confidence level of 95 p 0 05 two rainfall variables from both makutapora meteorological station lowland and zanka upland rain gauges were chosen for correlation with corresponding groundwater recharge values 1 the number of rain days in a hydrological year in which at least 1 mm of rainfall was recorded as the minimum non zero value in the dataset and 2 total rainfall over the duration of a hydrological year mm additionally three streamflow variables derived from stage data recorded at meya meya and one derived from chihanga data were chosen and comprised 1 duration of streamflow the number of days in a hydrological year where stream stage exceeded 0 1 m i e minimum value at meya meya 2 cumulative stream stage at meya meya i e sum of the daily stream stage values over the duration of a hydrological year in m and 3 duration of streamflow in a hydrological year when stream stage exceeded a threshold determined iteratively i e systematically varying threshold values by 0 01 m to reach a best fit linear regression model 0 25 m at meya meya 0 77 m at chihanga the rationale for the analysis of variable stage thresholds derived from allied research employing surface geophysics which suggested potential groundwater recharge pathways in association with overbank flood discharges that access permeable pathways through the regolith to enable rapid groundwater recharge zarate et al 2021 in the little kinyasungwe catchment a substantial proportion of the groundwater outflow is the result of groundwater abstraction hence values of groundwater recharge were derived from piezometric data by employing a modified water table fluctuation wtf method in which changes in groundwater levels through time are assumed to result from the balance between recharge and groundwater discharge that accounts for transience in pumped systems supplementary material a groundwater recharge is reported in terms of q sy values in metres wherein recharge q values are normalised to specific yield sy due to uncertainty in sy 3 2 high frequency hydrometric observations from 2015 2016 to 2017 2018 temporal relationships were examined between hourly observations of groundwater levels at three locations c5 89 75 122 75 the only monitoring wells for which data were available hourly stream stage at both meya meya and chihanga and daily rainfall observed in the vicinity of the monitoring wells in the lowland at makutapora and in upland locations remote from monitoring wells at zanka meya meya and itiso the purpose of these comparisons was to move beyond simple empirical associations section 3 1 and draw insight from high frequency observations into the hydrological dynamics that generate groundwater recharge the analysis focused on a series of three groundwater recharge events that are marked by distinct rises in groundwater levels fig 4 two events 1 st to 16th february and 30th march to 8th april occur during the 2015 2016 el niño event and one event 1 st to 20th january 2018 is from the 2017 2018 wet season comparisons with rainfall time series and stream stage sought to examine associations between localised rainfall as a potential source of diffuse groundwater recharge and remote upland rainfall generating ephemeral stream discharge as a potential source of focused recharge daily records of wellfield abstraction were also considered to evaluate the influence of pumping on observed piezometric responses automated hourly monitoring infrastructure for groundwater levels stream stage and barometric pressure was installed in november 2015 prior to the wet season associated with the 2015 2016 el niño event monitoring wells c5 89 75 and 122 75 were equipped with unvented insitu ruggedtroll 100 dataloggers and are located 110 m 200 m and 1430 m respectively from the drainage channel of the river little kinyasungwe details of well screen depths are not available but are expected to occur at depths of 30 m below ground or more within the base of the weathered granite and underlying fractured bedrock stream stage was also monitored by suspending insitu ruggedtroll 100 dataloggers inside a 2 inch perforated pvc piping screened with wire mesh and sealed at the top using a torque locking well plug supplementary information b allowing water to flow freely through the screened section and base at each established stream gauging stations on the river little kinyasungwe at meya meya and chihanga the datalogger was attached to an existing staff gauge and buried beneath the streambed groundwater level data were compensated for variations in atmospheric pressure using data collected on site fig 1 3 3 stable isotope ratios of o and h the origin of groundwater sampled from production wells in the makutapora wellfield was investigated using stable isotope ratios of o and h in precipitation groundwater and perennial and ephemeral surface water daily rainfall samples n 17 were collected at the makutapora meteorological station over 3 wet seasons 2015 2016 2017 2018 in accordance with iaea 2014 precipitation sampling guidelines for event based sampling using a buried sampler the analysis of stable isotope ratios of o 18o 16o and h 2h 1h was undertaken using a los gatos lgr100 water isotope analyser by elemtex limited callington uk supplementary data from the late 1980s and early 1990s for precipitation n 60 groundwater n 120 and perennial and ephemeral surface water n 17 were compiled from previously published studies nkotagu 1996b onodera et al 1995 shindo et al 1990 and the iaea twin database iaea wmo 2018 daily precipitation samples conducted through this research and from past studies were all collected at the makutapora meteorological station perennial surface water samples were taken from lake hombolo whereas ephemeral surface water samples were collected from river little kinyasungwe and river madihi the latter is just west of makutapora meteorological station shindo et al 1990 herein stable isotope ratios of o and h are described using delta notation δ18o and δ2h respectively in units of per mille where δ r s a m p l e r v s m o w 1 1000 and r is the ratio of 18o 16o or 2h 1h in vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow and the sample sample reported analytical uncertainty was 0 1 and 0 3 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the analysis sought to resolve the relationships between groundwater rainfall and surface waters on a cross plot of δ2h versus δ18o including adherence of groundwater and surface waters to the meteoric water line and the influence of evaporative enrichment this examination also explicitly traced the intensities of rainfall that generate groundwater recharge and surface waters as stable isotope ratios in rainfall within the tropics are strongly determined by site scale precipitation intensities through a process known as the amount effect jasechko and taylor 2015 jasechko 2019 due to differences in the upwind distillation of light versus heavy storm clouds low intensity rainfalls are relatively enriched in heavy isotopes 18o 2h whereas high intensity rainfalls are comparatively depleted in heavy isotopes comparisons of the amount weighted mean rainfall composition i e mean is normalised for rainfall amount with groundwater isotope compositions that record recharge generating rainfall can trace rainfall intensities that produce groundwater recharge jasechko and taylor 2015 goni et al 2021 4 results 4 1 hydrometric observations from 2006 2007 to 2016 2017 observations of daily rainfall stream stage and groundwater levels from the little kinyasungwe catchment over the period of 2006 2017 are presented in fig 5 groundwater recharge and observed lowland makutapora and upland zanka rainfall for each hydrological year are listed in table 1 evident from these time series data are considerable inter annual variations in rainfall and stream discharge observed as stream stage an association between el niño events 2006 2007 2009 2010 2015 2016 and hydrological years exhibiting greater stream discharge and positive deflections in groundwater levels indicative of groundwater recharge is observable and consistent with earlier analyses taylor et al 2013b relationships between groundwater recharge and a variety of parameters representing lowland makutapora and upland zanka rainfall as well as stream discharge of the river little kinyasungwe meya meya chihanga are shown in fig 6 the corelation between groundwater recharge and the duration of streamflow i e number of days when stream stage exceeds 0 1 m is stronger r 0 92 p 0

stream stage at 2 sites meya meya chihanga and daily wellfield pumpage from 1st to 16th february 2016 following the cessation of groundwater level decline in january 2016 groundwater levels in all 3 piezometers showed distinct rises beginning on 3rd and 6th february that coincided with rises in stream stage observed at both meya meya and chihanga on the 2nd and 3rd of february 2016 as well as at chihanga on 5th february and meya meya on 7th february on 2nd and 3rd february both rises in groundwater levels and stream discharge stage showed a stronger association with rainfall upstream of the wellfield on 1st and 2nd february at zanka 50 30 mm and meya meya 59 70 mm than that observed near the wellfield at makutapora 0 17 mm the brief decline in groundwater levels 0 15 to 0 20 m observed from 3rd to 6th february was likely influenced by an increase of 14 in wellfield pumpage from 2nd to 3rd february fig 7e subsequently on 6th and 7th february rises in groundwater levels and stream discharge observed at chihanga 5th to 6th feb and then meya meya 7th feb occurred in the absence of rainfall observed at makutapora and in response to rainfall observed on 6th february at zanka 36 mm and on 5th and 6th february at meya meya 90 78 mm peak stream discharge responses at meya meya less than 20 h after upland rainfall events have been observed previously fig 3 29 in shindo et al 1990 a series of pulses in stream stage exceeding 0 5 m at both meya meya and chihanga were observed from 8th to 15th february these showed an association with peaks in both upland and lowland rainfall and led to a sustained overall rise in groundwater levels of 0 5 m in all three monitoring wells an 18 decline in pumpage from 6th to 11th february was also expected to account for some of the noted rise in groundwater levels over this period nevertheless pumpage returned to a sustained rate in excess of 50 000 m3 per day on 16th february but groundwater levels did not revert to values observed prior to the reduction in pumpage fig 4 which is observed in the absence of groundwater recharge during the dry season see supplementary information c 4 2 2 groundwater recharge event ii 30th march to 8th

pumpage from 30th march to 8th april 2016 a rise in groundwater levels was initially observed on 31st march and in the absence of observed rainfall appeared to have been triggered by an 18 reduction in daily pumpage from 54 282 to 44 442 m3 within two days daily pumpage returned to roughly the rate prior to the reduction 54 385 m3 yet groundwater levels remained 10 15 cm higher than they were on 30th march and continued to rise a trend that continued until the end of april 2016 fig 4a similar to groundwater recharge event i groundwater level rises coincided with a series of pulses in stream discharge a rise in stream stage to 1 2 m at meya meya and marginally at chihanga corresponded to rainfall recorded on 1st april at zanka 27 mm rainfall recorded in the vicinity of the wellfield at makutapora upstream of the wellfield at zanka and itiso in the adjacent catchment on 2nd april corresponded to a peak in stream stage at meya meya of 0 7 m in the absence of rainfall recorded at makutapora substantial rises in stream stage exceeding 1 0 m were observed on 4th and 5th april at both meya meya and chihanga in response to daily rainfall recorded upstream of wellfield at zanka 59 mm on 4th april as well as the upland site at itiso on 4th 60 mm and 5th 78 mm april on 6th april rainfall events of 81 mm and 23 mm were recorded at makutapora and zanka respectfully and associated with a stream stage exceeding 1 5 m at meya meya and chihanga a stream stage exceeding 0 5 m was recorded at the downstream chihanga gauge catchment outlet until 13th april over this period 4th to 8th april wellfield pumpage remain steady σ 3 though slightly rising fig 8e 4 2 3 groundwater recharge event iii 1 st to 20th january 2018 fig 9 presents hourly groundwater levels at 1 piezometer 122 75 daily rainfall at 3 sites makutapora zanka meya meya hourly stream stage at 2 sites meya meya chihanga and daily wellfield pumpage from the 1st to 20th january 2018 the cessation of the annual dry season recession in groundwater level was observed on 3rd january and corresponded to the observation of stream discharge at meya meya and chihanga on the same day curiously rainfall was not observed on 3rd january but rainfall of 29 mm was recorded on 2nd january in the vicinity of the wellfield at makutapora and upstream of the wellfield at zanka a 21 decline in wellfield pumpage was observed from 2nd to 4th january and may explain in part the cessation of groundwater level decline the continued recession from 6th january in groundwater levels suggested that groundwater recharge over this period was minimal if it occurred at all a sharp rise in groundwater levels began on 15th january and was preceded by substantial rainfall upstream of the wellfield at zanka and meya meya starting on 11th january this included an extreme event of 120 mm recorded at zanka this extreme rainfall coincided with the generation of substantial streamflow indicated by stream stage observations exceeding 1 m at both meya meya and chihanga on 15th january although a 13 reduction in wellfield pumpage observed on 16th january could initially have contributed to the observed rise in groundwater level wellfield pumpage then began to increase slowly from 17th january while the observed groundwater level continued to rise 0 75 m until 9th february fig 4 4 3 tracing the origin of groundwater using

observations from hydrological years 2006 2007 to 2017 2018 stronger correlations exist between groundwater recharge and ephemeral streamflow than rainfall both the duration of observed streamflow i e number of days stream stage 10 cm and cumulative stream stage are better correlated to groundwater recharge than the number of rain events total rainfall and intensive 90th percentile monthly rainfall recorded proximate to the wellfield at makutapora and in the uplands at zanka fig 1 stronger and statistically significant linear correlation are observed between total and intensive upland rainfall at zanka and groundwater recharge compared to makutapora of further note is that the correlation between the duration of streamflow and groundwater recharge improved significantly by restricting the correlation to stream stage exceeding a threshold value i e 0 25 m at meya meya 0 77 m at chihanga this criterion is consistent with a proposed recharge pathway derived from the characterisation of the superficial geology in the little kinyasungwe catchment by electrical resistivity tomography ert zarate et al 2021 the identification of permeable pathways alongside ephemeral stream channels accessed by flood overbank discharges pathway c provided a clear rationale for comparing flood discharges exceeding a threshold to groundwater recharge derived from piezometric data the lower threshold for flood discharges at the upstream gauging station at meya meya i e stream stage of 0 25 m relative to the catchment outlet at chihanga i e stream stage of 0 77 m is consistent with the occurrence of flood discharges generating overbank flows downstream of the meya meya gauge fig 1 as exceedance of stream stage thresholds could conceivably denote the timing and magnitude of effective precipitation precipitation evapotranspiration correspondence among observed rainfall stream discharge and groundwater recharge events is discussed further below high frequency hourly observations of groundwater levels and stream stage from hydrological years 2015 2016 to 2017 2018 together with daily rainfall and wellfield pumpage show that sustained groundwater level rises indicative of groundwater recharge events correspond better to the timing and magnitude of rainfall observed in areas upstream of the wellfield and in association with observed pulses of stream discharge stable isotope ratios of o and h also suggest that groundwater in the wellfield is recharged by intensive 90th percentile daily rainfalls that have undergone slight evaporative enrichment in the heavy isotope 2h 18o similarities in the regressed isotopic compositions of groundwater and ephemeral surface waters in the little kinyasungwe catchment provide additional evidence to hydrometric observations of the contribution of focused groundwater recharge to the makutapora wellfield the presented analysis focuses on observations of stream stage at gauging stations on the river little kinyasungwe we recognise however that leakage can potentially occur along or adjacent to other ephemeral stream channels e g river madihi similar to shindo et al 1990 one of the authors taylor observed surface flows not represented in the mapped drainage of the river little kinyasungwe in fig 1 during groundwater recharge event ii on 4th april 2016 presented evidence linking focused groundwater recharge to ephemeral streamflow does not preclude the possibility of additional pathways recently identified from the characterisation of superficial geology around the makutapora wellfield from ert surveys including diffuse groundwater recharge zarate et al 2021 these include the contribution of diffuse recharge more widely within the catchment possibly aided in its transmission by extensions of fault and fracture networks simple water balance calculations see supplementary materials e show however that despite the variable and ephemeral nature of streamflow in the little kinyasungwe catchment the volumes of water transmitted episodically especially during el niño events have been of a magnitude that may be capable of sustaining both intensive groundwater abstraction recorded from the makutapora wellfield via focused recharge and discharges from the catchment outlet at chihanga these rough computations do not challenge the possibility of contributions from both diffuse recharge and even inter basin water transfers along fault systems to the makutapora wellfield but suggest that such dynamics are not intrinsically necessary the evidence of focused groundwater recharge to the makutapora wellfield in central semi arid tanzania is consistent with past research highlighting the importance of this groundwater recharge pathway in drylands alley 2009 scanlon et al 2006 that has recently been demonstrated more widely in tropical africa by cuthbert et al 2019 moreover the specific identification of ephemeral streams as a source of focused groundwater recharge is consistent with limited evidence from other semi arid regions acworth et al 2021 cuthbert et al 2016 goni et al 2021 simmers 2003 simmers et al 1997 the findings presented here also support the basic conceptual model proposed earlier by taylor et al 2013b whereby leakage from ephemeral streams as they flow over coarser grained soils along the basin floor contributes to groundwater recharge to the makutapora wellfield 5 2 implications from the local to the global the identification of focused groundwater recharge to the makutapora wellfield is of local pragmatic importance currently the wellfield is the sole source of the public piped water supply to dodoma the capital city of tanzania duwasa 2015 which is rapidly expanding the east african 2017 and was estimated to have had a population of more than 700 000 in early 2018 the citizen 2018 recognition of the contribution of ephemeral stream discharges in the little kinyasungwe catchment to the replenishment of the makutapora wellfield can inform requisite catchment wide wellhead protection measures to sustain the quality and quantity of pumped groundwater as well as inform potential strategies to enhance wellfield replenishment through managed aquifer recharge e g murray et al 2018 the evidence presented here and in a companion paper zarate et al 2021 in this volume provide a well documented case study to compare to other dryland environments in tropical africa more research is nevertheless required 1 to examine more fully additional groundwater recharge pathways to the makutapora wellfield 2 to test this conceptual and quantitative understanding of groundwater recharge with numerical models reconciled to improved monitoring data and 3 to better understand the hydrological conditions producing catchment runoff in the little kinyasungwe catchment driving focused groundwater recharge events on the latter the important contribution of heavy rainfall to the generation of focused groundwater recharge identified here points to the potential resilience of groundwater to climate change as the intensification of tropical rainfall under global warming leads to fewer but heavier rainfall events allan et al 2010 donat et al 2016 fischer and knutti 2016 the central finding of the importance of focused groundwater recharge derived from ephemeral streamflow in a dryland tanzania adds to a growing body of research globally acworth et al 2021 cuthbert et al 2019 2016 dahan et al 2008 nowreen et al 2020 villeneuve et al 2015 demonstrating the pervasiveness of focused groundwater recharge as focused groundwater recharge processes remain largely ignored in large scale hydrological models e g global hydrological models land surface models pessimistic projections of groundwater availability in drylands and the impacts of climate change jiménez cisneros et al 2014 can be misrepresentative the latest version of watergap 2 2d müller schmied et al 2021 the only large scale model to represent focused recharge simulates groundwater recharge from standing water bodies i e lakes reservoirs wetlands but not ephemeral streamflow numerical experiments and the development of codes to address this oversight are on going e g quichimbo et al 2020 2021 inclusion of focused groundwater recharge via ephemeral streamflow in large scale models presents a significant challenge yet one of increasing necessity as the spatial resolution of such models increases gleeson et al 2021 6 conclusions empirical evidence from hydrometric observations and stable isotope ratios of o and h in a dryland environment in central tanzania shows the importance of focused groundwater recharge in sustaining the sole perennial source of freshwater to its rapidly growing capital dodoma groundwater recharge estimated from piezometry is more strongly correlated with ephemeral streamflow than rainfall strongest associations are found between groundwater recharge and the duration of streamflow exceeding a threshold stream stage value this latter finding is consistent with permeable pathways in the superficial geology alongside ephemeral stream channels identified by surface geophysics in a companion study that are accessible by overbank flood discharges further the examination of individual groundwater recharge events using hourly observations of groundwater levels and stream stage with daily rainfall and wellfield pumpage shows that sustained groundwater level rises indicative of groundwater recharge correspond better to the timing and magnitude of rainfall observed in areas upstream of the wellfield remote from piezometry and in association with observed pulses of stream discharge finally stable isotope ratios of o and h in groundwater more closely match the composition of ephemeral streamflow in the little kinyasungwe catchment than average rainfall and regress to a value along the local meteoric water line that is consistent with the mean composition of intensive 90th percentile daily rainfall the combined hydrometric and isotopic evidence sheds new light on the contribution of focused groundwater recharge via ephemeral streamflow in a tropical dryland this new insight serves not only to inform strategies to protect and potentially augment the replenishment of the water supply to the rapidly growing dryland city of dodoma but also to evaluate how climate change may influence the renewability of groundwater resources in tropical drylands as precipitation intensities increase in a warming world and amplify flood discharges

livelihoods and poverty alleviation in tropical drylands yet the processes by which groundwater is replenished remain inadequately observed and resolved detailed observations are examined from central tanzania where the makutapora wellfield supplies freshwater to the rapidly growing capital city of dodoma new hydrological insights for the region the prominence of focused recharge from ephemeral stream discharges is shown from 1 groundwater recharge correlates more strongly with the seasonal duration of ephemeral stream stage exceeding a threshold than seasonal rainfall 2 hourly monitoring of groundwater levels and stream stage shows that sustained groundwater level rises indicative of groundwater recharge correspond better to observed pulses of stream discharge from intensive rainfall

these rates due to climate change and freshwater withdrawals understanding this balance and how it may change are predicated on knowledge of the mechanisms by which meteoric water replenishes aquifers as well as the conditions and pathways which generate groundwater recharge current understanding of groundwater recharge processes in semi arid areas is constrained by a lack of observational data recent continental to global scale analyses macdonald et al 2021 moeck et al 2020 mohan et al 2018 have highlighted broad associations between groundwater recharge and both climate and land cover

et al 2019 somaratne and smettem 2014 groundwater recharge can broadly be considered to derive from processes that are diffuse taking place throughout a landscape from the direct or near direct infiltration of precipitation or focused occurring from the leakage of ephemeral or perennial surface water at specific locations such as a drainage channel or depression within a landscape diffuse and focused recharge processes occur in most groundwater systems the prevalence of focused recharge is generally considered to increase with aridity alley 2009 cuthbert et al 2019 limited research has shown groundwater recharge in semi arid areas commonly occurs via leakage from ephemeral streams acworth et al 2021 cuthbert et al 2016 dahan et al 2008 villeneuve et al 2015 or ponds favreau et al

primarily diffuse nkotagu 1996a shindo et al 1989 with soil macropores transmitting the majority of infiltrating water through the unsaturated zone shindo et al 1989 more recently taylor et al 2013b hypothesised that focused recharge via leakage from ephemeral streams features centrally in highly episodic recharge events often associated with extreme seasonal rainfall during el niño events e g 1997 1998 this latter assertion has however remained untested by limitations in observational datasets here we seek to examine the processes by which heavy rainfall generates groundwater recharge this analysis examines 1 statistical relationships between groundwater recharge and both daily records of rainfall and ephemeral stream stage over hydrological years i e 1st october to 30th september from 2006 2007 to 2016 2017 2 temporal relationships between hourly observations of groundwater levels and stream stage together with daily rainfall from 2015 2016 to 2017 2018 and 3 associations among stable isotope ratios of o and h in rainfall surface waters and groundwater high frequency monitoring of groundwater levels and stream stage was initiated in advance of the 2015 2016 wet season as it

tanzania they are located at the southern end of the eastern branch of the east african rift system ears approximately 20 km north of tanzania s capital city dodoma fig 1 surface drainage occupies an area of 698 km2 upstream of the chihanga stream gauge the outlet of the river little kinyasungwe tectonic activity associated with the ears has strongly influenced the basin and surrounding areas linear drainage features including lakes rivers and swamps generally trend ne sw and nw se and reflect extensive tectonically induced faulting nkotagu 1996a major lineaments include the mlemu and kitope faults which follow a ne sw trend fig 1 the makutapora wellfield experiences a hot semi arid climate that is characterised by distinct wet and dry seasons and perennially high temperatures mean

to be 2120 mm lowland land cover is dominated by grassland and dwarf shrubs taylor et al 2013b whereas catchment uplands are mostly covered by thick shrubland and forest de pauw et al 1983 agriculture is restricted due to the importance of the wellfield a nearby military base and a soil preservation policy kangalawe 2009 there is consequently little evidence of substantial changes in land use taylor et al 2013b water bearing formations comprise the regolith and weathered and fractured crystalline bedrock of the dodoma system fawley 1955 shindo et al 1989 the crystalline basement comprises migmatite granite and disconnected fragments of older more basic basement rocks such as amphibolites schists and gneisses de pauw et al 1983 younger intrusions are also present in the form of basic and ultrabasic dykes in the seasonally inundated lowland depression in the vicinity of the wellfield the regolith is covered by a generally thick 10 m layer of mbuga clay a black clay like deposit fawley 1955 fig 3 this surface clay layer restricts diffuse recharge and promotes ponding of ephemeral stream discharges leading to transmission losses not only to the atmosphere but also conceivably to the subsurface as recharge through slow piston flow or preferential pathways such as vertical fractures zarate et al 2021 depths to groundwater in the wellfield in range from 25 to 35 m below ground level and are considered largely to reside below the mbuga clay though locally confining conditions can occur seddon 2019 further details of the layering and geometry of the superficial geology in this area are outlined by zarate et al 2021 regolith thickness varies between 50 m and 100 m fawley 1955 anomalously high transmissivities found in the makutapora wellfield are thought to result from enhanced weathering associated with the network of faults present in the saturated zone maurice et al 2019 taylor et al 2013b pumping tests indicate that transmissivities range from 400 to 4000 m2 d 1 maurice et al 2019 which are greater than typically observed in deeply weathered crystalline rock aquifer systems taylor and howard 2000 bianchi et al 2020 high yielding wells are proximate to major faults the wellfield currently comprises 24 production wells duwasa 2017 and is the sole source of the public piped water supply to dodoma the capital city of tanzania in 2016 the makutapora wellfield supplied water at an average rate of 50 000 m3 per day to dodoma groundwater abstraction from the wellfield has increased since the resources were first developed in the 1940s drainage

observations from 2006 2007 to 2017 2018 statistical relationships were examined between groundwater recharge derived from piezometry and hydrological observations compiled by the ministry of water and irrigation wami ruvu basin water board comprising 1 daily rainfall representing a local source of groundwater recharge in the vicinity of monitoring wells within the makutapora wellfield and 2 daily stream stage at meya meya drainage area 167 km2 and chihanga drainage area 698 km2 representing a potential source of focused groundwater recharge fig 1 gauging stations at meya meya upstream of the wellfield and chihanga downstream of the wellfield were established by shindo et al 1989 with daily records available since january 2006 fig 1 daily precipitation has been recorded at the makutapora meteorological station elevation 1081 m above mean sea level mamsl which is proximate to the wellfield in the lowland since january 2007 daily precipitation has also been collected at upland rain gauges meya meya 1121 mamsl and zanka 1159 mamsl since june 2008 and itiso 1103 mamsl since november 2007 fig 1 unlike the other 3 rain gauges itiso is situated 10 km outside of the catchment fig 1 groundwater levels have been monitored since 1954 at various locations throughout the wellfield fig 2 the strength of the statistical relationships between groundwater recharge and

suggested potential groundwater recharge pathways in association with overbank flood discharges that access permeable pathways through the regolith to enable rapid groundwater recharge zarate et al 2021 in the little kinyasungwe catchment a substantial proportion of the groundwater outflow is the result of groundwater abstraction hence values of groundwater recharge were derived from piezometric data by employing a modified water table fluctuation wtf method in which changes in groundwater levels through time are assumed to result from the balance between recharge and groundwater discharge

due to uncertainty in sy 3 2 high frequency hydrometric observations from 2015 2016 to 2017 2018 temporal relationships were examined between hourly observations of groundwater levels at three locations c5 89 75 122 75 the only monitoring wells for which data were available hourly stream stage at both meya meya and chihanga and daily rainfall observed in the vicinity of the monitoring wells in the lowland at makutapora and in upland locations remote from monitoring wells at zanka meya meya and itiso the purpose of these comparisons was to move beyond simple empirical associations section 3 1 and draw insight from high frequency observations into the hydrological dynamics that generate groundwater recharge the analysis focused on a series of three groundwater recharge events that are marked by distinct rises in groundwater levels fig 4 two events 1 st to 16th february and 30th march to 8th april occur during the 2015 2016 el niño event and one event 1 st to 20th january 2018 is from the 2017 2018 wet season comparisons with rainfall time series and stream stage sought to examine associations between localised rainfall as a potential source of diffuse groundwater recharge and remote upland rainfall generating ephemeral stream discharge as a potential source of focused recharge daily records of wellfield abstraction were also considered to evaluate the influence of pumping on observed piezometric responses automated hourly monitoring infrastructure for groundwater levels stream stage and barometric pressure was installed in november 2015 prior to the wet season associated with the 2015 2016 el niño event monitoring wells c5 89 75 and 122 75 were equipped with unvented insitu ruggedtroll 100 dataloggers and are located 110 m 200 m and 1430 m respectively from the drainage channel of the river little kinyasungwe details of well screen depths are not available but are expected to occur at depths of 30 m below ground or more within the base of the weathered granite and underlying fractured bedrock stream stage was also monitored by suspending insitu ruggedtroll 100 dataloggers inside a 2 inch perforated pvc piping screened with wire mesh and sealed at the top using a torque locking well plug supplementary information b allowing water to flow freely through the screened section and base at each established stream gauging stations on the river little kinyasungwe at meya meya and chihanga the datalogger was attached to an existing staff gauge and buried beneath the streambed groundwater level data were compensated for variations in atmospheric pressure using data collected on site fig 1 3 3 stable isotope ratios of o and h the origin of groundwater sampled from production wells in the makutapora wellfield was investigated using stable isotope ratios of o and h in precipitation groundwater and perennial and ephemeral surface water daily rainfall samples n 17 were collected at the makutapora meteorological station over 3 wet seasons 2015 2016 2017 2018 in accordance with iaea 2014 precipitation sampling guidelines for event based sampling using a buried sampler the analysis of stable isotope ratios of o 18o 16o and h 2h 1h was undertaken using a los gatos lgr100 water isotope analyser by elemtex limited callington uk supplementary data from the late 1980s and early 1990s for precipitation n 60 groundwater n 120 and perennial and ephemeral surface water n 17 were compiled from previously published studies nkotagu 1996b onodera et al 1995 shindo et al 1990 and the iaea twin database iaea wmo 2018 daily precipitation samples conducted through this research and from past studies were all collected at the makutapora meteorological station perennial surface water samples were taken from lake hombolo whereas ephemeral surface water samples were collected from river little kinyasungwe and river madihi the latter is just west of makutapora meteorological station shindo et al 1990 herein stable isotope ratios of o and h are described using delta notation δ18o and δ2h respectively in units of per mille where δ r s a m p l e r v s m o w 1 1000 and r is the ratio of 18o 16o or 2h 1h in vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow and the sample sample reported analytical uncertainty was 0 1 and 0 3 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the analysis sought to resolve the relationships between groundwater rainfall and surface waters on a cross plot of δ2h versus δ18o including adherence of groundwater and surface waters to the meteoric water line and the influence of evaporative enrichment this examination also explicitly traced the intensities of rainfall that generate groundwater recharge and surface waters as stable isotope ratios in rainfall within the tropics are strongly determined by site scale precipitation intensities through a process known as the amount effect jasechko and taylor 2015 jasechko 2019 due to differences in the upwind distillation of light versus heavy storm clouds low intensity rainfalls are relatively enriched in heavy isotopes 18o 2h whereas high intensity rainfalls are comparatively depleted in heavy isotopes comparisons of the amount weighted mean rainfall composition i e mean is normalised for rainfall amount with groundwater isotope compositions that record recharge generating rainfall can trace rainfall intensities that produce groundwater

chihanga on 5th february and meya meya on 7th february on 2nd and 3rd february both rises in groundwater levels and stream discharge stage showed a stronger association with rainfall upstream of the wellfield on 1st and 2nd february at zanka 50 30 mm and meya meya 59 70 mm than that observed near the wellfield at makutapora 0 17 mm the brief decline in groundwater levels 0 15 to 0 20 m observed from 3rd to 6th february was likely influenced by an increase of 14 in wellfield pumpage from 2nd to 3rd february fig 7e subsequently on 6th and 7th february rises in groundwater levels and stream discharge observed at chihanga 5th to 6th feb and then meya meya 7th feb occurred in the absence of rainfall observed at makutapora and in response to rainfall observed on 6th february at zanka 36 mm and on 5th and 6th february at meya meya 90 78 mm peak stream discharge responses at meya meya less than 20 h after upland rainfall events have been observed previously fig 3 29 in shindo et al 1990 a series of pulses in stream stage exceeding 0 5 m at both meya meya and chihanga were observed from 8th to 15th february these showed an association with peaks in both upland and lowland rainfall and led to a sustained overall rise in groundwater levels of 0 5 m in all three monitoring wells an 18 decline in pumpage from 6th to 11th february was also expected to account for some of the noted rise in groundwater levels over this period nevertheless pumpage returned to a sustained rate in excess of 50 000 m3 per day on 16th february but groundwater levels did not revert to values observed prior to the reduction in pumpage fig 4 which is observed in the absence of groundwater recharge during the dry season see supplementary information c 4 2 2 groundwater recharge event ii 30th march to 8th

pumpage from 30th march to 8th april 2016 a rise in groundwater levels was initially observed on 31st march and in the absence of observed rainfall appeared to have been triggered by an 18 reduction in daily pumpage from 54 282 to 44 442 m3 within two days daily pumpage returned to roughly the rate prior to the reduction 54 385 m3 yet groundwater levels remained 10 15 cm higher than they were on 30th march and continued to rise a trend that continued until the end of april 2016 fig 4a similar to groundwater recharge event i groundwater level rises coincided with a series of pulses in stream discharge a rise in stream stage to 1 2 m at meya meya and marginally at chihanga corresponded to rainfall recorded on 1st april at zanka 27 mm rainfall recorded in the vicinity of the wellfield at makutapora upstream of the wellfield at zanka and itiso in the adjacent catchment on 2nd april corresponded to a peak in stream stage at meya meya of 0 7 m in the absence of rainfall recorded at makutapora substantial rises in stream stage exceeding 1 0 m were observed on 4th and 5th april at both meya meya and chihanga in response to daily rainfall recorded upstream of wellfield at zanka 59 mm on 4th april as well as the upland site at itiso on 4th 60 mm and 5th 78 mm april on 6th april rainfall events of 81 mm and 23 mm were recorded at makutapora and zanka respectfully and associated with a stream stage exceeding 1 5 m at meya meya and chihanga a stream stage exceeding 0 5 m was recorded at the downstream chihanga gauge catchment outlet until 13th april over this period 4th to 8th

daily rainfall at 3 sites makutapora zanka meya meya hourly stream stage at 2 sites meya meya chihanga and daily wellfield pumpage from the 1st to 20th january 2018 the cessation of the annual dry season recession in groundwater level was observed on 3rd january and corresponded to the observation of stream discharge at meya meya and chihanga on the same day curiously rainfall was not observed on 3rd january but rainfall of 29 mm was recorded on 2nd january in the vicinity of the wellfield at makutapora and upstream of the wellfield at zanka a 21 decline in wellfield pumpage was observed from 2nd to 4th january and may explain in part the cessation of groundwater level decline the continued recession from 6th january in groundwater levels suggested that groundwater recharge over this period was minimal if it occurred at all a sharp rise in groundwater levels began on 15th january and was preceded by substantial rainfall upstream of the wellfield at zanka and meya meya starting on 11th january this included an extreme event of 120 mm recorded at zanka this extreme rainfall coincided with the generation of substantial streamflow indicated by stream stage observations exceeding 1 m at both meya meya and chihanga on 15th january although a 13 reduction in wellfield pumpage observed on 16th january could initially have contributed to the observed rise in groundwater level wellfield pumpage then began to increase slowly from 17th january while the observed groundwater level continued to rise 0 75 m until 9th february fig 4 4 3 tracing the origin of groundwater using

observations from hydrological years 2006 2007 to 2017 2018 stronger correlations exist between groundwater recharge and ephemeral streamflow than rainfall both the duration of observed streamflow i e number of days stream stage 10 cm and cumulative stream stage are better correlated to groundwater recharge than the number of rain events total rainfall and intensive 90th percentile monthly rainfall recorded proximate to the wellfield at makutapora and in the uplands at zanka fig 1 stronger and statistically significant linear correlation are observed between total and intensive upland rainfall at zanka and groundwater recharge compared to makutapora of further note is that the correlation between the duration of streamflow and groundwater recharge improved significantly by restricting the correlation to stream stage exceeding a threshold value i e 0 25 m at meya meya 0 77 m at chihanga this criterion is consistent with a proposed recharge pathway derived from the characterisation of the superficial geology in the little kinyasungwe catchment by electrical resistivity tomography ert zarate et al 2021 the identification of permeable pathways alongside ephemeral stream channels accessed by flood overbank discharges pathway c provided a clear rationale for comparing flood discharges exceeding a threshold to groundwater recharge derived from piezometric data the lower threshold for flood discharges at the upstream gauging station at meya meya i e stream stage of 0 25 m relative to the catchment outlet at chihanga i e stream stage of 0 77 m is consistent with the occurrence of flood discharges generating overbank flows downstream of the meya meya gauge fig 1 as exceedance of stream stage thresholds could conceivably denote the timing and magnitude of effective precipitation precipitation evapotranspiration correspondence among observed rainfall stream discharge and groundwater recharge events is discussed further below high frequency hourly observations of groundwater levels and stream stage from hydrological years 2015 2016 to 2017 2018 together with daily rainfall and wellfield pumpage show that sustained groundwater level rises indicative of groundwater recharge events correspond better to the timing and magnitude of rainfall observed in areas upstream of the wellfield and in association with observed pulses of stream discharge stable isotope ratios of o and h also suggest that groundwater in the wellfield is recharged by intensive 90th percentile daily rainfalls that have undergone slight evaporative enrichment in the heavy isotope 2h 18o similarities in the regressed isotopic compositions of groundwater and ephemeral surface waters in the little kinyasungwe catchment provide additional evidence to hydrometric observations of the contribution of focused groundwater recharge to the makutapora wellfield the presented analysis focuses on observations of stream stage at gauging stations on the river little kinyasungwe we recognise however that leakage can potentially occur along or adjacent to other ephemeral stream channels e g river madihi similar to shindo et al 1990 one of the authors taylor observed surface flows not represented in the mapped drainage of the river little kinyasungwe in fig 1 during groundwater recharge event ii on 4th april 2016 presented evidence linking focused groundwater recharge to ephemeral streamflow does not preclude the possibility of additional pathways recently identified from the characterisation of superficial geology around the makutapora wellfield from ert surveys including diffuse groundwater recharge zarate et al 2021 these include the contribution of diffuse recharge more widely within the catchment possibly aided in its transmission by extensions of fault and fracture networks simple water balance calculations see supplementary materials e show however that despite the variable and ephemeral nature of streamflow in the little kinyasungwe catchment the volumes of water transmitted episodically especially during el niño events have been of a magnitude that may be capable of sustaining both intensive groundwater abstraction recorded from the makutapora wellfield via focused recharge and discharges from the catchment outlet at chihanga these rough computations do not challenge the possibility of contributions from both diffuse recharge and even inter basin water transfers along fault systems to the makutapora wellfield but suggest that such dynamics are not intrinsically necessary the evidence of focused groundwater recharge to the makutapora wellfield in central semi arid tanzania is consistent with past research highlighting the importance of this groundwater recharge pathway in drylands alley 2009 scanlon et al 2006 that has recently been demonstrated more widely in tropical africa by cuthbert et al 2019 moreover the specific identification of ephemeral streams as a source of focused groundwater recharge is consistent with limited evidence from other semi arid regions acworth et al 2021 cuthbert et al 2016 goni et al 2021 simmers 2003 simmers et al 1997 the findings presented here also support the basic conceptual model proposed earlier by taylor et al 2013b whereby leakage from ephemeral streams as they flow over coarser grained soils along the basin floor contributes to groundwater recharge to the makutapora wellfield 5 2 implications from the local to the global the identification of focused groundwater recharge to the makutapora wellfield is of local pragmatic importance currently the wellfield is the sole source of the public piped water supply to dodoma the capital city of tanzania duwasa 2015 which is rapidly expanding the east african 2017 and was estimated to have had a population of more than 700 000 in early 2018 the citizen 2018 recognition of the contribution of ephemeral stream discharges in the little kinyasungwe catchment to the replenishment of the makutapora wellfield can inform requisite catchment wide wellhead protection measures to sustain the quality and quantity of pumped groundwater as well as inform potential strategies to enhance wellfield replenishment through managed aquifer recharge e g murray et al 2018 the evidence presented here and in a companion paper zarate et al 2021 in this volume provide a well documented case study to compare to other dryland environments in tropical africa more research is nevertheless required 1 to examine more fully additional groundwater recharge pathways to the makutapora wellfield 2 to test this conceptual and quantitative understanding of groundwater recharge with numerical models reconciled to improved monitoring data and 3 to better understand the hydrological conditions producing catchment runoff in the little kinyasungwe catchment driving focused groundwater recharge events on the latter the important contribution of heavy rainfall to the generation of focused groundwater recharge identified here points to the potential resilience of groundwater to climate change as the intensification of tropical rainfall under global warming leads to fewer but heavier rainfall events allan et al 2010 donat et al 2016 fischer and knutti 2016 the central finding of the importance of focused groundwater recharge derived from ephemeral streamflow in a dryland tanzania adds to a growing body of research globally acworth et al 2021 cuthbert et al 2019 2016 dahan et al 2008 nowreen et al 2020 villeneuve et al 2015 demonstrating the pervasiveness of focused groundwater recharge as focused groundwater recharge processes remain largely ignored in large scale hydrological models e g global hydrological models land surface models pessimistic projections of groundwater availability in drylands and the impacts of climate change jiménez cisneros et al 2014 can be misrepresentative the latest version of watergap 2 2d müller schmied et al 2021 the only large scale model to represent focused recharge simulates groundwater recharge from standing water bodies i e lakes reservoirs wetlands but not ephemeral streamflow numerical experiments and the development of codes to address this oversight are on going e g quichimbo et al 2020 2021 inclusion of focused groundwater recharge via ephemeral streamflow in large scale models presents a significant challenge yet one of increasing necessity as the spatial resolution of such models increases gleeson et al 2021 6 conclusions empirical evidence from hydrometric observations and stable isotope ratios of o and h in a dryland environment in central tanzania shows the importance of focused groundwater recharge in sustaining the sole perennial source of freshwater to its rapidly growing capital dodoma groundwater recharge estimated from piezometry is more strongly correlated with ephemeral streamflow than rainfall strongest associations are found between groundwater recharge and the duration of streamflow exceeding a threshold stream stage value this latter finding is consistent with permeable pathways in the superficial geology alongside ephemeral stream channels identified by surface geophysics in a companion study that are accessible by overbank flood discharges further the examination of individual groundwater recharge events using hourly observations of groundwater levels and stream stage with daily rainfall and wellfield pumpage shows that sustained groundwater level rises indicative of groundwater recharge correspond better to the timing and magnitude of rainfall observed in areas upstream of the wellfield remote from piezometry and in association with observed pulses of stream discharge finally stable isotope ratios of o and h in groundwater more closely match the composition of ephemeral streamflow in the little kinyasungwe catchment than average rainfall and regress to a value along the local meteoric water line that is consistent with the mean composition of intensive 90th percentile daily rainfall the combined hydrometric and isotopic evidence sheds new light on the contribution of focused groundwater recharge via ephemeral streamflow in a tropical dryland this new insight serves not only to inform strategies to protect and potentially augment the replenishment of the water supply to the rapidly growing dryland city of dodoma but also to evaluate how climate change may influence the renewability of groundwater resources in tropical drylands as precipitation intensities increase in a warming world and amplify flood discharges

8156,study region the catchment above bengbu in the huaihe river basin china study focus in the anthropocene hydrological drought is significantly affected by human activities and the degree of different human activities affecting droughts may vary in different physiographic and anthropogenic contexts this study aims to quantify the relative contributions of various human activities on hydrological droughts using scenario comparison method based on a calibrated pcr globwb model new hydrological insights for the region the impacts on hydrological droughts by human activities exhibit large differences over time and space in terms of time non irrigation water use nwu and irrigation water use iwu increased standardized drought streamflow deficit sdsd by about 119 and 214 on average during 1981 2010 respectively in terms of space nwu heavily increased sdsd in most regions of the basin whereas reduced it in the regions with limited surface water due to the return flow from unconsumed water to surface water iwu reduced sdsd in paddy irrigation regions due to large quantities of water in the upstream rivers were transferred to those regions for flooding irrigation whereas in non paddy irrigation regions iwu increased sdsd due to most of water being withdrawn locally and comparatively small quantity of water transfer reservoir operation ro reduced sdsd in downstream water receiving areas while increased sdsd in upstream areas our findings can help drought management and mitigation keywords hydrological drought pcr globwb 2 0 model human activitie scenario comparison huaihe river basin 1 introduction droughts produce intense socio economic impacts all over the world in areas with strong human activities characteristics human beings are no longer only affected but they also actively influence and alter the development of hydrological drought van loon et al 2016 globally drought intensity is generally exacerbated by human activities wada et al 2013 wanders and wada 2015 in this era of intensive human activities revealing the differentiated impacts of human activities on drought has become a research focus of socio hydrological researchers droughts are usually divided into hydrological meteorological agricultural and socio economic drought on the basis of its drivers and impacts mishra and singh 2010 among the different types of droughts hydrological drought is characterized by negative anomalies of surface or subsurface water sources usually discharge the generation and development of hydrological drought are not only restricted by climate factors but also affected by human activities van loon et al 2016 firoz et al 2018 wang et al 2021 previous studies have shown that catchment properties yang et al 2017 climate change van loon et al 2014 reservoir operation wu et al 2017 2018 human water use wada et al 2013 land use land cover change li et al 2019 abubaker et al 2020 and other human activities van loon et al 2016 have notable impacts on the formation and development of hydrological drought among these factors the reservoir operation and human water use affects hydrological droughts most directly because they change the hydrological process and reduce water availability under reservoir regulation the relationship between rainfall and runoff is changed which affects the frequency intensity and duration of hydrological drought van oel et al 2018 wu et al 2017 2018 for example wu et al 2017 showed that reservoir operation changes the relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought similarly he et al 2017 and yang et al 2020 and jiao et al 2020 found that reservoir operation has alleviated hydrological drought during the drought periods in california and yangtze river respectively human water use mainly can be categorized into non irrigation and irrigation water use and non irrigation water use mainly includes industrial domestic and livestock water use wada et al 2013 showed that the global drought intensities are heavily increased by 10 500 due to human water consumption in the past few decades moreover increased water use will further increase hydrological drought due to rapid economic development in the future wanders and wada 2015 although previous studies have revealed the great impact of human activities on hydrological drought these studies either focused on the joint effects of all human activities e g jiang et al 2019 or focused on the impacts of an individual human activity such as reservoir operation human water use or land use change e g wu et al 2017 and the spatial temporal effect of the impacts by different human activities on hydrological droughts is not very clear the key of analyzing how human activities affect drought characteristics and development is to quantitatively separate the natural factors and human activities in the formation and development of drought to do so several comparative analysis approaches have been proposed in recent years first the paired catchments comparison method which selects two watersheds with similar characteristics e g climatic properties catchment area and topographical properties except for special human regulations for comparison van loon et al 2019 however it is difficult to find such two catchments second the upstream downstream comparison method which compares droughts of upstream and downstream based on observation data van loon et al 2019 there is some uncertainty that caused by the possible nonlinear relationship of different gauging stations third pre post disturbance comparison method which compares droughts before and after a significant human intervention occurred based on streamflow observations liu et al 2016 however it is difficult to separate the no stationarity caused by climate change and by human interventions peñas et al 2016 fourth simulated observed comparison method which compares the simulated drought characteristics without human activities regarded as natural hydrological process with the observed data affected by human activities e g wu et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 abubaker et al 2020 wang et al 2020 there is a similarity in the pre post disturbance method and the simulated observed method in the sense that they both compare a human influence situation with a natural situation the simulated observed comparison method differs from the pre post disturbance comparison method in that the former take the whole observed period as the period affected by human activities whereas the latter split the whole observed period into two parts i e a period little human intervention and a period with significant human intervention a major problem with the simulated observed comparison method lies in that it reflects the cumulative impact of all human activities on the drought without differentiating individual effects of different human activities e g jiang et al 2019 finally the scenario comparison method which separates the effects of different human activities on hydrological process through hydrological modelling under a natural scenario and human intervention scenarios with different types of human activities for comparison the scenario comparison method is often conducted based on large scale models and can effectively separate different types of human activities wada et al 2013 wanders and wada 2015 he et al 2017 yang et al 2020 jiao et al 2020 long et al 2020 however these large scale models have coarse spatial resolutions and are often not validated or calibrated locally van loon et al 2019 the scenario comparison method was used in this study to assess the relative impacts of different types of human activities on drought characteristics because it can effectively simulate the effects of different human activities especially various types of water use and reservoir operation at present many hydrological models more or less consider the impact of human activities on the hydrological process but take rainfall runoff simulation as the core and make a conceptualized disposal of human activities such as the soil water and assessment tool swat and variable infiltration capacity vic model in addition many hydrological models consider all aspects of human water resources management such as aquatool ribasim wargi sim weap and pcr globwb model among those models the pcr globwb pcraster global water balance model is an advanced grid based global hydrology and water resources model developed at utrecht university van beek et al 2011 wada et al 2014 de graaf et al 2014 sutanudjaja et al 2018 the latest pcr globwb 2 0 fully integrates water use and reservoir operation into rainfall runoff process modelling and can systematically consider the direct impact of different human activities it has a high spatial resolution 5 5 acrmin and have been used on global and regional scales successfully e g sutanudjaja et al 2018 de graaf et al 2019 yang et al 2020 jiao et al 2020 therefore this study attempts to separate and quantify the different impacts mitigation or exacerbation of various human activities on hydrological drought by using the method of scenario comparison based on the pcr globwb 2 0 model the catchment above bengbu in the huaihe river basin which is located in east china was chosen as a study area where the hydrological process is strongly influenced by various types of human activities 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the catchment above bengbu in the huaihe river basin 111 56 117 31 e 30 57 34 57 n fig 1 has a drainage area of about 121 300 km2 it spans henan anhui and hubei provinces with the yellow river flow along the north border of the basin it is located in the transition area from north subtropical to warm temperate zone dominated by a continental monsoon climate huaihe river has many tributaries such as hongru river pi river and shaying river fig 1 shows four hydrological stations bengbu lutaizi huaibing and xixian along the mainstream and three hydrological stations bantai hengpaitou and zhoukou along the tributaries there are many reservoirs along the mainstream and tributaries among which 23 large and medium sized reservoirs shown in fig 1 are considered according to the global reservoir and dams dataset lehner et al 2011 the study basin is an important cereal producing area in china and has many large scale agricultural irrigation areas cropland accounts for about 75 of the total area of the basin and main crops grown in the henan province are non paddy crops e g wheat whereas paddy rice is the major crop in the anhui province additionally the study basin has the highest population density in china about 662 people km2 since 1949 the region was frequently struck by severe droughts in the past such as the 2008 2009 autumn winter drought 2 2 datasets the global datasets of pcr globwb 2 0 model during the period of 1979 2010 were obtained from

in this study the scenario comparison method for quantifying the impact of different human activities on hydrological drought characteristics consists of four major steps 1 cmfd meteorological data and global parameter datasets of pcr globwb 2 0 model were used to build pcr globwb 2 0 model with a 5 arcmin spatial resolution over the catchment during the period of 1979 2010 the constructed pcr globwb 2 0 model was calibrated and validated using datasets of observed monthly discharge and census based yearly water withdrawal and water consumption 2 the pcr globwb 2 0 model was used to simulate the spatial temporal variation of discharge under different human activity scenarios 3 the variable threshold method was used to identify hydrological drought characteristics under different simulated scenarios the threshold was determined based on the simulated monthly average discharge under the natural scenario s0 4 the hydrological drought characteristics of different human activity scenarios were compared to those of natural scenario s0 for quantifying the impacts of different human activities on hydrological drought characteristics 3 1 pcr globwb 2 0 model pcr globwb 2 0 model dynamically calculates the water storage in two vertically cumulated soil layers as well as an underlying groundwater layer at each grid unit and daily time step the model also simulates the water balance between the atmosphere and the top soil layer snow melt evapotranspiration and precipitation and between soil layers capillary rise percolation and infiltration wada et al 2014 moreover snow

irrigation water use and reservoir operation into the model and solves the process of water withdrawal consumption and return flow of human water management in this study water withdrawal is equal to all gross water demand and taken from surface water and groundwater more details of the structure and configuration of pcr globwb 2 0 model can refer to sutanudjaja et al 2018 in pcr globwb 2 0 model non irrigation water use covers three sectors domestic industry and livestock water use for each of non irrigation water use the water demand of non irrigation is estimated at a daily time step and are prescribed to the pcr globwb 2 0 model wada et al 2014 industrial water demand is estimated by multiplying water use intensities with the reference gridded water demand in 2000 wada et al 2016 domestic water demand is estimated by multiplying domestic water withdrawal of country per capita with number of persons in each grid cell wada et al 2014 livestock water demand is estimated by multiplying daily drinking water requirements of livestock with number of livestock in each grid unit in the irrigation scheme for irrigation water use simulation rice and non rice crops are parameterized separately in pcr globwb 2 0 model and the feedback between irrigation water and corresponding changes in surface water and soil water is considered and is dynamically linked with water balance of soil water storage surface water and evapotranspiration over irrigated areas the irrigation water demand is calculated based on the irrigated area per grid and the crop composition

fractions of non rice and rice irrigation and monthly crop composition maintains unchanged reservoir operation in pcr globwb model is carried out by considering the functions of water supply for human water use flood control hydropower navigation and others reservoir operation is dynamically linked with the routing scheme to meet the water demand of local and downstream van beek et al 2011 pcr globwb 2 0 model incorporates about 7000 reservoirs with storage capacity larger than 0 1 km3 many smaller reservoirs are also added if data are available globally and are gradually incorporated into the model according to their constructed years based on the global reservoir and dam database grand lehner et al 2011 this database includes 23 large and medium scale reservoirs in our study area fig

lower soil store parameters root fractions per soil layer topographical parameters arno scheme exponents parameters related to phenology ratio of cell maximum minimum soil storage groundwater parameters and human water management parameters e g non irrigation water demand and lakes and reservoir sutanudjaja et al 2018 these parameters were calibrated by sutanudjaja et al 2018 for global application when applying these global parameters to the basin of our study the meteorological forcing data soil parameters groundwater parameters and human water use parameters of pcr globwb model global datasets were adjusted first we replaced cru ts 3 2 dataset with cmfd he et al 2020 as the meteorological forcing data of the pcr globwb 2 0 model second according to the method of calibrating pcr globwb model proposed by sutanudjaja et al 2014 and lópez lópez et al 2017 other parameters i e soil parameters groundwater parameters and human water use parameters were adjusted by multiplying each grid with a spatially uniform pre factor table 1 instead of adjusting actual parameter values these adjusted parameters can be divided into two categories the first category of parameters is gross and net human water demand data e g industry domestic and livestock water demand these yearly water demand data were calibrated by using spatially uniform pre factors based on the observed yearly water demand data table 1 other categories baseflow recession coefficient soil saturated hydraulic conductivities and minimum soil water capacity were calibrated by using step wise calibration approach based on spatially uniform pre factors table 1 the remaining global parameters of pcr globwb 2 0 model were kept fixed in this study the observed monthly discharge at 7 hydrological stations fig 1 and yearly water consumption and water withdrawal of the study basin were used for calibrating and validating the pcr globwb 2 0 model the simulation series from 1979 to 2010 was divided into three segments data of the first two years 1979 1980 was used for spinning up the model to reach a dynamically stable state the data of 1981 1995 were used for calibration and the remaining data of 1996 2010 were used for validation the spin up period was not included in the subsequent analysis to evaluate the performance of discharge simulation correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse and relative bias error rbe are employed in addition to evaluate the performance of water consumption and water withdrawal simulation root mean square error rmse besides r and rbe is adopted these statistical metrics can be calculated as follows 1 r t 1 t x t x y t y t 1 t x t x 2 t 1 t y t y 2 2 n s e 1 t 1 t x t y t 2 t 1 t x t y 2 3 r b e t 1 t x t y t t 1 t y t

types of human activities i e non irrigation water use irrigation water use and reservoir operation are considered human water use denotes the water demands for industry domestic livestock and irrigation which are converted to actual withdrawals from surface water i e reservoirs lakes rivers and groundwater and water consumption and return flows are also calculated for each sector for non irrigation water use withdrawn water is used for domestic and livestock water supply or industrial production the return flow of non irrigation water use is added to the surface water for irrigation water use withdrawn water is used for paddy and non paddy irrigation some part of irrigation water is consumed by transpiration and evaporation and the rest part of irrigation water infiltrates to the groundwater as the return flow in addition reservoir operation is considered into the model indicating that the discharge can be regulated by reservoir operation for the purposes of water supply to meet water demand flood control hydropower navigation and others van beek et al 2011 to separate the effects of different human activities on hydrological drought we set five scenarios table 2 i e s0 s4 with the same model forcing and boundary conditions but different human activities to perform scenario comparison with the calibrated pcr globwb model we simulated different human activity scenarios by adjusting the model input data for s0 we did not consider any human activity that is did not use any human activity parameters i e irrigation area non irrigation water demand and reservoir operation to run the model for s1 we only used industry domestic and livestock water demand to force and run model for s2 we only used irrigation parameter to force and run model for s3 we used irrigation parameters and non irrigation parameters industrial domestic and livestock water demand to drive the model for s4 we used all human activity parameters i e irrigation area non irrigation water demand and reservoir operation to drive the model note that non irrigation water use is not considered in s0 and s3 indicating that no water withdrawal and water consumption in surface and ground for industrial production domestic and livestock water supply and no irrigation water use in s0 and s1 indicating that all crops in irrigation regions are rain fed and evapotranspiration is calculated according to natural vegetation land cover types bosmans et al 2017 and no reservoir operation in s0 s1 s2 and s3 indicating that all reservoirs are considered as lakes and have no function of regulating discharge note that s0 is a naturalized scenario and s4 is an actual scenario s0 was taken as the baseline scenario for assessing the characteristics of hydrological droughts under different human activity scenarios the characteristics of hydrological droughts of s1 s2 s3 and s4 scenarios were compared to those of s0 respectively to estimate their percentage impacts on hydrological droughts the effects of different human activities under different scenarios are measured using the following measures 5 i w u h d s j h d s 0 h d s 0 100 j 1 2 3 6 i ro h d s 4 h d s 3 h d s 0 100 here i wu wu denotes nwu iwu or awu is the percentage impacts of different water use wu type i e non irrigation water use nwu irrigation water use iwu and all type water use awu on hydrological drought characteristics respectively hd with different subscripts represents hydrological drought characteristics defined in section 3 4 under different simulation scenarios in addition i ro is the percentage impact of reservoir operation ro on hydrological drought equal to the difference of the impact under s4 minus the impact under s3 3 4 calculation of hydrological drought characteristics the variable threshold method vtm is used to extract drought characteristics from simulated monthly discharge a discharge threshold with a probability of exceedance between 70 90 is commonly used in previous studies e g van loon and van lanen 2012 wada et al 2013 to consider the seasonal variation of streamflow the monthly average discharge with the exceedance probability of 80 q80 was selected as the threshold level based on the simulated monthly average discharge under s0 scenario in this study the drought state at a gauging station or a grid cell n in a given month t can be judged by a binary variable s t n given by 7 s t n 1 q t n q 80 t n 0 q t n q 80 t n where q 80 t n is the drought threshold of month t representing the monthly discharge being exceeded or equalled 80 of the time q t n is the monthly discharge the value 1 of s t n indicates a state of drought and 0 indicates no drought the standardized drought streamflow deficit denoted by sdsd t n in a specific month t at location n can be calculated by 8 s d s d t n max q 80 t n q t n 0 q 80 t n the total drought streamflow deficit denoted by tdsd i for each drought event i is the total deviation from the threshold during the drought which can be calculated by 9 t d s d i t s i e i max q 80 t n q t n 0 where si and ei are the start and end time of each drought event i respectively furthermore the percentage of drought area over the whole region denoted by pda t at a month t can be defined by 10 p d a t n 1 n s t n n where n is total number of grid cells pda ranges between 0 and 1 with 0 represents that no grid cells are in drought and 1 represents that all the area is in drought 4 results 4 1 evaluation of model simulation the performances of monthly discharge simulations during calibration period 1981 1995 and validation period 1996 2010 at 7 gauging sites are presented in 7 plots of fig 2 which show that the observed and simulated discharge agree well for four stations along the mainstream the values of r in calibration and validation period ranged between 0 90 0 93 and 0 89 0 93 nse ranged between 0 80 0 87 and 0 80 0 83 and rbe ranged between 10 43 8 72 and 6 33 7 49 respectively for three stations in tributaries the values of r in calibration and validation period ranged between 0 86 0 93 and 0 86 0 89 nse ranged between 0 72 0 83 and 0 71 0 76 and rbe ranged between 8 07 22 15 and 1 27 12 09 respectively comparing the simulation performance of the mainstream with that of the tributary indicates that the simulation accuracy of large rivers is better than small rivers which is in line with the study of he et al 2017 overall nse varies from 0 71 to 0 87 and the absolute values of rbe range between 1 27 22 15 which indicate that the calibrated pcr globwb 2 0 model can well simulate the hydrological process of our study basin due to data availability water withdrawal and water consumption simulation were evaluated at yearly time scale from 1999 to 2010 see section 2 2 fig 3 shows scatter plots of the simulated versus census data of yearly water withdrawal and water consumption during 1999 2010 the result shows that simulated water withdrawal and water consumption match closely with the census data in addition the performance of water withdrawal and water consumption simulation during 1999 2010 are summarized in fig 4 the median value of r of water withdrawal and water consumption simulation were 0 71 and 0 12 respectively fig 4 a the median value of rmse of water withdrawal and water consumption simulation were 3 95 and 4 11 mm yr respectively fig 4 b the median value of rbe of water withdrawal and water consumption simulation were 1 63 and 1 07 respectively fig 4 c these results demonstrate that the calibrated model can generally capture the magnitude of water consumption and withdrawal although the trend simulations of water withdrawal and water consumption contain some uncertainties 4 2 comparison of simulated drought streamflow deficits with the observed deficits the scenarios s0 and s4 table 2 were selected as examples to compare the simulated total drought streamflow deficit tdsd during the number of months of a specific drought event with observed tdsd respectively in fig 5 the simulated tdsds were calculated based on simulated monthly discharge in scenarios s0 and s4 respectively while the observed tdsds were calculated based on the observed monthly streamflow at 7 hydrological stations comparison of the simulated tdsd per drought event of s4 with the observed tdsd at 7 hydrological stations exhibits good consistency which indicates that the calibrated pcr globwb model can generally reproduce tdsds under the low flow conditions in the study basin for s0 the simulated tdsds were less than those of the observed scatter plots are distributed below the 1 1 line however simulated tdsds under s4 heavily increased comparing to those under s0 scatter points were basically distributed on the 1 1 line this also indicates that the tdsd was significantly increased by human activities in addition it is worth noting that the distribution of scatter points gets less scattered with the increase of the tdsd which may be due to monthly threshold was used to identify hydrological drought which could cause some errors in estimating short drought events beyene et al 2014 4 3 temporal variation of impacts of different human activities on hydrological drought fig 6 compares the annual percentage of drought area pda and standardized drought streamflow deficit sdsd under different human activity scenarios s0 s1 s2 s3 and s4 over the entire basin during the period 1981 2010 pda and sdsd present similar pattern of temporal variation taking the pda larger than 0 2 and the sdsd larger than 200 as the criteria two dashed lines in fig 6 for quantifying the hydrological wetness we can identify seven severe multi year dry periods i e 1981 1982 1986 1988 1992 1995 1997 1999 2002 and 2008 2009 the detected dry periods are in line with most of the major droughts in the huaihe river basin reported by chen et al 2013 notably pda fig 6 a and sdsd fig 6 b under scenarios that considering human activities i e s1 s2 s3 and s4 are always larger than those under scenario s0 which indicates that hydrological droughts were significantly intensified by human activities especially human water use the impacts of nwu iwu awu and ro on annual sdsd and pda over the entire basin from 1981 to 2010 are illustrated in fig 7 it is shown that in general nwu increased sdsd and pda by about 119 and 72 on average during 1981 2010 fig 7 a whereas iwu increased sdsd and pda by about 214 and 110 on average fig 7 b that is the impact of iwu is bigger than nwu in magnitude which is in agreement with fig 6 indicating that the sdsd and pda under s2 were larger than those under s1 in addition with the combined effects of nwu and iwu sdsd and pda increased by about 310 and 148 on average from 1981 to 2010 fig 7 c in comparison with the effects of water use the impacts of reservoir operation on the drought were minor from the perspective of the entire basin fig 7 d while water uses always worsen droughts ro may aggravate or reduce sdsds over time depending on the function of reservoir operation such as water supply flood defense power generation or others 4 4 spatial impacts of different human activities on hydrological droughts fig 8 shows the spatial impacts of nwu iwu awu and ro on average sdsd on grid basis over the region during the period 1981 2010 significant spatial variability of the impacts of human activities on sdsd across the basin can be inspected in fig 8 in most regions of the study basin human water use iwu nwu and awu increased sdsd by more than 20 and even increased up to about five times in some regions fig 8 a c meanwhile human water use reduced drought impacts in small parts of basin these results indicate that the effects of human water use on sdsd are mixed over space in addition comparing effects of different types of water use on drought it can be found that the impact of iwu is bigger than that of nwu which is in line with the results of section 4 3 the impacts of ro and human water use on hydrological droughts have different spatial patterns fig 8 d shows the average impacts of reservoir operations on sdsd from 1981 to 2010 while both positive and negative impacts can be inspected in the upstream and downstream areas of the reservoirs there is a general spatial pattern that ro alleviates sdsd in the downstream water receiving area but aggravates sdsd in the upstream area the 2008 2009 autumn winter drought was selected as an example to further characterize the impacts of different human activities on a severe drought fig 9 shows the spatial pattern of the impacts of four types of human activities on sdsd of the 2008 2009 autumn winter drought in general human water use severely increased sdsd even up to five times in some regions compared to natural variability comparing the effects of different type of water use on sdsd it can be found that the impact of nwu is greater than that of iwu this is inconsistent with the above results which is due to the decrease of irrigation water consumption in autumn and winter in fig 9 c it is found that the combined impacts of iwu and nwu severely amplified sdsd up to five times for much more regions than irrigation or non irrigation water uses in addition take the locations of 23 reservoirs and their catchments as the upstream area in the downstream areas of these reservoirs i e downstream rivers downstream water receiving areas the ro impact less than 0 can be inspected in fig 9 d generally which indicates that ro can alleviate sdsd in the downstream water receiving area and the downstream rivers during the 2008 2009 autumn winter drought 5 discussions this study quantified the impact of human water uses i e irrigation water use and non irrigation water use and reservoir operations on the characteristics of hydrological drought using scenario comparison with pcr globwb 2 0 model in huaihe river basin during the period 1981 2010 results show that although human activities have significant impacts on hydrological droughts there are large differences over time and space in this section we discuss the opposing roles of human water use and reservoir operations affecting hydrological drought compare the impact of human activities on hydrological drought indicated by different methods with this study and discuss uncertainties and limitations caused by scenario comparison with pcr globwb 2 0 model 5 1 the dual role of human water use affecting hydrological drought over space in general our results shows that human water use i e iwu and nwu could reduce or increase drought in different spatial locations i e fig 8 a and b and the impacts of human water use on hydrological droughts present remarkable spatial heterogeneity for heterogeneous spatial impacts of different types of water use i e iwu and nwu on hydrological drought characteristics there are different reasons in different human activity scenarios differences in magnitudes and patterns of increased drought impacts caused by nwu can be explained by the difference in non irrigation water consumption by comparing fig 10 a and fig 8 a the non irrigation water consumption and the impact of nwu on sdsd have similar spatial patterns that is the impact of nwu on drought is great in areas where water consumption is high while nwu increased sdsd in most parts of the basin in some small parts i e north edge northeast and central parts of the basin nwu reduced sdsd north edge parts of basin are comparatively dry with limited availability of surface water and have several large cities with large water requirements for non irrigation water use a large amount of groundwater withdrawal to the north border of the huaihe river basin for nwu resulted in a large amount of return flow to surface water in northern parts of basin as shown in fig 10 b and c therefore the sdsds were alleviated in this region in other areas e g northeast and central parts of study basin where the return flow and water consumption are relatively small fig 10 b and c the cause that nwu alleviated sdsd seems to be different compared to the north edge of the basin to further explain this problem we selected an example grid located in the northeast of the study basin 115 17 30 e 34 17 30 n fig 10 as show in fig 11 comparing the discharge under s1 with that under s0 it can be found that the return flow under nwu increases the discharge generally especially in the low flow situations thus overall nwu alleviated the hydrological drought in these regions this finding is consistent with de graaf et al 2014 which found that the return flow to surface water can increase low flow and in regions where industrial water use is dominant return flow impact is large as shown in fig 8 b the impact of iwu on sdsd presents a contrasting spatial difference in northwest half henan province and southeast half anhui province of the basin namely iwu heavily increased sdsds in the northwest part while reduced sdsds in most of the southeast part of the basin such a contrasting impacts by iwu is related to the different irrigation practices for paddy and non paddy in pcr globwb 2 0 model as shown in fig 12 the main irrigated crop in northwest half is non paddy e g wheat while the main irrigated crop in the southeast half is rice paddy in the southeast half of the basin mostly in anhui province fig 1 iwu is mostly used for paddy irrigation which requires a certain surface water depth over the paddy fields to represent flooding irrigation during growing seasons wada et al 2014 sutanudjaja et al 2018 yang et al 2020 this flooding irrigation needs a large amount of water being abstracted from surface water e g river to paddy growing regions to meet such large quantities of water iwu in paddy irrigation regions withdrawals water not only from local grids but also mostly from upstream grids along the major rivers at that case iwu in the mostly paddy irrigated regions not only reduce the water availability in major rivers but also results in quantities of water being transferred to paddy irrigated areas fig 13 b and c which increase soil water storage and land surface runoff in the paddy irrigated area therefore as shown in fig 8 b iwu reduced sdsd in most paddy irrigated areas of basin because a large amount of water in the upstream area was transferred to these regions but increased the sdsd in major rivers because quantities of water were abstracted for irrigating the rice paddy in contrast in the northwest half water withdrawal fig 13 b is mainly used for non paddy irrigation non paddy needs relatively small quantities of water withdrawal comparing to flooding irrigation which leads to comparatively small quantity of water transferring to non paddy irrigation areas because most of their demand can be meet by abstracting water from local grid cells at that case most of locally withdrawn water was consumed by evapotranspiration fig 13 a with only a small amount of irrigation water returned to river system via infiltration into the soil in non paddy irrigated areas fig 13 c the most of locally withdrawn water being consumed and comparatively small quantity of water transfer results in water losses in non paddy irrigation areas and consequently exacerbates hydrological drought in this region a recent study by shah et al 2021 also found that irrigation intensifies streamflow drought while alleviates soil moisture drought in india during 1951 2016 5 2 the dual role of reservoir operation affecting hydrological drought in this study both the positive and negative effects of ro on hydrological drought were found not only over time but also over space as shown in fig 7 d and fig 8 d whether a reservoir is beneficial to drought resilience depends on its specific operation rules rangecroft et al 2019 our results suggest that ro reduces the sdsd in downstream water receiving area while increases the sdsd in the upstream area fig 8 d previous studies also showed the dual roles of ro for example he et al 2017 and yang et al 2020 found that ro can help alleviate hydrological droughts while van dijk et al 2013 and van oel et al 2018 found an increase in the severity of hydrological drought due to the effects of ro the results of our study revealed the spatial differences of impacts of ro on hydrological drought in the upstream and downstream areas of the reservoirs in addition our results also show that the ro during the 2008 2009 autumn winter drought can alleviate sdsd in the downstream water receiving area and the downstream river channels fig 9 d over the 1981 2010 the impact of ro on hydrological drought is a comprehensive average impact of various reservoir operation modes e g water supply drought resilience and water supply for non irrigation water use or irrigation water use were the main mode of ro during 1981 2010 thus ro not only reducing the drought in the downstream water receiving area but also increasing the drought in the upstream area in the 2008 2009 autumn winter drought releasing water for drought resilience is the main mode of ro thus ro alleviating sdsd in the downstream water receiving areas as well as river channel of downstream this kind of impacts of ro on a drought were also reported in previous studies for example the three gorges reservoir can effectively alleviate the downstream drought conditions through reservoir regulation zhan et al 2015 chai et al 2019 jiao et al 2020 li et al 2021 similarly dai et al 2008 found that the three gorges reservoir released about 3 58 109 m3 water in the driest year of 2006 for drought resilience and the flow in the dry season is consistent with the normal year 5 3 magnitude of human impacts on hydrological drought indicated by different approaches human water uses for industrial domestic and livestock water supply or agricultural irrigation heavily decreased the water of rivers or reservoirs and then increased local hydrological droughts in general our results show that nwu iwu and awu increased sdsd pda by about 119 72 214 110 and 310 148 over the whole study basin on average during 1981 2010 respectively fig 7 similar results have been reported in previous studies in other regions for example a global study by wada et al 2013 showed that human water consumption increased hydrological drought deficit by 10 500 from 1960 to 2010 in high water consumption regions yang et al 2020 showed that human activities mainly human water consumption increased drought deficit by about 70 200 over northern china during 2004 2015 these studies used the same method as our study namely scenario comparison approach in addition to scenario comparison method other methods are also used to analyze the impact of human activities on drought in previous studies for example wang et al 2020 pointed out that human activities increased drought deficits with maximum increases of 865 by using observed simulated comparison approach in the laohahe basin of northeastern china also in the laohahe basin liu et al 2016 using pre post disturbance comparison approach found that the deficit of hydrological drought was amplified 300 800 by human activities rangecroft et al 2019 found that human activities drought deficit volumes by 158 on average with the upstream downstream comparison in a basin of northern chile van loon et al 2019 using the paired catchments comparison approach in australia found that groundwater withdrawal for human water use aggravated total deficit of hydrological drought by more than 200 our results and the studies mentioned above both revealed huge impacts of human activities on hydrological drought i e the amplification of hydrological droughts by up to several times van loon et al 2019 showed that the characteristics of human activities are different in various regions so the magnitudes of humans affecting droughts are also different in different catchments 5 4 uncertainties and limitations of scenario comparison with pcr globwb 2 0 model in this study the major model parameters used for scenario experiment were adopted from the global parameter dataset calibrated by sutanudjaja et al 2018 for global modeling it is often impossible to get detailed parameters in a specific catchment in particular those about human activities e g reservoirs water withdrawal or water consumption therefore model calibration and validation based on regional observations is necessary to improve the accuracy of local application of the global model lópez lópez et al 2017 liu et al 2019 hosseini moghari et al 2020 many previous studies of analyzing the contributions of human activities on hydrological droughts did not conduct a model calibration e g he et al 2017 yang et al 2020 jiao et al 2020 which could result in notable uncertainties in estimating human impacts van loon et al 2019 shah et al 2021 in this study we used observed monthly discharge of 7 gauging stations and yearly water withdrawal and water consumption of different water use sectors to calibrate and validate the pcr globwb 2 0 model at the huaihe river basin the results show that the calibrated model can well simulate the hydrological process of our study basin figs 2 4 albeit with the simulation of trends of water withdrawal and consumption still exhibits some uncertainties fig 4 a in fact trends of water use are difficult to be captured using global hydrological models ghms especially in china where policy interventions and technological adoptions are used to adjust water consumption wada et al 2014 zhou et al 2020 which is difficult to be parameterized in the hydrological model moreover the trend is not used as a performance criterion of simulation evaluation in many hydrological models hosseini moghari et al 2020 regarding model calibration and validation there are still some limitations and uncertainties that need to be solved in future first the parameters were calibrated by using spatially uniform adjustment factors table 1 over whole basin which does not consider the spatial variability of parameters therefore a new calibration strategy should be developed for making the adjustment factors and parameters change with soil type land use altitude or other characteristics lópez lópez et al 2017 second the pcr globwb model does not consider the inter basin water transfer wada et al 2016 for surface water withdrawal it abstracts water from simulated surface water based on the water availability at local or upstream grids along the river network for groundwater withdrawal it only abstracts the ground water renewable and nonrenewable groundwater from the local grids and if the amount of groundwater water withdrawal is larger than the available groundwater storage the unmet water demand will be imposed on the nonrenewable groundwater wada et al 2016 the north edge of our study basin is adjacent to the yellow river fig 1 and the water of yellow river is transferred regularly to the huaihe river basin to meet some unmet water demand which is not included in the pcr globwb model therefore the groundwater withdrawal especially the non renewable groundwater is likely overestimated by the model because some water demand is met by water transfers from yellow river in the reality but met by groundwater withdrawal in the model third due to data availability the observed data used for calibration and validation of water withdrawal and water consumption simulation are on annual time scale which neglects the inter annual variation of water use also the period of the water use data series used for comparison is relatively short with only 12 years of data samples 1999 2010 which cannot verify the accuracy of the whole simulation period 1981 2010 in addition the temporal variation less than a year of the model performance can also bring some uncertainties especially during periods of water shortage when framers tend to adjust their irrigation water use temporally to cope with drought which could enhance the societal resistance to droughts wada et al 2013 forth parameters of reservoirs were obtained from the global reservoir and dams dataset lehner et al 2011 which includes only 23 large and medium sized reservoirs in our study basin fig 1 whereas there are much more smaller reservoirs operated in the basin although the influence of small reservoirs is expected to be smaller than the influence of large and medium sized reservoirs because small reservoirs are usually located on smaller rivers and has relatively small capacities of storage the collective impacts of small reservoirs on hydrological drought characteristics could be significant a promising way to derive information of undocumented reservoirs is using high resolution remote sensing products for example a recent study busker et al 2019 estimated the volume of reservoirs in regions with sparse data by using the satellite altimetry in addition restricted by data availability it is difficult to parameterize the operation rules of each reservoir reservoir operation in pcr globwb 2 0 model was calibrated and validated using monthly discharge of 7 hydrological stations which may lead to biases in the parameterization of actual process of reservoir operation in our study basin therefore more data of irrigation water use and reservoir operation would be collected in the future to further calibrate and parameterize the model 6 conclusions in this study the scenario comparison approach was used to identify the impacts of different human activities i e iwu nwu and ro on hydrological drought based on the calibrated pcr globwb 2 0 model for the catchment above bengbu in the huaihe river basin the results show that the impacts of human activities on hydrological drought vary in both time and space from 1981 2010 nwu and iwu increases sdsd by about 119 and 214 over the entire study basin on average respectively the effects of iwu and nwu on sdsd show different spatial distribution characteristics nwu heavily increase the sdsd in most regions of the basin whereas in other regions with limited availability of surface water nwu reduce sdsd due to return flow of unconsumed water to surface water iwu has contrasting impacts on hydrological droughts between non paddy irrigation and paddy irrigation dominated regions iwu reduce sdsd in paddy irrigation dominated regions due to large quantities of water were transferred to those regions for paddy irrigation which requires a certain surface water depth over the paddy fields for flooding irrigation but increase the sdsd in rivers of those regions due to high quantity of water was abstracted from the rivers to meet the high water demand of paddy irrigation in contrast iwu increase sdsd in non paddy irrigation dominated regions because of most of water being withdrawn locally and comparatively small quantity of water being transferred to non paddy irrigation area ro not only reduce sdsd in downstream water receiving areas but also increase sdsd in the upstream regions generally for water supply during the period 1981 2010 and in 2008 2009 autumn winter drought ro alleviate sdsd in downstream water receiving area as well as rivers channel of downstream by releasing water mainly for drought resilience the results of this study can provide increased understanding of the impacts of different human water management activities on hydrological drought characteristics and provide actionable knowledge for improved water resource management and drought control under the changing environment further research should be focused on improving the parameterization of human activities e g reservoir regulation water withdrawal and human water use in pcr globwb 2 0 model so as to improve the modelling of the effects of human activities on hydrological drought author statement hui cheng formal analysis

large differences over time and space in terms of time non irrigation water use nwu and irrigation water use iwu increased standardized drought streamflow deficit sdsd by about 119 and 214 on average during 1981 2010 respectively in terms of space nwu heavily increased sdsd in most regions of the basin whereas reduced it in the regions with limited surface water due to the return flow from unconsumed water to surface water iwu reduced sdsd in paddy irrigation regions due to large quantities of water in the upstream rivers were transferred to those regions for flooding irrigation whereas in non paddy irrigation regions iwu increased sdsd due to most of water being withdrawn locally and comparatively small quantity of water transfer reservoir operation ro reduced sdsd in downstream water receiving areas while increased sdsd in upstream areas our findings can help drought management and mitigation keywords hydrological drought pcr globwb 2 0 model human activitie scenario comparison huaihe river basin 1 introduction droughts produce intense socio economic impacts all over the world in areas with strong human activities characteristics human beings are no longer only affected but they also actively influence and alter the development of hydrological drought van loon et al 2016 globally drought intensity is generally exacerbated by human activities wada et al 2013 wanders and wada 2015 in this era of intensive human activities revealing the differentiated impacts of human activities on drought has become a research focus of socio hydrological researchers droughts are usually divided into hydrological meteorological agricultural and socio economic drought on the basis of its drivers and impacts mishra and singh 2010 among the different types of droughts hydrological drought is characterized by negative anomalies of surface or subsurface water sources usually discharge the generation and development of hydrological drought are not only restricted by climate factors but also affected by human activities van loon et al 2016 firoz et al 2018 wang et al 2021 previous studies have shown that catchment properties yang et al 2017 climate change van loon et al 2014 reservoir operation wu et al 2017 2018 human water use wada et al 2013 land use land cover change li et al 2019 abubaker et al 2020 and other human activities van loon et al 2016 have notable impacts on the formation and development of hydrological drought among these factors the reservoir operation and human water use affects hydrological droughts most directly because they change the hydrological process and reduce water availability under reservoir regulation the relationship between rainfall and runoff is changed which affects the frequency intensity and duration of hydrological drought van oel et al 2018 wu et al 2017 2018 for example wu et al 2017 showed that reservoir operation changes the relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought similarly he et al 2017 and yang et al 2020 and jiao et al 2020 found that reservoir operation has alleviated hydrological drought during the drought periods in california and yangtze river respectively human water use mainly can be categorized into non irrigation and irrigation water use and non irrigation water use mainly includes industrial domestic and livestock water use wada et al 2013 showed that the global drought intensities are heavily increased by 10 500 due to human water consumption in the past few decades moreover increased water use will further increase hydrological drought due to rapid economic development in the future wanders and wada 2015 although previous studies have revealed the great impact of human activities on hydrological drought these studies either focused on the joint effects of all human activities e g jiang et al 2019 or focused on the impacts of an individual human activity such as reservoir operation human water use or land use change e g wu et al 2017 and the spatial temporal effect of the impacts by different human activities on hydrological droughts is not very clear the key of analyzing how human activities affect drought characteristics and development is to quantitatively separate the natural factors and human activities in the formation and development of drought to do so several comparative analysis approaches have been proposed in recent years first the paired catchments comparison method which selects two watersheds with similar characteristics e g climatic properties catchment area and topographical properties except for special human regulations for comparison van loon et al 2019 however it is difficult to find such two catchments second the upstream downstream comparison method which compares droughts of upstream and downstream based on observation data van loon et al 2019 there is some uncertainty that caused by the possible nonlinear relationship of different gauging stations third pre post disturbance comparison method which compares droughts before and after a significant human intervention occurred based on streamflow observations liu et al 2016 however it is difficult to separate the no stationarity caused by climate change and by human interventions peñas et al 2016 fourth simulated observed comparison method which compares the simulated drought characteristics without human activities regarded as natural hydrological process with the observed data affected by human activities e g wu et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 abubaker et al 2020 wang et al 2020 there is a similarity in the pre post disturbance method and the simulated observed method in the sense that they both compare a human influence situation with a natural situation the simulated observed comparison method differs from the pre post disturbance comparison method in that the former take the whole observed period as the period affected by human activities whereas the latter split the whole observed period into two parts i e a period little human intervention and a period with significant human intervention a major problem with the simulated observed comparison method lies in that it reflects the cumulative impact of all human activities on the drought without differentiating individual effects of different human activities e g jiang et al 2019 finally the scenario comparison method which separates the effects of different human activities on hydrological process through hydrological modelling under a natural scenario and human intervention scenarios with different types of human activities for comparison the scenario comparison method is often conducted based on large scale models and can effectively separate different types of human activities wada et al 2013 wanders and wada 2015 he et al 2017 yang et al 2020 jiao et al 2020 long et al 2020 however these large scale models have coarse spatial resolutions and are often not validated or calibrated locally van loon et al 2019 the scenario comparison method was used in this study to assess the relative impacts of different types of human activities on drought characteristics because it can effectively simulate the effects of different human activities especially various types of water use and reservoir operation at present many hydrological models more or less consider the impact of human activities on the hydrological process but take rainfall runoff simulation as the core and make a conceptualized disposal of human activities such as the soil water and assessment tool swat and variable infiltration capacity vic model in addition many hydrological models consider all aspects of human water resources management such as aquatool ribasim wargi sim weap and pcr globwb model among those models the pcr globwb pcraster global water balance model is an advanced grid based global hydrology and water resources model developed at utrecht university van beek et al 2011 wada et al 2014 de graaf et al 2014 sutanudjaja et al 2018 the latest pcr globwb 2 0 fully integrates water use and reservoir operation into rainfall runoff process modelling and can systematically consider the direct impact of different human activities it has a high spatial resolution 5 5 acrmin and have been used on global and regional scales successfully e g sutanudjaja et al 2018 de graaf et al 2019 yang et al 2020 jiao et al 2020 therefore this study attempts to separate and quantify the different impacts mitigation or exacerbation of various human activities on hydrological drought by using the method of scenario comparison based on the pcr globwb 2 0 model the catchment above bengbu in the huaihe river basin which is located in east china was chosen as a study area where the hydrological process is strongly influenced by various types of human activities 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the catchment above bengbu in the huaihe river basin 111 56 117 31 e 30 57 34 57 n fig 1 has a drainage area of about 121 300 km2 it spans henan anhui and hubei provinces with the yellow river flow along the north border of the basin it is located in the transition area from north subtropical to warm temperate zone dominated by a continental monsoon climate huaihe river has many tributaries such as hongru river pi river and shaying river fig 1 shows four hydrological stations bengbu lutaizi huaibing and xixian along the mainstream and three hydrological stations bantai hengpaitou and zhoukou along the tributaries there are many reservoirs along the mainstream and tributaries among which 23 large and medium sized reservoirs shown in fig 1 are considered according to the global reservoir and dams dataset lehner et al 2011 the study basin is an important cereal producing area in china and has many large scale agricultural irrigation areas cropland accounts for about 75 of the total area of the basin and main crops grown in the henan province are non paddy crops e g wheat whereas paddy rice is the major crop in the anhui province additionally the study basin has the highest population density in china about 662 people km2 since 1949 the region was frequently struck by severe droughts in the past such as the 2008 2009 autumn winter drought 2 2 datasets the global datasets of pcr globwb 2 0 model during the period of 1979 2010 were obtained from sutanudjaja et al 2018 https geo data uu nl research pcrglobwb pcr globwb gmd paper sutanudjaja et al 2018 considering that the meteorological forcing data in the pcr globwb datasets are not accurate in china gridded daily temperature and precipitation from 1979 to 2010 retrieved from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 https data tpdc ac cn zh hans were used instead the cmfd meteorological data have a 0 1 resolution and were interpolated to a 5 arcmin spatial resolution by bilinear interpolation method to force pcr globwb 2 0 model monthly discharge observed at 7 hydrological stations fig 1 during the period 1979 2010 were derived from the bureau of hydrology and water resources of henan province china the census data of yearly industry water use domestic water use livestock water use irrigation water use groundwater water abstraction surface water abstraction and locations of major reservoirs fig 1 in the catchment were taken from annual water resources bulletin of the huaihe river basin china for the period of 1999 2010 which were downloaded from the website of the huaihe river conservancy commission hrcc http www hrc gov cn 3 methodology in this study the scenario comparison method for quantifying the impact of different human activities on hydrological drought characteristics consists of four major steps 1 cmfd meteorological data and global parameter datasets of pcr globwb 2 0 model were used to build pcr globwb 2 0 model with a 5 arcmin spatial resolution over the catchment during the period of 1979 2010 the constructed pcr globwb 2 0 model was calibrated and validated using datasets of observed monthly discharge and census based yearly water withdrawal and water consumption 2 the pcr globwb 2 0 model was used to simulate the spatial temporal variation of discharge under different human activity scenarios 3 the variable threshold method was used to identify hydrological drought characteristics under different simulated scenarios the threshold was determined based on the simulated monthly average discharge under the natural scenario s0 4 the hydrological drought characteristics of different human activity scenarios were compared to those of natural scenario s0 for quantifying the impacts of different human activities on hydrological drought characteristics 3 1 pcr globwb 2 0 model pcr globwb 2 0 model dynamically calculates the water storage in two vertically cumulated soil layers as well as an underlying groundwater layer at each grid unit and daily time step the model also simulates the water balance between the atmosphere and the top soil layer snow melt evapotranspiration and precipitation and between soil layers capillary rise percolation and infiltration wada et al 2014 moreover snow storage and canopy interception also are considered in the model the land cover types of pcr globwb model includes natural short vegetation natural tall vegetation irrigated paddy crops and irrigated non paddy crops the local runoff of each unit includes the surface or direct runoff qdr the second layer interflow qsf and the groundwater base flow qbf sutanudjaja et al 2014 the river discharge was routed by kinematic wave routing approach for accumulating the local runoff across the river network from all grids pcr globwb model integrates human water management e g non irrigation water use irrigation water use and reservoir operation into the model and solves the process of water withdrawal consumption and return flow of human water management in this study water withdrawal is equal to all gross water demand and taken from surface water and groundwater more details of the structure and configuration of pcr globwb 2 0 model can refer to sutanudjaja et al 2018 in pcr globwb 2 0 model non irrigation water use covers three sectors domestic industry and livestock water use for each of non irrigation water use the water demand of non irrigation is estimated at a daily time step and are prescribed to the pcr globwb 2 0 model wada et al 2014 industrial water demand is estimated by multiplying water use intensities with the reference gridded water demand in 2000 wada et al 2016 domestic water demand is estimated by multiplying domestic water withdrawal of country per capita with number of persons in each grid cell wada et al 2014 livestock water demand is estimated by multiplying daily drinking water requirements of livestock with number of livestock in each grid unit in the irrigation scheme for irrigation water use simulation rice and non rice crops are parameterized separately in pcr globwb 2 0 model and the feedback between irrigation water and corresponding changes in surface water and soil water is considered and is dynamically linked with water balance of soil water storage surface water and evapotranspiration over irrigated areas the irrigation water demand is calculated based on the irrigated area per grid and the crop composition according to fao guidelines wada et al 2014 the irrigated area in each cell is estimated based on reported irrigated areas of faostat https www fao org faostat en home and changes over year while the fractions of non rice and rice irrigation and monthly crop composition maintains unchanged reservoir operation in pcr globwb model is carried out by considering the functions of water supply for human water use flood control hydropower navigation and others reservoir operation is dynamically linked with the routing scheme to meet the water demand of local and downstream van beek et al 2011 pcr globwb 2 0 model incorporates about 7000 reservoirs with storage capacity larger than 0 1 km3 many smaller reservoirs are also added if data are available globally and are gradually incorporated into the model according to their constructed years based on the global reservoir and dam database grand lehner et al 2011 this database includes 23 large and medium scale reservoirs in our study area fig 1 3 2 calibration and validation of pcr globwb 2 0 model the parameter datasets of pcr globwb 2 0 model mainly includes 10 categories meteorological forcing land cover areas over cell areas upper and lower soil store parameters root fractions per soil layer topographical parameters arno scheme exponents parameters related to phenology ratio of cell maximum minimum soil storage groundwater parameters and human water management parameters e g non irrigation water demand and lakes and reservoir sutanudjaja et al 2018 these parameters were calibrated by sutanudjaja et al 2018 for global application when applying these global parameters to the basin of our study the meteorological forcing data soil parameters groundwater parameters and human water use parameters of pcr globwb model global datasets were adjusted first we replaced cru ts 3 2 dataset with cmfd he et al 2020 as the meteorological forcing data of the pcr globwb 2 0 model second according to the method of calibrating pcr globwb model proposed by sutanudjaja et al 2014 and lópez lópez et al 2017 other parameters i e soil parameters groundwater parameters and human water use parameters were adjusted by multiplying each grid with a spatially uniform pre factor table 1 instead of adjusting actual parameter values these adjusted parameters can be divided into two categories the first category of parameters is gross and net human water demand data e g industry domestic and livestock water demand these yearly water demand data were calibrated by using spatially uniform pre factors based on the observed yearly water demand data table 1 other categories baseflow recession coefficient soil saturated hydraulic conductivities and minimum soil water capacity were calibrated by using step wise calibration approach based on spatially uniform pre factors table 1 the remaining global parameters of pcr globwb 2 0 model were kept fixed in this study the observed monthly discharge at 7 hydrological stations fig 1 and yearly water consumption and water withdrawal of the study basin were used for calibrating and validating the pcr globwb 2 0 model the simulation series from 1979 to 2010 was divided into three segments data of the first two years 1979 1980 was used for spinning up the model to reach a dynamically stable state the data of 1981 1995 were used for calibration and the remaining data of 1996 2010 were used for validation the spin up period was not included in the subsequent analysis to evaluate the performance of discharge simulation correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse and relative bias error rbe are employed in addition to evaluate the performance of water consumption and water withdrawal simulation root mean square error rmse besides r and rbe is adopted these statistical metrics can be calculated as follows 1 r t 1 t x t x y t y t 1 t x t x 2 t 1 t y t y 2 2 n s e 1 t 1 t x t y t 2 t 1 t x t y 2 3 r b e t 1 t x t y t t 1 t y t 100 4 r m s e i 1 t x t y t 2 t here x t and y t indicate observed and simulated data respectively t is a number of time steps t is a time step 3 3 experimental setup in pcr globwb 2 0 model three types of human activities i e non irrigation water use irrigation water use and reservoir operation are considered human water use denotes the water demands for industry domestic livestock and irrigation which are converted to actual withdrawals from surface water i e reservoirs lakes rivers and groundwater and water consumption and return flows are also calculated for each sector for non irrigation water use withdrawn water is used for domestic and livestock water supply or industrial production the return flow of non irrigation water use is added to the surface water for irrigation water use withdrawn water is used for paddy and non paddy irrigation some part of irrigation water is consumed by transpiration and evaporation and the rest part of irrigation water infiltrates to the groundwater as the return flow in addition reservoir operation is considered into the model indicating that the discharge can be regulated by reservoir operation for the purposes of water supply to meet water demand flood control hydropower navigation and others van beek et al 2011 to separate the effects of different human activities on hydrological drought we set five scenarios table 2 i e s0 s4 with the same model forcing and boundary conditions but different human activities to perform scenario comparison with the calibrated pcr globwb model we simulated different human activity scenarios by adjusting the model input data for s0 we did not consider any human activity that is did not use any human activity parameters i e irrigation area non irrigation water demand and reservoir operation to run the model for s1 we only used industry domestic and livestock water demand to force and run model for s2 we only used irrigation parameter to force and run model for s3 we used irrigation parameters and non irrigation parameters industrial domestic and livestock water demand to drive the model for s4 we used all human activity parameters i e irrigation area non irrigation water demand and reservoir operation to drive the model note that non irrigation water use is not considered in s0 and s3 indicating that no water withdrawal and water consumption in surface and ground for industrial production domestic and livestock water supply and no irrigation water use in s0 and s1 indicating that all crops in irrigation regions are rain fed and evapotranspiration is calculated according to natural vegetation land cover types bosmans et al 2017 and no reservoir operation in s0 s1 s2 and s3 indicating that all reservoirs are considered as lakes and have no function of regulating discharge note that s0 is a naturalized scenario and s4 is an actual scenario s0 was taken as the baseline scenario for assessing the characteristics of hydrological droughts under different human activity scenarios the characteristics of hydrological droughts of s1 s2 s3 and s4 scenarios were compared to those of s0 respectively to estimate their percentage impacts on hydrological droughts the effects of different human activities under different scenarios are measured using the following measures 5 i w u h d s j h d s 0 h d s 0 100 j 1 2 3 6 i ro h d s 4 h d s 3 h d s 0 100 here i wu wu denotes nwu iwu or awu is the percentage impacts of different water use wu type i e non irrigation water use nwu irrigation water use iwu and all type water use awu on hydrological drought characteristics respectively hd with different subscripts represents hydrological drought characteristics defined in section 3 4 under different simulation scenarios in addition i ro is the percentage impact of reservoir operation ro on hydrological drought equal to the difference of the impact under s4 minus the impact under s3 3 4 calculation of hydrological drought characteristics the variable threshold method vtm is used to extract drought characteristics from simulated monthly discharge a discharge threshold with a probability of exceedance between 70 90 is commonly used in previous studies e g van loon and van lanen 2012 wada et al 2013 to consider the seasonal variation of streamflow the monthly average discharge with the exceedance probability of 80 q80 was selected as the threshold level based on the simulated monthly average discharge under s0 scenario in this study the drought state at a gauging station or a grid cell n in a given month t can be judged by a binary variable s t n given by 7 s t n 1 q t n q 80 t n 0 q t n q 80 t n where q 80 t n is the drought threshold of month t representing the monthly discharge being exceeded or equalled 80 of the time q t n is the monthly discharge the value 1 of s t n indicates a state of drought and 0 indicates no drought the standardized drought streamflow deficit denoted by sdsd t n in a specific month t at location n can be calculated by 8 s d s d t n max q 80 t n q t n 0 q 80 t n the total drought streamflow deficit denoted by tdsd i for each drought event i is the total deviation from the threshold during the drought which can be calculated by 9 t d s d i t s i e i max q 80 t n q t n 0 where si and ei are the start and end time of each drought event i respectively furthermore the percentage of drought area over the whole region denoted by pda t at a month t can be defined by 10 p d a t n 1 n s t n n where n is total number of grid cells pda ranges between 0 and 1 with 0 represents that no grid cells are in drought and 1 represents that all the area is in drought 4 results 4 1 evaluation of model simulation the performances of monthly discharge simulations during calibration period 1981 1995 and validation period 1996 2010 at 7 gauging sites are presented in 7 plots of fig 2 which show that the observed and simulated discharge agree well for four stations along the mainstream the values of r in calibration and validation period ranged between 0 90 0 93 and 0 89 0 93 nse ranged between 0 80 0 87 and 0 80 0 83 and rbe ranged between 10 43 8 72 and 6 33 7 49 respectively for three stations in tributaries the values of r in calibration and validation period ranged between 0 86 0 93 and 0 86 0 89 nse ranged between 0 72 0 83 and 0 71 0 76 and rbe ranged between 8 07 22 15 and 1 27 12 09 respectively comparing the simulation performance of the mainstream with that of the tributary indicates that the simulation accuracy of large rivers is better than small rivers which is in line with the study of he et al 2017 overall nse varies from 0 71 to 0 87 and the absolute values of rbe range between 1 27 22 15 which indicate that the calibrated pcr globwb 2 0 model can well simulate the hydrological process of our study basin due to data availability water withdrawal and water consumption simulation were evaluated at yearly time scale from 1999 to 2010 see section 2 2 fig 3 shows scatter plots of the simulated versus census data of yearly water withdrawal and water consumption during 1999 2010 the result shows that simulated water withdrawal and water consumption match closely with the census data in addition the performance of water withdrawal and water consumption simulation during 1999 2010 are summarized in fig 4 the median value of r of water withdrawal and water consumption simulation were 0 71 and 0 12 respectively fig 4 a the median value of rmse of water withdrawal and water consumption simulation were 3 95 and 4 11 mm yr respectively fig 4 b the median value of rbe of water withdrawal and water consumption simulation were 1 63 and 1 07 respectively fig 4 c these results demonstrate that the calibrated model can generally capture the magnitude of water consumption and withdrawal although the trend simulations of water withdrawal and water consumption contain some uncertainties 4 2 comparison of simulated drought streamflow deficits with the observed deficits the scenarios s0 and s4 table 2 were selected as examples to compare the simulated total drought streamflow deficit tdsd during the number of months of a specific drought event with observed tdsd respectively in fig 5 the simulated tdsds were calculated based on simulated monthly discharge in scenarios s0 and s4 respectively while the observed tdsds were calculated based on the observed monthly streamflow at 7 hydrological stations comparison of the simulated tdsd per drought event of s4 with the observed tdsd at 7 hydrological stations exhibits good consistency which indicates that the calibrated pcr globwb model can generally reproduce tdsds under the low flow conditions in the study basin for s0 the simulated tdsds were less than those of the observed scatter plots are distributed below the 1 1 line however simulated tdsds under s4 heavily increased comparing to those under s0 scatter points were basically distributed on the 1 1 line this also indicates that the tdsd was significantly increased by human activities in addition it is worth noting that the distribution of scatter points gets less scattered with the increase of the tdsd which may be due to monthly threshold was used to identify hydrological drought which could cause some errors in estimating short drought events beyene et al 2014 4 3 temporal variation of impacts of different human activities on hydrological drought fig 6 compares the annual percentage of drought area pda and standardized drought streamflow deficit sdsd under different human activity scenarios s0 s1 s2 s3 and s4 over the entire basin during the period 1981 2010 pda and sdsd present similar pattern of temporal variation taking the pda larger than 0 2 and the sdsd larger than 200 as the criteria two dashed lines in fig 6 for quantifying the hydrological wetness we can identify seven severe multi year dry periods i e 1981 1982 1986 1988 1992 1995 1997 1999 2002 and 2008 2009 the detected dry periods are in line with most of the major droughts in the huaihe river basin reported by chen et al 2013 notably pda fig 6 a and sdsd fig 6 b under scenarios that considering human activities i e s1 s2 s3 and s4 are always larger than those under scenario s0 which indicates that hydrological droughts were significantly intensified by human activities especially human water use the impacts of nwu iwu awu and ro on annual sdsd and pda over the entire basin from 1981 to 2010 are illustrated in fig 7 it is shown that in general nwu increased sdsd and pda by about 119 and 72 on average during 1981 2010 fig 7 a whereas iwu increased sdsd and pda by about 214 and 110 on average fig 7 b that is the impact of iwu is bigger than nwu in magnitude which is in agreement with fig 6 indicating that the sdsd and pda under s2 were larger than those under s1 in addition with the combined effects of nwu and iwu sdsd and pda increased by about 310 and 148 on average from 1981 to 2010 fig 7 c in comparison with the effects of water use the impacts of reservoir operation on the drought were minor from the perspective of the entire basin fig 7 d while water uses always worsen droughts ro may aggravate or reduce sdsds over time depending on the function of reservoir operation such as water supply flood defense power generation or others 4 4 spatial impacts of different human activities on hydrological droughts fig 8 shows the spatial impacts of nwu iwu awu and ro on average sdsd on grid basis over the region during the period 1981 2010 significant spatial variability of the impacts of human activities on sdsd across the basin can be inspected in fig 8 in most regions of the study basin human water use iwu nwu and awu increased sdsd by more than 20 and even increased up to about five times in some regions fig 8 a c meanwhile human water use reduced drought impacts in small parts of basin these results indicate that the effects of human water use on sdsd are mixed over space in addition comparing effects of different types of water use on drought it can be found that the impact of iwu is bigger than that of nwu which is in line with the results of section 4 3 the impacts of ro and human water use on hydrological droughts have different spatial patterns fig 8 d shows the average impacts of reservoir operations on sdsd from 1981 to 2010 while both positive and negative impacts can be inspected in the upstream and downstream areas of the reservoirs there is a general spatial pattern that ro alleviates sdsd in the downstream water receiving area but aggravates sdsd in the upstream area the 2008 2009 autumn winter drought was selected as an example to further characterize the impacts of different human activities on a severe drought fig 9 shows the spatial pattern of the impacts of four types of human activities on sdsd of the 2008 2009 autumn winter drought in general human water use severely increased sdsd even up to five times in some regions compared to natural variability comparing the effects of different type of water use on sdsd it can be found that the impact of nwu is greater than that of iwu this is inconsistent with the above results which is due to the decrease of irrigation water consumption in autumn and winter in fig 9 c it is found that the combined impacts of iwu and nwu severely amplified sdsd up to five times for much more regions than irrigation or non irrigation water uses in addition take the locations of 23 reservoirs and their catchments as the upstream area in the downstream areas of these reservoirs i e downstream rivers downstream water receiving areas the ro impact less than 0 can be inspected in fig 9 d generally which indicates that ro can alleviate sdsd in the downstream water receiving area and the downstream rivers during the 2008 2009 autumn winter drought 5 discussions this study quantified the impact of human water uses i e irrigation water use and non irrigation water use and reservoir operations on the characteristics of hydrological drought using scenario comparison with pcr globwb 2 0 model in huaihe river basin during the period 1981 2010 results show that although human activities have significant impacts on hydrological droughts there are large differences over time and space in this section we discuss the opposing roles of human water use and reservoir operations affecting hydrological drought compare the impact of human activities on hydrological drought indicated by different methods with this study and discuss uncertainties and limitations caused by scenario comparison with pcr globwb 2 0 model 5 1 the dual role of human water use affecting hydrological drought over space in general our results shows that human water use i e iwu and nwu could reduce or increase drought in different spatial locations i e fig 8 a and b and the impacts of human water use on hydrological droughts present remarkable spatial heterogeneity for heterogeneous spatial impacts of different types of water use i e iwu and nwu on hydrological drought characteristics there are different reasons in different human activity scenarios differences in magnitudes and patterns of increased drought impacts caused by nwu can be explained by the difference in non irrigation water consumption by comparing fig 10 a and fig 8 a the non irrigation water consumption and the impact of nwu on sdsd have similar spatial patterns that is the impact of nwu on drought is great in areas where water consumption is high while nwu increased sdsd in most parts of the basin in some small parts i e north edge northeast and central parts of the basin nwu reduced sdsd north edge parts of basin are comparatively dry with limited availability of surface water and have several large cities with large water requirements for non irrigation water use a large amount of groundwater withdrawal to the north border of the huaihe river basin for nwu resulted in a large amount of return flow to surface water in northern parts of basin as shown in fig 10 b and c therefore the sdsds were alleviated in this region in other areas e g northeast and central parts of study basin where the return flow and water consumption are relatively small fig 10 b and c the cause that nwu alleviated sdsd seems to be different compared to the north edge of the basin to further explain this problem we selected an example grid located in the northeast of the study basin 115 17 30 e 34 17 30 n fig 10 as show in fig 11 comparing the discharge under s1 with that under s0 it can be found that the return flow under nwu increases the discharge generally especially in the low flow situations thus overall nwu alleviated the hydrological drought in these regions this finding is consistent with de graaf et al 2014 which found that the return flow to surface water can increase low flow and in regions where industrial water use is dominant return flow impact is large as shown in fig 8 b the impact of iwu on sdsd presents a contrasting spatial difference in northwest half henan province and southeast half anhui province of the basin namely iwu heavily increased sdsds in the northwest part while reduced sdsds in most of the southeast part of the basin such a contrasting impacts by iwu is related to the different irrigation practices for paddy and non paddy in pcr globwb 2 0 model as shown in fig 12 the main irrigated crop in northwest half is non paddy e g wheat while the main irrigated crop in the southeast half is rice paddy in the southeast half of the basin mostly in anhui province fig 1 iwu is mostly used for paddy irrigation which requires a certain surface water depth over the paddy fields to represent flooding irrigation during growing seasons wada et al 2014 sutanudjaja et al 2018 yang et al 2020 this flooding irrigation needs a large amount of water being abstracted from surface water e g river to paddy growing regions to meet such large quantities of water iwu in paddy irrigation regions withdrawals water not only from local grids but also mostly from upstream grids along the major rivers at that case iwu in the mostly paddy irrigated regions not only reduce the water availability in major rivers but also results in quantities of water being transferred to paddy irrigated areas fig 13 b and c which increase soil water storage and land surface runoff in the paddy irrigated area therefore as shown in fig 8 b iwu reduced sdsd in most paddy irrigated areas of basin because a large amount of water in the upstream area was transferred to these regions but increased the sdsd in major rivers because quantities of water were abstracted for irrigating the rice paddy in contrast in the northwest half water withdrawal fig 13 b is mainly used for non paddy irrigation non paddy needs relatively small quantities of water withdrawal comparing to flooding irrigation which leads to comparatively small quantity of water transferring to non paddy irrigation areas because most of their demand can be meet by abstracting water from local grid cells at that case most of locally withdrawn water was consumed by evapotranspiration fig 13 a with only a small amount of irrigation water returned to river system via infiltration into the soil in non paddy irrigated areas fig 13 c the most of locally withdrawn water being consumed and comparatively small quantity of water transfer results in water losses in non paddy irrigation areas and consequently exacerbates hydrological drought in this region a recent study by shah et al 2021 also found that irrigation intensifies streamflow drought while alleviates soil moisture drought in india during 1951 2016 5 2 the dual role of reservoir operation affecting hydrological drought in this study both the positive and negative effects of ro on hydrological drought were found not only over time but also over space as shown in fig 7 d and fig 8 d whether a reservoir is beneficial to drought resilience depends on its specific operation rules rangecroft et al 2019 our results suggest that ro reduces the sdsd in downstream water receiving area while increases the sdsd in the upstream area fig 8 d previous studies also showed the dual roles of ro for example he et al 2017 and yang et al 2020 found that ro can help alleviate hydrological droughts while van dijk et al 2013 and van oel et al 2018 found an increase in the severity of hydrological drought due to the effects of ro the results of our study revealed the spatial differences of impacts of ro on hydrological drought in the upstream and downstream areas of the reservoirs in addition our results also show that the ro during the 2008 2009 autumn winter drought can alleviate sdsd in the downstream water receiving area and the downstream river channels fig 9 d over the 1981 2010 the impact of ro on hydrological drought is a comprehensive average impact of various reservoir operation modes e g water supply drought resilience and water supply for non irrigation water use or irrigation water use were the main mode of ro during 1981 2010 thus ro not only reducing the drought in the downstream water receiving area but also increasing the drought in the upstream area in the 2008 2009 autumn winter drought releasing water for drought resilience is the main mode of ro thus ro alleviating sdsd in the downstream water receiving areas as well as river channel of downstream this kind of impacts of ro on a drought were also reported in previous studies for example the three gorges reservoir can effectively alleviate the downstream drought conditions through reservoir regulation zhan et al 2015 chai et al 2019 jiao et al 2020 li et al 2021 similarly dai et al 2008 found that the three gorges reservoir released about 3 58 109 m3 water in the driest year of 2006 for drought resilience and the flow in the dry season is consistent with the normal year 5 3 magnitude of human impacts on hydrological drought indicated by different approaches human water uses for industrial domestic and livestock water supply or agricultural irrigation heavily decreased the water of rivers or reservoirs and then increased local hydrological droughts in general our results show that nwu iwu and awu increased sdsd pda by about 119 72 214 110 and 310 148 over the whole study basin on average during 1981 2010 respectively fig 7 similar results have been reported in previous studies in other regions for example a global study by wada et al 2013 showed that human water consumption increased hydrological drought deficit by 10 500 from 1960 to 2010 in high water consumption regions yang et al 2020 showed that human activities mainly human water consumption increased drought deficit by about 70 200 over northern china during 2004 2015 these studies used the same method as our study namely scenario comparison approach in addition to scenario comparison method other methods are also used to analyze the impact of human activities on drought in previous studies for example wang et al 2020 pointed out that human activities increased drought deficits with maximum increases of 865 by using observed simulated comparison approach in the laohahe basin of northeastern china also in the laohahe basin liu et al 2016 using pre post disturbance comparison approach found that the deficit of hydrological drought was amplified 300 800 by human activities rangecroft et al 2019 found that human activities drought deficit volumes by 158 on average with the upstream downstream comparison in a basin of northern chile van loon et al 2019 using the paired catchments comparison approach in australia found that groundwater withdrawal for human water use aggravated total deficit of hydrological drought by more than 200 our results and the studies mentioned above both revealed huge impacts of human activities on hydrological drought i e the amplification of hydrological droughts by up to several times van loon et al 2019 showed that the characteristics of human activities are different in various regions so the magnitudes of humans affecting droughts are also different in different catchments 5 4 uncertainties and limitations of scenario comparison with pcr globwb 2 0 model in this study the major model parameters used for scenario experiment were adopted from the global parameter dataset calibrated by sutanudjaja et al 2018 for global modeling it is often impossible to get detailed parameters in a specific catchment in particular those about human activities e g reservoirs water withdrawal or water consumption therefore model calibration and validation based on regional observations is necessary to improve the accuracy of local application of the global model lópez lópez et al 2017 liu et al 2019 hosseini moghari et al 2020 many previous studies of analyzing the contributions of human activities on hydrological droughts did not conduct a model calibration e g he et al 2017 yang et al 2020 jiao et al 2020 which could result in notable uncertainties in estimating human impacts van loon et al 2019 shah et al 2021 in this study we used observed monthly discharge of 7 gauging stations and yearly water withdrawal and water consumption of different water use sectors to calibrate and validate the pcr globwb 2 0 model at the huaihe river basin the results show that the calibrated model can well simulate the hydrological process of our study basin figs 2 4 albeit with the simulation of trends of water withdrawal and consumption still exhibits some uncertainties fig 4 a in fact trends of water use are difficult to be captured using global hydrological models ghms especially in china where policy interventions and technological adoptions are used to adjust water consumption wada et al 2014 zhou et al 2020 which is difficult to be parameterized in the hydrological model moreover the trend is not used as a performance criterion of simulation evaluation in many hydrological models hosseini moghari et al 2020 regarding model calibration and validation there are still some limitations and uncertainties that need to be solved in future first the parameters were calibrated by using spatially uniform adjustment factors table 1 over whole basin which does not consider the spatial variability of parameters therefore a new calibration strategy should be developed for making the adjustment factors and parameters change with soil type land use altitude or other characteristics lópez lópez et al 2017 second the pcr globwb model does not consider the inter basin water transfer wada et al 2016 for surface water withdrawal it abstracts water from simulated surface water based on the water availability at local or upstream grids along the river network for groundwater withdrawal it only abstracts the ground water renewable and nonrenewable groundwater from the local grids and if the amount of groundwater water withdrawal is larger than the available groundwater storage the unmet water demand will be imposed on the nonrenewable groundwater wada et al 2016 the north edge of our study basin is adjacent to the yellow river fig 1 and the water of yellow river is transferred regularly to the huaihe river basin to meet some unmet water demand which is not included in the pcr globwb model therefore the groundwater withdrawal especially the non renewable groundwater is likely overestimated by the model because some water demand is met by water transfers from yellow river in the reality but met by groundwater withdrawal in the model third due to data availability the observed data used for calibration and validation of water withdrawal and water consumption simulation are on annual time scale which neglects the inter annual variation of water use also the period of the water use data series used for comparison is relatively short with only 12 years of data samples 1999 2010 which cannot verify the accuracy of the whole simulation period 1981 2010 in addition the temporal variation less than a year of the model performance can also bring some uncertainties especially during periods of water shortage when framers tend to adjust their irrigation water use temporally to cope with drought which could enhance the societal resistance to droughts wada et al 2013 forth parameters of reservoirs were obtained from the global reservoir and dams dataset lehner et al 2011 which includes only 23 large and medium sized reservoirs in our study basin fig 1 whereas there are much more smaller reservoirs operated in the basin although the influence of small reservoirs is expected to be smaller than the influence of large and medium sized reservoirs because small reservoirs are usually located on smaller rivers and has relatively small capacities of storage the collective impacts of small reservoirs on hydrological drought characteristics could be significant a promising way to derive information of undocumented reservoirs is using high resolution remote sensing products for example a recent study busker et al 2019 estimated the volume of reservoirs in regions with sparse data by using the satellite altimetry in addition restricted by data availability it is difficult to parameterize the operation rules of each reservoir reservoir operation in pcr globwb 2 0 model was calibrated and validated using monthly discharge of 7 hydrological stations which may lead to biases in the parameterization of actual process of reservoir operation in our study basin therefore more data of irrigation water use and reservoir operation would be collected in the future to further calibrate and parameterize the model 6 conclusions in this study the scenario comparison approach was used to identify the impacts of different human activities i e iwu nwu and ro on hydrological drought based on the calibrated pcr globwb 2 0 model for the catchment above bengbu in the huaihe river basin the results show that the impacts of human activities on hydrological drought vary in both time and space from 1981 2010 nwu and iwu increases sdsd by about 119 and 214 over the entire study basin on average respectively the effects of iwu and nwu on sdsd show different spatial distribution characteristics nwu heavily increase the sdsd in most regions of the basin whereas in other regions with limited availability of surface water nwu reduce sdsd due to return flow of unconsumed water to surface water iwu has contrasting impacts on hydrological droughts between non paddy irrigation and paddy irrigation dominated regions iwu reduce sdsd in paddy irrigation dominated regions due to large quantities of water were transferred to those regions for paddy irrigation which requires a certain surface water depth over the paddy fields for flooding irrigation but increase the sdsd in rivers of those regions due to high quantity of water was abstracted from the rivers to meet the high water demand of paddy irrigation in contrast iwu increase sdsd in non paddy irrigation dominated regions because of most of water being withdrawn locally and comparatively small quantity of water being transferred to non paddy irrigation area ro not only reduce sdsd in downstream water receiving areas but also increase sdsd in the upstream regions generally for water supply during the period 1981 2010 and in 2008 2009 autumn winter drought ro alleviate sdsd in downstream water receiving area as well as rivers channel of downstream by releasing water mainly for drought resilience the results of this study can provide increased understanding of the impacts of different human water management activities on hydrological drought characteristics and provide actionable knowledge for improved water resource management and drought control under the changing environment further research should be focused on improving the parameterization of human activities e g reservoir regulation

8157,study region upper yangtze river basin china study focus the intensification of climate change and human activities leads to non stationarity of hydrological processes previous studies mainly focus on monthly hydrological or budyko models however it is a challenge that catchment hydrological responses to human activities for daily hydrological models this study aims to evaluate anthropogenic impacts on water yield of the upper yangtze river basin by representing the xinanjiang model parameters as functions of socio economic factors new hydrological insights the hydrological parameters wm soil water storage capacity and ke ratio of potential evaporation to pan evaporation increased in 1976 2000 while the parameter b non homogeneity of the soil water storage capacity declined it is further demonstrated that the population and the drainage area of reservoirs have the greatest impact on b and wm respectively their linear functional form is validated to be effective for improving streamflow simulation these findings can help understand the non stationarity of the rainfall runoff relationship due to increasing human development and contribute to adaptive development strategies for future water resource management keywords hydrological model time varying parameter human activities 1 introduction today the world population is more than 7 5 billion and is projected to increase to 9 billion in 2040 un 2019 due to the rapid population growth the extent of urbanization and socio economic development is unprecedented and highly influential in posing serious stresses on water resources gao et al 2019 lei et al 2018 paliaga et al 2020 wada et al 2017 xin et al 2019 xu et al 2014 hydrological simulation under human activities becomes a global major concern streamflow can be modified by human activities in a direct way chen et al 2020 jaramillo and destouni 2015 wang et al 2021 such as reservoir regulation gong et al 2021 ming et al 2018 and water consumption for the increasing demand of agricultural industrial and domestic uses another way is to cause changes in climate and land use land cover lulc li et al 2020a saha et al 2020 for example transforming natural slopes into terraces can improve soil conditions and water storage capacity which can further change the processes of runoff generation and routing this indicates that adaptive water management has been carried under the limited natural environment but it in turn has impacts on hydrological cycles both temporally and spatially this presents a great challenge for simulating streamflow in human hydrological systems and thus it is imperative to take account of anthropogenic influence in hydrological models for accurate streamflow prediction integrating human activities into hydrologic models is commonly seen in socio hydrologic studies an et al 2021 srinivasan 2015 van emmerik et al 2014 it is always based on the regional water balance model for example van emmerik et al 2014 presented a hydrology equation tracking the change of regional water storage on a daily time step they mainly considered excluding the amount of water for irrigation and including the amount of reservoir storage feng et al 2016 divided the impacts of human activities on water resources into two total consumptive water use for people s livelihoods and technical water use for power generation except for dynamics differential equations conceptual models are used for a detailed description of hydrologic processes and roust performance the soil and water assessment tool swat is employed to simulate hydrological fluxes and coupled with irrigation in a multi agent platform of social ecological systems in the work of martin et al 2016 lei et al 2018 proposed a budyko type framework to investigate the interactions between vegetation and human water consumption in general human activities such as irrigation and reservoir regulation are treated as external drivers by water storage or consumption the impacts of human activities on catchment hydrological processes i e runoff generation and routing processes are paid attention to in few studies parameters in conceptual hydrological models are crucial for presenting the runoff generation and routing processes xie et al 2021 some of which are with physical meaning bound up with the underlying surface conditions or watershed characteristics they are commonly treated as constant temporally however the presence of climatic variations and human activities can be measured using time varying parameters lan et al 2018 pathiraja et al 2016 stephens et al 2019 westra et al 2014 for example deng et al 2019 explored the correlations between the parameters of a monthly water balance model and some catchment characteristics i e precipitation potential evaporation and ndvi and then modeled the parameters with the influencing characteristics similarly in the work of jiang et al 2015 the budyko parameter is presented as the function of temperature potential evaporation and irrigated area of the weihe river basin however the existing literature lacks the capability of varying parameters in more complex models they always focus on hydrological models on monthly or inter annual time scales therefore the physical meaning is less evident compared with daily hydrological models this attempts us to evaluate the impacts of economic and social factors such as population gdp and dams which are seldom emphasized in literature on the time varying parameters of daily hydrological models with this study we aim to explore the variations in hydrologic processes in the context of increasing human activities and improve streamflow simulations through recognizing and establishing functions of hydrologic time varying parameters the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the methodology used in this study including the hydrological model sensitivity analysis the time varying parameter estimation method correlation analysis and the derivation of time varying parameter functions section 3 presents the study basin the upper yangtze river basin china and the sources of data the results and discussion are presented in sections 4 and 5 respectively finally conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 methodology the flowchart of the study is presented in fig 1 based on the available hydrologic data the sensitivity analysis is implemented for the xinanjiang model to find the sensitive parameters section 2 1 and 2 2 then the split sample calibration based on dynamic programming ssc dp is used to identify the time varying trajectories of the sensitive model parameters section 2 3 the relationship between climatic socio economic factors and the time varying parameters is quantified by the correlation analysis section 2 4 according to this the time varying parameter s function is derived by two methods section 2 5 the performances of various time varying parameter s functions are evaluated through different criteria section 2 6 2 1 hydrological modeling in this study the xinanjiang model zhao 1992 is used to simulate streamflow which is widely used in china hu et al 2019 li et al 2013 lu et al 2013 it can be used on a daily or sub daily scale with 15 parameters the input of the model is rainfall and pan evaporation the output is the streamflow at the outlet of the basin the model is composed of four modules as follows 1 evaporation the soil is divided into the upper lower and deep layers and the water storage capacity of them is wum wlm and wdm respectively 2 flow production the underlying surface of the basin is divided into permeable areas and impermeable areas in the permeable area the runoff is equal to the rainfall after saturation of the soil to describe the inhomogeneity of the watershed a soil moisture storage capacity distribution curve and its parameter b are introduced 3 runoff separation a free water capacity distribution curve divides the total runoff into the surface runoff interflow and groundwater the curve has two parameters sm and ex 4 flow concentration surface runoff is routed by the unit hydrograph method interflow and groundwater are routed by the linear reservoir method the flowchart is presented in fig 2 and the parameters are described in table 1 2 2 identification of sensitive parameters by using sensitivity analysis the morris method morris 1991 is a widely used parameter sensitivity method which can determine the influence of each parameter on the calibration metrics and reduce computational burdens the method is to change one of the parameters θ p and keep the other parameters unchanged the elementary effect e e p is used to judge the influence of parameter changes on the objective function presented as follows 1 e e p θ 1 θ 2 θ n p δ y θ 1 θ 2 θ p 1 θ p δ θ p 1 θ n p y θ 1 θ 2 θ n p δ where y represents the value of the objective function and n p is the total number of parameters the final sensitivity is determined by the mean value and standard deviation of e e p campolongo et al 2007 herman et al 2013 jie et al 2018 the mean value μ represents the influence of the individual parameter on the model output if μ is larger the parameter is considered to be more sensitive the standard deviation denotes the interaction between parameters the larger σ indicates stronger interaction 2 3 time varying parameter estimation using the ssc dp the methods to identify time varying parameters include the ensemble kalman filter and split sample calibration ssc etc for the daily hydrological models using ssc has lower calculation burdens and the parameters can be kept unchanged for a given period one month one season or one year in the conventional ssc method the hydrological time series is divided into n sub periods and the optimal set of parameters is determined for each sub period separately however different parameter sets can result in similar effects in each sub period dziubanski et al 2020 the estimated time varying parameters by the ssc tend to fluctuate significantly with time to solve these problems the ssc dp method zhang and liu 2021 is adopted in this study the method is implemented by considering the continuity of parameters based on conventional ssc the steps are as follows 1 divide the hydrological series into n sub periods for each sub period the mcmc markov chain monte carlo method chib and greenberg 1995 is implemented with the hydrological model to generated near optimal parameters the mcmc method is widely used in fields of hydrology and water resources jeremiah et al 2011 liu et al 2011 2014 zhang et al 2020 it generates initial parameters with a specific distribution updates the distribution based on the likelihood measure and derive the posterior distribution of parameter values a large number of near optimal parameters e g 10 000 are generated from the posterior distribution 2 merge simulation accuracy and parameter continuity into one single objective function for n sub periods to ensure that the calibrated time varying parameters have high simulation accuracy and low fluctuations the objective function is optimized by using dynamic programming bellman 1957 yang et al 2018 and its expression is shown as follows 2 m a x f i 1 n n s e i α p 1 n p θ i 1 p θ i p θ m a x p θ m i n p where θ i p is the p th estimated parameter over the i th sub period θ m a x p and θ m i n p are its maximum and minimum values respectively n p is the number of the parameters and α is the weight of parameter continuity 3 calculate the final model states of each sub period e g soil water content as the values of the initial states for the next sub period 4 loop step 1 to step 3 until the number of iterations reaches a certain value saying 30 in this study 2 4 selection of influence factors by using correlation analysis pearson correlation analysis is used to quantify the relationships between the time varying parameters and the climatic socio economic factors after standardization with the min max normalization method the value of pearson correlation coefficients closer to 1 indicates the stronger correlation relationship xu et al 2021 the significance is tested using the two tailed student s t test chen et al 2020 2 5 derivation of time varying parameters function through the correlation analysis results the functional relationship between time varying parameters and influence factors can be developed based on the previous research deng et al 2019 a linear relation is a simple and effective functional type with strong extensibility assuming that the time varying parameters are related to factor x the function expression can be constructed 3 θ i a b x i τ where a and b are constant parameters and τ is the time lag to obtain the values of a and b two methods are considered in this study 1 fitting the time varying parameters and the influence factors are fitted the values of a and b are obtained by the least square method the fitted function expression is embedded in the hydrological model by replacing the time varying parameter it is noted that other parameters remain constant values 2 recalibration the function expression is embedded into the model without the determination of a and b all parameters a and b are recalibrated during the calibration period the function expression is evaluated through validation if the evaluation indexes obtained by the function expression is improved significantly it means that x is an important influence factor 2 6 performance evaluation criteria the performance of the model is assessed by the nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 which is a widely used evaluation index in a perfect model prediction nse is equal to 1 the expression is as follows 4 n s e 1 i 1 n q i q i 2 i 1 n q i q i 2 it should be noted that the number of the parameters increases when the hydrologic model is embedded with the time varying parameter functions however the improvement of nse may be due to the increase in the number of parameters in some cases in some cases the improvement of nse may due to the increase in the number of parameters this over parameterization leads to more uncertainty in the model which is difficult to extend therefore aic is usually adopted for the evaluation of models with different parameter numbers however aic does not satisfy its assumption when the number of samples is too small hoge et al 2018 alternatively another index is adopted the structural risk minimization srm the identification results of which are proved to be more reliable than aic schoups et al 2008 the expression of the rpsrm is as follows 5 r p s r m 1 p p l n p l n n 2 n 1 1 n s e where p m n and m is considered as the number of parameters n is the length of the time series the lower rpsrm represents better performance 3 study basin and available data 3 1 study basin the yangtze river starts from the qinghai tibet plateau and runs through the mainland of china to the east china sea with a total length of 6 300 km it is the longest river in asia xu et al 2006 in this study we focus our research efforts on the upper yangtze river basin fig 3 i e from headwaters to the yichang station the upper yangtze river basin has been remarkably affected by human activities especially dam construction the total length of the river is 4 511 km and the controlled basin area is 979 200 square kilometers accounting for 58 9 of the total basin area of the yangtze river the administrative region includes tibet qinghai gansu shaanxi chongqing sichuan yunnan guizhou and hubei among which sichuan is the largest accounting for almost half 47 58 of the whole area of the upper reaches of the yangtze river most areas have a subtropical monsoon climate warm and humid zhang et al 2007 hence the xinanjiang model is used for application in this basin to investigate the aggregated and macroscopic influence of various human activities 3 2 available data the modeling period is from 1976 to 2010 the calibration period is 1976 2000 while the validation period is 2001 2010 since the precipitation pan evaporation and streamflow are hardly collected at a sub daily scale for such a long period the daily time step is used for the xinanjiang model the daily meteorological data of the upper reaches of the yangtze river are provided by the national meteorological information center http data cma cn from 73 hydrological stations including precipitation pan evaporation relative humidity sunshine duration average maximum minimum temperature and wind speed the mean areal rainfall is calculated by the tyson polygon method the mean areal values of other meteorological variables such as pan evaporation are obtained by the averaging method the daily outlet flow time series of the basin is obtained based on the measured data of yichang station which is about 44 km downstream of the three gorges reservoir since the measured streamflow has been significantly impacted by reservoir regulations it cannot be used for the hydrological model hong et al 2015 the flow data used were restored by the bureau of hydrology changjiang yangtze river water resources commission bh crwrc to reduce the impacts of the regulations the restored inflow was calculated through the water balance equation using the observed water level reservoir release and the reservoir stage volume curve of the three gorges dam the hydrologic and meteorological variables are plotted in fig 4 a it can be analyzed through the mann kendall test that the average maximum minimum temperature at ht and lt respectively increased significantly while sunshine duration sun and wind speed wv declined significantly the precipitation p runoff q and relative humidity wet displayed insignificant decreases and the pan evaporation pet presented an insignificant increasing tendency the data of the annual social and economic factors from1976 to 2010 are collected from the provincial statistical yearbook including population pop agricultural population apop urban population upop gdp agricultural area aa and irrigated area ia in terms of the reservoir construction the data of storage capacity vr and drainage area sr of the large reservoirs were obtained from the bh crwrc fig 4 b shows the annual variations of the socio economic factors it can be seen that the population agricultural population urban population gdp reservoir storage capacity and drainage area remarkably increased while the cultivated area declined the irrigated area had no significant trends from 1976 to 2010 given that the social and economic factors are collected on an annual scale the time varying parameters are considered to change annually for the ssc dp method to reflect the integrated responses of hydrologic processes over a year instead of a single event 4 result 4 1 estimation of the time varying parameters since the parameter estimation of the xinanjiang model are highly dimensionalized a sensitivity analysis should be used to identify the important parameters and reduce computational burdens fig 5 presents the results of the sensitivity analysis produced by the morris method fig 5 a shows that the parameter ke is far more sensitive than the other parameters with the μ value the mean of eep in eq 1 larger than 0 8 fig 5 b shows that the sensitivities of the parameters wm b sm ki and kg are close and the μ values are about 0 05 although the sensitivities are remarkably close only wm b and ke are considered to be sensitive in this study allowing for the computational burdens the three parameters are all considered as sensitive parameters that can change with human activities and climate variations while the insensitive parameters are kept constant during calibration the ssc dp is applied in the upper yangtze river basin for obtaining time varying parameter trajectories during the calibration period the mcmc ensemble size is set to 10 000 which is sufficient to find a large number of nearly optimal parameter sets the weight α balancing the accuracy of streamflow simulation and parameter continuity is critical for estimating time varying parameters several schemes based on different α are considered in this study to eliminate its impacts table 2 summarized the streamflow simulation performance of different schemes the nse values of the ssc dp schemes are always higher than that of the scheme using constant parameters c0 hence it is necessary for simulating streamflow of the upper yangtze river basin using time varying parameters scheme c1 with α equal to zero performs best with an improvement of the nse values of 2 51 compared with c0 scheme c2 c3 c4 and c5 are slightly inferior to c1 since they consider parameter continuity schemes c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 provide very close simulations thereafter the time varying parameter trajectories identified by the ssc dp are depicted in fig 6 it is apparent that the trajectories of schemes c4 and c5 fluctuate lower than those of schemes c1 c2 and c3 because of larger α a mann kendall test is applied to these parameter trajectories the wm estimated by the five schemes all increased the estimated ke had upward tendencies for all five schemes as for parameter b the estimations decreased from 1976 to 2010 4 2 relationships between the time varying parameters and influencing factors a correlation analysis is conducted between the time varying parameters and influencing factors the person correlation coefficients are illustrated in fig 7 in schemes c1 c2 and c3 the correlation coefficients are generally low and insignificant for wm ke and b however the correlation coefficients of parameter wm are higher with most social and economic factors in scheme c4 while in scheme c5 both parameters wm and b are highly correlated with most social and economic factors the parameter ke is moderately correlated with several climatic socio economic factors since wm b and ke are significantly correlated with some influencing factors therefore these factors are likely to be the causes of the changes in the hydrological parameters to determine the quantitative relationship between them a set of time varying parameter functions are constructed in the following section for parameter wm 16 influence factors are identified population pop agricultural population apop urban population upop gdp agricultural area aa and irrigated area ia storage capacity vr vr1 and drainage area sr sr1 relative humidity wet sunshine duration sun average temperature at minimum temperature lt wind speed wv and precipitation p for parameter b there are 17 factors with significant correlation coefficients population pop agricultural population apop urban population upop gdp agricultural area aa and irrigated area ia storage capacity vr vr1 and drainage area sr sr1 relative humidity wet sunshine duration sun average maximum minimum temperature at ht and lt respectively wind speed wv and pan evaporation pet it can be found that multiple significant indicators are related to parameters wm and b involving both human activities and climate changes the factors significantly correlated with ke are less including irrigated area ia relative humidity wet maximum temperature ht precipitation p and evaporation pet 4 3 performance of the empirical functions with time varying parameters linear empirical functions are developed and embedded in the xinanjiang model using the fitting and recalibration methods respectively 1 fitting the correlations are mostly significant between the influencing factors and time varying parameters of schemes c4 and c5 see fig 7 hence the linear fitting is conducted based on the time varying parameters of schemes c4 and c5 to reduce uncertainty although the identified parameters are all time variant in fig 6 over simulations can be caused if the functions of 3 parameters are all constructed and embedded in the hydrological model to avoid over estimations 7 sets of functions listed in table 3 are constructed by linear fitting between the identified time varying parameters and different influencing factors the functions are assessed by simulating runoff in calibration and validation periods the simulation performance of different functions is presented in fig 8 the dots with the same color refer to the functions of the same time varying parameters but with different covariates e g population gdp or precipitation in general the functions with time varying ke have lower nse than the ones with wm or b in calibration and validation periods besides most functions of wm b ke which have 3 time varying parameters do not perform better than the ones of wm b which have 2 time varying parameters according to the nse values for both calibration and validation periods the best performed functions using the fitting method are selected and labeled in fig 9 the nse and rpsrm values of which are listed in table 4 it can be seen that the function of wm with the covariate of lowest temperature yields the greatest nse improvement for scheme c4 while the wm b1 and wm b2 give the best performance in both calibration and validation periods for scheme c5 in terms of rpsrm the best empirical function for the upper yangtze river basin of wm is defined as wm t 137 522 sr1 t 2 498 95 and b t 2 874 aa t 0 204 however the improvement of this method is very limited since there is large uncertainty in the direct linear regression of the time varying parameters therefore recalibration is also adopted in this study 2 recalibration similar to the fitting method 3 cases of functions listed in table 3 are constructed by recalibration method between the identified time varying parameters and different influencing factors to reduce over estimations histograms in fig 9 shows the performance of the functions with one time varying parameters it can be seen that the function with the agricultural population covariate performs best in terms of the calibration and validation periods among the 16 factors influencing the parameter wm it is followed by the drainage area of the reservoirs the covariate of which performs slightly better than that of the agricultural population in the validation period but worse in the calibration period as for the parameter ke the covariate of irrigation area improves the values of the nse most in both calibration and validation periods among the 17 factors significantly correlated with parameter b the covariate of the total storage capacity of reservoirs yields the best performances for the whole period it is even superior to the optimal empirical functions of time varying ke and wm in cases 1 for the highest nse value in the validation period compared with scheme c0 the improvements in b1 are 1 18 and 2 71 for calibration and validation periods respectively fig 10 shows the performance of the functions with two time varying parameters it can be found that two empirical functions perform best for simultaneously employing time varying wm and b which are labeled in the fig 10 a overall the wm b1 gives the highest nse values for the whole period however the wm b2 performs better in the validation period in terms of simultaneously using time varying ke and b fig 10 b the ke b1 produces the best result when simultaneously using time varying wm and ke fig 10 c the wm ke1 has the highest nse value for the whole period while wm ke2 and wm ke3 perform better for the validation period overall the optimal empirical function in case 2 is wm b2 since the improvements of the nse values are most significant compared with scheme c0 i e 1 50 and 3 26 for calibration and validation periods respectively fig 11 shows the performance of the functions with three time varying parameters for case 3 four empirical functions yield the best performances using time varying wm ke and b which are labeled in fig 11 the equation wm ke b1 gives the best performance for the whole period but is inferior to the other equations for the nse values in the validation period therein wm ke b4 has the highest nse for validation overall the wm ke b3 is the optimal empirical function with the covariates of sunshine duration for wm the agricultural population for b and precipitation for ke the improvements of nse values are 1 55 and 3 15 compared with scheme c0 for calibration and validation periods respectively according to the nse for both calibration and validation periods the best performed functions using the recalibration method are selected and labeled in figs 9 11 the nse and rpsrm values of which are listed in table 5 it can be seen that the use of time varying parameter functions significantly reduces the values of the rpsrm indicating that the covariates embedded in the xinanjiang model are efficient however over parameterization occurs in the wm ke b3 the rpsrm of which is similar to that of wm b2 in the calibration period but higher than that in the validation period hence the best empirical functions for the upper yangtze river basin of wm and b are defined as wm t 132 25 sr t 0 049 and b t 2 974 pop t 1 0 149 for a visual representation fig 12 plots the hydrograph reproduced by the scheme c0 and the scheme using the wm b2 for both calibration and validation periods the wm b2 simulates peak discharge with higher accuracy the underestimation by the scheme c0 is significantly reduced by the dynamic scheme also the values of relative error of the scheme c0 is 2 17 and 7 50 during the calibration and validation periods respectively while those of the wm b2 decrease to 0 38 and 1 21 during the calibration and validation periods respectively it indicates that the wm b2 can simulate better not only the peak flow but also the runoff volume 4 4 runoff responses to variations in human activities hydrologic models are used to investigate the impacts of the changing environment on runoff by employing the constant parameters to forecast the future runoff however this method neglects the time variations of hydrologic processes under the human activities in the section 4 3 the best performed time varying parameter functions are obtained i e wm b2 which are related to the population and reservoir constructions based on the observed data of precipitation and pan evaporation in the upper yangtze river basin from 1976 to 2010 the wm b2 is used in this section with the xinanajing model to analyze the impacts of human activities by predicting future runoff while changing the population and reservoir construction conditions for example the factors of population and reservoirs increase or decline 5 10 which are used as the inputs to the wm b2 to predict the time varying parameter b and wm respectively then the estimated time varying parameters are embedded in the xinanjiang model to simulate the streamflow the total runoff volume simulated by the wm b2 with the unchanged population and reservoirs is set as a baseline compared with the baseline the runoff responses to variations in human activities can be obtained fig 13 presents the runoff responses to the variations of human activities it shows that for every 1 increase in population and the drainage area of the reservoirs the annual runoff volumes at yichang station decrease by 19 664 107 m3 and 40 099 105 m3 respectively the runoff response calculated by the constant parameters is 0 m3 it means that the constant parameters cannot predict the variations of future runoff if the population and reservoirs grow rapidly in the basin while the proposed function wm b2 can obtain the decreasing volumes of the runoff the development of economy and society causes agricultural industrial and domestic water demands increasing in the upper yangtze river basin while the growing population and reservoir constructions will reduce the runoff at the yichang station hence it is necessary to conduct the adaptive water resources management 5 discussion in contrast to previous studies investigating the response of runoff under a changing environment by using time varying parameters this study uses a daily hydrological model and an efficient time varying parameter identification method i e ssc dp based on fig 7 conventional ssc is not able to find that the climatic and social economic factors affect the runoff generation processes while the ssc dp considering parameter continuity provides useful information for correlation hence it is suggested to use the ssc dp to recognize the time varying parameters of the daily hydrological models three model parameters are selected based on sensitivity analysis wm ke and b wm means the soil water storage capacity which is a crucial parameter in both evaporation and runoff production the increase of the wm directly results in the decline of water yield because more water exists in the form of soil water the correlation analysis reveals that the changes of the wm are more associated with the socio economic factors fig 7 a especially the population and the drainage area of the reservoirs pearson correlation efficient 0 6 it is generally believed that the change in water yield responds to the lulc for example the forest and wetlands li et al 2020b pathiraja et al 2018 however this study suggests that the impacts of reservoirs cannot be overlooked the impacts of construction of reservoirs can be explained from 2 aspects 1 the water surface areas enlarge resulting in the rise of evaporation hence the runoff generation decreases 2 a part of water resources is stored in the reservoirs and the runoff in rivers reduces equivalent to increasing the soil water storage capacity of the basin ke describes the relationship between potential and pan evaporation the increase of ke produces larger potential evaporation elevates actual evaporation and reduces the water yield it is correlated more significantly with climatic factors such as relative wet highest temperature precipitation and potential evaporation while irrigation area is the only significantly important socio economic factor the reason that ke is related to irrigation area is possibly that the irrigation caused strong influence on the meteorological factors of the near surface atmosphere e g temperature vapor pressure and relative humidity which can change the actual evaporation han et al 2014 yang and zhong 2009 various functions of time varying ke are conducted to simulate the flows in the yichang station however it is found that the time varying ke functions k e a f a c t o r b embedded in the xinanjiang model are not best performed the reason can be that the variations of ke are simultaneously affected by multiple factors e g irrigation and climatic factors the time varying function should be k e a i r r i g a t i o n b c l i m a t i c f a c t o r 1 c c l i m a t i c f a c t o r 2 d hence the functions of ke are not efficient in this study b represents the non homogeneity of the soil water storage capacity strongly associated with wm it is also remarkably correlated with the socio economic factors such as population gdp and reservoirs when treating the parameter b as the function of population the performance of the xinanjiang model improves most it can be inferred that the population plays an important role in the variations of parameter b the reason may be the total population is an integrated factor of human activities which is considered important in driving water demand yang et al 2005 attributed the decrease in discharge of the lower reach of the yangtze river to water consumption and reservoir construction intensified water demand and reservoir construction tended to divert water from river or storage water in the reservoirs simultaneously increasing the evaporation hence the wm values of some regions increased which made the regions with larger wm rise and b reduce overall the water demand increases along with the development of society and economy and more reservoirs are constructed an intensification of the evaporation has been brought which changes the runoff generation 6 conclusions this study identifies the time varying parameters of the xinanjiang model by the ssc dp method investigates the interactions between the runoff generation parameters and climatic socio economic factors and derives the empirical functions with the important factors to better simulate the streamflow under a changing environment the conclusions are 1 the ssc dp is demonstrated to be efficient in identifying time varying parameters of the xinanjiang model compared with the conventional method through the ssc dp it is revealed that the soil water storage capacity wm and the ratio of potential evaporation to pan evaporation ke increased in the upper yangtze river basin from 1976 to 2010 while the non homogeneity of the soil water storage capacity b generally declined 2 the socio economic factors provide useful information for streamflow simulations under human activities for example the drainage area of reservoirs and population are the major influences for the variations of wm and b respectively climatic factors and irrigation are the combined causes of variations of ke 3 the proposed empirical function wm b2 with the covariates of population and drainage area of reservoirs effectively improves the nse in calibration and validation periods it also has more accurate simulations of peak flow and runoff volume based on the proposed empirical function the responses of the water yield under climatic change and human activities can be quantified further study focuses on embedding the proposed empirical function in the socio hydrological

8157,study region upper yangtze river basin china study focus the intensification of climate change and human activities leads to non stationarity of hydrological processes previous studies mainly focus on monthly hydrological or budyko models however it is a challenge that catchment hydrological responses to human activities for daily hydrological models this study aims to evaluate anthropogenic impacts on water yield of the upper yangtze river basin by representing the xinanjiang model parameters as functions of socio economic factors new hydrological insights the hydrological parameters wm soil water storage capacity and ke ratio of potential evaporation to pan evaporation increased in 1976 2000 while the parameter b non homogeneity of the soil water storage capacity declined it is further demonstrated that the population and the drainage area of reservoirs have the greatest impact on b and wm respectively their linear functional form is validated to be effective for improving streamflow simulation these findings can help understand the non stationarity of the rainfall runoff relationship due to increasing human development and contribute to adaptive development strategies for future water resource management keywords hydrological model time varying parameter human activities 1 introduction today the world population is more than 7 5 billion and is projected to increase to 9 billion in 2040 un 2019 due to the rapid population growth the extent of urbanization and socio economic development is unprecedented and highly influential in posing serious stresses on water resources gao et al 2019 lei et al 2018 paliaga et al 2020 wada et al 2017 xin et al 2019 xu et al 2014 hydrological simulation under human activities becomes a global major concern streamflow can be modified by human activities in a direct way chen et al 2020 jaramillo and destouni 2015 wang et al 2021 such as reservoir regulation gong et al 2021 ming et al 2018 and water consumption for the increasing demand of agricultural industrial and domestic uses another way is to cause changes in climate and land use land cover lulc li et al 2020a saha et al 2020 for example transforming natural slopes into terraces can improve soil conditions and water storage capacity which can further change the processes of runoff generation and routing this indicates that adaptive water management has been carried under the limited natural environment but it in turn has impacts on hydrological cycles both temporally and spatially this presents a great challenge for simulating streamflow in human hydrological systems and thus it is imperative to take account of anthropogenic influence in hydrological models for accurate streamflow prediction integrating human activities into hydrologic models is commonly seen in socio hydrologic studies an et al 2021 srinivasan 2015 van emmerik et al 2014 it is always based on the regional water balance model for example van emmerik et al 2014 presented a hydrology equation tracking the change of regional water storage on a daily time step they mainly considered excluding the amount of water for irrigation and including the amount of reservoir storage feng et al 2016 divided the impacts of human activities on water resources into two total consumptive water use for people s livelihoods and technical water use for power generation except for dynamics differential equations conceptual models are used for a detailed description of hydrologic processes and roust performance the soil and water assessment tool swat is employed to simulate hydrological fluxes and coupled with irrigation in a multi agent platform of social ecological systems in the work of martin et al 2016 lei et al 2018 proposed a budyko type framework to investigate the interactions between vegetation and human water consumption in general human activities such as irrigation and reservoir regulation are treated as external drivers by water storage or consumption the impacts of human activities on catchment hydrological processes i e runoff generation and routing processes are paid attention to in few studies parameters in conceptual hydrological models are crucial for presenting the runoff generation and routing processes xie et al 2021 some of which are with physical meaning bound up with the underlying surface conditions or watershed characteristics they are commonly treated as constant temporally however the presence of climatic variations and human activities can be measured using time varying parameters lan et al 2018 pathiraja et al 2016 stephens et al 2019 westra et al 2014 for example deng et al 2019 explored the correlations between the parameters of a monthly water balance model and some catchment characteristics i e precipitation potential evaporation and ndvi and then modeled the parameters with the influencing characteristics similarly in the work of jiang et al 2015 the budyko parameter is presented as the function of temperature potential evaporation and irrigated area of the weihe river basin however the existing literature lacks the capability of varying parameters in more complex models they always focus on hydrological models on monthly or inter annual time scales therefore the physical meaning is less evident compared with daily hydrological models this attempts us to evaluate the impacts of economic and social factors such as population gdp and dams which are seldom emphasized in literature on the time varying parameters of daily hydrological models with this study we aim to explore the variations in hydrologic processes in the context of increasing human activities and improve streamflow simulations through recognizing and establishing functions of hydrologic time varying parameters the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the methodology used in this study including the hydrological model sensitivity analysis the time varying parameter estimation method correlation analysis and the derivation of time varying parameter functions section 3 presents the study basin the upper yangtze river basin china and the sources of data the results and discussion are presented in sections 4 and 5 respectively finally conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 methodology the flowchart of the study is presented in fig 1 based on the available hydrologic data the sensitivity analysis is implemented for the xinanjiang model to find the sensitive parameters section 2 1 and 2 2 then the split sample calibration based on dynamic programming ssc dp is used to identify the time varying trajectories of the sensitive model parameters section 2 3 the relationship between climatic socio economic factors and the time varying parameters is quantified by the correlation analysis section 2 4 according to this the time varying parameter s function is derived by two methods section 2 5 the performances of various time varying parameter s functions are evaluated through different criteria section 2 6 2 1 hydrological modeling in this study the xinanjiang model zhao 1992 is used to simulate streamflow which is widely used in china hu et al 2019 li et al 2013 lu et al 2013 it can be used on a daily or sub daily scale with 15 parameters the input of the model is rainfall and pan evaporation the output is the streamflow at the outlet of the basin the model is composed of four modules as follows 1 evaporation the soil is divided into the upper lower and deep layers and the water storage capacity of them is wum wlm and wdm respectively 2 flow production the underlying surface of the basin is divided into permeable areas and impermeable areas in the permeable area the runoff is equal to the rainfall after saturation of the soil to describe the inhomogeneity of the watershed a soil moisture storage capacity distribution curve and its parameter b are introduced 3 runoff separation a free water capacity distribution curve divides the total runoff into the surface runoff interflow and groundwater the curve has two parameters sm and ex 4 flow concentration surface runoff is routed by the unit hydrograph method interflow and groundwater are routed by the linear reservoir method the flowchart is presented in fig 2 and the parameters are described in table 1 2 2 identification of sensitive parameters by using sensitivity analysis the morris method morris 1991 is a widely used parameter sensitivity method which can determine the influence of each parameter on the calibration metrics and reduce computational burdens the method is to change one of the parameters θ p and keep the other parameters unchanged the elementary effect e e p is used to judge the influence of parameter changes on the objective function presented as follows 1 e e p θ 1 θ 2 θ n p δ y θ 1 θ 2 θ p 1 θ p δ θ p 1 θ n p y θ 1 θ 2 θ n p δ where y represents the value of the objective function and n p is the total number of parameters the final sensitivity is determined by the mean value and standard deviation of e e p campolongo et al 2007 herman et al 2013 jie et al 2018 the mean value μ represents the influence of the individual parameter on the model output if μ is larger the parameter is considered to be more sensitive the standard deviation denotes the interaction between parameters the larger σ indicates stronger interaction 2 3 time varying parameter estimation using the ssc dp the methods to identify time varying parameters include the ensemble kalman filter and split sample calibration ssc etc for the daily hydrological models using ssc has lower calculation burdens and the parameters can be kept unchanged for a given period one month one season or one year in the conventional ssc method the hydrological time series is divided into n sub periods and the optimal set of parameters is determined for each sub period separately however different parameter sets can result in similar effects in each sub period dziubanski et al 2020 the estimated time varying parameters by the ssc tend to fluctuate significantly with time to solve these problems the ssc dp method zhang and liu 2021 is adopted in this study the method is implemented by considering the continuity of parameters based on conventional ssc the steps are as follows 1 divide the hydrological series into n sub periods for each sub period the mcmc markov chain monte carlo method chib and greenberg 1995 is implemented with the hydrological model to generated near optimal parameters the mcmc method is widely used in fields of hydrology and water resources jeremiah et al 2011 liu et al 2011 2014 zhang et al 2020 it generates initial parameters with a specific distribution updates the distribution based on the likelihood measure and derive the posterior distribution of parameter values a large number of near optimal parameters e g 10 000 are generated from the posterior distribution 2 merge simulation accuracy and parameter continuity into one single objective function for n sub periods to ensure that the calibrated time varying parameters have high simulation accuracy and low fluctuations the objective function is optimized by using dynamic programming bellman 1957 yang et al 2018 and its expression is shown as follows 2 m a x f i 1 n n s e i α p 1 n p θ i 1 p θ i p θ m a x p θ m i n p where θ i p is the p th estimated parameter over the i th sub period θ m a x p and θ m i n p are its maximum and minimum values respectively n p is the number of the parameters and α is the weight of parameter continuity 3 calculate the final model states of each sub period e g soil water content as the values of the initial states for the next sub period 4 loop step 1 to step 3 until the number of iterations reaches a certain value saying 30 in this study 2 4 selection of influence factors by using correlation analysis pearson correlation analysis is used to quantify the relationships between the time varying parameters and the climatic socio economic factors after standardization with the min max normalization method the value of pearson correlation coefficients closer to 1 indicates the stronger correlation relationship xu et al 2021 the significance is tested using the two tailed student s t test chen et al 2020 2 5 derivation of time varying parameters function through the correlation analysis results the functional relationship between time varying parameters and influence factors can be developed based on the previous research deng et al 2019 a linear relation is a simple and effective functional type with strong extensibility assuming that the time varying parameters are related to factor x the function expression can be constructed 3 θ i a b x i τ where a and b are constant parameters and τ is the time lag to obtain the values of a and b two methods are considered in this study 1 fitting the time varying parameters and the influence factors are fitted the values of a and b are obtained by the least square method the fitted function expression is embedded in the hydrological model by replacing the time varying parameter it is noted that other parameters remain constant values 2 recalibration the function expression is embedded into the model without the determination of a and b all parameters a and b are recalibrated during the calibration period the function expression is evaluated through validation if the evaluation indexes obtained by the function expression is improved significantly it means that x is an important influence factor 2 6 performance evaluation criteria the performance of the model is assessed by the nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 which is a widely used evaluation index in a perfect model prediction nse is equal to 1 the expression is as follows 4 n s e 1 i 1 n q i q i 2 i 1 n q i q i 2 it should be noted that the number of the parameters increases when the hydrologic model is embedded with the time varying parameter functions however the improvement of nse may be due to the increase in the number of parameters in some cases in some cases the improvement of nse may due to the increase in the number of parameters this over parameterization leads to more uncertainty in the model which is difficult to extend therefore aic is usually adopted for the evaluation of models with different parameter numbers however aic does not satisfy its assumption when the number of samples is too small hoge et al 2018 alternatively another index is adopted the structural risk minimization srm the identification results of which are proved to be more reliable than aic schoups et al 2008 the expression of the rpsrm is as follows 5 r p s r m 1 p p l n p l n n 2 n 1 1 n s e where p m n and m is considered as the number of parameters n is the length of the time series the lower rpsrm represents better performance 3 study basin and available data 3 1 study basin the yangtze river starts from the qinghai tibet plateau and runs through the mainland of china to the east china sea with a total length of 6 300 km it is the longest river in asia xu et al 2006 in this study we focus our research efforts on the upper yangtze river basin fig 3 i e from headwaters to the yichang station the upper yangtze river basin has been remarkably affected by human activities especially dam construction the total length of the river is 4 511 km and the controlled basin area is 979 200 square kilometers accounting for 58 9 of the total basin area of the yangtze river the administrative region includes tibet qinghai gansu shaanxi chongqing sichuan yunnan guizhou and hubei among which sichuan is the largest accounting for almost half 47 58 of the whole area of the upper reaches of the yangtze river most areas have a subtropical monsoon climate warm and humid zhang et al 2007 hence the xinanjiang model is used for application in this basin to investigate the aggregated and macroscopic influence of various human activities 3 2 available data the modeling period is from 1976 to 2010 the calibration period is 1976 2000 while the validation period is 2001 2010 since the precipitation pan evaporation and streamflow are hardly collected at a sub daily scale for such a long period the daily time step is used for the xinanjiang model the daily meteorological data of the upper reaches of the yangtze river are provided by the national meteorological information center http data cma cn from 73 hydrological stations including precipitation pan evaporation relative humidity sunshine duration average maximum minimum temperature and wind speed the mean areal rainfall is calculated by the tyson polygon method the mean areal values of other meteorological variables such as pan evaporation are obtained by the averaging method the daily outlet flow time series of the basin is obtained based on the measured data of yichang station which is about 44 km downstream of the three gorges reservoir since the measured streamflow has been significantly impacted by reservoir regulations it cannot be used for the hydrological model hong et al 2015 the flow data used were restored by the bureau of hydrology changjiang yangtze river water resources commission bh crwrc to reduce the impacts of the regulations the restored inflow was calculated through the water balance equation using the observed water level reservoir release and the reservoir stage volume curve of the three gorges dam the hydrologic and meteorological variables are plotted in fig 4 a it can be analyzed through the mann kendall test that the average maximum minimum temperature at ht and lt respectively increased significantly while sunshine duration sun and wind speed wv declined significantly the precipitation p runoff q and relative humidity wet displayed insignificant decreases and the pan evaporation pet presented an insignificant increasing tendency the data of the annual social and economic factors from1976 to 2010 are collected from the provincial statistical yearbook including population pop agricultural population apop urban population upop gdp agricultural area aa and irrigated area ia in terms of the reservoir construction the data of storage capacity vr and drainage area sr of the large reservoirs were obtained from the bh crwrc fig 4 b shows the annual variations of the socio economic factors it can be seen that the population agricultural population urban population gdp reservoir storage capacity and drainage area remarkably increased while the cultivated area declined the irrigated area had no significant trends from 1976 to 2010 given that the social and economic factors are collected on an annual scale the time varying parameters are considered to change annually for the ssc dp method to reflect the integrated responses of hydrologic processes over a year instead of a single event 4 result 4 1 estimation of the time varying parameters since the parameter estimation of the xinanjiang model are highly dimensionalized a sensitivity analysis should be used to identify the important parameters and reduce computational burdens fig 5 presents the results of the sensitivity analysis produced by the morris method fig 5 a shows that the parameter ke is far more sensitive than the other parameters with the μ value the mean of eep in eq 1 larger than 0 8 fig 5 b shows that the sensitivities of the parameters wm b sm ki and kg are close and the μ values are about 0 05 although the sensitivities are remarkably close only wm b and ke are considered to be sensitive in this study allowing for the computational burdens the three parameters are all considered as sensitive parameters that can change with human activities and climate variations while the insensitive parameters are kept constant during calibration the ssc dp is applied in the upper yangtze river basin for obtaining time varying parameter trajectories during the calibration period the mcmc ensemble size is set to 10 000 which is sufficient to find a large number of nearly optimal parameter sets the weight α balancing the accuracy of streamflow simulation and parameter continuity is critical for estimating time varying parameters several schemes based on different α are considered in this study to eliminate its impacts table 2 summarized the streamflow simulation performance of different schemes the nse values of the ssc dp schemes are always higher than that of the scheme using constant parameters c0 hence it is necessary for simulating streamflow of the upper yangtze river basin using time varying parameters scheme c1 with α equal to zero performs best with an improvement of the nse values of 2 51 compared with c0 scheme c2 c3 c4 and c5 are slightly inferior to c1 since they consider parameter continuity schemes c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 provide very close simulations thereafter the time varying parameter trajectories identified by the ssc dp are depicted in fig 6 it is apparent that the trajectories of schemes c4 and c5 fluctuate lower than those of schemes c1 c2 and c3 because of larger α a mann kendall test is applied to these parameter trajectories the wm estimated by the five schemes all increased the estimated ke had upward tendencies for all five schemes as for parameter b the estimations decreased from 1976 to 2010 4 2 relationships between the time varying parameters and influencing factors a correlation analysis is conducted between the time varying parameters and influencing factors the person correlation coefficients are illustrated in fig 7 in schemes c1 c2 and c3 the correlation coefficients are generally low and insignificant for wm ke and b however the correlation coefficients of parameter wm are higher with most social and economic factors in scheme c4 while in scheme c5 both parameters wm and b are highly correlated with most social and economic factors the parameter ke is moderately correlated with several climatic socio economic factors since wm b and ke are significantly correlated with some influencing factors therefore these factors are likely to be the causes of the changes in the hydrological parameters to determine the quantitative relationship between them a set of time varying parameter functions are constructed in the following section for parameter wm 16 influence factors are identified population pop agricultural population apop urban population upop gdp agricultural area aa and irrigated area ia storage capacity vr vr1 and drainage area sr sr1 relative humidity wet sunshine duration sun average temperature at minimum temperature lt wind speed wv and precipitation p for parameter b there are 17 factors with significant correlation coefficients population pop agricultural population apop urban population upop gdp agricultural area aa and irrigated area ia storage capacity vr vr1 and drainage area sr sr1 relative humidity wet sunshine duration sun average maximum minimum temperature at ht and lt respectively wind speed wv and pan evaporation pet it can be found that multiple significant indicators are related to parameters wm and b involving both human activities and climate changes the factors significantly correlated with ke are less including irrigated area ia relative humidity wet maximum temperature ht precipitation p and evaporation pet 4 3 performance of the empirical functions with time varying parameters linear empirical functions are developed and embedded in the xinanjiang model using the fitting and recalibration methods respectively 1 fitting the correlations are mostly significant between the influencing factors and time varying parameters of schemes c4 and c5 see fig 7 hence the linear fitting is conducted based on the time varying parameters of schemes c4 and c5 to reduce uncertainty although the identified parameters are all time variant in fig 6 over simulations can be caused if the functions of 3 parameters are all constructed and embedded in the hydrological model to avoid over estimations 7 sets of functions listed in table 3 are constructed by linear fitting between the identified time varying parameters and different influencing factors the functions are assessed by simulating runoff in calibration and validation periods the simulation performance of different functions is presented in fig 8 the dots with the same color refer to the functions of the same time varying parameters but with different covariates e g population gdp or precipitation in general the functions with time varying ke have lower nse than the ones with wm or b in calibration and validation periods besides most functions of wm b ke which have 3 time varying parameters do not perform better than the ones of wm b which have 2 time varying parameters according to the nse values for both calibration and validation periods the best performed functions using the fitting method are selected and labeled in fig 9 the nse and rpsrm values of which are listed in table 4 it can be seen that the function of wm with the covariate of lowest temperature yields the greatest nse improvement for scheme c4 while the wm b1 and wm b2 give the best performance in both calibration and validation periods for scheme c5 in terms of rpsrm the best empirical function for the upper yangtze river basin of wm is defined as wm t 137 522 sr1 t 2 498 95 and b t 2 874 aa t 0 204 however the improvement of this method is very limited since there is large uncertainty in the direct linear regression of the time varying parameters therefore recalibration is also adopted in this study 2 recalibration similar to the fitting method 3 cases of functions listed in table 3 are constructed by recalibration method between the identified time varying parameters and different influencing factors to reduce over estimations histograms in fig 9 shows the performance of the functions with one time varying parameters it can be seen that the function with the agricultural population covariate performs best in terms of the calibration and validation periods among the 16 factors influencing the parameter wm it is followed by the drainage area of the reservoirs the covariate of which performs slightly better than that of the agricultural population in the validation period but worse in the calibration period as for the parameter ke the covariate of irrigation area improves the values of the nse most in both calibration and validation periods among the 17 factors significantly correlated with parameter b the covariate of the total storage capacity of reservoirs yields the best performances for the whole period it is even superior to the optimal empirical functions of time varying ke and wm in cases 1 for the highest nse value in the validation period compared with scheme c0 the improvements in b1 are 1 18 and 2 71 for calibration and validation periods respectively fig 10 shows the performance of the functions with two time varying parameters it can be found that two empirical functions perform best for simultaneously employing time varying wm and b which are labeled in the fig 10 a overall the wm b1 gives the highest nse values for the whole period however the wm b2 performs better in the validation period in terms of simultaneously using time varying ke and b fig 10 b the ke b1 produces the best result when simultaneously using time varying wm and ke fig 10 c the wm ke1 has the highest nse value for the whole period while wm ke2 and wm ke3 perform better for the validation period overall the optimal empirical function in case 2 is wm b2 since the improvements of the nse values are most significant compared with scheme c0 i e 1 50 and 3 26 for calibration and validation periods respectively fig 11 shows the performance of the functions with three time varying parameters for case 3 four empirical functions yield the best performances using time varying wm ke and b which are labeled in fig 11 the equation wm ke b1 gives the best performance for the whole period but is inferior to the other equations for the nse values in the validation period therein wm ke b4 has the highest nse for validation overall the wm ke b3 is the optimal empirical function with the covariates of sunshine duration for wm the agricultural population for b and precipitation for ke the improvements of nse values are 1 55 and 3 15 compared with scheme c0 for calibration and validation periods respectively according to the nse for both calibration and validation periods the best performed functions using the recalibration method are selected and labeled in figs 9 11 the nse and rpsrm values of which are listed in table 5 it can be seen that the use of time varying parameter functions significantly reduces the values of the rpsrm indicating that the covariates embedded in the xinanjiang model are efficient however over parameterization occurs in the wm ke b3 the rpsrm of which is similar to that of wm b2 in the calibration period but higher than that in the validation period hence the best empirical functions for the upper yangtze river basin of wm and b are defined as wm t 132 25 sr t 0 049 and b t 2 974 pop t 1 0 149 for a visual representation fig 12 plots the hydrograph reproduced by the scheme c0 and the scheme using the wm b2 for both calibration and validation periods the wm b2 simulates peak discharge with higher accuracy the underestimation by the scheme c0 is significantly reduced by the dynamic scheme also the values of relative error of the scheme c0 is 2 17 and 7 50 during the calibration and validation periods respectively while those of the wm b2 decrease to 0 38 and 1 21 during the calibration and validation periods respectively it indicates that the wm b2 can simulate better not only the peak flow but also the runoff volume 4 4 runoff responses to variations in human activities hydrologic models are used to investigate the impacts of the changing environment on runoff by employing the constant parameters to forecast the future runoff however this method neglects the time variations of hydrologic processes under the human activities in the section 4 3 the best performed time varying parameter functions are obtained i e wm b2 which are related to the population and reservoir constructions based on the observed data of precipitation and pan evaporation in the upper yangtze river basin from 1976 to 2010 the wm b2 is used in this section with the xinanajing model to analyze the impacts of human activities by predicting future runoff while changing the population and reservoir construction conditions for example the factors of population and reservoirs increase or decline 5 10 which are used as the inputs to the wm b2 to predict the time varying parameter b and wm respectively then the estimated time varying parameters are embedded in the xinanjiang model to simulate the streamflow the total runoff volume simulated by the wm b2 with the unchanged population and reservoirs is set as a baseline compared with the baseline the runoff responses to variations in human activities can be obtained fig 13 presents the runoff responses to the variations of human activities it shows that for every 1 increase in population and the drainage area of the reservoirs the annual runoff volumes at yichang station decrease by 19 664 107 m3 and 40 099 105 m3 respectively the runoff response calculated by the constant parameters is 0 m3 it means that the constant parameters cannot predict the variations of future runoff if the population and reservoirs grow rapidly in the basin while the proposed function wm b2 can obtain the decreasing volumes of the runoff the development of economy and society causes agricultural industrial and domestic water demands increasing in the upper yangtze river basin while the growing population and reservoir constructions will reduce the runoff at the yichang station hence it is necessary to conduct the adaptive water resources management 5 discussion in contrast to previous studies investigating the response of runoff under a changing environment by using time varying parameters this study uses a daily hydrological model and an efficient time varying parameter identification method i e ssc dp based on fig 7 conventional ssc is not able to find that the climatic and social economic factors affect the runoff generation processes while the ssc dp considering parameter continuity provides useful information for correlation hence it is suggested to use the ssc dp to recognize the time varying parameters of the daily hydrological models three model parameters are selected based on sensitivity analysis wm ke and b wm means the soil water storage capacity which is a crucial parameter in both evaporation and runoff production the increase of the wm directly results in the decline of water yield because more water exists in the form of soil water the correlation analysis reveals that the changes of the wm are more associated with the socio economic factors fig 7 a especially the population and the drainage area of the reservoirs pearson correlation efficient 0 6 it is generally believed that the change in water yield responds to the lulc for example the forest and wetlands li et al 2020b pathiraja et al 2018 however this study suggests that the impacts of reservoirs cannot be overlooked the impacts of construction of reservoirs can be explained from 2 aspects 1 the water surface areas enlarge resulting in the rise of evaporation hence the runoff generation decreases 2 a part of water resources is stored in the reservoirs and the runoff in rivers reduces equivalent to increasing the soil water storage capacity of the basin ke describes the relationship between potential and pan evaporation the increase of ke produces larger potential evaporation elevates actual evaporation and reduces the water yield it is correlated more significantly with climatic factors such as relative wet highest temperature precipitation and potential evaporation while irrigation area is the only significantly important socio economic factor the reason that ke is related to irrigation area is possibly that the irrigation caused strong influence on the meteorological factors of the near surface atmosphere e g temperature vapor pressure and relative humidity which can change the actual evaporation han et al 2014 yang and zhong 2009 various functions of time varying ke are conducted to simulate the flows in the yichang station however it is found that the time varying ke functions k e a f a c t o r b embedded in the xinanjiang model are not best performed the reason can be that the variations of ke are simultaneously affected by multiple factors e g irrigation and climatic factors the time varying function should be k e a i r r i g a t i o n b c l i m a t i c f a c t o r 1 c c l i m a t i c f a c t o r 2 d hence the functions of ke are not efficient in this study b represents the non homogeneity of the soil water storage capacity strongly associated with wm it is also remarkably correlated with the socio economic factors such as population gdp and reservoirs when treating the parameter b as the function of population the performance of the xinanjiang model improves most it can be inferred that the population plays an important role in the variations of parameter b the reason may be the total population is an integrated factor of human activities which is considered important in driving water demand yang et al 2005 attributed the decrease in discharge of the lower reach of the yangtze river to water consumption and reservoir construction intensified water demand and reservoir construction tended to divert water from river or storage water in the reservoirs simultaneously increasing the evaporation hence the wm values of some regions increased which made the regions with larger wm rise and b reduce overall the water demand increases along with the development of society and economy and more reservoirs are constructed an intensification of the evaporation has been brought which changes the runoff generation 6 conclusions this study identifies the time varying parameters of the xinanjiang model by the ssc dp method investigates the interactions between the runoff generation parameters and climatic socio economic factors and derives the empirical functions with the important factors to better simulate the streamflow under a changing environment the conclusions are 1 the ssc dp is demonstrated to be efficient in identifying time varying parameters of the xinanjiang model compared with the conventional method through the ssc dp it is revealed that the soil water storage capacity wm and the ratio of potential evaporation to pan evaporation ke increased in the upper yangtze river basin from 1976 to 2010 while the non homogeneity of the soil water storage capacity b generally declined 2 the socio economic factors provide useful information for streamflow simulations under human activities for example the drainage area of reservoirs and population are the major influences for the variations of wm and b respectively climatic factors and irrigation are the combined causes of variations of ke 3 the proposed empirical function wm b2 with the covariates of population and drainage area of reservoirs effectively improves the nse in calibration and validation periods it also has more accurate simulations of peak flow and runoff volume based on the proposed empirical function the responses of the water yield under climatic change and human activities can be quantified further study focuses on embedding the proposed empirical function in the socio hydrological

8158,study region poyang lake basin china study focus this study aimed to investigate whether there are non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation in the poyang lake basin plb of china and the trends of non stationary characteristics from 1959 to 2019 the spatio temporal variations of extreme precipitation were analysed from three fundamental aspects duration frequency and intensity based on the prewhitening mann kendall pwmk test non stationary variations and the risk of extreme precipitation were investigated based on the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss new hydrological insights for the region 1 the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation increased significantly whereas there was a significant decrease in extreme precipitation duration in the plb 2 the duration of extreme precipitation showed significant non stationary characteristics in the western plb at the nanchang site 83 3 of the extreme precipitation intensity indices showed non stationary characteristics the rx1day maximum 1 day precipitation amount and rx5day maximum 5 day precipitation amount increased significantly for different return periods under non stationary conditions in the northwestern plb 3 the risk of extreme precipitation can be captured using the gamlss the stationary method underestimated the extreme precipitation intensity e g rx1day compared to the gamlss for longer return periods in the plb more attention should be paid to the increase and fluctuation of the return period of extreme precipitation caused by the mean non stationarity and variance non stationarity keywords non stationary spatio temporal variation extreme precipitation poyang lake basin gamlss 1 introduction climate change particularly extreme weather events has attracted considerable attention in recent decades gudmundsson et al 2021 zou et al 2021 the fifth intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report provided clear evidence of global warming from 1880 to 2012 the average global surface temperature increased by approximately 0 85 c ipcc 2014 compared with the average climate extreme climatic events are more sensitive to climate change gao et al 2017 and the trend of change is stronger khan et al 2020 therefore in the context of global warming the intensity and frequency of extreme events have changed significantly ali et al 2018 gao et al 2020 kundzewicz et al 2020 in recent years there has been an increase in the frequency of extreme high temperature and extreme precipitation events alexander 2016 and extreme precipitation events are positively correlated with temperature increases ali et al 2018 gao et al 2020 the global increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events not only leads to serious natural hazards such as floods tang et al 2021 and landslides and debris flows ingram 2016 but also causes substantial human and economic losses lu et al 2021 global extreme weather event variability and trends have shown significant changes and many previous studies have shown that china experiences frequent extreme precipitation events li and chen 2021 lu et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 as the largest freshwater lake in china poyang lake has strategic importance in sustaining the surrounding ecological environment several studies have found that climate change and human activity have caused more extreme precipitation events and floods in the poyang lake basin plb in the recent decades li et al 2021 ma et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 which has severely affected the stability of the surrounding environment zhan et al 2019 the effects of human activities on climate change mainly correspond to the frequent use of fossil fuels massive greenhouse gas emissions land use and land cover change and construction of reservoirs xin et al 2019 in addition previous studies have shown that the east asian summer monsoon easm zou and ren 2015 el niño southern oscillation enso north atlantic oscillation nao indian ocean dipole iod and pacific decadal oscillation pdo are significantly associated with extreme precipitation events in the plb particularly enso xiao et al 2015 li and hu 2019 used a group of extreme precipitation related indices based on the mann kendall mk trend test kendall 1975 mann 1945 and found an intensified trend of extreme precipitation events in the plb during 1960 2012 zhang et al 2015 used 15 rain gauges and the mk trend test and found that precipitation changes intensified as reflected by increased precipitation extremes most existing studies are based on the mk trend test to identify whether significant trends exist in hydro meteorological time series however there are autocorrelation effects in the hydrometeorological time series which can lead to errors in the trends das and scaringi 2021 o brien et al 2021 moreover the stationary and non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation events have become a hot issue in climate change research sun et al 2018 studies based on the stationarity assumption indicated that sample series obeyed the same distribution in the past present and future however in a changing environment climate change and human activities significantly influence the intensity frequency and duration of extreme precipitation events gao et al 2018 so the conventional stationarity hypothesis is no longer suitable for flood risk assessment and hydrological project design gao et al 2017 2018 however most existing flood protection design standards are based on assumptions of stationarity when calculating storm return periods which can lead to distortion of the standards lu et al 2020 mirdashtvan and mohseni saravi 2020 therefore when studying extreme precipitation non stationary characteristics need to be tested to ensure the accuracy of the results sun et al 2018 rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 proposed a non stationary analysis model called generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss which has been widely used for the simulation and attribution analysis of runoff changes by constructing linear nonlinear parametric and non parametric relationships between distribution function parameters and multiple explanatory variables chen et al 2021 used the peak flow series from 158 gauges in the uk based on gamlss moreover previous studies have shown that gamlss has good applicability in investigating the non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation in the southeast coastal region of china gao et al 2017 it is important to assess the trend of extreme precipitation events and analyze the stationary and non stationary characteristics of plb to reduce the effects of natural disaster reduction and management of water resources to achieve this the prewhitening mk pwmk test yue and wang 2002 which eliminates autocorrelation in meteorological and hydrological series was selected for trend testing the gamlss which is based on the location scale and shape parameters was selected for non stationary analysis the objectives were to 1 analyze the spatio temporal variation in extreme precipitation 2 detect the non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation and 3 investigate the recurrence risk of extreme precipitation events the outcome of this study can provide effective scientific support for reducing the effects of extreme precipitation events in the plb the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the data and methods used in this study section 3 elaborates the results analysis and the discussion and conclusions are presented in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 data and methods 2 1 meteorological observations as an important storage lake in the yangtze river basin poyang lake plays an important supplementary role in maintaining water sources and protecting ecological diversity lei et al 2021 the plb extends between 113 74 118 47 e and 24 57 30 01 n with a drainage basin area of 16 22 104 km2 the plb has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 1664 mm the plb has low elevation in the middle and high elevations including high mountains hills and plains the lake receives water flows mainly from five rivers ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui there are 16 meteorological stations conducting long term consecutive measurements in the plb fig 1 the measurements were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system of the national meteorological information center http data cma cn for 1959 2019 all the selected stations can reflect the rainfall trend with no gaps exceeding two consecutive weeks the quality of the observations was rigorously tested by the provider and we performed quality control and error analysis on all data before conducting the analysis to ensure the authenticity and accuracy of the data 2 2 methods 2 2 1 extreme precipitation indices the extreme climate indices are a series of climate indices provided by the expert team on climate change detection monitoring and indices etccdmi based on daily temperature and precipitation data extreme precipitation indices were calculated to detect the non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation events table 1 these indices were computed using the rclimdex software zhang and yang 2004 the calculation process of rclimdex includes data quality control homogenization tests and index calculations there are 11 extreme precipitation indices recommended by etccdmi and rnn was modified to r1mm and r50 mm in this study based on different classification criteria the extreme precipitation indices can be divided into different categories which can be classified into monthly extreme precipitation indices and annual extreme precipitation indices based on different time scales and into absolute threshold indices and relative threshold indices based on different threshold classification methods alexander et al 2019 for example croitoru et al 2013 classified extreme precipitation indices into two categories based on frequency and intensity yao et al 2020 classified extreme precipitation indices into four categories based on intensity percentile threshold frequency and duration based on the rainfall characteristics of the study area we classified these 12 extreme precipitation indices into the following three categories 1 duration indices including cdd and cwd 2 frequency indices including r1mm r10 mm r20 mm and r50 mm and 3 intensity indices including rx1day rx5day sdii r95p r99p and prcptot 2 2 2 trend analysis the mk test is a non parametric test recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo for time series analysis and is widely used for trend testing of hydrological and meteorological elements however in the application process the autocorrelation of hydrological and meteorological elements often causes the elements with insignificant trends to become significant thus it should be noted that the results of the mk test were affected by autocorrelation of the time series it is essential to keep the time series serially independent before performing the trend test the pwmk test yue and wang 2002 which can eliminate autocorrelation in the series and maintain consistency with the overall trend of the mk test results was considered for trend testing in this study previous studies have used the prewhitening procedure before trend detection o brien et al 2021 wu et al 2021 xu and tang 2021 the results showed that this method is more reasonable than the mk test and improves the accuracy of the trend test in this study the prewhitening procedure was applied by the following steps first eliminating the linear trend of raw series 1 y t x t β t where y t x t and β t are the de trended series raw series value and linear regression slope of the trend in the raw series at time t respectively second removing the autocorrelation term from the de trended series 2 y t y t r 1 y t 1 where r 1 is the lag 1 serial correlation coefficient of the de trended series and y t is the de trended and pre whitened series called the residual series finally we added the linear trend that was eliminated in the first step back to the de trended or residual series 3 y t y t β t where y t is the pre whitened series 2 2 3 gamlss model the gamlss model can establish the relationship between the statistical parameters of the response variables location scale shape etc and explanatory variables based on fitting the location scale and shape parameters with an addable semi parametric or non parametric term or a random effects term rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 the ability to introduce multiple explanatory variables is a remarkable advantage of the gamlss in this study we used a semi parametric gamlss model suppose there are n independent observations y i i 1 n which follow a distribution of f y y i θ i in this case θ i corresponds to the location parameter mean mn median etc the scale parameter variance var mean square etc and the shape parameter skewness coefficient kurtosis coefficient where θ i t θ i 1 θ i 2 θ i k represents the k parameters position scale and shape vector and k is usually less than 4 the formula is as follows 4 g k θ k x k β k j 1 m h j k x j k where θ k is a vector of length n x k is an n m matrix of explanatory variables and β k is a vector of parameters of length m h j k represents the functional relationship between the distribution parameters and the explanatory variables x j k this model is widely used for risk assessment of extreme precipitation events and has been shown to outperform traditional distribution models chen et al 2021 gao et al 2018 here we briefly describe the application of the gamlss model in this study the changes in mn and var of the extreme precipitation series indicate that they exhibit non stationary characteristics gao et al 2018 therefore the mn and var of the extreme precipitation series were used to characterize the location and scale parameters in the gamlss model respectively moreover the effect of the random term on the model was not considered in this study the functional relationship between the statistical parameters mean θ 1 and variance θ 2 and the unique explanatory variable time t is as follows 5 g 1 θ 1 t β 1 6 g 2 θ 2 t β 2 the common types of distribution functions are listed in table 2 the parameters of the distribution functions are mn and var of the extreme precipitation series common trend line type expressions are summarized in table 3 in this study we considered a series in which mn and var exhibit a non linear trend with non stationarity 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal variation in extreme precipitation 3 1 1 temporal variation of extreme precipitation indices fig 2 illustrates the temporal variation of extreme precipitation indices from 1959 to 2019 in the plb in general all indices except cdd cwd and r1mm showed a linearly increasing trend the duration indices decreased and the intensive and frequent indices increased for the duration indices cdd showed a significant downward trend between 1960 and 1973 with a sudden increase to a peak of 43 days in 1974 and showed a slow downward trend thereafter similar to cdd cwd showed a decreasing trend until 1975 with a peak of 24 days in 1999 and a minimum of 9 days in 1989 1991 and 2006 for the frequency indices the decreasing trend of r1mm was not significant reaching a minimum value of 148 days in 2003 and gradually increasing thereafter r10 mm r20 mm and r50 mm all showed an upward trend with r20 mm showing largest upward trend note that some years have zero values of r50 mm during the time series which was due to the limitations of the thiessen polygon interpolation for the intensity indices both r95p and r99p showed a long term increasing trend in the time series r95p showed a clear upward trend after 1978 but showed decreasing trend during 2000 2009 and showed an upward trend thereafter in contrast the fluctuating trend of r99p was highly variable with a total of 16 years with zero values but with extreme values of 300 mm in both 1994 and 1998 and a continuous increasing trend after 2017 we also found that the trends of rx1day and rx5day were similar but that of rx5day was more volatile rx1day reached a maximum of 101 mm in 2001 rx5day showed a decreasing trend from 1967 to 1979 and increased thereafter sdii varied between 6 8 mm day in 1963 and 11 7 mm day in 1998 with a significant increase over the entire study period there was a visible upward trend in prcptot but a low value range was observed between 2000 and 2009 table 4 illustrates that except for cdd and cwd the other extreme precipitation indices showed an increasing trend at different confidence levels from 1959 to 2019 for r20 mm r95p and sdii these indices showed a significant increasing trend at the 0 1 significance level 3 1 2 spatial variation of extreme precipitation indices the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation indices in the plb showed an increasing trend during the past 61 years while the duration showed a decreasing trend fig 3 in terms of the duration of extreme precipitation indices more stations showed decreased trends in duration indices than those with increasing trends the frequency indices showed an increasing trend for all stations except ganzhou and guangchang the intensity indices showed an increasing trend at all stations except boyang with yichun and nancheng reaching a significance level of 0 05 geographically these results illustrate that the extreme precipitation intensity and frequency over the central plb have increased however extreme precipitation events in the northwestern and southwestern regions of the basin showed less variability fig 4 shows the pwmk trend for 12 extreme precipitation indices in plb at different confidence levels from 1959 to 2019 for the duration indices cdd and cwd showed increasing trends in the southern and northern parts of the plb respectively for the frequency indices r1mm showed a decrease in the southern part of plb and an increase in the northern part as the threshold increased an increasing trend from r10 mm to r50 mm across the entire basin was observed zhangshu and nancheng showed a significant increasing trend of r50 mm at 0 05 significance level nanxiong and guangchang were the exceptions in terms of intensity indices r95p showed an increasing trend across the basin and for seven stations it reached the 0 05 significance level however compared to the trends at r95p boyang and jinggangshan exhibited increasing trends at r99p additionally at 13 out of 16 stations rx1day and rx5day were dominated by a not significant increasing tendency we observed an overall increasing tendency of the sdii and six stations at 0 05 significance level prcptot showed an increasing trend at all stations except for nanxiong table 5 shows that most stations 93 75 in the plb had increasing trends with the most significant increasing trend in zhangshu and jinggangshan however there was a decreasing trend in the extreme precipitation indices of about 30 or more at stations such as nanxiong boyang and ji an table 6 shows that 75 of the extreme precipitation indices showed increasing trends at each station with r20 mm r50 mm r95p rx1day and sdii showing increasing trends at more than 13 stations fewer stations showed no trend and only cwd r10 mm r99p and prcptot showed no trend at individual stations in contrast cdd cwd and r1mm showed decreasing trend at more than 50 of stations with r1mm decreasing at approximately 60 of the 16 stations 3 2 non stationary variation of extreme precipitation indices to assess the degree of goodness of fit between the statistical model and fitted data the minimum akaike information criterion aic value was selected the results of the optimal gamlss model obtained using the aic criterion tables 7 9 showed that more than half of the extreme precipitation indices at 81 25 of the stations in the plb exhibited stationary characteristics and the optimal distribution type was igamma with a line shape of 1 that is a linear trend in mn and no trend in var in general the extreme precipitation indices at each station were dominated by stationary characteristics table 8 with a maximum number distribution of igamma and a maximum number linearity of 1 these results indicate that the stations can be divided into three categories those with significant stationary characteristics xiushui yichun ganzhou nanxiong jingdezhen guixi yushan nancheng and guangchang those with a balance between stationary and non stationary characteristics ji an jinggangshan suichuan lushan boyang and zhangshu and those with significant non stationary characteristics nanchang for the stations with significant stationary characteristics yichun ganzhou nanxiong guixi yushan and guangchang all had 10 or more indices showing stationary characteristics including the guixi station with all extreme precipitation indices showing stationary characteristics among the stations with balanced stationary and non stationary characteristics stations such as ji an and jinggangshan showed non stationary characteristics with five or more extreme precipitation indices only nanchang had significant non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation indices with 83 3 of extreme precipitation intensity indices being non stationary the most at any individual station overall the stations were dominated by stationary characteristics with regard to each extreme precipitation index table 9 however certain stations exhibited non stationary characteristics with regard to each index in terms of the duration indices the number of sites with stationary and non stationary characteristics was similar for cdd and cwd with both having nine stations exhibiting stationary characteristics for the frequency indices r10 mm r20 mm and r50 mm all showed stationary characteristics the number of stations with non stationary characteristics in r1mm was 43 75 with the exception of rx5day the intensity indices were classified as having significant stationary characteristics with each index exhibiting stationary characteristics at more than 10 stations with the exception of three indices r1mm r10 mm and rx5day the remaining indices were mostly stationary in the northern part of the basin fig 5 in contrast the r10 mm r20 mm r50 mm r95p r99p sdii and prcptot indices showed stationary characteristics in the southern part of the plb fig 6 illustrates the pwmk trends for mn at different confidence levels from 1959 to 2019 the results for mn were generally consistent with the linear trend fig 2 cdd cwd and r1mm showed decreasing trends in the study area most of the other indices showed an increasing trend and reached the 0 05 significance level however r99p and rx5day showed a decreasing trend and no trend in the northeastern and northwestern areas of the plb respectively the results of the pwmk trend test for var at each station fig 7 showed a multivariate trend compared to that of mn for the duration indices cdd and cwd showed decreasing and increasing trends in the western part of the plb respectively the frequency indices primarily showed a decreasing trend with no more than four stations showing an increasing trend among the intensity indices r95p and r99p showed opposite trends with the former showing a decreasing trend in the southwestern and northeastern parts of the basin whereas the latter showed increasing trends at most stations in the basin the trends for rx1day and rx5day were similar both showing decreasing trends in the northeastern area of the basin and increasing trends in the southeastern area of the basin the majority of stations showed a decreasing trend with respect to sdii prcptot showed a decreasing trend in the northeastern and southwestern parts of the basin and an increasing trend in the southeastern part of the basin 3 3 risk changes of extreme precipitation for the different index types cwd r50 mm rx1day and rx5day were selected to represent the duration frequency and intensity respectively the extreme precipitation amounts at 20 100 and 500 yr return periods by gamlss were applied to analyze the risk of extreme precipitation for each station from 1959 to 2019 fig 8 shows that the northeastern and southwestern parts of the plb had longer rainfall durations but the trends reversed with the northeastern part showing a decreasing trend and the southwestern part showing an increasing trend nanchang in the central part of the plb showed a shorter duration and a decreasing trend overall cwd increased as the return period increases in terms of the different return periods the maximum rainfall duration increased by four days from the 20 yr to the 100 yr and by two days from the 100 yr to the 500 yr return period the range of low value centers gradually decreased with the smallest range observed in the 100 yr return period fig 9 shows a significant increasing trend at all stations except for zhangshu nanchang yushan and jinggangshan in general the number of rainstorms increased from southwest to the northeast among them yushan was heavy rainfall center while nanxiong was the low rainfall center in terms of the different return periods the maximum number of rainstorms increased by six days from the 20 yr to the 100 yr return period and by three days from the 100 yr to the 500 yr return period additionally the frequency of heavy rainfall at yushan with a 500 yr event was twice that of nanxiong the results of the three return periods for rx1day fig 10 showed that the southwestern part of the basin was the center of low values and the southeastern and northwestern parts were the centers of high values additionally most of the stations in the plb showed a significant increasing trend in terms of the different return periods the maximum number of rx1day increased by 50 mm from the 20 yr to the 500 yr return period rx5day reflects the intensity and duration of the extreme precipitation fig 11 indicates that lushan in the northwestern and guixi in the northeastern part of the plb were the high value centers of rx5day while the southwestern part was the low value center of rx5day the low value centers in the southwestern region showed an increasing trend whereas the high value centers in the north showed a decreasing trend as the return period increased the rank of nancheng decreased and that of guangchang increased to more intuitively illustrate the recurrence risk of extreme precipitation three stations with significant non stationary characteristics were selected jingdezhen nanchang and ganzhou located in the upper middle and lower plb respectively additionally we compared the rx1day r50 mm and cwd variation under stationary no trend in mn and var and non stationary the result of the gamlss model conditions for different return periods for rx1day jingdezhen is mn non stationarity nanchang is mn and var non stationarity and ganzhou is var non stationarity for r50 mm and cwd nanchang is var non stationarity and mn non stationarity respectively the non stationarity model was able to better capture the trend in rx1day over time and better fit the trend change characteristics in the very high and very low value years than the stationary model fig 12 it can be seen that the non stationary model is better for assessing the recurrence risk of the intensity frequency and duration of extreme precipitation events from a different station perspective jingdezhen under stationary conditions exceeded the 500 yr return period in both 2012 and 2018 while under non stationary conditions the year 2012 was placed between the 100 yr and 500 yr return periods fig 12a the return period for non stationary conditions at jingdezhen continued to increase between 1959 and 1970 the highest rx1day under the 500 yr return period occurred in 1970 and then decreased slightly however the growth continued after 1990 and has increased in recent years reaching 503 16 mm in 2019 nanchang the capital of jiangxi province the intensity frequency and duration of extreme precipitation showed non stationary characteristics for the rx1day nanchang showed a bimodal variation characteristic of non stationary conditions with peaks of 306 63 and 473 54 mm around 1973 and 2001 for the 500 yr return period respectively and a significant downward trend after 2001 fig 12b for r50 mm the highest value of 13 d occurred in 1959 and the lowest value of 1 d occurred in 2007 fig 12d the frequency of extreme precipitation in nanchang shows greater fluctuations owing to var non stationarity in terms of cwd the return period of extreme precipitation duration in nanchang increased with time showing a linear trend fig 12e there was a great difference in the performance of the stationary and non stationary conditions the former had a lower value than the latter under the same return period ganzhou shows an l shaped trend under non stationary conditions with the highest value of 342 41 mm occurring in 1959 and the lowest value of 125 25 mm in 1971 fig 12c under non stationary conditions rx1day reached the 100 yr and 20 yr return period levels in 1961 and 1982 respectively however under stationary conditions 1961 exceeded the 500 yr return period furthermore from 1967 to 1977 the 500 yr return period under non stationary conditions was lower than the 20 yr return period under stationary conditions in general the mn non stationarity and var non stationarity caused trend changes and fluctuating changes in the return period respectively if both mn and var show non stationary characteristics then the variation of extreme precipitation return period will be more obvious and bring a higher risk of disaster for example the results of the return periods of intensity frequency and duration of extreme precipitation events in nanchang indicated that non stationarity was more likely to change the return periods of extreme precipitation intensity than frequency and duration the values for the stationary and non stationary characteristics differed significantly across time table 10 with higher values for the non stationary model overall furthermore the difference between the non stationary and stationary models became more significant as time increased particularly after 1985 in the 20 yr return period of rx1day the stationary model showed higher values from 1959 to 1984 in contrast in the 100 yr return period of rx1day the non stationary model was higher than the stationary model after 1970 the overall value of the non stationary model was higher than that of the stationary model for the 500 yr return period of rx1day 4 discussion 4 1 spatio temporal variation in extreme precipitation the results show that the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation increased significantly during the past 61 years in the plb whereas the duration of extreme precipitation decreased significantly zhang et al 2015 also found that the intensity of moderate and heavy rainfall increased in the plb moreover the annual area affected by extreme precipitation events showed a general upward trend of 400 km2 year zhan et al 2019 fig 2 shows that 1990 2000 and 2010 2015 had a high occurrence of extreme precipitation events in 1990 2000 increased rainfall due to enso caused severe flooding in the plb in 1992 1995 and 1998 hu et al 2007 shankman et al 2006 in 2010 2015 the plb experienced severe drought events in 2012 2013 and 2015 these results indicate that there is an unequal temporal distribution of precipitation in the plb extreme precipitation events concentrated in the flood season april september can not only lead to flooding but also to drought events in the non flood season october march in general var is an important indicator of non stationarity variations in var imply an increase and decrease in precipitation which leads to floods and droughts respectively the non stationary characteristics of precipitation in the plb were further verified by drought and flood in 2019 and 2020 respectively the runoff in the plb increases during the flood season due to precipitation increases and the interaction between the yangtze river flow and plb hu et al 2007 therefore extreme precipitation during the flood season is often associated with floods tang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 moreover extreme precipitation during the non flood season is the main cause of runoff variation lei et al 2021 drought events are likely to occur once precipitation is lower than the mean climatology lu et al 2021 additionally in terms of geospatial distribution extreme precipitation trends increased significantly in the southwestern eastern and northeastern areas of the plb li and hu 2019 reported that the northeastern and eastern areas experienced a higher frequency of extreme precipitation events this is due to the fact that extreme precipitation tends to occur during the flood season topography at high altitudes during summer and autumn is conducive to the formation of extreme precipitation conditions zhang et al 2014 therefore there is a significant trend of increasing extreme precipitation in the south and east furthermore high altitude topography in different regions contributes positively to extreme precipitation guan et al 2017 4 2 non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation indices the gamlss model results shown in tables 7 9 indicate that the extreme precipitation indices in the plb are dominated by stationary characteristics however the nanchang site exhibited significant non stationary characteristics and showed a significant trend of increasing intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events over the past 61 years in fact frequent climate change and human activities in recent years have affected the stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation in the plb in terms of the impact of climate change precipitation in the plb is influenced by several atmospheric circulation indices xiao et al 2015 zhu et al 2020 human activities have increased daily precipitation extremes by approximately 13 chen and sun 2017 moreover as urbanization increases land use changes affect the global and local climate by changing the atmospheric moisture and ecological balance salazar et al 2015 nanchang is the economic political and cultural center of the jiangxi province with the accelerating urbanization since the 1978 economic reforms human activities in nanchang have become increasingly frequent wang 2020 meanwhile increased co2 emissions reduced vegetation cover and large amounts of reclaimed agricultural land li et al 2012 have contributed to local climate change gao et al 2018 found that climate indices can affect mean state var during extreme precipitation events and human activities can lead to significant changes in extreme precipitation events therefore the non stationary characteristics of nanchang are mainly caused by frequent human activities at the same time the results of the trend test for var fig 7 show relatively less stability for the stations at higher altitudes and an increasing trend which indicates that topography has an influence on extreme precipitation events 4 3 risk changes of extreme precipitation previous studies have shown that gamlss is suitable for assessing the non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation indices and their attributes gao et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 2014 it can also be used to calculate extreme precipitation amounts at different return periods gao et al 2017 figs 8 11 show that the high value of extreme precipitation events in the basin is located in the north and east and the low values are located in the southwest moreover the higher elevations in the east and south which are more mountainous and hilly landscapes make the local climate susceptible to the effects of elevation most areas of the plb are below the medium level in the 20 yr return period of each index particularly in the plains however comparing the variation of rx1day over time for different stations fig 12a c showed that jingdezhen and nanchang have higher values than ganzhou in both the stationary and non stationary models previous studies have shown that the easm significantly contributes to precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river particularly in summer ren et al 2013 xiao et al 2015 zhu et al 2020 jingdezhen and nanchang are closer to poyang lake and the yangtze river than ganzhou and are thus more susceptible to changes in water moisture hence the values of the extreme precipitation events were high with extreme precipitation events showing non stationary characteristics we need to be aware that there is a possibility of future flooding in nanchang in addition the results in fig 12 show that the non stationary model can be unusually low in individual years such as in nanchang from 2016 to 2019 and ganzhou from 1967 to 1977 therefore the design of rainfall flood protection standards should integrate stationary and non stationary models to avoid excessive fluctuations in standards in general mn non stationarity and var non stationarity changed the trend and fluctuation state of the return period of extreme precipitation events respectively the combination of the two can have a significant impact on extreme precipitation events 5 conclusion in this study 12 extreme precipitation indices were selected to analyze the spatial and temporal variations of extreme precipitation in the plb based on the pwmk and gamlss models the variation in the return period under non stationary conditions was also investigated the results provide a scientific basis for water resource management and disaster prevention in the plb the important conclusions drawn from this study are as follows 1 extreme precipitation intensities and frequency in the plb increased from 1959 to 2019 while the duration of extreme precipitation decreased significantly for instance r50 mm increased by 0 43 days and cwd decreased by 1 58 days r95p increased by 141 33 mm which accounted for more than 87 of prcptot additionally extreme precipitation trends increased significantly in the southwestern eastern and northeastern areas of the plb the number of extreme precipitation indices that showed an increase at the jingdezhen site was twice that at the nanxiong site 2 most of the extreme precipitation indices showed stationary characteristics in most parts of the plb the duration of extreme precipitation showed significant non stationary characteristics in the western plb however at the site scale stationary and non stationary characteristics appeared separately with respect to different indices particularly for nanchang with 83 3 of extreme precipitation intensity indices showing non stationary characteristics 3 the trend of the mn of the extreme precipitation indices increased more than var however the mn of extreme precipitation duration showed a significant decrease while var showed an increasing trend 4 the risk of extreme precipitation increased significantly for different return periods under non stationary conditions in the northwest and northeast of the plb the duration and frequency of extreme precipitation increased from southwest to northeast the intensity of extreme precipitation was higher in the southeastern and northwestern parts of the plb the rx1day and rx5day in the northwestern part of the plb were twice that of the southwestern plb under the 500 yr return period 5 the risk of extreme precipitation in the plb could be better captured and simulated using a non stationary model the risk of extreme precipitation in most parts of the plb was below the medium level in the 20 yr return period particularly in the plains in the last 10 years the stationary method has significantly underestimated the extreme precipitation intensity at the jingdezhen and ganzhou sites for the 500 yr return period there is also an underestimation of the frequency and duration of the return period of extreme precipitation events in the future more attention should be paid to the increase and fluctuation of the return period of extreme precipitation events caused by mn non stationarity and var non stationarity as well as the extreme precipitation events caused by the combination of the two

8158,study region poyang lake basin china study focus this study aimed to investigate whether there are non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation in the poyang lake basin plb of china and the trends of non stationary characteristics from 1959 to 2019 the spatio temporal variations of extreme precipitation were analysed from three fundamental aspects duration frequency and intensity based on the prewhitening mann kendall pwmk test non stationary variations and the risk of extreme precipitation were investigated based on the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss new hydrological insights for the region 1 the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation increased significantly whereas there was a significant decrease in extreme precipitation

stationary conditions in the northwestern plb 3 the risk of extreme precipitation can be captured using the gamlss the stationary method underestimated the extreme precipitation intensity e g rx1day compared to the gamlss for longer return periods in the plb more attention should be paid to the increase and fluctuation of the return period of extreme precipitation caused by the mean non stationarity and variance non stationarity keywords non stationary spatio temporal variation extreme precipitation poyang lake basin gamlss 1 introduction climate change particularly extreme weather events has attracted considerable attention in recent decades gudmundsson et al 2021 zou et al 2021 the fifth intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report provided clear evidence of global warming from 1880 to 2012 the average global surface temperature increased by approximately 0 85 c ipcc 2014 compared with the average climate extreme climatic events are more sensitive to climate change gao et al 2017 and the trend of change is stronger khan et al 2020 therefore in the context of global warming the intensity and frequency of extreme events have changed significantly ali et al 2018 gao et al 2020 kundzewicz et al 2020 in recent years there has been an increase in the frequency of extreme high temperature and extreme precipitation events alexander 2016 and extreme precipitation events are positively correlated with temperature increases ali et al 2018 gao et al 2020 the global increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events not only leads to serious natural hazards such as floods tang et al 2021 and landslides and debris flows ingram 2016 but also causes substantial human and economic losses lu et al 2021 global extreme weather event variability and trends have shown significant changes and many previous studies have shown that china experiences frequent extreme precipitation events li and chen 2021 lu et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 as the largest freshwater lake in china poyang lake has strategic importance in sustaining the surrounding ecological environment several studies have found that climate change and human activity have caused more extreme precipitation events and floods in the poyang lake basin plb in the recent decades li et al 2021 ma et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 which has severely affected the stability of the surrounding environment zhan et al 2019 the effects of human activities on climate change mainly correspond to the frequent use of fossil fuels massive greenhouse gas emissions land use and land cover change and construction of reservoirs xin et al 2019 in addition previous studies have shown that the east asian summer monsoon easm zou and ren 2015 el niño southern oscillation enso north atlantic oscillation nao indian ocean dipole iod and pacific decadal oscillation pdo are significantly associated with extreme precipitation events in the plb particularly enso xiao et al 2015 li and hu 2019 used a group of extreme precipitation related indices based on the mann kendall mk trend test kendall 1975 mann 1945 and found an intensified trend of extreme precipitation events in the plb during 1960 2012 zhang et al 2015 used 15 rain gauges and the mk trend test and found that precipitation changes intensified as reflected by increased precipitation extremes most existing studies are based on the mk trend test to identify whether significant trends exist in hydro meteorological time series however there are autocorrelation effects in the hydrometeorological time series which can lead to errors in the trends das and scaringi 2021 o brien et al 2021 moreover the stationary and non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation events have become a hot issue in climate change research sun et al 2018 studies based on the stationarity assumption indicated that sample series obeyed the same distribution in the past present and future however in a changing environment climate change and human activities significantly influence the intensity frequency and duration of extreme precipitation events gao et al 2018 so the conventional stationarity hypothesis is no longer suitable for flood risk assessment and hydrological project design gao et al 2017 2018 however most existing flood protection design standards are based on assumptions of stationarity when calculating storm return periods which can lead to distortion of the standards lu et al 2020 mirdashtvan and mohseni saravi 2020 therefore when studying extreme precipitation non stationary characteristics need to be tested to ensure the accuracy of the results sun et al 2018 rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 proposed a non stationary analysis model called generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss which has been widely used for the simulation and attribution analysis of runoff changes by constructing linear nonlinear parametric and non parametric relationships between distribution function parameters and multiple explanatory variables chen et al 2021 used the peak flow series from 158 gauges in the uk based on gamlss moreover previous studies have shown that gamlss has good applicability in investigating the non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation in the southeast coastal region of china gao et al 2017 it is important to assess the trend of extreme precipitation events and analyze the stationary and non stationary characteristics of plb to reduce the effects of natural disaster reduction and management of water resources to achieve this the prewhitening mk pwmk test yue and wang 2002 which eliminates autocorrelation in meteorological and hydrological series was selected for trend testing the gamlss which is based on the location scale and shape parameters was selected for non stationary analysis the objectives were to 1 analyze the spatio temporal variation in extreme precipitation 2 detect the non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation and 3 investigate the recurrence risk of extreme precipitation events the outcome of this study can provide effective scientific support for reducing the effects of extreme precipitation events in the plb the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the data and methods used in this study section 3 elaborates the results analysis and the discussion and conclusions are presented in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 data and methods 2 1 meteorological observations as an important storage lake in the yangtze river basin poyang lake plays an important supplementary role in maintaining water sources and protecting ecological diversity lei et al 2021 the plb extends between 113 74 118 47 e and 24 57 30 01 n with a drainage basin area of 16 22 104 km2 the plb has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 1664 mm the plb has low elevation in the middle and high elevations including high mountains hills and plains the lake receives water flows mainly from five rivers ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui there are 16 meteorological stations conducting long term consecutive measurements in the plb fig 1 the measurements were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system of the national meteorological information center http data cma cn for 1959 2019 all the selected stations can reflect the rainfall trend with no gaps exceeding two consecutive weeks the quality of the observations was rigorously tested by the provider and we performed quality control and error analysis on all data before conducting the analysis to ensure the authenticity and accuracy of the data 2 2 methods 2 2 1 extreme precipitation indices the extreme climate indices are a series of climate indices provided by the expert team on climate change detection monitoring and indices etccdmi based on daily temperature and precipitation data extreme precipitation indices were calculated to detect the non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation events table 1 these indices were computed using the rclimdex software zhang and yang 2004 the calculation process of rclimdex includes data quality control homogenization tests and index calculations there are 11 extreme precipitation indices recommended by etccdmi and rnn was modified to r1mm and r50 mm in this study based on different classification criteria the extreme precipitation indices can be divided into different categories which can be classified into monthly extreme precipitation indices and annual extreme precipitation indices based on different time scales and into absolute threshold indices and relative threshold indices based on different threshold classification methods alexander et al 2019 for example croitoru et al 2013 classified extreme precipitation indices into two categories based on frequency and intensity yao et al 2020 classified extreme precipitation indices into four categories based on intensity percentile threshold frequency and duration based on the rainfall characteristics of the study area we classified these 12 extreme precipitation indices into the following three categories 1 duration indices including cdd and cwd 2 frequency indices including r1mm r10 mm r20 mm and r50 mm and 3 intensity indices including rx1day rx5day sdii r95p r99p and prcptot 2 2 2 trend analysis the mk test is a non parametric test recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo for time series analysis and is widely used for trend testing of hydrological and meteorological elements however in the application process the autocorrelation of hydrological and meteorological elements often causes the elements with insignificant trends to become significant thus it should be noted that the results of the mk test were affected by autocorrelation of the time series it is essential to keep the time series serially independent before performing the trend test the pwmk test yue and wang 2002 which can eliminate autocorrelation in the series and maintain consistency with the overall trend of the mk test results was considered for trend testing in this study previous studies have used the prewhitening procedure before trend detection o brien et al 2021 wu et al 2021 xu and tang 2021 the results showed that this method is more reasonable than the mk test and improves the accuracy of the trend test in this study the prewhitening procedure was applied by the following steps first eliminating the linear trend of raw series 1 y t x t β t where y t x t and β t are the de trended series raw series value and linear regression slope of the trend in the raw series at time t respectively second removing the autocorrelation term from the de trended series 2 y t y t r 1 y t 1 where r 1 is the lag 1 serial correlation coefficient of the de trended series and y t is the de trended and pre whitened series called the residual series finally we added the linear trend that was eliminated in the first step back to the de trended or residual series 3 y t y t β t where y t is the pre whitened series 2 2 3 gamlss model the gamlss model can establish the relationship between the statistical parameters of the response variables location scale shape etc and explanatory variables based on fitting the location scale and shape parameters with an addable semi parametric or non parametric term or a random effects term rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 the ability to introduce multiple explanatory variables is a remarkable advantage of the gamlss in this study we used a semi parametric gamlss model suppose there are n independent observations y i i 1 n which follow a distribution of f y y i θ i in this case θ i corresponds to the location parameter mean mn median etc the scale parameter variance var mean square etc and the shape parameter skewness coefficient kurtosis coefficient where θ i t θ i 1 θ i 2 θ i k represents the k parameters position scale and shape vector and k is usually less than 4 the formula is as follows 4 g k θ k x k β k j 1 m h j k x j k where θ k is a vector of length n x k is an n m matrix of explanatory variables and β k is a vector of parameters of length m h j k represents the functional relationship between the distribution parameters and the explanatory variables x j k this model is widely used for risk assessment of extreme precipitation events and has been shown to outperform traditional distribution models chen et al 2021 gao et al 2018 here we briefly describe the application of the gamlss model in this study the changes in mn and var of the extreme precipitation series indicate that they exhibit non stationary characteristics gao et al 2018 therefore the mn and var of the extreme precipitation series were used to characterize the location and scale parameters in the gamlss model respectively moreover the effect of the random term on the model was not considered in this study the functional relationship between the statistical parameters mean θ 1 and variance θ 2 and the unique explanatory variable time t is as follows 5 g 1 θ 1 t β 1 6 g 2 θ 2 t β 2 the common types of distribution functions are listed in table 2 the parameters of the distribution functions are mn and var of the extreme precipitation series common trend line type expressions are summarized in table 3 in this study we considered a series in which mn and var exhibit a non linear trend with non stationarity 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal variation in extreme precipitation 3 1 1 temporal variation of extreme precipitation indices fig 2 illustrates the temporal variation of extreme precipitation indices from 1959 to 2019 in the plb in general all indices except cdd cwd and r1mm showed a linearly increasing trend the duration indices decreased and the intensive and frequent indices increased for the duration indices cdd showed a significant downward trend between 1960 and 1973 with a sudden increase to a peak of 43 days in 1974 and showed a slow downward trend thereafter similar to cdd cwd showed a decreasing trend until 1975 with a peak of 24 days in 1999 and a minimum of 9 days in 1989 1991 and 2006 for the frequency indices the decreasing trend of r1mm was not significant reaching a minimum value of 148 days in 2003 and gradually increasing thereafter r10 mm r20 mm and r50 mm all showed an upward trend with r20 mm showing largest upward trend note that some years have zero values of r50 mm during the time series which was due to the limitations of the thiessen polygon interpolation for the intensity indices both r95p and r99p showed a long term increasing trend in the time series r95p showed a clear upward trend after 1978 but showed decreasing trend during 2000 2009 and showed an upward trend thereafter in contrast the fluctuating trend of r99p was highly variable with a total of 16 years with zero values but with extreme values of 300 mm in both 1994 and 1998 and a continuous increasing trend after 2017 we also found that the trends of rx1day and rx5day were similar but that of rx5day was more volatile rx1day reached a maximum of 101 mm in 2001 rx5day showed a decreasing trend from 1967 to 1979 and increased thereafter sdii varied between 6 8 mm day in 1963 and 11 7 mm day in 1998 with a significant increase over the entire study period there was a visible upward trend in prcptot but a low value range was observed between 2000 and 2009 table 4 illustrates that except for cdd and cwd the other extreme precipitation indices showed an increasing trend at different confidence levels from 1959 to 2019 for r20 mm r95p and sdii these indices showed a significant increasing trend at the 0 1 significance level 3 1 2 spatial variation of extreme precipitation indices the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation indices in the plb showed an increasing trend during the past 61 years while the duration showed a decreasing trend fig 3 in terms of the duration of extreme precipitation indices more stations showed decreased trends in duration indices than those with increasing trends the frequency indices showed an increasing trend for all stations except ganzhou and guangchang the intensity indices showed an increasing trend at all stations except boyang with yichun and nancheng reaching a significance level of 0 05 geographically these results illustrate that the extreme precipitation intensity and frequency over the central plb have increased however extreme precipitation events in the northwestern and southwestern regions of the basin showed less variability fig 4 shows the pwmk trend for 12 extreme precipitation indices in plb at different confidence levels from 1959 to 2019 for the duration indices cdd and cwd showed increasing trends in the southern and northern parts of the plb respectively for the frequency indices r1mm showed a decrease in the southern part of plb and an increase in the northern part as the threshold increased an increasing trend from r10 mm to r50 mm across the entire basin was observed zhangshu and nancheng showed a significant increasing trend of r50 mm at 0 05 significance level nanxiong and guangchang were the exceptions in terms of intensity indices r95p showed an increasing trend across the basin and for seven stations it reached the 0 05 significance level however compared to the trends at r95p boyang and jinggangshan exhibited increasing trends at r99p additionally at 13 out of 16 stations rx1day and rx5day were dominated by a not significant increasing tendency we observed an overall increasing tendency of the sdii and six stations at 0 05 significance level prcptot showed an increasing trend at all stations except for nanxiong table 5 shows that most stations 93 75 in the plb had increasing trends with the most significant increasing trend in zhangshu and jinggangshan however there was a decreasing trend in the extreme precipitation indices of about 30 or more at stations such as nanxiong boyang and ji an table 6 shows that 75 of the extreme precipitation indices showed increasing trends at each station with r20 mm r50 mm r95p rx1day and sdii showing increasing trends at more than 13 stations fewer stations showed no trend and only cwd r10 mm r99p and prcptot showed no trend at individual stations in contrast cdd cwd and r1mm showed decreasing trend at more than 50 of stations with r1mm decreasing at approximately 60 of the 16 stations 3 2 non stationary variation of extreme precipitation indices to assess the degree of goodness of fit between the statistical model and fitted data the minimum akaike information criterion aic value was selected the results of the optimal gamlss model obtained using the aic criterion tables 7 9 showed that more than half of the extreme precipitation indices at 81 25 of the stations in the plb exhibited stationary characteristics and the optimal distribution type was igamma with a line shape of 1 that is a linear trend in mn and no trend in var in general the extreme precipitation indices at each station were dominated by stationary characteristics table 8 with a maximum number distribution of igamma and a maximum number linearity of 1 these results indicate that the stations can be divided into three categories those with significant stationary characteristics xiushui yichun ganzhou nanxiong jingdezhen guixi yushan nancheng and guangchang those with a balance between stationary and non stationary characteristics ji an jinggangshan suichuan lushan boyang and zhangshu and those with significant non stationary characteristics nanchang for the stations with significant stationary characteristics yichun ganzhou nanxiong guixi yushan and guangchang all had 10 or more indices showing stationary characteristics including the guixi station with all extreme precipitation indices showing stationary characteristics among the stations with balanced stationary and non stationary characteristics stations such as ji an and jinggangshan showed non stationary characteristics with five or more extreme precipitation indices only nanchang had significant non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation indices with 83 3 of extreme precipitation intensity indices being non stationary the most at any individual station overall the stations were dominated by stationary characteristics with regard to each extreme precipitation index table 9 however certain stations exhibited non stationary characteristics with regard to each index in terms of the duration indices the number of sites with stationary and non stationary characteristics was similar for cdd and cwd with both having nine stations exhibiting stationary characteristics for the frequency indices r10 mm r20 mm and r50 mm all showed stationary characteristics the number of stations with non stationary characteristics in r1mm was 43 75 with the exception of rx5day the intensity indices were classified as having significant stationary characteristics with each index exhibiting stationary characteristics at more than 10 stations with the exception of three indices r1mm r10 mm and rx5day the remaining indices were mostly stationary in the northern part of the basin fig 5 in contrast the r10 mm r20 mm r50 mm r95p r99p sdii and prcptot indices showed stationary characteristics in the southern part of the plb fig 6 illustrates the pwmk trends for mn at different confidence levels from 1959 to 2019 the results for mn were generally consistent with the linear trend fig 2 cdd cwd and r1mm showed decreasing trends in the study area most of the other indices showed an increasing trend and reached the 0 05 significance level however r99p and rx5day showed a decreasing trend and no trend in the northeastern and northwestern areas of the plb respectively the results of the pwmk trend test for var at each station fig 7 showed a multivariate trend compared to that of mn for the duration indices cdd and cwd showed decreasing and increasing trends in the western part of the plb respectively the frequency indices primarily showed a decreasing trend with no more than four stations showing an increasing trend among the intensity indices r95p and r99p showed opposite trends with the former showing a decreasing trend in the southwestern and northeastern parts of the basin whereas the latter showed increasing trends at most stations in the basin the trends for rx1day and rx5day were similar both showing decreasing trends in the northeastern area of the basin and increasing trends in the southeastern area of the basin the majority of stations showed a decreasing trend with respect to sdii prcptot showed a decreasing trend in the northeastern and southwestern parts of the basin and an increasing trend in the southeastern part of the basin 3 3 risk changes of extreme precipitation for the different index types cwd r50 mm rx1day and rx5day were selected to represent the duration frequency and intensity respectively the extreme precipitation amounts at 20 100 and 500 yr return periods by gamlss were applied to analyze the risk of extreme precipitation for each station from 1959 to 2019 fig 8 shows that the northeastern and southwestern parts of the plb had longer rainfall durations but the trends reversed with the northeastern part showing a decreasing trend and the southwestern part showing an increasing trend nanchang in the central part of the plb showed a shorter duration and a decreasing trend overall cwd increased as the return period increases in terms of the different return periods the maximum rainfall duration increased by four days from the 20 yr to the 100 yr and by two days from the 100 yr to the 500 yr return period the range of low value centers gradually decreased with the smallest range observed in the 100 yr return period fig 9 shows a significant increasing trend at all stations except for zhangshu nanchang yushan and jinggangshan in general the number of rainstorms increased from southwest to the northeast among them yushan was heavy rainfall center while nanxiong was the low rainfall center in terms of the different return periods the maximum number of rainstorms increased by six days from the 20 yr to the 100 yr return period and by three days from the 100 yr to the 500 yr return period additionally the frequency of heavy rainfall at yushan with a 500 yr event was twice that of nanxiong the results of the three return periods for rx1day fig 10 showed that the southwestern part of the basin was the center of low values and the southeastern and northwestern parts were the centers of high values additionally most of the stations in the plb showed a significant increasing trend in terms of the different return periods the maximum number of rx1day increased by 50 mm from the 20 yr to the 500 yr return period rx5day reflects the intensity and duration of the extreme precipitation fig 11 indicates that lushan in the northwestern and guixi in the northeastern part of the plb were the high value centers of rx5day while the southwestern part was the low value center of rx5day the low value centers in the southwestern region showed an increasing trend whereas the high value centers in the north showed a decreasing trend as the return period increased the rank of nancheng decreased and that of guangchang increased to more intuitively illustrate the recurrence risk of extreme precipitation three stations with significant non stationary characteristics were selected jingdezhen nanchang and ganzhou located in the upper middle and lower plb respectively additionally we compared the rx1day r50 mm and cwd variation under stationary no trend in mn and var and non stationary the result of the gamlss model conditions for different return periods for rx1day jingdezhen is mn non stationarity nanchang is mn and var non stationarity and ganzhou is var non stationarity for r50 mm and cwd nanchang is var non stationarity and mn non stationarity respectively the non stationarity model was able to better capture the trend in rx1day over time and better fit the trend change characteristics in the very high and very low value years than the stationary model fig 12 it can be seen that the non stationary model is better for assessing the recurrence risk of the intensity frequency and duration of extreme precipitation events from a different station perspective jingdezhen under stationary conditions exceeded the 500 yr return period in both 2012 and 2018 while under non stationary conditions the year 2012 was placed between the 100 yr and 500 yr return periods fig 12a the return period for non stationary conditions at jingdezhen continued to increase between 1959 and 1970 the highest rx1day under the 500 yr return period occurred in 1970 and then decreased slightly however the growth continued after 1990 and has increased in recent years reaching 503 16 mm in 2019 nanchang the capital of jiangxi province the intensity frequency and duration of extreme precipitation showed non stationary characteristics for the rx1day nanchang showed a bimodal variation characteristic of non stationary conditions with peaks of 306 63 and 473 54 mm around 1973 and 2001 for the 500 yr return period respectively and a significant downward trend after 2001 fig 12b for r50 mm the highest value of 13 d occurred in 1959 and the lowest value of 1 d occurred in 2007 fig 12d the frequency of extreme precipitation in nanchang shows greater fluctuations owing to var non stationarity in terms of cwd the return period of extreme precipitation duration in nanchang increased with time showing a linear trend fig 12e there was a great difference in the performance of the stationary and non stationary conditions the former had a lower value than the latter under the same return period ganzhou shows an l shaped trend under non stationary conditions with the highest value of 342 41 mm occurring in 1959 and the lowest value of 125 25 mm in 1971 fig 12c under non stationary conditions rx1day reached the 100 yr and 20 yr return period levels in 1961 and 1982 respectively however under stationary conditions 1961 exceeded the 500 yr return period furthermore from 1967 to 1977 the 500 yr return period under non stationary conditions was lower than the 20 yr return period under stationary conditions in general the mn non stationarity and var non stationarity caused trend changes and fluctuating changes in the return period respectively if both mn and var show non stationary characteristics then the variation of extreme precipitation return period will be more obvious and bring a higher risk of disaster for example the results of the return periods of intensity frequency and duration of extreme precipitation events in nanchang indicated that non stationarity was more likely to change the return periods of extreme precipitation intensity than frequency and duration the values for the stationary and non stationary characteristics differed significantly across time table 10 with higher values for the non stationary model overall furthermore the difference between the non stationary and stationary models became more significant as time increased particularly after 1985 in the 20 yr return period of rx1day the stationary model showed higher values from 1959 to 1984 in contrast in the 100 yr return period of rx1day the non stationary model was higher than the stationary model after 1970 the overall value of the non stationary model was higher than that of the stationary model for the 500 yr return period of rx1day 4 discussion 4 1 spatio temporal variation in extreme precipitation the results show that the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation increased significantly during the past 61 years in the plb whereas the duration of extreme precipitation decreased significantly zhang et al 2015 also found that the intensity of moderate and heavy rainfall increased in the plb moreover the annual area affected by extreme precipitation events showed a general upward trend of 400 km2 year zhan et al 2019 fig 2 shows that 1990 2000 and 2010 2015 had a high occurrence of extreme precipitation events in 1990 2000 increased rainfall due to enso caused severe flooding in the plb in 1992 1995 and 1998 hu et al 2007 shankman et al 2006 in 2010 2015 the plb experienced severe drought events in 2012 2013 and 2015 these results indicate that there is an unequal temporal distribution of precipitation in the plb extreme precipitation events concentrated in the flood season april september can not only lead to flooding but also to drought events in the non flood season october march in general var is an important indicator of non stationarity variations in var imply an increase and decrease in precipitation which leads to floods and droughts respectively the non stationary characteristics of precipitation in the plb were further verified by drought and flood in 2019 and 2020 respectively the runoff in the plb increases during the flood season due to precipitation increases and the interaction between the yangtze river flow and plb hu et al 2007 therefore extreme precipitation during the flood season is often associated with floods tang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 moreover extreme precipitation during the non flood season is the main cause of runoff variation lei et al 2021 drought events are likely to occur once precipitation is lower than the mean climatology lu et al 2021 additionally in terms of geospatial distribution extreme precipitation trends increased significantly in the southwestern eastern and northeastern areas of the plb li and hu 2019 reported that the northeastern and eastern areas experienced a higher frequency of extreme precipitation events this is due to the fact that extreme precipitation tends to occur during the flood season topography at high altitudes during summer and autumn is conducive to the formation of extreme precipitation conditions zhang et al 2014 therefore there is a significant trend of increasing extreme precipitation in the south and east furthermore high altitude topography in different regions contributes positively to extreme precipitation guan et al 2017 4 2 non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation indices the gamlss model results shown in tables 7 9 indicate that the extreme precipitation indices in the plb are dominated by stationary characteristics however the nanchang site exhibited significant non stationary characteristics and showed a significant trend of increasing intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events over the past 61 years in fact frequent climate change and human activities in recent years have affected the stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation in the plb in terms of the impact of climate change precipitation in the plb is influenced by several atmospheric circulation indices xiao et al 2015 zhu et al 2020 human activities have increased daily precipitation extremes by approximately 13 chen and sun 2017 moreover as urbanization increases land use changes affect the global and local climate by changing the atmospheric moisture and ecological balance salazar et al 2015 nanchang is the economic political and cultural center of the jiangxi province with the accelerating urbanization since the 1978 economic reforms human activities in nanchang have become increasingly frequent wang 2020 meanwhile increased co2 emissions reduced vegetation cover and large amounts of reclaimed agricultural land li et al 2012 have contributed to local climate change gao et al 2018 found that climate indices can affect mean state var during extreme precipitation events and human activities can lead to significant changes in extreme precipitation events therefore the non stationary characteristics of nanchang are mainly caused by frequent human activities at the same time the results of the trend test for var fig 7 show relatively less stability for the stations at higher altitudes and an increasing trend which indicates that topography has an influence on extreme precipitation events 4 3 risk changes of extreme precipitation previous studies have shown that gamlss is suitable for assessing the non stationary characteristics of extreme precipitation indices and their attributes gao et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 2014 it can also be used to calculate extreme precipitation amounts at different return periods gao et al 2017 figs 8 11 show that the high value of extreme precipitation events in the basin is located in the north and east and the low values are located in the southwest moreover the higher elevations in the east and south which are more mountainous and hilly landscapes make the local climate susceptible to the effects of elevation most areas of the plb are below the medium level in the 20 yr return period of each index particularly in the plains however comparing the variation of rx1day over time for different stations fig 12a c showed that jingdezhen and nanchang have higher values than ganzhou in both the stationary and non stationary models previous studies have shown that the easm significantly contributes to precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river particularly in summer ren et al 2013 xiao et al 2015 zhu et al 2020 jingdezhen and nanchang are closer to poyang lake and the yangtze river than ganzhou and are thus more susceptible to changes in water moisture hence the values of the extreme precipitation events were high with extreme precipitation events showing non stationary characteristics we need to be aware that there is a possibility of future flooding in nanchang in addition the results in fig 12 show that the non stationary model can be unusually low in individual years such as in nanchang from 2016 to 2019 and ganzhou from 1967 to 1977 therefore the design of rainfall flood protection standards should integrate stationary and non stationary models to avoid excessive fluctuations in standards in general mn non stationarity and var non stationarity changed the trend and fluctuation state of the return period of extreme precipitation events respectively the combination of the two can have a significant impact on extreme precipitation events 5 conclusion in this study 12 extreme precipitation indices were selected to analyze the spatial and temporal variations of extreme precipitation in the plb based on the pwmk and gamlss models the variation in the return period under non stationary conditions was also investigated the results provide a scientific basis for water resource management and disaster prevention in the plb the important conclusions drawn from this study are as follows 1 extreme precipitation intensities and frequency in the plb increased from 1959 to 2019 while the duration of extreme precipitation decreased significantly for instance r50 mm increased by 0 43 days and cwd decreased by 1 58 days r95p increased by 141 33 mm which accounted for more than 87 of prcptot additionally extreme precipitation trends increased significantly in the southwestern eastern and northeastern areas of the plb the number of extreme precipitation indices that showed an increase at the jingdezhen site was twice that at the nanxiong site 2 most of the extreme precipitation indices showed stationary characteristics in most parts of the plb the duration of extreme precipitation showed significant non stationary characteristics in the western plb however at the site scale stationary and non stationary characteristics appeared separately with respect to different indices particularly for nanchang with 83 3 of extreme precipitation intensity indices showing non stationary characteristics 3 the trend of the mn of the extreme precipitation indices increased more than var however the mn of extreme precipitation duration showed a significant decrease while var showed an increasing trend 4 the risk of extreme precipitation increased significantly for different return periods under non stationary conditions in the northwest and northeast of the plb the duration and frequency of extreme precipitation increased from southwest to northeast the intensity of extreme precipitation was higher in the southeastern and northwestern parts of the plb the rx1day and rx5day in the northwestern part of the plb were twice that of the southwestern plb under the 500 yr return period 5 the risk of extreme precipitation in the plb could be better captured and simulated using a non stationary model the risk of extreme precipitation in most parts of the plb was below the medium level in the 20 yr return period particularly in the plains in the last 10 years the stationary method has significantly underestimated the extreme precipitation intensity at the jingdezhen and ganzhou sites for the 500 yr return period there is also an underestimation of the frequency and duration of the return period of extreme precipitation events in the future more attention should be paid to the increase and fluctuation of the return period of extreme precipitation events caused by mn non stationarity and var non stationarity as well as the extreme precipitation events caused by the combination of the two

8159,study region five mountain rivers rasau congkak sekayu nal and lata payung in malaysia study focus stability of mountain rivers is essential to maintain the natural landscape of fluvial morphology amid climate variability and anthropogenic stresses however rapid assessment tools for characterizing the channel stability of mountain river systems are lacking in this study a river morphologic stability index rmsi is developed and used to evaluate the stability of 32 cross sections in five mountain rivers in malaysia the performance of this index is compared with that of five conventional indexes new hydrological insights for the region the analysis indicates that ten crucial parameters and their weightages are key to represent the dynamic changes of river landscapes channel form 0 16 channel dimension 0 14 substrate 0 13 channel pattern 0 12 bank slope 0 09 bank erosion 0 08 channel adjustment 0 08 artificial feature and structure 0 07 degree of constriction 0 07 and vegetative cover 0 06 these parameters formed the basis of the development of rmsi for each parameter its ratings and weightages were defined to differentiate between the excellent and worst river conditions the final rmsi score was grouped into four categories highly stable 0 25 moderately stable 26 50 moderately unstable 51 75 and extremely unstable 76 100 results indicated that 22 of all the 32 cross sections concerned were within the very stable category keywords river stability hydro morphology assessment index analytical hierarchical process mountain river 1 introduction streams and rivers are generally the products of natural geological processes fluvial dynamics and human alterations therefore water resources must be carefully managed to ensure the sustainability of river landscapes and the continuous supply of clean water the processes of erosion sediment transport and deposition are the catalysts that shape the river landscapes of our earth julien 2010 an interruption of natural river equilibrium through land use change instream sand mining or other causes will result in either erosion or deposition at the downstream of the rivers recently numerous hydro morphological river assessments have been undertaken in many countries with notable differences in their aims scales and approaches overall one main objective of these exercises is to provide a rapid tool to evaluate either channel condition or channel stability using various approaches belletti et al 2015 offered an in depth discussion on the river health assessment the approaches widely used for river health assessment can be divided into four main types 1 physical habitat assessment gorazd and branka 2009 harding et al 2009 maine department of environmental protection 2009 natural resources conservation 2009 northern ireland environment agency 2009 andrew et al 2010 xia et al 2010 marta gonzález and diego 2011 2 riparian habitat assessment oregon governor s watershed

hydrological regime alteration assessment richter et al 1996 olden and poff 2003 black et al 2005 kleynhans et al 2005 mathews and richter 2007 shiau and wu 2008 martínez santa maría et al 2010 healey et al 2012 and 4 morphological assessment pfankuch 1975 heeren et al 2012 rinaldi et al 2013 ulloa et al 2020 these approaches perform differently in diverse river sections and geomorphological settings nevertheless similar parameters are often used for the assessments in a combination of hydraulics hydrology and geomorphology of river landscapes in a nutshell these evaluations being represented as the hydro morphological assessment methods can provide a good understanding on the best solution of restoration work in the future the available project risk screening matrix for river management and restoration cluer et al 2010 skidmore et al 2011 thorne et al 2015 is apparent due to available hydro morphological assessment in the past in malaysia there is a lack of rapid assessment tools for characterizing either the channel stability or channel condition of mountain river systems as of now the only available index to assess the river health is the national water quality index wqi for malaysia department of environment doe 2006 however the wqi was developed mainly to assess the physical and chemical aspects of water quality of the fluvial river systems rather than the mountain river systems most assessments in malaysia have been conducted either by producing a mapping system or by using an empirical equation consequently two phenomena that require zonation for mitigation works have been widely studied in malaysia flood risk mapping sinnakaudan et al 2003 hassan et al 2006 elsheikh et al 2015 and landslide mapping pradhan and lee 2010 ayob et al 2019 sulaiman et al 2019b empirical equations for the assessments have been widely used in the past including for sediment transport prediction in river systems sinnakaudan et al 2006 2010 sulaiman et al 2017b a and prediction of river bank erosion abidin et al 2017 however a rapid assessment tool in the form of hydro morphological approaches is clearly needed to test the stability of mountain river systems the focus on mountain river systems stems from two main reasons 1 the rapid development of agricultural activities at the mountain river corridors has led to serious catastrophes in the past such as landslides river bank erosion and high suspended sediments in the river systems and 2 the morphometry of the mountain river systems is different from that of their lowland counterpart playing an immense role in the hydrologic behaviour of a drainage basin sajadi et al 2020 the term mountain rivers can be inferred to a gradient of 0 002 m m along the majority of its length wohl 2000 thompson 2006 besides their steep slopes the mountain rivers are generally characterized by the high boundary roughness provided by large coarse clasts various bed material sizes and high turbulent flow thompson 2006 vollmer and kleinhans 2008 horton 1945 defined headwater or mountain rivers as having a stream order of 1 4 due to these reasons the mountain rivers have generally been considered to be fundamentally different from the lowland rivers and the application of the existing theories of unconfined alluvial channel associated to lowland rivers has been subjected to further verification sulaiman et al 2017a mountain rivers exhibit great variability in hydrological regime channel planform channel gradient grain size and bedforms sediment dynamics and aquatic and riparian biota both at localized individual mountain ranges and among the diverse mountainous regions wohl 2000 in view of these the main objective of this study was to develop a river morphologic stability index rmsi to assess mountain river systems with a case study in malaysia four main stages were formulated to develop the rmsi selecting the reference site revisiting the existing indices finding the influential parameters and making a multi criteria decision the index was then used to evaluate the stability of 32 cross sections in five mountain rivers in malaysia the results were also compared with those from five conventional indices based on these some conclusions pertaining to the applicability and validity of the newly developed index were drawn 2 methodology for river morphologic stability index rmsi prior to the development of the rmsi four main stages were performed selecting the reference site revisiting the existing indices finding the influential parameters and making a multi criteria decision reference site represents the stable channel criteria as previously described by kujanová and matoušková 2017 evaluation of the existing indices encapsulates fitting of the current data into those existing indices and finding the drawbacks of using such indices finding the influential parameters depicts the process of selecting the parameters that control channel stability in a river system making a multi criteria decision involves the development of an index using a hybrid of matrix eigenvalues and heuristic approach in fig 1 the four coloured dashed boxes red blue orange and black delineate these four main stages as a basis for developing the rmsi these stages are described below 2 1 selecting the reference site a stable channel can be inferred as a reference site because it is best described by looking at the least degraded channel caused by natural and anthropogenic alterations with the most ecologically and morphologically dynamic states palmer et al 2005 palmer et al 2005 claimed that a river system must be self sustaining and resilient to external perturbations brierley and fryirs 2013 stated that a reference site could be designated as an expected state with the best condition that the river can balance the human alterations given the catchment conditions thus in the present study the selection of the reference site was made following the macroscale and microscale assessments it was adapted from kujanová and matoušková 2017 to alleviate unnecessary sampling that is not feasible for malaysian river conditions the macroscale assessment was performed using cartographic data and satellite imagery analysis the presence of reservoirs in the upstream mainly influenced the selection of the reference site since a reservoir could create hydropeaking which alters the natural flow conditions thus the presence of reservoirs or man made ponds would automatically disqualify such a site the characteristics that are needed to investigate a watershed are listed in fig 1 however natural vegetation structures should always be present before fitting the field survey data into the existing hydro morphological index the microscale assessment entailed checking the river stability status using one or more of the existing indices this assessment emphasized the river reach properties and their relationship to the river stability a minimum of five existing hydro morphological indices were chosen to fit against the field data to determine whether the study area was indeed a reference site or not most of the existing hydro morphological indices classified river segments into either stable moderately stable or unstable reach two main conditions must be fulfilled prior to the selection of a reference site i the score for each cross section must fall within very stable category and ii the frequency of very stable category must be greater than 2 2 2 revisiting the existing indices revisiting the existing indices was made by observing the scoring class and the parameter list see table 1 the scoring and grading techniques were assessed by looking at the similarity the gap and the method of computation for each index previous studies have shown that various grading and scoring techniques were employed for the indices however finding similarity between them was difficult therefore finding a common ground for each index was a crucial step furthermore thorne et al 1996 criticized the opinionated index method as it emphasized a qualitative approach which led to criticisms on the grounds that it was highly subjective therefore lists of parameters and methods for evaluation were given special attention the majority of assessment indices emulated qualitative rather than quantitative techniques in this study five existing indices under morphological theme groups were reviewed and assessed in detail the channel stability index csi simon and downs 1995 oklahoma ozark streambank erosion

stability index psi pfankuch 1975 a review on the influential parameters ranking scoring and types of categorical data is presented here by inferring the study by belletti et al 2015 2 3 finding the influential parameters a ready made checklist provided by belletti et al 2015 was used as a basis to find the influential parameters the description for each parameter was discussed based on the european method for water framework directive reform 2019 data collection method is a theme that relates the method of gathering the data source of information with the mechanism of their storing type of assessment the type of assessment consists of three sub criteria inventorying appraisal by index and general evaluation inventorying is a feature mapping on the frequency extent absence presence and hydro morphological aspect of a river system länder arbeitsgemeinschaft wasser lawa 2000 2002 langhammer 2007 mühlmann 2010 onema 2010 appraisal by index mainly uses a functional unit score system where scores are assigned following a hierarchical stepwise approach länder arbeitsgemeinschaft wasser lawa 2002 general evaluation is a method that aims to give an overall assessment of hydro morphological conditions van dam et al 2007 tavzes and urbanic 2009 spatial scale is the extent of land area or geographical distance of the study area longitudinal spatial scale infers the streamwise extent of a river section temporal scale refers to the time frame of data collection for analysis most researchers utilize the present state of data for river assessment recorded features are parameters assessed in the field such as channel features vegetation floodplain features and large scale characteristics these levels of features are stratified according to the active channel bank and riparian unit floodplain and megaform unit vegetation covers the bank and riparian unit which is close to the water edge floodplain features are the width of the whole floodplain and potentially erodible corridors rinaldi et al 2013 large scale characteristics are recorded features on the megaform unit and the associated flow regimes as such rinaldi et al 2013 emphasized the segmentation phase of geology geomorphology climate and land use in the large scale settings river processes are the themes that relate the physical and geomorphic forms of a river landscape as a result of fluvial processes the weightage for each parameter was assessed using the analytical hierarchical process ahp the highest weightage indicated the most influential parameters in their sub indices the influential parameters provided a basis for the factors that controlled changes in the river landscapes the weightage was expressed in terms of matrix eigenvalues those eigenvalues were normalized among the selected influential parameters to obtain the total eigenvalue of 100 this weightage was multiplied by the associated ratings of selected parameters to obtain their scores the ratings were selected based on the previous assessment and the score was tallied to get the total score hence the overall index of either stable or unstable channel conditions was determined 2 4 making a multi criteria decision multi criteria decision making mcdm is a process of selecting the influential parameters using the ahp technique multi criteria represents the multiple level of parameters prior to selecting the influential parameters the hydro morphological method by belletti et al 2015 was used to determine the influential parameters that affected the channel changes a total of 47 parameters was extracted from 22 existing indices for the weighting analysis these 47 parameters were used to obtain a full perspective of the percentage coverage as portrayed in fig 2 the mcdm was made by separating those parameters into 10 classes of criteria covering data collection method type of method longitudinal spatial scale lateral spatial scale temporal scale channel feature vegetative regeneration floodplain feature large scale characteristics of bedform and river process the highest frequency within this class was assigned as the highest preference prior to ahp which entailed the use of a preference scale for bipolar comparisons table 2 fig 2 shows the frequency in a percentage form for each criterion as previously reported by belletti et al 2015 the frequency of 100 in any sub criterion meant that all existing hydro morphological methods used those techniques in their sampling computation or derivation since only two levels of hierarchy were involved criterion and sub criterion they must be assessed separately the difference in frequency served as a benchmark for selecting the preference scale a preference scale of 1 indicated equal importance while a preference scale of 9 portrayed extreme importance between the two selections for example the difference in percentage for remote sensing and field survey was 18 in favour of the latter scale preference of 2 2 5 development of river morphologic stability index rmsi following the above four stages the rmsi was developed it entailed normalizing the selected influential parameters to fit into 100 of weightage the parameters contained two levels of mcdm which led to the formation of global weightage gw and local weightage lw for the criteria and sub criteria respectively with 47 parameters assessed from fig 2 the top 10 influential parameters were selected prior to the rmsi formation the selection was made based on the ahp see sections 2 3 and 2 4 the normalization was performed using the following formula 1 w e i g h t a g e g w l w c u m u l a t i v e f o r g w l w each parameter consisted of a few ratings based on previous studies pfankuch 1975 johnson et al 1999 rinaldi et al 2013 those ratings differentiated the best and the worst conditions for each parameter the minimum and maximum ratings were the same for each parameter most ratings for each index spanned from 0 to 10 where the lowest number close to 0 depicted excellent characteristics while the highest number close to 10 depicted the opposite the total score could be obtained by summing up all the sub scores for each parameter 2 r m s i 0 100 α 1 p rate 1 α 2 p rate 2 α 3 p rate 3 α n p rate n where r m s i 0 100 is the expected total score values ranging from 0 to 100 α is the weightage values p r a t e is the ratings for each parameter and n is the number of parameters to classify the stability of the watershed studied the score levels must be divided into a meaningful classification such as stable moderately stable or unstable condition different sets of scores and rating levels were used for the previous indices as shown in table 3 the basis of ranking and scoring system for the rmsi were due to the following reasons 1 johnson et al 1999 divided the scoring system equally into four groups representing excellent good fair and poor the rmsi employed the same approach where equal distribution alleviates bias towards ranking preference and 2 previous scoring system presented in table 3 depicted ranking and scoring system for each of the five indices considered in this study the minimum score could even start at 15 instead of 0 and the maximum score could reach up to 156 to eliminate these variations the minimum score of 0 and maximum of 100 was introduced in the rmsi the previous scoring system is comparable to the rmsi by normalizing each scoring system into 100 3 study area and data five rivers from mountainous regions in malaysia were selected as case studies for the implementation of the rmsi methodology they are rasau river 8 cross sections congkak river 8 cross sections sekayu river 11 cross sections nal river 2 cross sections and lata payung river 3 cross sections the 32 cross sections in these rivers were surveyed along the longitudinal river profile separated 500 1200 m apart depending on the complexities and the divergence of the morphological appearances fig 3 shows the sampling locations of the five rivers the factors influencing the selection of the study area and the cross sections were 1 location that fit the definition of mountain rivers and 2 accessibility the first stage in identifying the reference site was to find any obstacles and man made or artificial structures within the study reaches that might change the flow dynamics such structures included dams weirs bridges modifications to river bed and bank and channel diversions using cartographic data the pre selected rivers were assessed to observe the presence of these obstacles in the river system map analysis and field visits are generally the best ways to validate the existence of such elements table s1 indicates that none of the pre selected rivers contained such obstacles or artificial structures at the river cross sections there were no important reservoirs or ponds upstream of the pre selected sites although the sekayu river is located close to the kenyir dam the catchments for the two are different cross wise obstacles or weirs were not present in any of the pre selected rivers water extraction diversion or channel modification were not present in the study areas natural vegetation structure and existence of riparian zone were also considered in the identification of the reference sites after determining the potential reference site at the macroscale level field surveys were conducted to fit the hydro morphologic data into the existing indices table 4 shows the hydraulic geometry and sediment characteristics for all the 32 study cross sections the river discharge and velocity ranged between 0 05 4 72 m3 s and 0 02 1 13 m s respectively the flowrates were measured at the recession limb of a storm hydrograph which signified the nature of rivers after a peak rainstorm event the discharge was small due to its location at the upper stream order with the river width being less than 30 m the average water surface slopes were 0 03 m m and the maximum recorded slope was 0 4 m m the median grain size was in the range of 0 57 286 mm which was within the sand to boulder type of material note that the influence of hydrologic alteration on the river stability was not relevant here as it was not an influencing factor for the morphologic index considered in this study 4 results and discussion 4 1 selection of reference sites selection of reference sites for potential reaches was made at a microscale level using the existing indices fig 4 summarizes the results of the assessment for all the 32 cross sections it suggested that ten cross sections were not suitable for selection as reference sites as the scores did not fulfil the conditions stipulated in section 2 1 for instance two cross sections at the nal river n1 n2 were categorized as either moderately stable or moderately unstable channels these two cross sections also showed excessive bar development bank cutting and aggradation as portrayed in fig s1 the same situation happened for two cross sections in the setiu river five cross sections in the congkak river and one cross section in the rasau river most of these cross sections were categorized as moderately stable than stable channels in a nutshell out of a total of 32 potential reference sites only 22 cross sections were considered suitable as reference sites 4 2 performances of different indices from table 1 the majority of parameters were analysed qualitatively rather than quantitatively fig 5 reveals that the ccsi consists of more qualitative measurement 75 than quantitative measurement 25 the johnson index had the highest quantitative measurement parameters 46 greater quantitative measurement reduced the bias towards the operator s errors however the underlying principles for all indices remained the same the parameters were deemed to be in an excellent state should the ratings be smaller or close to zero most ratings for each index spanned from 0 to 10 with the lowest number close to 0 indicating excellent characteristics while the highest number close to 10 indicating the opposite since the nal river has been seriously deteriorated as mentioned above it is used as an example for discussing the performance of each index here the maximum rating in the osepi for the nal river was found to be the mass wasting 7 5 10 bank height 6 25 10 streambank protection 6 25 10 and vegetative cover 6 25 10 however the median values for streambank protection and vegetative cover were 5 10 as shown in fig 6 the median of 5 5 10 meant that the majority of the study area was 50 covered with shrubs and roots therefore to reinstate the nal river into a more stable condition the rehabilitation work should focus on enhancing the streambank protection and vegetative cover rather than modifying other river properties for the csi the ratings ranged between 0 and 4 bed materials that had bedrock characteristics were assigned a score of zero while bed materials of silts clays were assigned a score of 4 it is desirable to have low ratings to obtain stable condition greater force and higher shields stress are required to entrain dislodge and transport larger particle size yager et al 2007 therefore bigger size of bed material was assigned with lower rating values due to relative erodibility as previously reported by simon and downs 1995 and johnson et al 1999 the maximum ratings for the nal river in the csi were for the degree of constriction 4 4 and degree of incision 3 5 4 the median value of bed bank protection stood at 2 5 4 which meant that the majority of the study area did not have natural bed and bank protection therefore to reinstate the river into a more stable condition the rehabilitation work should focus on enhancing both bank and bed protection the assessment for the ccsi was grouped into three categories upper bank lower bank and channel bottom regions the parameters for the upper bank region were intermediate flood prone width degree of incision vegetative cover and mass wasting for the lower bank region the parameters consisted of bank material flow deflector obstruction to flow and scouring lastly the channel bottom regions focused on particle arrangement degradation aggradation and stage of channel evolution the maximum scores for the nal river in the ccsi were particle packing 6 5 and degree of aggradation 6 particle packing refers to the degree of sorting a homogenous particle packing on the riverbed shows well packed bed material while non uniform particle packing on the river bottom shows the opposite most of the study cross sections showed non uniform particle sizes reflecting the particle packing scores the degree of aggradation shows the embeddedness of particles on the riverbed embeddedness implies the stacking of coarser particle atop of a riverbed to reflect the interlock between the particles low embeddedness reflects low interlocking among particles on the riverbed the median value of flood prone width was 5 the lack of a well connected floodplain at the nal river may be identified as a cause of biological stress related to water quality habitat issues related to excess nutrients and sediment and unstable habitat zones therefore to reinstate the river into a more stable condition the rehabilitation work should focus on enhancing the intermediate flood prone width and enriching the riparian zone the johnson index score revealed that all ratings spanned from 0 to 12 with the lowest number close to 0 indicating excellent characteristics while the highest number close to 12 indicating the opposite after obtaining the ratings from 0 to 12 the ratings from the respective parameters must be multiplied with the weightage to obtain the stability scores the highest weightage assigned was shear stress ratio 1 0 and the lowest weightages were assigned to debris jam potential and obstruction to flow 0 2 it is desirable to have low scores in order to obtain stable condition shear stress ratio and bar development parameters indicated the maximum ratings and scores in the johnson index for the nal river shear stress ratio can be defined as the ratio between bed shear stress and critical shear stress bed shear stress is the force exerted by the flow on the sediment particles while critical shear stress is the minimum force required to entrain particles on the riverbed a ratio of 1 implies that the particles are on the verge of transport state a ratio of less than 1 implies that the minimum shear required to entrain the particles is far greater than the force exerted by the flow and thus the median particles on the riverbed are still intact and not in a moving state a ratio of greater than 1 implies that the exerted force by the flow exceeds the minimum force required to entrain the particles hence the particles will start to move the johnson index was designed for channel stability at road crossing which acquired less scouring issue hence it is desirable to have a shear stress ratio of less than 1 to reflect the stable state of particle on the riverbed therefore to reinstate the river into a more stable condition the rehabilitation work should focus on modifying the shear stress ratio the ratio can be reduced by changing the channel slope which will decrease the bed shear stress or coarsening the bed material size which in turn will increase the critical shear stress the pfankuch index emulates three categories in its computation upper bank lower bank and bottom section the parameters for the upper bank were landform slope mass wasting debris jam potential and vegetative cover for the lower bank the parameters consisted of channel capacity bank rock content obstruction to flow and bank cutting lastly the parameters for the bottom section included rock angularity brightness of the rock particle arrangement percentage of stable material scouring and clinging aquatic vegetation the maximum rating for the nal river in the pfankuch index was observed at the bottom section the ratings for scouring and deposition was recorded at 13 5 24 while a median value of 5 was recorded for percentage of stable material on riverbed the stable material reflects the coarse sediment particles on riverbed the rocks remaining on a stream bottom partly reflect the geological conditions and preceding flow regime bedrock and boulders 26 cm diameter can generally be considered as stable elements therefore to reinstate the river into a more stable condition the rehabilitation work should focus on modifying the bed material sizes coarsening of bed material will improve the river stability 4 3 assessment on influential parameters a total of 47 parameters fig 2 were extracted for the weighting analysis prior to the selection of the top 10 parameters that influenced the river changes the biggest frequency within this class was assigned the highest preference prior to the ahp more details can be found in fig s2 and table s2 the rankings were obtained by multiplying the local weightage lw and global weightage gw the lw represented the matrix of eigenvalues within the sub criteria classes while the gw represented the matrix of eigenvalues within the criteria classes based on the results channel form represented rank number 1 or the most influential parameter that controlled the channel change since 47 parameters were tested and analysed the top 10 parameters that contributed to channel change were ranked from 1 to 10 by normalizing the weightage values to 100 the parameters and the associated weightages were channel form 0 16 channel dimension 0 14 substrate 0 13 channel pattern 0 12 bank slope 0 09 bank erosion 0 08 channel adjustment 0 08 artificial feature and structure 0 07 degree of constriction 0 07 and vegetative cover 0 06 fig 7 depicts the parameters that were susceptible to the channel change these parameters were used as the basis for the calculation of the new rmsi in malaysia using the equation 3 r m s i 0 100 0 16 p channel form 0 14 p channel dimension 0 13 p substrate 0 12 p channel pattern 0 09 p bank slope 0 08 p bank erosion 0 08 p channel adjustment 0 07 p artificial structure 0 07 p degree of constriction 0 06 p vegetative cover where p is the rating for each parameterization the index was formulated on the basis that no single parameter might impose threat to the functioning river system but the rating for each parameterization could adversely impact the stability score it is desirable to have a lower score as shown in table 3 as such to restore the river into a more stable state the rating for each parameterization should be close to zero and the target parameter should focus on the descending weightage value e g 0 16 for channel form and 0 06 for vegetative cover the full explanation on the ratings can be obtained from the supplementary file fig 7 shows that the vegetative cover for riverbanks had the lowest weightage than the others although it was the lowest the existing index made full use of this criterion in its derivation note that if a bank slope was very high the vegetation typically played a minor role in stabilizing the river the ahp analysis revealed that bank slope played a major role in keeping river stability where the weightage of 0 09 was recorded as opposed to 0 06 for vegetative cover nonetheless both parameters were included in the development of the index meanwhile the channel form had the highest weight because of its crucial impact on the upper bank region and the whole catchment area when compared to vegetative cover which only impacted locally 4 4 application of rmsi all the ten influential parameters see fig 7 were selected as the main assessment scheme in the rmsi these 10 parameters seemed to be feasible and easy to assess in the fields while inclusion of a large number of parameters in the rmsi imposed some difficulties in the evaluation the weightages in fig 7 were used as a basis in creating the ratings these ratings were grouped into four or five classes depending on the available literature or frequently used terminology in the hydro morphological assessment as such the substrate parameters might consist of clay silt sand gravel and bedrock each rating would give a different score depending on the vulnerability towards river stability for instance bedrock would be assigned rating of 0 while clay would be assigned a rating of 10 a summary of the ratings is shown in table s3 the majority of the parameters utilized quantitative physical measurement description 60 rather than qualitative visual observation description higher proportion of quantitative parameters would alleviate biases towards the operator s error during a field observation because of low dependency on visual observation but high reliance on physical measurement the rmsi gave better selection when compared to the existing indices qualitative analysis offers dichotomous categories such as functional non functional or yes no without using empirical equation to make the selection all measurements in the fields must fulfil the ratings in the assessment form see table s3 the scores near to 0 indicated stability while a score toward 10 indicated the opposite the rating for each parameter must be multiplied by the associated weightage to obtain the score of the sub parameters the final scores can be obtained by summing up all the scores of the sub parameters and fitting them into either very stable moderately stable moderately unstable or very unstable category the fitting of data for the 32 cross sections into the rmsi revealed promising results the parameters that required field measurement and computation were streambed material channel dimension bank slope angle degree of constriction vegetative cover and channel form the remaining parameters utilized field observation to determine the existence of the related features such as artificial features channel adjustment bank erosion and channel pattern the total scores for all the cross sections are shown in fig 8 twenty two river cross sections were within the very stable category in which the scores were in the range 0 25 these results were consistent with the aforementioned reference sites as previously discussed in section 3 2 confirming its reliability the existing indices seem to have the score variance in the range 30 60 amongst them the score for osepi and ccsi were found to be almost identical to each other while csi was susceptible to produce the highest score reading for majority of the cross sections two clusters were observed osepi and ccsi produced the minimum score while csi johnson and pfankuch indices yielded the maximum score for each cross section nonetheless rmsi produced the median between them the advantages of the rmsi over the other indices stem from three fundamental factors 1 the number of parameters that can be acquired through field and physical measurements is greater than that possible with visual observation which alleviate human errors due to field observation 2 the rmsi is comparable to the other existing indices due to the selection of 10 key parameters and maximum ratings of 10 for each the normalization is easy to make for each rating class because of equal distribution among the score classes and 3 the number of parameters assessed is fewer than that in the previous indices yet the capability of the rmsi to evaluate river stability is consistent and comparable with that of the previous indices however it should be noticed that the rmsi developed in this study and also other indices was mainly applicable for morphologic stability evaluation and so may not be suitable or reliable for physical habitat riparian or hydrological alteration assessment 5 conclusions in this study we proposed the river morphologic stability index rmsi to assess river stability at mountain rivers in malaysia the river stability status can be grouped into four classes using rmsi highly stable score of 0 25 moderately stable score of 26 50 moderately unstable score of 51 75 and extremely unstable score of 76 100 the validation of the rmsi against 22 reference sites revealed that all of them fell within the highly stable category those references sites are morphologically stable from field visit and are found to fall into stable reach category using the existing indices thus the application of the rmsi is considered as reliable which can provide consistent results against the actual datasets the results from the present study are certainly encouraging however formulation of a new river stability index should focus on hybrid application of morphologic riparian physical habitat and flow alteration instead of just the independent approach in order to maximise the applicability of the index the process based explanation for the influential parameters that control the river change should also be given

8159,study region five mountain rivers rasau congkak sekayu nal and lata payung in malaysia study focus stability of mountain rivers is essential to maintain the natural landscape of fluvial morphology amid climate variability and anthropogenic stresses however rapid assessment tools for characterizing the channel stability of mountain river systems are lacking in this study a river morphologic stability index rmsi is developed and used to evaluate the stability of 32 cross sections in five mountain rivers in malaysia the performance of this index is compared with that of five conventional indexes new hydrological insights for the region the analysis indicates that ten crucial parameters and their weightages are key to represent the dynamic changes of river landscapes channel form 0 16 channel dimension 0 14 substrate 0 13 channel pattern 0 12 bank slope 0 09 bank erosion 0 08 channel adjustment 0 08 artificial feature and structure 0 07 degree of constriction 0 07 and vegetative cover 0 06 these parameters formed the basis of the development of rmsi for each parameter its ratings and weightages were defined to differentiate between the excellent and worst river conditions the final rmsi score was grouped into four categories highly stable 0 25 moderately stable 26 50 moderately unstable 51 75 and extremely unstable 76 100 results indicated that 22 of all the 32 cross sections concerned were within the very stable category keywords river stability hydro morphology assessment index analytical hierarchical process mountain river 1 introduction streams and rivers are generally the products of natural geological processes fluvial dynamics and human alterations therefore water resources must be carefully managed to ensure the sustainability of river landscapes and the continuous supply of clean water the processes of erosion sediment transport and deposition are the catalysts that shape the river landscapes of our earth julien 2010 an interruption of natural river equilibrium through land use change instream sand mining or other causes will result in either erosion or deposition at the downstream of the rivers recently numerous hydro morphological river assessments have been undertaken in many countries with notable differences in their aims scales and approaches overall one main objective of these exercises is to provide a rapid tool to evaluate either channel condition or channel stability using various approaches belletti et al 2015 offered an in depth discussion on the river health assessment the approaches widely used for river health assessment can be divided into four main types 1 physical habitat assessment gorazd and branka 2009 harding et al 2009 maine department of environmental protection 2009 natural resources conservation 2009 northern ireland environment agency 2009 andrew et al 2010 xia et al 2010 marta gonzález and diego 2011 2 riparian habitat assessment oregon governor s watershed

settings nevertheless similar parameters are often used for the assessments in a combination of hydraulics hydrology and geomorphology of river landscapes in a nutshell these evaluations being represented as the hydro morphological assessment methods can provide a good understanding on the best solution of restoration work in the future the available project risk screening matrix for river management and restoration cluer et al 2010 skidmore et al 2011 thorne et al 2015 is apparent due to available hydro morphological assessment in the past in malaysia there is a lack of rapid assessment tools for characterizing either the channel stability or channel condition of mountain river systems as of now the only available index to assess the river health is the national water quality index wqi for malaysia department of environment doe 2006 however the wqi was developed mainly to assess the physical and chemical aspects of water quality of the fluvial river systems rather than the mountain river systems most assessments in malaysia have been conducted either by producing a mapping system or by using an empirical equation consequently two phenomena that require zonation for mitigation works have been widely studied in malaysia flood risk mapping sinnakaudan et al 2003 hassan et al 2006 elsheikh et al 2015 and landslide mapping pradhan and lee 2010 ayob et al 2019 sulaiman et al 2019b empirical equations for the assessments have been widely used in the past including for sediment transport prediction in river systems sinnakaudan et al 2006 2010 sulaiman et al 2017b a and prediction of river bank erosion abidin et al 2017 however a rapid assessment tool in the form of hydro morphological approaches is clearly needed to test the stability of mountain river systems the focus on mountain river systems stems from two main reasons 1 the rapid development of agricultural activities at the mountain river corridors has led to serious catastrophes in the past such as landslides river bank erosion and high suspended sediments in the river systems and 2 the morphometry of the mountain river systems is different from that of their lowland counterpart playing an immense role in the hydrologic behaviour of a drainage basin sajadi et al 2020 the term mountain rivers can be inferred to a gradient of 0 002 m m along the majority of its length wohl 2000 thompson 2006 besides their steep slopes the mountain rivers are generally characterized by the high boundary roughness provided by large coarse clasts various bed material sizes and high turbulent flow thompson 2006 vollmer and kleinhans 2008 horton 1945 defined headwater or mountain rivers as having a stream order of 1 4 due to these reasons the mountain rivers have generally been considered to be fundamentally different from the lowland rivers and the application of the existing theories of unconfined alluvial channel associated to lowland rivers has been subjected to further verification sulaiman et al 2017a mountain rivers exhibit great variability in hydrological regime channel planform channel gradient grain size and bedforms sediment dynamics and aquatic and riparian biota both at localized individual mountain ranges and among the diverse mountainous regions wohl 2000 in view of these the main objective of this study was to develop a river morphologic stability index rmsi to assess mountain river systems with a case study in malaysia four main stages were formulated to develop the rmsi selecting the reference site revisiting the existing indices finding the influential parameters and making a multi criteria decision the index was then used to evaluate the stability of 32 cross sections in five mountain rivers in malaysia the results were also compared with those from five conventional indices based on these some conclusions pertaining to the applicability and validity of the newly developed index were drawn 2 methodology for river morphologic stability index rmsi prior to the development of the rmsi four main stages were performed selecting the reference site revisiting the existing indices finding the influential parameters and making a multi criteria decision reference site represents the stable channel criteria as previously described by kujanová and matoušková 2017 evaluation of the existing indices encapsulates fitting of the current data into those existing indices and finding the drawbacks of using such indices finding the influential parameters depicts the process of selecting the parameters that control channel stability in a river system making a multi criteria decision involves the development of an index using a hybrid of matrix eigenvalues and heuristic approach in fig 1 the four coloured dashed boxes red blue orange and black delineate these four main stages as a basis for developing the rmsi these stages are described below 2 1 selecting the reference site a stable channel can be inferred as a reference site because it is best described by looking at the least degraded channel caused by natural and anthropogenic alterations with the most ecologically and morphologically dynamic states palmer et al 2005 palmer et al 2005 claimed that a river system must be self sustaining and resilient to external perturbations brierley and fryirs 2013 stated that a reference site could be designated as an expected state with the best condition that the river can balance the human alterations given the catchment conditions thus in the present study the selection of the reference site was made following the macroscale and microscale assessments it was adapted from kujanová and matoušková 2017 to alleviate unnecessary sampling that is not feasible for malaysian river conditions the macroscale assessment was performed using cartographic data and satellite imagery analysis the presence of reservoirs in the upstream mainly influenced the selection of the reference site since a reservoir could create hydropeaking which alters the natural flow conditions thus the presence of reservoirs or man made ponds would automatically disqualify such a site the characteristics that are needed to investigate a watershed are listed in fig 1 however natural vegetation structures should always be present before fitting the field survey data into the existing hydro morphological index the microscale assessment entailed checking the river stability status using one or more of the existing indices this assessment emphasized the river reach properties and their relationship to the river stability a minimum of five existing hydro morphological indices were chosen to fit against the field data to determine whether the study area was indeed a reference site or not most of the existing hydro morphological indices classified river segments into either stable moderately stable or unstable reach two main conditions must be fulfilled prior to the selection of a reference site i the score for each cross section must fall within very stable category and ii the frequency of very stable category must be greater than 2 2 2 revisiting the existing indices revisiting the existing indices was made by observing the scoring class and the parameter list see table 1 the scoring and grading techniques were assessed by looking at the similarity the gap and the method of computation for each index previous studies have shown that various grading and scoring techniques were employed for the indices however finding similarity between them was difficult therefore finding a common ground for each index was a crucial step furthermore thorne et al 1996 criticized the opinionated index method as it emphasized a qualitative approach which led to criticisms on the grounds that it was highly subjective therefore lists of parameters and methods for evaluation were given special attention the majority of assessment indices emulated qualitative rather than quantitative techniques in this study five existing indices under morphological theme groups were reviewed and assessed in detail the channel stability index csi simon and downs 1995 oklahoma ozark streambank erosion

stability index psi pfankuch 1975 a review on the influential parameters ranking scoring and types of categorical data is presented here by inferring the study by belletti et al 2015 2 3 finding the influential parameters a ready made checklist provided by belletti et al 2015 was used as a basis to find the influential parameters the description for each parameter was discussed based on the european method for water framework directive reform 2019 data collection method is a theme that relates the method of gathering the data source of information with the mechanism of their storing type of assessment the type of assessment consists of three sub criteria inventorying appraisal by index and general evaluation inventorying is a feature mapping on the frequency extent absence presence and hydro morphological aspect of a river system länder arbeitsgemeinschaft wasser lawa 2000 2002 langhammer 2007 mühlmann 2010 onema 2010 appraisal by index mainly uses a functional unit score system where scores are assigned following a hierarchical stepwise approach länder arbeitsgemeinschaft wasser lawa 2002 general evaluation is a method that aims to give an overall assessment of hydro morphological conditions van dam et al 2007 tavzes and urbanic 2009 spatial scale is the extent of land area or geographical distance of the study area longitudinal spatial scale infers the streamwise extent of a river section temporal scale refers to the time frame of data collection for analysis most researchers utilize the present state of data for river assessment recorded features are parameters assessed in the field such as channel features vegetation floodplain features and large scale characteristics these levels of features are stratified according to the active channel bank and riparian unit floodplain and megaform unit vegetation covers the bank and riparian unit which is close to the water edge floodplain features are the width of the whole floodplain and potentially erodible corridors rinaldi et al 2013 large scale characteristics are recorded features on the megaform unit and the associated flow regimes as such rinaldi et al 2013 emphasized the segmentation phase of geology geomorphology climate and land use in the large scale settings river processes are the themes that relate the physical and geomorphic forms of a river landscape as a result of fluvial processes the weightage for each parameter was assessed using the analytical hierarchical process ahp the highest weightage indicated the most influential parameters in their sub indices the influential parameters provided a basis for the factors that controlled changes in the river landscapes the weightage was expressed in terms of matrix eigenvalues those eigenvalues were normalized among the selected influential parameters to obtain the total eigenvalue of 100 this weightage was multiplied by the associated ratings of selected parameters to obtain their scores the ratings were selected based on the previous assessment and the score was tallied to get the total score hence the overall index of either stable or unstable channel conditions was determined 2 4 making a multi criteria decision multi criteria decision making mcdm is a process of selecting the influential parameters using the ahp technique multi criteria represents the multiple level of parameters prior to selecting the influential parameters the hydro morphological method by belletti et al 2015 was used to determine the influential parameters that affected the channel changes a total of 47 parameters was extracted from 22 existing indices for the weighting analysis these 47 parameters were used to obtain a full perspective of the percentage coverage as portrayed in fig 2 the mcdm was made by separating those parameters into 10 classes of criteria covering data collection method type of method longitudinal spatial scale lateral spatial scale temporal scale channel feature vegetative regeneration floodplain feature large scale characteristics of bedform and river process the highest frequency within this class was assigned as the highest preference prior to ahp which entailed the use of a preference scale for bipolar comparisons table 2 fig 2 shows the frequency in a percentage form for each criterion as previously reported by belletti et al 2015 the frequency of 100 in any sub criterion meant that all existing hydro morphological methods used those techniques in their sampling computation or derivation since only two levels of hierarchy were involved criterion and sub criterion they must be assessed separately the difference in frequency served as a benchmark for selecting the preference scale a preference scale of 1 indicated equal importance while a preference scale of 9 portrayed extreme importance between the two selections for example the difference in percentage for remote sensing and field survey was 18 in favour of the latter scale preference of 2 2 5 development of river morphologic stability index rmsi following the above four stages the rmsi was developed it entailed normalizing the selected influential parameters to fit into 100 of weightage the parameters contained two levels of mcdm which led to the formation of global weightage gw and local weightage lw for the criteria and sub criteria respectively with 47 parameters assessed from fig 2 the top 10 influential parameters were selected prior to the rmsi formation the selection was made based on the ahp see sections 2 3 and 2 4 the normalization was performed using the following formula 1 w e i g h t a g e g w l w c u m u l a t i v e f o r g w l w each parameter consisted of a few ratings based on previous studies pfankuch 1975 johnson et al 1999 rinaldi et al 2013 those ratings differentiated the best and the worst conditions for each parameter the minimum and maximum ratings were the same for each parameter most ratings for each index spanned from 0 to 10 where the lowest number close to 0 depicted excellent characteristics while the highest number close to 10 depicted the opposite the total score could be obtained by summing up all the sub scores for each parameter 2 r m s i 0 100 α 1 p rate 1 α 2 p rate 2 α 3 p rate 3 α n p rate n where r m s i 0 100 is the expected total score values ranging from 0 to 100 α is the weightage values p r a t e is the ratings for each parameter and n is the number of parameters to classify the stability of the watershed studied the score levels must be divided into a meaningful classification such as stable moderately stable or unstable condition different sets of scores and rating levels were used for the previous indices as shown in table 3 the basis of ranking and scoring system for the rmsi were due to the following reasons 1 johnson et al 1999 divided the scoring system equally into four groups representing excellent good fair and poor the rmsi employed the same approach where equal distribution alleviates bias towards ranking preference and 2 previous scoring system presented in table 3 depicted ranking and scoring system for each of the five indices considered in this study the minimum score could even start at 15 instead of 0 and the maximum score could reach up to 156 to eliminate these variations the minimum score of 0 and maximum of 100 was introduced in the rmsi the previous scoring system is comparable to the rmsi by normalizing each scoring system into 100 3 study area and data five rivers from mountainous regions in malaysia were selected as case studies for the implementation of the rmsi methodology they are rasau river 8 cross sections congkak river 8 cross sections sekayu river 11 cross sections nal river 2 cross sections and lata payung river 3 cross sections the 32 cross sections in these rivers were surveyed along the longitudinal river profile separated 500 1200 m apart depending on the complexities and the divergence of the morphological appearances fig 3 shows the sampling locations of the five rivers the factors influencing the selection of the study area and the cross sections were 1 location that fit the definition of mountain rivers and 2 accessibility the first stage in identifying the reference site was to find any obstacles and man made or artificial structures within the study reaches that might change the flow dynamics such structures included dams weirs bridges modifications to river bed and bank and channel diversions using cartographic data the pre selected rivers were assessed to observe the presence of these obstacles in the river system map analysis and field visits are generally the best ways to validate the existence of such elements table s1 indicates that none of the pre selected rivers contained such obstacles or artificial structures at the river cross sections there were no important reservoirs or ponds upstream of the pre selected sites although the sekayu river is located close to the kenyir dam the catchments for the two are different cross wise obstacles or weirs were not present in any of the pre selected rivers water extraction diversion or channel modification were not present in the study areas natural vegetation structure and existence of riparian zone were also considered in the identification of the reference sites after determining the potential reference site at the macroscale level field surveys were conducted to fit the hydro morphologic data into the existing indices table 4 shows the hydraulic geometry and sediment characteristics for all the 32 study cross sections the river discharge and velocity ranged between 0 05 4 72 m3 s and 0 02 1 13 m s respectively the flowrates were measured at the recession limb of a storm hydrograph which signified the nature of rivers after a peak rainstorm event the discharge was small due to its location at the upper stream order with the river width being less than 30 m the average water surface slopes were 0 03 m m and the maximum recorded slope was 0 4 m m the median grain size was in the range of 0 57 286 mm which was within the sand to boulder type of material note that the influence of hydrologic alteration on the river stability was not relevant here as it was not an influencing factor for the morphologic index considered in this study 4 results and discussion 4 1 selection of reference sites selection of reference sites for potential reaches was made at a microscale level using the existing indices fig 4 summarizes the results of the assessment for all the 32 cross sections it suggested that ten cross sections were not suitable for selection as reference sites as the scores did not fulfil the conditions stipulated in section 2 1 for instance two cross sections at the nal river n1 n2 were categorized as either moderately stable or moderately unstable channels these two cross sections also showed excessive bar development bank cutting and aggradation as portrayed in fig s1 the same situation happened for two cross sections in the setiu river five cross sections in the congkak river and one cross section in the rasau river most of these cross sections were categorized as moderately stable than stable channels in a nutshell out of a total of 32 potential reference sites only 22 cross sections were considered suitable as reference sites 4 2 performances of different indices from table 1 the majority of parameters were analysed qualitatively rather than quantitatively fig 5 reveals that the ccsi consists of more qualitative measurement 75 than quantitative measurement 25 the johnson index had the highest quantitative measurement parameters 46 greater quantitative measurement reduced the bias towards the operator s errors however the underlying principles for all indices remained the same the parameters were deemed to be in an excellent state should the ratings be smaller or close to zero most ratings for each index spanned from 0 to 10 with the lowest number close to 0 indicating excellent characteristics while the highest number close to 10 indicating the opposite since the nal river has been seriously deteriorated as mentioned above it is used as an example for discussing the performance of each index here the maximum rating in the osepi for the nal river was found to be the mass wasting 7 5 10 bank height 6 25 10 streambank protection 6 25 10 and vegetative cover 6 25 10 however the median values for streambank protection and vegetative cover were 5 10 as shown in fig 6 the median of 5 5 10 meant that the majority of the study area was 50 covered with shrubs and roots therefore to reinstate the nal river into a more stable condition the rehabilitation work should focus on enhancing the streambank protection and vegetative cover rather than modifying other river properties for the csi the ratings ranged between 0 and 4 bed materials that had bedrock characteristics were assigned a score of zero while bed materials of silts clays were assigned a score of 4 it is desirable to have low ratings to obtain stable condition greater force and higher shields stress are required to entrain dislodge and transport larger particle size yager et al 2007 therefore bigger size of bed material was assigned with lower rating values due to relative erodibility as previously reported by simon and downs 1995 and johnson et al 1999 the maximum ratings for the nal river in the csi were for the degree of constriction 4 4 and degree of incision 3 5 4 the median value of bed bank protection stood at 2 5 4 which meant that the majority of the study area did not have natural bed and bank protection therefore to reinstate the river into a more stable condition the rehabilitation work should focus on enhancing both bank and bed protection the assessment for the ccsi was grouped into three categories upper bank lower bank and channel bottom regions the parameters for the upper bank region were intermediate flood prone width degree of incision vegetative cover and mass wasting for the lower bank region the parameters consisted of bank material flow deflector obstruction to flow and scouring lastly the channel bottom regions focused on particle arrangement degradation aggradation and stage of channel evolution the maximum scores for the nal river in the ccsi were particle packing 6 5 and degree of aggradation 6 particle packing refers to the degree of sorting a homogenous particle packing on the riverbed shows well packed bed material while non uniform particle packing on the river bottom shows the opposite most of the study cross sections showed non uniform particle sizes reflecting the particle packing scores the degree of aggradation shows the embeddedness of particles on the riverbed embeddedness implies the stacking of coarser particle atop of a riverbed to reflect the interlock between the particles low embeddedness reflects low interlocking among particles on the riverbed the median value of flood prone width was 5 the lack of a well connected floodplain at the nal river may be identified as a cause of biological stress related to water quality habitat issues related to excess nutrients and sediment and unstable habitat zones therefore to reinstate the river into a more stable condition the rehabilitation work should focus on enhancing the intermediate flood prone width and enriching the riparian zone the johnson index score revealed that all ratings spanned from 0 to 12 with the lowest number close to 0 indicating excellent characteristics while the highest number close to 12 indicating the opposite after obtaining the ratings from 0 to 12 the ratings from the respective parameters must be multiplied with the weightage to obtain the stability scores the highest weightage assigned was shear stress ratio 1 0 and the lowest weightages were assigned to debris jam potential and obstruction to flow 0 2 it is desirable to have low scores in order to obtain stable condition shear stress ratio and bar development parameters indicated the maximum ratings and scores in the johnson index for the nal river shear stress ratio can be defined as the ratio between bed shear stress and critical shear stress bed shear stress is the force exerted by the flow on the sediment particles while critical shear stress is the minimum force required to entrain particles on the riverbed a ratio of 1 implies that the particles are on the verge of transport state a ratio of less than 1 implies that the minimum shear required to entrain the particles is far greater than the force exerted by the flow and thus the median particles on the riverbed are still intact and not in a moving state a ratio of greater than 1 implies that the exerted force by the flow exceeds the minimum force required to entrain the particles hence the particles will start to move the johnson index was designed for channel stability at road crossing which acquired less scouring issue hence it is desirable to have a shear stress ratio of less than 1 to reflect the stable state of particle on the riverbed therefore to reinstate the river into a more stable condition the rehabilitation work should focus on modifying the shear stress ratio the ratio can be reduced by changing the channel slope which will decrease the bed shear stress or coarsening the bed material size which in turn will increase the critical shear stress the pfankuch index emulates three categories in its computation upper bank lower bank and bottom section the parameters for the upper bank were landform slope mass wasting debris jam potential and vegetative cover for the lower bank the parameters consisted of channel capacity bank rock content obstruction to flow and bank cutting lastly the parameters for the bottom section included rock angularity brightness of the rock particle arrangement percentage of stable material scouring and clinging aquatic vegetation the maximum rating for the nal river in the pfankuch index was observed at the bottom section the ratings for scouring and deposition was recorded at 13 5 24 while a median value of 5 was recorded for percentage of stable material on riverbed the stable material reflects the coarse sediment particles on riverbed the rocks remaining on a stream bottom partly reflect the geological conditions and preceding flow regime bedrock and boulders 26 cm diameter can generally be considered as stable elements therefore to reinstate the river into a more stable condition the rehabilitation work should focus on modifying the bed material sizes coarsening of bed material will improve the river stability 4 3 assessment on influential parameters a total of 47 parameters fig 2 were extracted for the weighting analysis prior to the selection of the top 10 parameters that influenced the river changes the biggest frequency within this class was assigned the highest preference prior to the ahp more details can be found in fig s2 and table s2 the rankings were obtained by multiplying the local weightage lw and global weightage gw the lw represented the matrix of eigenvalues within the sub criteria classes while the gw represented the matrix of eigenvalues within the criteria classes based on the results channel form represented rank number 1 or the most influential parameter that controlled the channel change since 47 parameters were tested and analysed the top 10 parameters that contributed to channel change were ranked from 1 to 10 by normalizing the weightage values to 100 the parameters and the associated weightages were channel form 0 16 channel dimension 0 14 substrate 0 13 channel pattern 0 12 bank slope 0 09 bank erosion 0 08 channel adjustment 0 08 artificial feature and structure 0 07 degree of constriction 0 07 and vegetative cover 0 06 fig 7 depicts the parameters that were susceptible to the channel change these parameters were used as the basis for the calculation of the new rmsi in malaysia using the equation 3 r m s i 0 100 0 16 p channel form 0 14 p channel dimension 0 13 p substrate 0 12 p channel pattern 0 09 p bank slope 0 08 p bank erosion 0 08 p channel adjustment 0 07 p artificial structure 0 07 p degree of constriction 0 06 p vegetative cover where p is the rating for each parameterization the index was formulated on the basis that no single parameter might impose threat to the functioning river system but the rating for each parameterization could adversely impact the stability score it is desirable to have a lower score as shown in table 3 as such to restore the river into a more stable state the rating for each parameterization should be close to zero and the target parameter should focus on the descending weightage value e g 0 16 for channel form and 0 06 for vegetative cover the full explanation on the ratings can be obtained from the supplementary file fig 7 shows that the vegetative cover for riverbanks had the lowest weightage than the others although it was the lowest the existing index made full use of this criterion in its derivation note that if a bank slope was very high the vegetation typically played a minor role in stabilizing the river the ahp analysis revealed that bank slope played a major role in keeping river stability where the weightage of 0 09 was recorded as opposed to 0 06 for vegetative cover nonetheless both parameters were included in the development of the index meanwhile the channel form had the highest weight because of its crucial impact on the upper bank region and the whole catchment area when compared to vegetative cover which only impacted locally 4 4 application of rmsi all the ten influential parameters see fig 7 were selected as the main assessment scheme in the rmsi these 10 parameters seemed to be feasible and easy to assess in the fields while inclusion of a large number of parameters in the rmsi imposed some difficulties in the evaluation the weightages in fig 7 were used as a basis in creating the ratings these ratings were grouped into four or five classes depending on the available literature or frequently used terminology in the hydro morphological assessment as such the substrate parameters might consist of clay silt sand gravel and bedrock each rating would give a different score depending on the vulnerability towards river stability for instance bedrock would be assigned rating of 0 while clay would be assigned a rating of 10 a summary of the ratings is shown in table s3 the majority of the parameters utilized quantitative physical measurement description 60 rather than qualitative visual observation description higher proportion of quantitative parameters would alleviate biases towards the operator s error during a field observation because of low dependency on visual observation but high reliance on physical measurement the rmsi gave better selection when compared to the existing indices qualitative analysis offers dichotomous categories such as functional non functional or yes no without using empirical equation to make the selection all measurements in the fields must fulfil the ratings in the assessment form see table s3 the scores near to 0 indicated stability while a score toward 10 indicated the opposite the rating for each parameter must be multiplied by the associated weightage to obtain the score of the sub parameters the final scores can be obtained by summing up all the scores of the sub parameters and fitting them into either very stable moderately stable moderately unstable or very unstable category the fitting of data for the 32 cross sections into the rmsi revealed promising results the parameters that required field measurement and computation were streambed material channel dimension bank slope angle degree of constriction vegetative cover and channel form the remaining parameters utilized field observation to determine the existence of the related features such as artificial features channel adjustment bank erosion and channel pattern the total scores for all the cross sections are shown in fig 8 twenty two river cross sections were within the very stable category in which the scores were in the range 0 25 these results were consistent with the aforementioned reference sites as previously discussed in section 3 2 confirming its reliability the existing indices seem to have the score variance in the range 30 60 amongst them the score for osepi and ccsi were found to be almost identical to each other while csi was susceptible to produce the highest score reading for majority of the cross sections two clusters were observed osepi and ccsi produced the minimum score while csi johnson and pfankuch indices yielded the maximum score for each cross section nonetheless rmsi produced the median between them the advantages of the rmsi over the other indices stem from three fundamental factors 1 the number of parameters that can be acquired through field and physical measurements is greater than that possible with visual observation which alleviate human errors due to field observation 2 the rmsi is comparable to the other existing indices due to the selection of 10 key parameters and maximum ratings of 10 for each the normalization is easy to make for each rating class because of equal distribution among the score classes and 3 the number of parameters assessed is fewer than that in the previous indices yet the capability of the rmsi to evaluate river stability is consistent and comparable with that of the previous indices however it should be noticed that the rmsi developed in this study and also other indices was mainly applicable for morphologic stability evaluation and so may not be suitable or reliable for physical habitat riparian or hydrological alteration assessment 5 conclusions in this study we proposed the river morphologic stability index rmsi to assess river stability at mountain rivers in malaysia the river stability status can be grouped into four classes using rmsi highly stable score of 0 25 moderately stable score of 26 50 moderately unstable score of 51 75 and extremely unstable score of 76 100 the validation of the rmsi against 22 reference sites revealed that all of them fell within the highly stable category those references sites are morphologically stable from field visit and are found to fall into stable reach category using the existing indices thus the application of the rmsi is considered as reliable which can provide consistent results against the actual datasets the results from the present study are certainly encouraging however formulation of a new river stability index should focus on hybrid application of morphologic riparian physical habitat and flow alteration instead of just the independent approach in order to maximise the applicability of the index the process based explanation for the influential parameters that control the river change should also be given
