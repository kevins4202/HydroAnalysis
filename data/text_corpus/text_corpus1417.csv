flood detention is higher for low rps than high rps while the time delay ability is smaller keywords megacity flood mitigation and adaption low impact development optimal layout design storm water management model simulated annealing sustainable water management 1 introduction since the mid 20th century the global population has been rapidly growing and their need for resources has greatly increased this has resulted in growing urbanization causing increased impermeability in the urban catchment area greatly decreased proportions of infiltration capacity rainfall loss increased intensity of surface runoffs miller et al 2014 and reduced concentration time urban expansion has led to widespread enhancement in a wide variety of streamflow metrics with the exceptions of peak flow indicators rouge and cai 2014 therefore the risk of flood faced by megacities has augmented although most modern megacities currently benefit from both sewage and pumping station drainage systems to facilitate flood channeling from the urban area once rainstorm intensity and duration have exceeded the maximum load capacity of a megacity s drainage system residents from surrounding areas may still suffer flooding losses taiwan island is located in the margin of the western pacific ocean this is a region often hit by hurricanes and storms therefore experiencing frequent severe floods occasionally causing huge inundation losses the current global climate change is an added source of difficulties since in the future megacities may suffer flooding with increased frequency and intensity hence the urgent need to enhance protection devices regarding urban areas needs to be addressed in order to cope with heavy rainfalls a megacity s sewage system must deal with the overflow problem and a larger flood storage space for surface water must be available to handle greater hurricanes and rainstorms vermonden et al 2012 however the protection currently provided by existing flood control devices and sewage system to megacities has low standards and limited effects low impact development lid has a feature of decentralized small scale source control utilizing designs and devices to reduce rainstorm runoff through infiltration retention and evaporation thus relieving pressures on rainwater sewage capacity and pumping stations becoming a part of rainstorm runoff management in megacities hence introducing lid concept and devices into urban development and public construction projects to reduce the natural impacts of development has become a task that brooks no delay previous studies related to megacity lid can be divided into 3 categories the first includes experiments designs and analyses of lid efficiencies dietz 2007 performed experimental comparison by using a series of lid based devices including vegetative swales bioretention cell and permeable paving results show that the lid devices can obviously decrease the runoff of the drainage area and green roof can decrease 63 of direct runoff alfredo et al 2010 performed a series of experiments for green roof results show that the magnitude of time delay and flood detention of peak flow can be promoted 22 70 page et al 2015 installed a bioretention cell street retrofit four permeable pavement parking stalls and a tree filter device to control and treat residential street runoff results show that peak discharge significantly decreased by 28 while lag times in the catchment remained unchanged runoff depths in the lid retrofit catchment were significantly less for events with low rainfall intensities but significantly greater for events with high intensities however most previous researchers employed a limited number of lid types to both experiments and designs therefore the performance of composite design for different types of lid elements so that floods with different return periods can achieve their maximum flood detention efficiencies is still a topic of notable importance requiring intensive investigation the second category of studies focuses on simulations of lid efficiency despotovic et al 2002 simulated and evaluated the drainage efficiency atthekumodrazcatchmentinbelgrade using two rainfall runoff models for the flood events of different return periods themajor devicesoftherecommended solution for re designoftheexisting system are three retention ponds and outlet into a trunk guo 2004 presented a hydrology based approach by which the storage outflow curve can be approximated from the inflow hydrograph to the basin and the maximum allowable release from the basin gilroy and mccuen 2009 analyzed the effects of both location and quantity of two types of bmps cisterns and bioretention pits a spatiotemporal model of a micro watershed was developed to determine the effects of bmps on single family townhome and commercial lots results show that cisterns alone are capable of controlling rooftop runoff for small storms and the location is a factor in the peak reduction chang et al 2013 proposed a drainage and inundation model to assess whether the high intensity rainfall scenario under climate change can be handled by installing detention pond pumping station and flood diversion devices etc results show the essentiality of these engineering approaches walsh et al 2014 presented the results of a long term continuous hydrologic simulation analysis of a watershed scale residential rainwater harvesting rwh program the u s environmental protection agency s storm water management model swmm was applied to simulate rainfall runoff responses for variations in a rwh network including the rwh unit storage size the number of implementing households the amount of time before a unit is allowed to release captured runoff i e drain delay and the time it takes for the unit to drain i e coefficient of discharge lucas and sample 2015 assessed two low impact development lid green stormwater infrastructure gsi alternatives typical free discharge underdrains and underdrains with flow controlled outlets green control these alternatives were compared to two non lid alternatives existing conditions and tunnel storage results show that the green control alternative performed substantially better than the other alternatives in terms of volume control and gsi is more resilient than non lid infrastructure it can be learned from overviewing the abovementioned studies that the increased runoff caused by urban development can be reduced by establishing flood control devices however when facing high intensity rainfall or inundation the flood mitigating benefit of single type lid is still limited and both net benefit and benefit cost ratio cannot be maximized thus lid devices design optimization toward increased flood mitigating efficiency is a topic worth studying besides devices with completed design need quantification tools to simulate rainfall runoffs under multiple lid devices that is an insufficiently explored subject in academic investigations and practical applications new flood mitigating designs such as rain garden and permeable paving are mostly based on experiments determining devices benefits hence the development of simulation elements concerning flood control devices is also an important research topic the third category regards the simulations analyses and optimizations of lid designs however correlation studies regarding optimal layout design of flood control devices are insufficient previous researchers mainly used simulation analysis for lid design booth et al 2002 indicated that comprehensive disaster mitigation needs to be considered in urban development including limitation on impermeable area forest conservation strategy rainwater detention riparian buffer maintenance wetland and slope protection different management objectives need to be stipulated for different development levels fresno et al 2005 proposed the concept of the sustainable urban drainage system to avoid the flood pollution and reduced ecological diversity and the main engineering approaches involved permeable paving infiltration trench infiltration cell filter depression filter strip detention pond and wetland etc according to evaluation results of strategy simulation urban drainage needs to be carried out through a series of engineering solutions instead of a single device meanwhile the connections between different devices also need to be considered in order to control water quantity liu et al 2014 evaluated and quantified the flood and peak flows reduced by green infrastructure gi their results showed that the reduced flood capacity of single gi device was very limited however through the layout of overall devices the total rainfall runoffs of different return periods were effectively reduced by 85 100 and the peak flows were also decreased by 92 100 in order to solve the simulation difficulties in obtaining the optimal solution of design by automatically linkage huang et al 2015 adopted rainwater harvesting systems rwhs into a stormwater runoff management model swmm for the spatial design of capacities and quantities of rain barrels for urban flood mitigation a simulation optimization model is proposed for effectively identifying the optimal design in the optimization method backpropagation neural network bpnn is first applied for developing a water level simulation model of urban drainage systems to substitute for swmm to conform to newly considered optimization model and a tabu search based algorithm is used to optimize the planning solution however only rwhs was applied to urban flood mitigation in this study and the effective and automatic use of multiple composite lid devices to achieve the best flood mitigating economic benefits is still a topic that needs immediate study and development our study aims to establish the optimization model for optimizing the amounts types sizes and layouts of the lid devices first the storm water management model swmm for the studied area was established and model calibration and validation were performed according to historical rainfall events next a simulated annealing sa algorithm was used to develop a technically innovative automatic solving module finally the flood mitigating benefit and lid devices layout design under the maximized benefit cost ratio namely the optimized layout design of lid devices were explored this study specially researches the following subjects 1 the consequences of the existing infrastructures on present and future technical management choices 2 forms of innovations by technical approaches using a better knowledge of natural processes including economical 3 benefits and limits of smart tools and 4 incompatibility of objectives constraints and setting up of priorities the applied seven lid devices include permeable paving bioretention cell infiltration trench rain barrel vegetative swales green roof a newly developed tree box 2 development of methodology 2 1 procedures this study consists of three parts 1 establishment and parameter calibration of storm water management model swmm 2 establishment of an optimization model of multiple low impact development lid devices and 3 optimization and analysis of optimal lid layout design the flowchart of the methodology is shown in fig 1 and the steps are described as follows step 1 1 establish the conceptual model of hydrological and physiographic architectures and engineering structures in the studied area then perform parameter calibration and validation of swmm step 1 2 establish the lid simulation mode in swmm once calibration has been completed input related parameters based on experimental results and lid design form step 2 1 write design variables into the inp file of swmm simulation elements letting the program automatically call to execute swmm and output the simulation results in a rpt file this way the flood mitigating benefits of rainstorm concerning each return period can be calculated automatically step 2 2 establish the objective function constraints and decision variables of the optimal lid layout design and embed the benefit cost computation model of device s flood detention into the optimization model step 3 write the simulated annealing algorithm using matlab programming language to perform an optimization of combined layout design of multiple lids and analyze the optimization results to propose choices priorities and strategies of optimal design 2 2 introduction to swmm the united states environmental protection agency us epa swmm model is a dynamic rainfall runoff model used for simulation of the surface subsurface hydrology quantity and quality from primarily urban suburban areas rossman 2010 the hydrology component of swmm operates on a collection of subcatchment areas with and without depression storage to predict runoff from precipitation evaporation and infiltration losses from each of the subcatchment the horton s infiltration method is adopted for rainfall runoff simulation in subcatchments in swmm in addition the lid areas on the subcatchment can be modeled to reduce the impervious and pervious runoff swmm tracks the flow rate flow depth and water quality in each pipe and channel during a simulation period composed of multiple fixed or variable time steps 2 2 1 model parameters and routing the adopted model parameters for simulation include 1 in subcatchments width of overland flow path m percent of impervious area manning s n for impervious and pervious area depth of depression storage on impervious and pervious area mm and percent of impervious area with no depression storage 2 in infiltration process horton based max min infiltration rates mm h and decay constant mm h and 3 in conduits manning s roughness coefficient the subcatchment width parameter is normally estimated by dividing the subcatchment area by a representative length of overland flow the routing options of swmm include steady flow routing kinematic wave routing and dynamic wave routing dynamic wave routing solves the complete one dimensional saint venant flow equations which consist of the continuity equation and momentum equation for conduits and a volume continuity equation at nodes due to the capability and demand of this study dynamic wave routing is applied for routing 2 2 2 the low impact development components within swmm the lid function is integrated within the subcatchment component of swmm and allows further refinement of the overflows infiltration flow and evaporation in permeable paving bioretention cell rain garden rain barrel vegetative swales green roof infiltration trench and newly developed tree box lid takes many forms but can generally be thought of as an effort to minimize or prevent concentrated flows of stormwater leaving a site guo et al 2010 the structures of the eight lid types used and developed in this study are shown in fig 2 which the specifications are assigned by the results of in situ experiment and analysis from the construction and planning agency ministry of the interior taiwan after entering the lid the runoff will sequentially pass through surface layer pavement layer and storage layer and eventually be discharged from underdrain finally an excess runoff will overflow through drainage material to leave the lid devices basic parameters of lid devices include depression storage depth porosity infiltration rate and manning s roughness lid module in swmm can appropriately simulate the amount of flood detention however the newly developed filter device of tree box was not included therefore this study simulates the flood detention effect of tree box lid element by conceptualization through adding a storage unit to another subcatchment node then converging them to outfall or junction node through two connections weir and orifice the newly developed tree box device had effects on both water source detention and storage as well as peak delaying lid simulation element was validated using the flow obtained through lab testing using as assaying device a 120 60 60 cm tree box device from top to tree box bottom there was a 45 cm thick mixed layer of soil and coir non woven fabric followed by a 40 cm thick gravel gradation porosity 0 273 the water outlet was 15 cm above the bottom to allow this section to reach a saturated state first the experiment design configuration is displayed in fig 3 60 min designed rainfalls in 5 year 25 year and 50 year return periods of the precipitation station were used as rainfall conditions while a horner method was applied as rainfall pattern chow et al 1988 2 3 development of optimization model 2 3 1 decision variables the decision variables included in this study focused on the numbers areas of seven types of lid permeable paving bioretention cell infiltration trench rain barrel vegetative swales green roof and newly developed tree box the designed capacity of rain barrel was divided into large sized 1300 l and small sized 300 l according to taiwanese architectural type and formation and the drain delay of rain barrel was set as 6 h since expensive large areas of urban land are hardly available in megacities the rain garden was not adopted in this study besides rain barrels were divided in large sized and small sized the number of which was considered as decision variable when determining the layout the decision variables are expressed as follows 1 x x l j j 1 8 l 1 n s where x is the vector of decision variables xi j is the area or quantity of lid number j at subcatchment l the number j respectively represents 1 permeable paving 2 bioretention cell 3 infiltration trench 4 rain barrel in large size 5 rain barrel in small size 6 vegetative swales 7 green roof and 8 new developed tree box the unit of lid numbers 1 2 3 6 and 7 is area and the unit of number 4 5 and 8 is quantity and ns is the total number of subcatchments 2 3 2 objective function the benefit cost ratio method from economic evaluation and analysis was used as the objective function in this study s optimization model enabling seeking the layout design by maximizing the benefit per unit cost expressed as the following equation 2 max z x b x c x where z x is the objective function b x and c x are the annual benefit and the annual cost associated with decision variables x respectively b x c x 1 means the scheme has the positive net benefit and is suitable for investment or construction b x c x 1 suggests the scheme has the negative net benefit and investment or construction should be withdrawn the computation of c x and b x can be described as follows 2 3 2 1 annual cost c x lid costs include one time invested fixed cost total project cost as shown in table 1 and annual maintenance cost as shown in table 2 however since each lid device has a different life cycle the fixed cost is converted into the annual fixed cost described in section 2 3 2 1 1 then added up to the annual maintenance expenditure described in section 2 3 2 1 2 for obtaining the annual cost these are described as follows 1 annual fixed cost the equation converting total project cost to annual fixed cost is 3 a j p j i 1 i n j 1 i n j 1 where aj is the annual fixed cost of lid device j pj is total project cost of lid device j i is the interest rate and nj is the life cycle of lid device j year the economic analysis term namely the so called economic life 2 annual maintenance cost the maintenance cost of each lid can be apportioned to yearly maintenance cost based on the service life and maintenance cycle m j j 1 8 summarizing the above the computing equation for annual cost can be expressed as follows c x j 1 8 l 1 n s c j x j l j 1 8 l 1 n s p j i 1 i n j 1 i n j 1 m j x j l where cj is the annual cost of lid device j mj is the annual maintenance cost of lid device j and ns is the total number of subcatchments 2 3 2 2 annual benefit b x in this study the annual benefit corresponds to the summation of direct and indirect benefits reflecting the reductions of annual inundation loss brought about directly and indirectly by the lid devices respectively the estimation steps can be listed as follows 1 conversions between inundation depth and direct indirect losses the relationship between inundation depth and residential property loss per person can be established using in situ investigation data and a non linear regression equation taking min sheng community in the studied region of taipei as an example such equation can be expressed as follows cheng and wang 2004 5 w p d 0 09 d 0 47 where w p d is the residential property loss per person 104 usd at inundation depth d meter the industrial and commercial loss can be estimated by inundation depth with the characteristic relationship equation constructed by the investigated data in situ using taipei as an example the equation can be expressed as follows cheng and wang 2004 6 w ic d 19546 69229 d s t d 0 28 m where w ic is the industrial and commercial loss per person 104 usd the in situ investigation results of indirect loss are highly correlated with the direct loss and can be back calculated by the direct loss taking taipei as an example the indirect loss of a common residence can be estimated as being 22 of the direct loss while the indirect loss of an industrial and commercial area can be estimated as 45 of its direct loss 2 computation of inundation depth for the rainstorm of each return period in practice the flooding loss is directly proportional to inundated depth which is directly proportional to the total volume of burst pipes the burst pipe amount i e volume of each manhole at each time point can be obtained through swmm simulation using rainfall intensity pattern for each return period moreover the spatiotemporal flooding scope and depth can be calculated by the spatiotemporal burst pipe volume with the volume depth width relationship in the inundation region 3 computation of total inundation loss for the rainstorm of each return period eqs 5 and 6 can be used to calculate the property and industrial commercial losses per person due to the rainstorm of each return period furthermore the ratio of direct loss over indirect loss can be used to calculate the corresponding indirect loss per person the regional inundation loss of rainstorm of each return period for manhole k can then be obtained by totaling up the product of each inundation loss per person multiplying the number of the affected person the computation equation can be expressed as follows cheng and wang 2004 7 l k d 1 k p w p d p p 1 k ic w ic d p ic where l k d is the inundation loss for inundation depth d at inundated manhole k pp is the number of people whose property is affected by inundation kp is the proportion of indirect property loss due to inundation p ic is the number of people whose industries or commerce are affected by inundation and k ic is the proportion of indirect industry commerce loss due to inundation then the total inundation loss of a specific rainstorm can be obtained by totaling up the regional inundation loss for each manhole as shown below 8 l t k 1 n h l k d where l t is the total inundation loss of a specific rainstorm k is the regional serial number of inundated manhole and nh is the total regional number of inundated manholes 4 computation of annual inundation loss for layout design x in this study based on the concepts of riemann integral and mean value theorem the total inundation loss of each return period and probability density were used to calculate the regional annual inundation loss first the expected inundation loss of rainstorm of each return period was calculated taking the single return period of tr years as an example the expected inundation loss of this return period l e x t r equals to the product of the total inundation loss l t x t r and the occurrence probability of the rainstorm of this return period p t r as shown below 9 l e x t r l t x t r p t r where l e x t r is the expected value of the inundation loss for the rainstorm of return period tr and layout design x r is the serial number of return period p t r is the occurrence probability of the rainstorm of return period tr and l t x t r is the total inundation loss for the rainstorm of return period tr and layout design x in order to calculate the inundation loss induced by all kinds of rainstorms with different return periods the exceedance probability ep is imported for the derivation ep refers to the occurrence probability of rainstorm exceeding a certain magnitude within a certain period in flood and is reciprocal to the return period hence when calculating the expected inundation losses of rainstorms of two adjacent return periods l e x t r t r 1 the occurrence probability is the difference between the two eps 1 t r 1 t r 1 while inundation loss equals to the average losses of two return periods l t x t r l t x t r 1 2 as shown in fig 4 therefore eq 9 can be re written as follows 10 l e x t r t r 1 l t x t r l t x t r 1 2 1 t r 1 t r 1 then in order to calculate the annual benefit b x in the objective function in eq 2 the annual inundation loss l y x is calculated from the summation of the expected inundation losses caused by rainstorms of all different return periods in the region which can be derived from eq 10 as follows 11 l y x r 1 r max l t x t r l t x t r 1 2 1 t r 1 t r 1 where l y x is the annual inundation loss brought about by lid layout design x and r max is the maximum serial number of return period 5 computation of annual benefit after computing the expected annual inundation losses before and after lid layout design using the aforementioned method i e l y 0 and l y x respectively in eq 11 the annual benefit brought about by lid layout b x can be obtained by subtraction between the two situations 12 b x l y 0 l y x where b x is the annual benefit brought about by lid layout design x and ly 0 is the expected annual inundation loss under the current situation 2 3 2 3 derivation of calculation equation of objective function finally by the aforementioned derived annual cost c x in eq 4 and annual benefit b x in eqs 11 and 12 the objective function in eq 2 can be re written as follows z x b x c x l y 0 l y x j 1 8 l 1 n s c j x j l r 1 r max l t 0 t r l t 0 t r 1 2 1 t r 1 t r 1 r 1 r max l t x t r l t x t r 1 2 1 t r 1 t r 1 j 1 8 l 1 n s p j i 1 i n j 1 i n j 1 m j x j l where l t 0 t r is the expected total inundation loss for the rainstorm of return period tr under the current situation 2 3 3 constraints 1 limitation of layout design of area and quantity due to certain limitations in the location of lid technology e g permeable paving is more suitable for sidewalk and parking area green roof and rain barrel are more suitable for rooftop etc and restrictions in the land use pattern of the studied region there will be upper and lower bounds in the area and the number of lid devices 14 0 x j l x j l max j 1 8 l 1 n s where x j l max is the maximum available area or quantity for lid number j at subcatchment l 2 limitation of shared area in order to prevent overlapping of the lid layout region e g bioretention cell vegetative swales newly developed tree box green roof and rain barrel the summation of the individually arranged area of the adopted lids cannot exceed the available layout area the formulation can be expressed as follows 15 0 x 2 l x 6 l x 8 l x g l max l 1 n s 16 0 x 4 l a 4 l x 5 l a 5 l x 7 l x r l max l 1 n s where x 2 l x 6 l and x 8 l are the allocated area of bioretention cell vegetative swales and tree box at subcatchment l respectively x g l max is the maximum available area of green land at subcatchment l x 4 l and a 4 l are the quantity and assigned area of rain barrel in large size at subcatchment l respectively x 5 l and a 5 l are the quantity and assigned area of rain barrel in small size at subcatchment l respectively x 7 l is the area of green roof and x r l max is the maximum available allocated area of rooftop 3 urban stormwater management model since the state variable dk x tr in this study corresponds to the computed inundation result from swmm embedded in the optimization model the calculating formula of swmm s rainfall runoff simulation is also the constraint of the optimization model 2 4 solution of optimization model in this study simulated annealing sa in a meta heuristic algorithm was used for solving the optimization model since such an algorithm is more suitable for situations involving multiple variables and more room for feasible solutions compared to other approaches and is less constrained by calculation parameters while simpler to use meta heuristic algorithms are faster and robust enough for jumping out from the local optimum of the optimization function because this algorithm can also accept inferior solutions within a limited range after using it a stepwise refinement process could help on to derive near exact solutions sa algorithm kirkpatrick et al 1983 is a general probability optimization algorithm and its principle is similar to that of metal annealing by applying thermodynamic theories in statistics hence every single point in search space can be envisaged as a molecule in the air and the energy of the molecule corresponds to its own kinetic energy the algorithm starts at a random point in the search space chooses a neighbor in each step then calculates the probability of reaching the neighbor from its current location for an object reaching thermal equilibrium with a temperature of tt and an energy state of e the energy probability value p e can be expressed as a boltzmann distribution 17 p e 1 n t t e e k t t where n t t is normalization factor k is boltzmann constant and e e k t t is the boltzmann factor the above equation reveals that the boltzmann distribution tends to be in the lowest energy state when the temperature drops the solving flowchart by using sa algorithm can be shown in fig 5 and the routing step can be described as follows step 1 set the initial solution in agreement with the constrained model multiple lid layout design then input it into swmm to calculate the objective function value of the current solution b c ratio of flood mitigation step 2 generate a neighborhood solution in the solution space from the current solution using a generating function in order to reduce the time consumption of the algorithm the neighborhood solution is commonly generated by substituting and interchanging all or part of the elements of the current solution then input the neighborhood solution into swmm model to calculate the difference between the objective function values corresponding to the current solution and the neighborhood solution step 3 determine whether the neighborhood solution x is accepted the most commonly used acceptance criterion is the metropolis criterion if δz difference value of objective function between current solution and neighborhood solution 0 accept x as the new current solution x otherwise accept x as the new current solution x with a probability of exp δz tt when the neighborhood solution is accepted substitute the current solution with the neighborhood solution meanwhile correcting the objective function value by this time the current solution has completed one inner loop calculation iteration based on which the next round of calculation can be started step 4 determine if the number of inner loop calculations nc has met the termination rule n c n c max namely the maximum number of move step lower the current temperature to βtt if termination rule has been met continue this inner loop calculation batch if the termination rule has not been met when the temperature tt drops to a minimum allowable temperature t t min stop the iterative calculation and accept the currently found optimal solution as the final one the annealing scheme of sa means at a certain temperature state tt once a certain number of iteration operations have been completed lower the temperature tt and perform the next batch of iteration operations at the new temperature state eventually the sa will asymptotically converge and can be proved by the markov chain theory to be the solving algorithm converging toward the globally optimal solution with a probability of 1 according to the aforementioned definition and solving process of sa its parameters needing to be set include initial temperature t0 temperature attenuation function β termination rule of inner loop n c max and termination rule of the outer loop t t min 3 application 3 1 study area taipei is the most representative megacity in taiwan and the min sheng community in taipei is the first national american style demonstration community in taiwan with a resident population currently over 350 000 and total community area of 140 06 ha as revealed in fig 6 land use types in min sheng community are mainly homes roads and commercial buildings resulting in a high proportion of impermeable area and only a small proportion of parks schools and public land having permeable green fields thus inundation events occur frequently additionally this region has a high population density low inundation tolerance and high inundation risk hence min sheng community was chosen for operating the proposed lid devices design in this study hoping to optimize the multi lid combination layout that best meets the flood mitigating economic benefit through megacity lid optimization model the optimized design strategy must reduce the regional inundation loss and the pressure on fu yuan pumping station most parts of min sheng community are flat areas suitable for the introduction of lid devices all slopes are below 5 with a slightly higher inclination in the east and the ground surface elevation between 4 and 7 m as shown in fig 7 a residential land accounts for the largest portion of land use area 53 88 followed by land for roads 25 44 land for schools 7 50 and land for parks 7 21 these four types of land use account for 94 03 of the total community area as expressed in fig 7 b and table 3 min sheng community neighbors keelung river in the east and fig 7 c reveals two sewage outlets in this region one converges to the road intersection point s in the west then draining off into keelung river in the north the other converges into the forebay of fu yuan pumping station and then discharges into keelung river through a pump drain the sewer system of min sheng community includes a total of 112 subcatchments as shown in fig 7 d 3 2 establishment of swmm 3 2 1 model construction under

hydrology and sewer drainage module hydraulic have been completed relevant parameters can be input according to physiographic hydrological conditions of the study area and swmm manual rossman 2010 3 2 2 model calibration and validation of swmm in this study the parameter calibration and model validation of land surface and sewage simulation model for min sheng community were performed using historically measured rainstorm data e g precipitation water level and pumping station operation data etc two rainstorm events with complete measured data were adopted for model calibration and validation the calibration event was selected as a rainstorm occurred during 2014 5 20 20 00 and 2014 05 21 04 00 and the validation event was selected as a rainstorm occurred during 2014 06 29 19 00 and 2014 06 30 04 00 the downstream end of min sheng community s sewer system is fu yuan pumping station thus the water level hydrograph of fu yuan pumping station s forebay measured by a supersonic time of flight gauge during two rainstorms were used as the calibration and validation target for the swmm water level simulation after parameter calibration during the period covered by recorded pumping operation data i e during 2014 5 20 20 00 and 2014 5 21 01 10 in fig 9 a and during 2014 06 29 19 00 and 2014 06 30 02 00 in fig 9b the simulated hydrographs of forebay water level were accurate during these periods the mean absolute errors maes of forebay water level simulation in calibration stage and validation stage were 0 066 m and 0 057 m respectively while the correlation coefficients ccs were 0 993 and 0 992 respectively during the periods with no pumping recorded data the forebay water level hydrographs were simulated by assuming the pumping flow are the same as the anterior mode which the operational rule curves are illustrated in the right side of fig 9 the simulated results during 2014 5 21 01 10 and 2014 05 21 04 00 in fig 9a and during 2014 06 30 02 00 and 2014 06 30 04 00 in fig 9b reveal that the operational modes rule curves determined by man made thinking are different from the anterior mode regarding the calibrated parameter the width values of overland flow path were between 3 m and 351 m with an average of 48 6 m and the percent values of catchment s impervious area were between 62 and 100 with an average of 83 the surface manning s n values were mainly between 0 013 and 0 038 with an average value of 0 015 and the average depth value of depression storage was 0 05 mm for infiltration the horton based max min infiltration rates were 3 1 mm h and 0 47 mm h respectively and the average decay constant value was 3 8 mm h moreover the sewer manning s coefficient n values were between 0 012 and 0 017 3 2 3 layout principle of lids in this study in order to respond and adapt to megacity inundation impacts associated with heavy rainstorms the principles applied to lid layout and construction were the following 1 permeable paving sidewalk cycleway circus park or parking area 2 bioretention cell road parking area courtyard park circus sidewalk and central dividing island 3 infiltration trench road community area building sidewalk parking area courtyard 4 rain barrel residential area commercial area public area or industrial area 5 vegetative swales parking area courtyard park road and public space devices 6 green roof constructed on flat or rooftops sloping ideally between 2 and 15 degrees and 7 newly developed tree box public devices parking area and sidewalk in this study the tree box lid element was added with a storage unit through a subcatchment node of swmm both converging to outfall and junction nodes through two connections of weir and orifice presently with the purpose of validating the correctness of tree box simulation in swmm measured data obtained from experiment design and simulation results were used in setting up the lid simulation element and relevant parameters the device s area was 0 72 10 4 ha the vertical flow path 1 2 m wide and the ground surface slope was 1 all infiltrated water was collected by subsurface drain conduits yielding 100 impermeability and 0 15 manning s roughness the percentage of impermeable area with no depression was 25 with 0 2092 and 0 1092 m depression storage and water detention depths respectively the water outlet height was 0 10 m the vertical flow path 1 2 m wide and the radius of outlet pipe was 0 022 m the distance from the outlet to the bottom was 0 041 m after inputting the inflow hydrograph passing through the lid device into swmm to obtain simulated outflows then compared and validated the outflow hydrograph against the suitable experimental data and plotted as an example using results covering a 5 year return period as depicted in fig 10 according to the obtained validation results the average root mean square error rmse of runoff hydrographs in experiment and simulation was 2 05 10 5 m3 s cm with an average absolute error percentage aaep of 3 60 the peak time error was 0 min and the involved peak flow error was 3 45 10 6 cm aaep 2 04 these results were consistent with the targeted 10 objective concerning both peak flow and total runoff errors confirming the correctness and practicability of the lid simulation element 3 3 optimized layout design of combined multiple lids 3 3 1 setting of optimization model in this study three subcatchments in min sheng community that practicable allowed allocating lid devices were selected and layout principles under different land use patterns were also explored the selected subcatchments were s14 s87 and s102 respectively which land use patterns were mainly residential and military s14 mostly roads schools and parks s87 and completely residential use s102 respectively as shown in fig 8 in order to evaluate the optimal lid layout with different land use patterns the decision variables were set as the layout areas unit m2 and numbers of the 8 types of lid devices in the 3 subcatchments the concentration time during rainfall and runoff i e flow travel time on the surface and in drainage system to the fu yuan pumping station is approximately 45 min 1 h hence the designed rainstorm hyetographs obtained through frequency analysis of taipei observation station s rainfall data namely all return periods of rainstorms tr 1 2 5 10 25 50 100 200 years with 1 hour rainfall duration were input into swmm to simulate inundation conditions in min sheng community in terms of a constrained model since min sheng community has both high development level and building coverage ratio under the premise of unchanging land use the area and number of lid devices to be allocated will be limited both maximum and minimum areas and numbers of all lids can be allocated for all subcatchments in the constrained model as revealed in table 4 green field is the largest allocatable area in bioretention cell moreover there are also common area restrictions among lids for example the set areas of green roof and rain barrel should not be greater than the roof area and the total area of bioretention cell vegetative swales and tree box should not be greater than the green field the green field includes the park residential courtyard sidewalk plantation road dividing island and parking area etc 3 3 2 inundation simulation in current condition after simulating inundation conditions of the min sheng community under current situation unset lid it was found that inundation occurred for rainstorms with 5 200 years return periods the inundated areas were mainly found in manholes around s14 and fu yuan pumping station the expected total inundation loss of rainstorm concerning each return period is shown in table 5 a and the annual average inundation loss was 9 6 106 usd as obtained through integration approximately 84 times of a taiwanese s average annual income this value illustrated that if the government does not implement flood mitigating approaches people will suffer severe property losses caused by the heavy rainfall intensity and impervious induced inundation 3 3 3 optimization results after setting sa parameters t 0 100 t t min 0 1 β 0 9 n c max 150 and performing 10 021 iterations of computation the b c ratio of the optimal objective function could be as high as 1 448 the total solving time using msi pc intel i5 was 437 583 9 s and optimization results of decision variable values are depicted in table 6 in consideration of each lid s maximum allocated area buffer lids bioretention cell rain barrel in small size green roof were suitable for upstream subcatchement 14 retaining lids permeable paving rain barrel in large size newly developed tree box were adequate for subcatchment 87 that was in a higher location finally draining lids infiltration trench vegetative swales were suitable for installation in subcatchment 102 in the end of pipelines after introducing lid into the 3 subcatchments of min sheng community approximate annual cost was 2 26 105 usd the annual inundation loss could be reduced from 9 60 106 usd to 9 27 106 usd resulting in an annual benefit of 3 28 105 usd values of inundation loss simulated with different return periods are shown in table 5 b b c ratio of the best optimized lid layout design was 1 448 the results have pointed out that building combined multiple lids devices on 8 39 of the areas belonging to min sheng community could reduce inundation loss by 3 42 assuming the b c ratio could be kept at 1 448 the inundation loss would be further reduced by 41 if combinations of multiple lids were allocated at the same time in the entire community the reciprocal diagram between annual cost and annual b c ratio of the optimization process is illustrated in fig 11 connecting local optima could approximately form a quadratic curve while the optimal solution is the vertex of such graphical depiction 3 3 4 discussion on future designed choices priorities and strategies in this section the reasons behind so many flood mitigation benefits brought about to megacity was discussed taking rainstorms with return periods of 5 year and 200 year as examples the effects of lid devices on sewer system s flow and fu yuan pumping station forebay s inflow capacities were explored for rainstorm of the 5 year return period reduction ratio in peak flow of min sheng community s downstream fu yuan pumping station forebay could reach 29 8 and the average reduction ratio in peak flow of the 3 subcatchments was 23 49 demonstrating fairly good effects as shown in fig 12 and table 7 for peak delaying ability the forebay of fu yuan pumping station could delay the peak for 10 min by as much as 20 while s14 could further delay by 37 5 which is the best performance among 3 subcatchments whose average delay ratio was 14 28 as shown in table 8 manhole 4449 147 and 4449 24 showed almost no time delays the possible reasons for such behavior were 1 simulation computation had a 5 min interval and the delay time is smaller than this interval cannot be shown 2 results caused by superimposed peaks regarding this last effect lid caused delayed upstream peaks and unobvious downstream peaks yet with significant measurements such overlap results in unobvious delaying effect with the phenomenon of the second peak for rainstorm with 200 year return period min sheng community s downstream fu yuan pumping station forebay and the 3 subcatchments could averagely reduce peak flow by 5 75 and 9 52 respectively showing a poorer flood detention effect comparing to a rainstorm with 5 year return period as shown in table 9 peak flow mitigation in pumping station s forebay was mostly reduced by rainstorm with 5 year return period 29 8 peak flow mitigation ability decreased with increasing return period and was only 5 75 for a 200 year return period almost only one sixth of the value found for a 5 year return period additionally pumping station s forebay could delay arrival time of peaks for 5 min approximately by 12 50 while the 3 subcatchments could delay by 34 26 on average as shown in table 10 and fig 13 peak delaying efficiency was increased from 12 50 of 5 year return period to 34 26 concerning the 200 year return period both flow capacity and arrival time of rainstorm for a 5 year return period could be effectively reduced or delayed however the 200 year return period showed only a relatively significant peak delaying effect and less efficient peak flow reduction that was because rainstorm of 200 year return period involved too large flood flows although the flood detention effect was significant in the early stage of the rainstorm thus the installed lids will no longer function once the soil water content has reached saturation and detention storage containers and drainage system have been fully loaded however the lids will still be able to temporarily retain flash flood and reduce flow rate thus increasing the peak delaying ability according to the results of optimization and analysis priorities of lid devices allocated in urban areas should primarily be given to green roof and bioretention cell followed by rain barrel and permeable paving the proportion of layout in the 2 26 105 usd total annual cost was 31 for green roof 27 for bioretention cell and 11 for both rain barrel and permeable paving as shown in fig 14 besides the infiltration trench and vegetative swales are mainly intended for water transfer in this study being less efficient for flood mitigation in min sheng community in terms of layout strategy green roof rain barrel and bioretention cell should be allocated in residential areas while permeable paving and tree box mostly allocate in roads through hydrologic hydraulic simulation and economic optimization and analysis the average efficiency of each lid technology was obtained inundation loss reduction per unit cost yielding 28 22 20 15 9 and 3 for green roof bioretention cell tree box permeable paving rain barrel and both vegetative swales and infiltration trench respectively among the best lid layout in each subcatchment of min sheng community subcatchment 14 had a 9 85 104 usd annual cost about 43 of total cost and its catchment area is located upstream the pipelines thus the allocated lids are mainly buffer slow action green roof small rain barrel and bioretention cell so as to block part of the flood flow and reduce flood s flow rate subcatchment 87 had a 5 21 104 usd annual cost about 23 of total cost and its catchment area is located in higher places therefore the allocated lids are mainly permeable paving large rain barrel and newly developed tree box that are able to retain flood furthermore the land in this area is mainly used for roads and allocating permeable paving and tree box involves higher benefit per unit area subcatchment 102 had a 7 59 104 usd annual cost about 34 of total cost since it is located in a residential area most construction expenses concern green roof rain barrel and bioretention cell although the largest areas of infiltration trench and vegetative swales are allocated to this subcatchment the flood mitigating efficiency will be insignificant if the flood flow is too large since the permeable area is too small and the mid and upstream devices water retaining and flow rate reducing abilities are too low 4 conclusion in this study an optimization model for combining the layout of multiple lid devices in megacity s large scale communities was established layout choices priorities and strategies for the optimal flood mitigating b c ratio were proposed based on economic analysis the contributions provided by this study include 1 analysis of flooding consequences on the development of a megacity 2 development of an innovative technical approach enabling an automatic and effective optimization process linking with newly considered interdisciplinary embedded flooding economic simulation model and 3 proposal of adaptive solutions using a combined layout scheme by considering the economic hydrology statistic aspect this study sets the benefit cost ratio as the objective function in order to deal with flooding in all return periods rps the decision variables correspond to the allocated areas and quantity of lid devices including porous pavements bioretention cells infiltration trenches rain barrels vegetable swales green roofs and newly developed tree boxes under such layout the flooding loss was simulated with a storm water management model swmm and the optimal solution was solved by employing a simulated annealing sa algorithm that can automatically link with swmm min sheng community in taipei is chosen as a study area for demonstrating the applicability of the developed model and practical solutions results show that the b c ratio of identified optimal design can reach 1 448 with green roofs account for 31 of total cost and bioretention cells 27 of total cost as main devices and rain barrels 11 and porous pavements 11 as secondary supplies since infiltration trenches and vegetable swales are mainly used to transport water the performance of flood reduction is not efficient regarding rainfalls in all return periods the peak flows and delay of peak times downstream of fu yuan pumping station forebay can decrease significantly in the range of 5 75 29 80 and 12 50 20 respectively and 9 52 23 49 and 12 50 37 5 at the subcatchments the efficiency of flood detention is higher for low rps than high rps while the delayed ability of peak time is smaller in terms of each lid s largest allocated area upstream subcatchments are suitable to be allocated with buffer slow action lids bioretention cell rain barrel in small size green roof so as to block part of the flood flow and reduce flood s flow rate subcatchments located in higher places are suitable for layout with retaining lids permeable paving rain barrel in large size newly developed tree box so as to block flood flow that has entered a depression and thus effectively reduce inundation loss finally draining lids infiltration trench vegetative swales are adequate to be allocated in pipeline s downstream subcatchments so as to faster discharge the massive amount of accumulated water into outside rivers regarding layout strategy residential area has higher allocated areas of the green roof rain barrel and bioretention cell the road has higher allocated areas of permeable paving and tree box through hydrologic hydraulic simulation and economic optimization and analysis the average efficiency reduction in inundation loss per unit cost of each lid technology was 28 22 20 15 9 and 3 for green roof bioretention cell tree box permeable paving rain barrel and both vegetative swales and infiltration trench respectively urban afforestation heat island effect improved water quality and other indirect benefits brought about by lid cannot be effectively quantified so far any simulation computation methods that might be available in the future are recommended to consider them furthermore pumping stations in the simulation model were operated according to current regulation however the operation of the water pumping units shall be reduced after lid devices have been allocated thus future operation regulation for pumping stations should be included for discussion in the

7085,this study establishes an innovative systematic optimization model for megacity flood mitigation by combining multiple low impact development lid devices taking into consideration a benefit cost b c analysis the contributions provided by this study include 1 analysis of flooding consequences on a developing megacity 2 development of a technical approach enabling an automatic and effective

flood detention is higher for low rps than high rps while the time delay ability is smaller keywords megacity flood mitigation and adaption low impact development optimal layout design storm water management model simulated annealing sustainable water management 1 introduction since the mid 20th century the global population has been rapidly growing and their need for resources has greatly increased this has resulted in growing urbanization causing increased impermeability in the urban catchment area greatly decreased proportions of infiltration capacity rainfall loss increased intensity of surface runoffs miller et al 2014 and reduced concentration time urban expansion has led to widespread enhancement in a wide variety of streamflow metrics with the exceptions of peak flow indicators rouge and cai 2014 therefore the risk of flood faced by megacities has augmented although most modern megacities currently benefit from both sewage and pumping station drainage systems to facilitate flood channeling from the urban area once rainstorm intensity and duration have exceeded the maximum load capacity of a megacity s drainage system residents from surrounding areas may still suffer flooding losses taiwan island is located in the margin of the western pacific ocean this is a region often hit by hurricanes and storms therefore experiencing frequent severe floods occasionally causing huge inundation losses the current global climate change is an added source of difficulties since in the future megacities may suffer flooding with increased frequency and intensity hence the urgent need to enhance protection devices regarding urban areas needs to be addressed in order to cope with heavy rainfalls a megacity s sewage system must deal with the overflow problem and a larger flood storage space for surface water must be available to handle greater hurricanes and rainstorms vermonden et al 2012 however the protection currently provided by existing flood control devices and sewage system to megacities has low standards and limited effects low impact development lid has a feature of decentralized small scale source control utilizing designs and devices to reduce rainstorm runoff through infiltration retention and evaporation thus relieving pressures on rainwater sewage capacity and pumping stations becoming a part of rainstorm runoff management in megacities hence introducing lid concept and devices into urban development and public construction projects to reduce the natural impacts of development has become a task that brooks no delay previous studies related to megacity lid can be divided into 3 categories the first includes experiments designs and analyses of lid efficiencies dietz 2007 performed experimental comparison by using a series of lid based devices including vegetative swales bioretention cell and permeable paving results show that the lid devices can obviously decrease the runoff of the drainage area and green roof can decrease 63 of direct runoff alfredo et al 2010 performed a series of experiments for green roof results show that the magnitude of time delay and flood detention of peak flow can be promoted 22 70 page et al 2015 installed a bioretention cell street retrofit four permeable pavement parking stalls and a tree filter device to control and treat residential street runoff results show that peak discharge significantly decreased by 28 while lag times in the catchment remained unchanged runoff depths in the lid retrofit catchment were significantly less for events with low rainfall intensities but significantly greater for events with high intensities however most previous researchers employed a limited number of lid types to both experiments and designs therefore the performance of composite design for different types of lid elements so that floods with different return periods can achieve their maximum flood detention efficiencies is still a topic of notable importance requiring intensive investigation the second category of studies focuses on simulations of lid efficiency despotovic et al 2002 simulated and evaluated the drainage efficiency atthekumodrazcatchmentinbelgrade using two rainfall runoff models for the flood events of different return periods themajor devicesoftherecommended solution for re designoftheexisting system are three retention ponds and outlet into a trunk guo 2004 presented a hydrology based approach by which the storage outflow curve can be approximated from the inflow hydrograph to the basin and the maximum allowable release from the basin gilroy and mccuen 2009 analyzed the effects of both location and quantity of two types of bmps cisterns and bioretention pits a spatiotemporal model of a micro watershed was developed to determine the effects of bmps on single family townhome and commercial lots results show that cisterns alone are capable of controlling rooftop runoff for small storms and the location is a factor in the peak reduction chang et al 2013 proposed a drainage and inundation model to assess whether the high intensity rainfall scenario under climate change can be handled by installing detention pond pumping station and flood diversion devices etc results show the essentiality of these engineering approaches walsh et al 2014 presented the results of a long term continuous hydrologic simulation analysis of a watershed scale residential rainwater harvesting rwh program the u s environmental protection agency s storm water management model swmm was applied to simulate rainfall runoff responses for variations in a rwh network including the rwh unit storage size the number of implementing households the amount of time before a unit is allowed to release captured runoff i e drain delay and the time it takes for the unit to drain i e coefficient of discharge lucas and sample 2015 assessed two low impact development lid green stormwater infrastructure gsi alternatives typical free discharge underdrains and underdrains with flow controlled outlets green control these alternatives were compared to two non lid alternatives existing conditions and tunnel storage results show that the green control alternative performed substantially better than the other alternatives in terms of volume control and gsi is more resilient than non lid infrastructure it can be learned from overviewing the abovementioned studies that the increased runoff caused by urban development can be reduced by establishing flood control devices however when facing high intensity rainfall or inundation the flood mitigating benefit of single type lid is still limited and both net benefit and benefit cost ratio cannot be maximized thus lid devices design optimization toward increased flood mitigating efficiency is a topic worth studying besides devices with completed design need quantification tools to simulate rainfall runoffs under multiple lid devices that is an insufficiently explored subject in academic investigations and practical applications new flood mitigating designs such as rain garden and permeable paving are mostly based on experiments determining devices benefits hence the development of simulation elements concerning flood control devices is also an important research topic the third category regards the simulations analyses and optimizations of lid designs however correlation studies regarding optimal layout design of flood control devices are insufficient previous researchers mainly used simulation analysis for lid design booth et al 2002 indicated that comprehensive disaster mitigation needs to be considered in urban development including limitation on impermeable area forest conservation strategy rainwater detention riparian buffer maintenance wetland and slope protection different management objectives need to be stipulated for different development levels fresno et al 2005 proposed the concept of the sustainable urban drainage system to avoid the flood pollution and reduced ecological diversity and the main engineering approaches involved permeable paving infiltration trench infiltration cell filter depression filter strip detention pond and wetland etc according to evaluation results of strategy simulation urban drainage needs to be carried out through a series of engineering solutions instead of a single device meanwhile the connections between different devices also need to be considered in order to control water quantity liu et al 2014 evaluated and quantified the flood and peak flows reduced by green infrastructure gi their results showed that the reduced flood capacity of single gi device was very limited however through the layout of overall devices the total rainfall runoffs of different return periods were effectively reduced by 85 100 and the peak flows were also decreased by 92 100 in order to solve the simulation difficulties in obtaining the optimal solution of design by automatically linkage huang et al 2015 adopted rainwater harvesting systems rwhs into a stormwater runoff management model swmm for the spatial design of capacities and quantities of rain barrels for urban flood mitigation a simulation optimization model is proposed for effectively identifying the optimal design in the optimization method backpropagation neural network bpnn is first applied for developing a water level simulation model of urban drainage systems to substitute for swmm to conform to newly considered optimization model and a tabu search based algorithm is used to optimize the planning solution however only rwhs was applied to urban flood mitigation in this study and the effective and automatic use of multiple composite lid devices to achieve the best flood mitigating economic benefits is still a topic that needs immediate study and development our study aims to establish the optimization model for optimizing the amounts types sizes and layouts of the lid devices first the storm water management model swmm for the studied area was established and model calibration and validation were performed according to historical rainfall events next a simulated annealing sa algorithm was used to develop a technically innovative automatic solving module finally the flood mitigating benefit and lid devices layout design under the maximized benefit cost ratio namely the optimized layout design of lid devices were explored this study specially researches the following subjects 1 the consequences of the existing infrastructures on present and future technical management choices 2 forms of innovations by technical approaches using a better knowledge of natural processes including economical 3 benefits and limits of smart tools and 4 incompatibility of objectives constraints and setting up of priorities the applied seven lid devices include permeable paving bioretention cell infiltration trench rain barrel vegetative swales green roof a newly developed tree box 2 development of methodology 2 1 procedures this study consists of three parts 1 establishment and parameter calibration of storm water management model swmm 2 establishment of an optimization model of multiple low impact development lid devices and 3 optimization and analysis of optimal lid layout design the flowchart of the methodology is shown in fig 1 and the steps are described as follows step 1 1 establish the conceptual model of hydrological and physiographic architectures and engineering structures in the studied area then perform parameter calibration and validation of swmm step 1 2 establish the lid simulation mode in swmm once calibration has been completed input related parameters based on experimental results and lid design form step 2 1 write design variables into the inp file of swmm simulation elements letting the program automatically call to execute swmm and output the simulation results in a rpt file this way the flood mitigating benefits of rainstorm concerning each return period can be calculated automatically step 2 2 establish the objective function constraints and decision variables of the optimal lid layout design and embed the benefit cost computation model of device s flood detention into the optimization model step 3 write the simulated annealing algorithm using matlab programming language to perform an optimization of combined layout design of multiple lids and analyze the optimization results to propose choices priorities and strategies of optimal design 2 2 introduction to swmm the united states environmental protection agency us epa swmm model is a dynamic rainfall runoff model used for simulation of the surface subsurface hydrology quantity and quality from primarily urban suburban areas rossman 2010 the hydrology component of swmm operates on a collection of subcatchment areas with and without depression storage to predict runoff from precipitation evaporation and infiltration losses from each of the subcatchment the horton s infiltration method is adopted for rainfall runoff simulation in subcatchments in swmm in addition the lid areas on the subcatchment can be modeled to reduce the impervious and pervious runoff swmm tracks the flow rate flow depth and water quality in each pipe and channel during a simulation period composed of multiple fixed or variable time steps 2 2 1 model parameters and routing the adopted model parameters for simulation include 1 in subcatchments width of overland flow path m percent of impervious area manning s n for impervious and pervious area depth of depression storage on impervious and pervious area mm and percent of impervious area with no depression storage 2 in infiltration process horton based max min infiltration rates mm h and decay constant mm h and 3 in conduits manning s roughness coefficient the subcatchment width parameter is normally estimated by dividing the subcatchment area by a representative length of overland flow the routing options of swmm include steady flow routing kinematic wave routing and dynamic wave routing dynamic wave routing solves the complete one dimensional saint venant flow equations which consist of the continuity equation and momentum equation for conduits and a volume continuity equation at nodes due to the capability and demand of this study dynamic wave routing is applied for routing 2 2 2 the low impact development components within swmm the lid function is integrated within the subcatchment component of swmm and allows further refinement of the overflows infiltration flow and evaporation in permeable paving bioretention cell rain garden rain barrel vegetative swales green roof infiltration trench and newly developed tree box lid takes many forms but can generally be thought of as an effort to minimize or prevent concentrated flows of stormwater leaving a site guo et al 2010 the structures of the eight lid types used and developed in this study are shown in fig 2 which the specifications are assigned by the results of in situ experiment and analysis from the construction and planning agency ministry of the interior taiwan after entering the lid the runoff will sequentially pass through surface layer pavement layer and storage layer and eventually be discharged from underdrain finally an excess runoff will overflow through drainage material to leave the lid devices basic parameters of lid devices include depression storage depth porosity infiltration rate and manning s roughness lid module in swmm can appropriately simulate the amount of flood detention however the newly developed filter device of tree box was not included therefore this study simulates the flood detention effect of tree box lid element by conceptualization through adding a storage unit to another subcatchment node then converging them to outfall or junction node through two connections weir and orifice the newly developed tree box device had effects on both water source detention and storage as well as peak delaying lid simulation element was validated using the flow obtained through lab testing using as assaying device a 120 60 60 cm tree box device from top to tree box bottom there was a 45 cm thick mixed layer of soil and coir non woven fabric followed by a 40 cm thick gravel gradation porosity 0 273 the water outlet was 15 cm above the bottom to allow this section to reach a saturated state first the experiment design configuration is displayed in fig 3 60 min designed rainfalls in 5 year 25 year and 50 year return periods of the precipitation station were used as rainfall conditions while a horner method was applied as rainfall pattern chow et al 1988 2 3 development of optimization model 2 3 1 decision variables the decision variables included in this study focused on the numbers areas of seven types of lid permeable paving bioretention cell infiltration trench rain barrel vegetative swales green roof and newly developed tree box the designed capacity of rain barrel was divided into large sized 1300 l and small sized 300 l according to taiwanese architectural type and formation and the drain delay of rain barrel was set as 6 h since expensive large areas of urban land are hardly available in megacities the rain garden was not adopted in this study besides rain barrels were divided in large sized and small sized the number of which was considered as decision variable when determining the layout the decision variables are expressed as follows 1 x x l j j 1 8 l 1 n s where x is the vector of decision variables xi j is the area or quantity of lid number j at subcatchment l the number j respectively represents 1 permeable paving 2 bioretention cell 3 infiltration trench 4 rain barrel in large size 5 rain barrel in small size 6 vegetative swales 7 green roof and 8 new developed tree box the unit of lid numbers 1 2 3 6 and 7 is area and the unit of number 4 5 and 8 is quantity and ns is the total number of subcatchments 2 3 2 objective function the benefit cost ratio method from economic evaluation and analysis was used as the objective function in this study s optimization model enabling seeking the layout design by maximizing the benefit per unit cost expressed as the following equation 2 max z x b x c x where z x is the objective function b x and c x are the annual benefit and the annual cost associated with decision variables x respectively b x c x 1 means the scheme has the positive net benefit and is suitable for investment or construction b x c x 1 suggests the scheme has the negative net benefit and investment or construction should be withdrawn the computation of c x and b x can be described as follows 2 3 2 1 annual cost c x lid costs include one time invested fixed cost total project cost as shown in table 1 and annual maintenance cost as shown in table 2 however since each lid device has a different life cycle the fixed cost is converted into the annual fixed cost described in section 2 3 2 1 1 then added up to the annual maintenance expenditure described in section 2 3 2 1 2 for obtaining the annual cost these are described as follows 1 annual fixed cost the equation converting total project cost to annual fixed cost is 3 a j p j i 1 i n j 1 i n j 1 where aj is the annual fixed cost of lid device j pj is total project cost of lid device j i is the interest rate and nj is the life cycle of lid device j year the economic analysis term namely the so called economic life 2 annual maintenance cost the maintenance cost of each lid can be apportioned to yearly maintenance cost based on the service life and maintenance cycle m j j 1 8 summarizing the above the computing equation for annual cost can be expressed as follows c x j 1 8 l 1 n s c j x j l j 1 8 l 1 n s p j i 1 i n j 1 i n j 1 m j x j l where cj is the annual cost of lid device j mj is the annual maintenance cost of lid device j and ns is the total number of subcatchments 2 3 2 2 annual benefit b x in this study the annual benefit corresponds to the summation of direct and indirect benefits reflecting the reductions of annual inundation loss brought about directly and indirectly by the lid devices respectively the estimation steps can be listed as follows 1 conversions between inundation depth and direct indirect losses the relationship between inundation depth and residential property loss per person can be established using in situ investigation data and a non linear regression equation taking min sheng community in the studied region of taipei as an example such equation can be expressed as follows cheng and wang 2004 5 w p d 0 09 d 0 47 where w p d is the residential property loss per person 104 usd at inundation depth d meter the industrial and commercial loss can be estimated by inundation depth with the characteristic relationship equation constructed by the investigated data in situ using taipei as an example the equation can be expressed as follows cheng and wang 2004 6 w ic d 19546 69229 d s t d 0 28 m where w ic is the industrial and commercial loss per person 104 usd the in situ investigation results of indirect loss are highly correlated with the direct loss and can be back calculated by the direct loss taking taipei as an example the indirect loss of a common residence can be estimated as being 22 of the direct loss while the indirect loss of an industrial and commercial area can be estimated as 45 of its direct loss 2 computation of inundation depth for the rainstorm of each return period in practice the flooding loss is directly proportional to inundated depth which is directly proportional to the total volume of burst pipes the burst pipe amount i e volume of each manhole at each time point can be obtained through swmm simulation using rainfall intensity pattern for each return period moreover the spatiotemporal flooding scope and depth can be calculated by the spatiotemporal burst pipe volume with the volume depth width relationship in the inundation region 3 computation of total inundation loss for the rainstorm of each return period eqs 5 and 6 can be used to calculate the property and industrial commercial losses per person due to the rainstorm of each return period furthermore the ratio of direct loss over indirect loss can be used to calculate the corresponding indirect loss per person the regional inundation loss of rainstorm of each return period for manhole k can then be obtained by totaling up the product of each inundation loss per person multiplying the number of the affected person the computation equation can be expressed as follows cheng and wang 2004 7 l k d 1 k p w p d p p 1 k ic w ic d p ic where l k d is the inundation loss for inundation depth d at inundated manhole k pp is the number of people whose property is affected by inundation kp is the proportion of indirect property loss due to inundation p ic is the number of people whose industries or commerce are affected by inundation and k ic is the proportion of indirect industry commerce loss due to inundation then the total inundation loss of a specific rainstorm can be obtained by totaling up the regional inundation loss for each manhole as shown below 8 l t k 1 n h l k d where l t is the total inundation loss of a specific rainstorm k is the regional serial number of inundated manhole and nh is the total regional number of inundated manholes 4 computation of annual inundation loss for layout design x in this study based on the concepts of riemann integral and mean value theorem the total inundation loss of each return period and probability density were used to calculate the regional annual inundation loss first the expected inundation loss of rainstorm of each return period was calculated taking the single return period of tr years as an example the expected inundation loss of this return period l e x t r equals to the product of the total inundation loss l t x t r and the occurrence probability of the rainstorm of this return period p t r as shown below 9 l e x t r l t x t r p t r where l e x t r is the expected value of the inundation loss for the rainstorm of return period tr and layout design x r is the serial number of return period p t r is the occurrence probability of the rainstorm of return period tr and l t x t r is the total inundation loss for the rainstorm of return period tr and layout design x in order to calculate the inundation loss induced by all kinds of rainstorms with different return periods the exceedance probability ep is imported for the derivation ep refers to the occurrence probability of rainstorm exceeding a certain magnitude within a certain period in flood and is reciprocal to the return period hence when calculating the expected inundation losses of rainstorms of two adjacent return periods l e x t r t r 1 the occurrence probability is the difference between the two eps 1 t r 1 t r 1 while inundation loss equals to the average losses of two return periods l t x t r l t x t r 1 2 as shown in fig 4 therefore eq 9 can be re written as follows 10 l e x t r t r 1 l t x t r l t x t r 1 2 1 t r 1 t r 1 then in order to calculate the annual benefit b x in the objective function in eq 2 the annual inundation loss l y x is calculated from the summation of the expected inundation losses caused by rainstorms of all different return periods in the region which can be derived from eq 10 as follows 11 l y x r 1 r max l t x t r l t x t r 1 2 1 t r 1 t r 1 where l y x is the annual inundation loss brought about by lid layout design x and r max is the maximum serial number of return period 5 computation of annual benefit after computing the expected annual inundation losses before and after lid layout design using the aforementioned method i e l y 0 and l y x respectively in eq 11 the annual benefit brought about by lid layout b x can be obtained by subtraction between the two situations 12 b x l y 0 l y x where b x is the annual benefit brought about by lid layout design x and ly 0 is the expected annual inundation loss under the current situation 2 3 2 3 derivation of calculation equation of objective function finally by the aforementioned derived annual cost c x in eq 4 and annual benefit b x in eqs 11 and 12 the objective function in eq 2 can be re written as follows z x b x c x l y 0 l y x j 1 8 l 1 n s c j x j l r 1 r max l t 0 t r l t 0 t r 1 2 1 t r 1 t r 1 r 1 r max l t x t r l t x t r 1 2 1 t r 1 t r 1 j 1 8 l 1 n s p j i 1 i n j 1 i n j 1 m j x j l where l t 0 t r is the expected total inundation loss for the rainstorm of return period tr under the current situation 2 3 3 constraints 1 limitation of layout design of area and quantity due to certain limitations in the location of lid technology e g permeable paving is more suitable for sidewalk and parking area green roof and rain barrel are more suitable for rooftop etc and restrictions in the land use pattern of the studied region there will be upper and lower bounds in the area and the number of lid devices 14 0 x j l x j l max j 1 8 l 1 n s where x j l max is the maximum available area or quantity for lid number j at subcatchment l 2 limitation of shared area in order to prevent overlapping of the lid layout region e g bioretention cell vegetative swales newly developed tree box green roof and rain barrel the summation of the individually arranged area of the adopted lids cannot exceed the available layout area the formulation can be expressed as follows 15 0 x 2 l x 6 l x 8 l x g l max l 1 n s

the maximum available area of green land at subcatchment l x 4 l and a 4 l are the quantity and assigned area of rain barrel in large size at subcatchment l respectively x 5 l and a 5 l are the quantity and assigned area of rain barrel in small size at subcatchment l respectively x 7 l is the area of green roof and x r l max is the maximum available allocated area of rooftop 3 urban stormwater management model since the state variable dk x tr in this study corresponds to the computed inundation result from swmm embedded in the optimization model the calculating formula of swmm s rainfall runoff simulation is also the constraint of the optimization model 2 4 solution of optimization model in this study simulated annealing sa in a meta heuristic algorithm was used for solving the optimization model since such an algorithm is more suitable for situations involving multiple variables and more room for feasible solutions compared to other approaches and is less constrained by calculation parameters while simpler to use meta heuristic algorithms are faster and robust enough for jumping out from the local optimum of the optimization function because this algorithm can also accept inferior solutions within a limited range after using it a stepwise refinement process could help on to derive near exact solutions sa algorithm kirkpatrick et al 1983 is a general probability optimization algorithm and its principle is similar to that of metal annealing by applying thermodynamic theories in statistics hence every single point in search space can be envisaged as a molecule in the air and the energy of the molecule corresponds to its own kinetic energy the algorithm starts at a random point in the search space chooses a neighbor in each step then calculates the probability of reaching the neighbor from its current location for an object reaching thermal equilibrium with a temperature of tt and an energy state of e the energy probability value p e can be expressed as a boltzmann distribution 17 p e 1 n t t e e k t t where n t t is normalization factor k is boltzmann constant and e e k t t is the boltzmann factor the above equation reveals that the boltzmann distribution tends to be in the lowest energy state when the temperature drops the solving flowchart by using sa algorithm can be shown in fig 5 and the routing step can be described as follows step 1 set the initial solution in agreement with the constrained model multiple lid layout design then input it into swmm to calculate the objective function value of the current solution b c ratio of flood mitigation step 2 generate a neighborhood solution in the solution space from the current solution using a generating function in order to reduce the time consumption of the algorithm the neighborhood solution is commonly generated by substituting and interchanging all or part of the elements of the current solution then input the neighborhood solution into swmm model to calculate the difference between the objective function values corresponding to the current solution and the neighborhood solution step 3 determine whether the neighborhood solution x is accepted the most commonly used acceptance criterion is the metropolis criterion if δz difference value of objective function between current solution and neighborhood solution 0 accept x as the new current solution x otherwise accept x as the new current solution x with a probability of exp δz tt when the neighborhood solution is accepted substitute the current solution with the neighborhood solution meanwhile correcting the objective function value by this time the current solution has completed one inner loop calculation iteration based on which the next round of calculation can be started step 4 determine if the number of inner loop calculations nc has met the termination rule n c n c max namely the maximum number of move step lower the current temperature to βtt if termination rule has been met continue this inner loop calculation batch if the termination rule has not been met when the temperature tt drops to a minimum allowable temperature t t min stop the iterative calculation and accept the currently found optimal solution as the final one the annealing scheme of sa means at a certain temperature state tt once a certain number of iteration operations have been completed lower the temperature tt and perform the next batch of iteration operations at the new temperature state eventually the sa will asymptotically converge and can be proved by the markov chain theory to be the solving algorithm converging toward the globally optimal solution with a probability of 1 according to the aforementioned definition and solving process of sa its parameters needing to be set include initial temperature t0 temperature attenuation function β termination rule of inner loop n c max and termination rule of the outer loop t t min 3 application 3 1 study area taipei is the most representative megacity in taiwan and the min sheng community in taipei is the first national american style demonstration community in taiwan with a resident population currently over 350 000 and total community area of 140 06 ha as revealed in fig 6 land use types in min sheng community are mainly homes roads and commercial buildings resulting in a high proportion of impermeable area and only a small proportion of parks schools and public land having permeable green fields thus inundation events occur frequently additionally this region has a high population density low inundation tolerance and high inundation risk hence min sheng community was chosen for operating the proposed lid devices design in this study hoping to optimize the multi lid combination layout that best meets the flood mitigating economic benefit through megacity lid optimization model the optimized design strategy must reduce the regional inundation loss and the pressure on fu yuan pumping station most parts of min sheng community are flat areas suitable for the introduction of lid devices all slopes are below 5 with a slightly higher inclination in the east and the ground surface elevation between 4 and 7 m as shown in fig 7 a residential land accounts for the largest portion of land use area 53 88 followed by land for roads 25 44 land for schools 7 50 and land for parks 7 21 these four types of land use account for 94 03 of the total community area as expressed in fig 7 b and table 3 min sheng community neighbors keelung river in the east and fig 7 c reveals two sewage outlets in this region one converges to the road intersection point s in the west then draining off into keelung river in the north the other converges into the forebay of fu yuan pumping station and then discharges into keelung river through a pump drain the sewer system of min sheng community includes a total of 112 subcatchments as shown in fig 7 d 3 2 establishment of swmm 3 2 1 model construction under current hydrologic and hydraulic structure the construction result of swmm simulation model under current hydrologic and hydraulic structure of fu yuan pumping station in min sheng community is shown in fig 8 the model has established 112 subcatchments 219 manholes 229 conduits 5 pumps 6 outfalls 1 gate and 1 forebay once the constructions of urban sewer system models for surface runoff module hydrology and sewer drainage module hydraulic have been completed relevant parameters can be input according to physiographic hydrological conditions of the study area and swmm manual rossman 2010 3 2 2 model calibration and validation of swmm in this study the parameter calibration and model validation of land surface and sewage simulation model for min sheng community were performed using historically measured rainstorm data e g precipitation water level and pumping station operation data etc two rainstorm events with complete measured data were adopted for model calibration and validation the calibration event was selected as a rainstorm occurred during 2014 5 20 20 00 and 2014 05 21 04 00 and the validation event was selected as a rainstorm occurred during 2014 06 29 19 00 and 2014 06 30 04 00 the downstream end of min sheng community s sewer system is fu yuan pumping station thus the water level hydrograph of fu yuan pumping station s forebay measured by a supersonic time of flight gauge during two rainstorms were used as the calibration and validation target for the swmm water level simulation after parameter calibration during the period covered by recorded pumping operation data i e during 2014 5 20 20 00 and 2014 5 21 01 10 in fig 9 a and during 2014 06 29 19 00 and 2014 06 30 02 00 in fig 9b the simulated hydrographs of forebay water level were accurate during these periods the mean absolute errors maes of forebay water level simulation in calibration stage and validation stage were 0 066 m and 0 057 m respectively while the correlation coefficients ccs were 0 993 and 0 992 respectively during the periods with no pumping recorded data the forebay water level hydrographs were simulated by assuming the pumping flow are the same as the anterior mode which the operational rule curves are illustrated in the right side of fig 9 the simulated results during 2014 5 21 01 10 and 2014 05 21 04 00 in fig 9a and during 2014 06 30 02 00 and 2014 06 30 04 00 in fig 9b reveal that the operational modes rule curves determined by man made thinking are different from the anterior mode regarding the calibrated parameter the width values of overland flow path were between 3 m and 351 m with an average of 48 6 m and the percent values of catchment s impervious area were between 62 and 100 with an average of 83 the surface manning s n values were mainly between 0 013 and 0 038 with an average value of 0 015 and the average depth value of depression storage was 0 05 mm for infiltration the horton based max min infiltration rates were 3 1 mm h and 0 47 mm h respectively and the average decay constant value was 3 8 mm h moreover the sewer manning s coefficient n values were between 0 012 and 0 017 3 2 3 layout principle of lids in this study in order to respond and adapt to megacity inundation impacts associated with heavy rainstorms the principles applied to lid layout and construction were the following 1 permeable paving sidewalk cycleway circus park or parking area 2 bioretention cell road parking area courtyard park circus sidewalk and central dividing island 3 infiltration trench road community area building sidewalk parking area courtyard 4 rain barrel residential area commercial area public area or industrial area 5 vegetative swales parking area courtyard park road and public space devices 6 green roof constructed on flat or rooftops sloping ideally between 2 and 15 degrees and 7 newly developed tree box public devices parking area and sidewalk in this study the tree box lid element was added with a storage unit through a subcatchment node of swmm both converging to outfall and junction nodes through two connections of weir and orifice presently with the purpose of validating the correctness of tree box simulation in swmm measured data obtained from experiment design and simulation results were used in setting up the lid simulation element and relevant parameters the device s area was 0 72 10 4 ha the vertical flow path 1 2 m wide and the ground surface slope was 1 all infiltrated water was collected by subsurface drain conduits yielding 100 impermeability and 0 15 manning s roughness the percentage of impermeable area with no depression was 25 with 0 2092 and 0 1092 m depression storage and water detention depths respectively the water outlet height was 0 10 m the vertical flow path 1 2 m wide and the radius of outlet pipe was 0 022 m the distance from the outlet to the bottom was 0 041 m after inputting the inflow hydrograph passing through the lid device into swmm to obtain simulated outflows then compared and validated the outflow hydrograph against the suitable experimental data and plotted as an example using results covering a 5 year return period as depicted in fig 10 according to the obtained validation results the average root mean square error rmse of runoff hydrographs in experiment and simulation was 2 05 10 5 m3 s cm with an average absolute error percentage aaep of 3 60 the peak time error was 0 min and the involved peak flow error was 3 45 10 6 cm aaep 2 04 these results were consistent with the targeted 10 objective concerning both peak flow and total runoff errors confirming the correctness and practicability of the lid simulation element 3 3 optimized layout design of combined multiple lids 3 3 1 setting of optimization model in this study three subcatchments in min sheng community that practicable allowed allocating lid devices were selected and layout principles under different land use patterns were also explored the selected subcatchments were s14 s87 and s102 respectively which land use patterns were mainly residential and military s14 mostly roads schools and parks s87 and completely residential use s102 respectively as shown in fig 8 in order to evaluate the optimal lid layout with different land use patterns the decision variables were set as the layout areas unit m2 and numbers of the 8 types of lid devices in the 3 subcatchments the concentration time during rainfall and runoff i e flow travel time on the surface and in drainage system to the fu yuan pumping station is approximately 45 min 1 h hence the designed rainstorm hyetographs obtained through frequency analysis of taipei observation station s rainfall data namely all return periods of rainstorms tr 1 2 5 10 25 50 100 200 years with 1 hour rainfall duration were input into swmm to simulate inundation conditions in min sheng community in terms of a constrained model since min sheng community has both high development level and building coverage ratio under the premise of unchanging land use the area and number of lid devices to be allocated will be limited both maximum and minimum areas and numbers of all lids can be allocated for all subcatchments in the constrained model as revealed in table 4 green field is the largest allocatable area in bioretention cell moreover there are also common area restrictions among lids for example the set areas of green roof and rain barrel should not be greater than the roof area and the total area of bioretention cell vegetative swales and tree box should not be greater than the green field the green field includes the park residential courtyard sidewalk plantation road dividing island and parking area etc 3 3 2 inundation simulation in current condition after simulating inundation conditions of the min sheng community under current situation unset lid it was found that inundation occurred for rainstorms with 5 200 years return periods the inundated areas were mainly found in manholes around s14 and fu yuan pumping station the expected total inundation loss of rainstorm concerning each return period is shown in table 5 a and the annual average inundation loss was 9 6 106 usd as obtained through integration approximately 84 times of a taiwanese s average annual income this value illustrated that if the government does not implement flood mitigating approaches people will suffer severe property losses caused by the heavy rainfall intensity and impervious induced inundation 3 3 3 optimization results after setting sa parameters t 0 100 t t min 0 1 β 0 9 n c max 150 and performing 10 021 iterations of computation the b c ratio of the optimal objective function could be as high as 1 448 the total solving time using msi pc intel i5 was 437 583 9 s and optimization results of decision variable values are depicted in table 6 in consideration of each lid s maximum allocated area buffer lids bioretention cell rain barrel in small size green roof were suitable for upstream subcatchement 14 retaining lids permeable paving rain barrel in large size newly developed tree box were adequate for subcatchment 87 that was in a higher location finally draining lids infiltration trench vegetative swales were suitable for installation in subcatchment 102 in the end of pipelines after introducing lid into the 3 subcatchments of min sheng community approximate annual cost was 2 26 105 usd the annual inundation loss could be reduced from 9 60 106 usd to 9 27 106 usd resulting in an annual benefit of 3 28 105 usd values of inundation loss simulated with different return periods are shown in table 5 b b c ratio of the best optimized lid layout design was 1 448 the results have pointed out that building combined multiple lids devices on 8 39 of the areas belonging to min sheng community could reduce inundation loss by 3 42 assuming the b c ratio could be kept at 1 448 the inundation loss would be further reduced by 41 if combinations of multiple lids were allocated at the same time in the entire community the reciprocal diagram between annual cost and annual b c ratio of the optimization process is illustrated in fig 11 connecting local optima could approximately form a quadratic curve while the optimal solution is the vertex of such graphical depiction 3 3 4 discussion on future designed choices priorities and strategies in this section the reasons behind so many flood mitigation benefits brought about to megacity was discussed taking rainstorms with return periods of 5 year and 200 year as examples the effects of lid devices on sewer system s flow and fu yuan pumping station forebay s inflow capacities were explored for rainstorm of the 5 year return period reduction ratio in peak flow of min sheng community s downstream fu yuan pumping station forebay could reach 29 8 and the average reduction ratio in peak flow of the 3 subcatchments was 23 49 demonstrating fairly good effects as shown in fig 12 and table 7 for peak delaying ability the forebay of fu yuan pumping station could delay the peak for 10 min by as much as 20 while s14 could further delay by 37 5 which is the best performance among 3 subcatchments whose average delay ratio was 14 28 as shown in table 8 manhole 4449 147 and 4449 24 showed almost no time delays the possible reasons for such behavior were 1 simulation computation had a 5 min interval and the delay time is smaller than this interval cannot be shown 2 results caused by superimposed peaks regarding this last effect lid caused delayed upstream peaks and unobvious downstream peaks yet with significant measurements such overlap results in unobvious delaying effect with the phenomenon of the second peak for rainstorm with 200 year return period min sheng community s downstream fu yuan pumping station forebay and the 3 subcatchments could averagely reduce peak flow by 5 75 and 9 52 respectively showing a poorer flood detention effect comparing to a rainstorm with 5 year return period as shown in table 9 peak flow mitigation in pumping station s forebay was mostly reduced by rainstorm with 5 year return period 29 8 peak flow mitigation ability decreased with increasing return period and was only 5 75 for a 200 year return period almost only one sixth of the value found for a 5 year return period additionally pumping station s forebay could delay arrival time of peaks for 5 min approximately by 12 50 while the 3 subcatchments could delay by 34 26 on average as shown in table 10 and fig 13 peak delaying efficiency was increased from 12 50 of 5 year return period to 34 26 concerning the 200 year return period both flow capacity and arrival time of rainstorm for a 5 year return period could be effectively reduced or delayed however the 200 year return period showed only a relatively significant peak delaying effect and less efficient peak flow reduction that was because rainstorm of 200 year return period involved too large flood flows although the flood detention effect was significant in the early stage of the rainstorm thus the installed lids will no longer function once the soil water content has reached saturation and detention storage containers and drainage system have been fully loaded however the lids will still be able to temporarily retain flash flood and reduce flow rate thus increasing the peak delaying ability according to the results of optimization and analysis priorities of lid devices allocated in urban areas should primarily be given to green roof and bioretention cell followed by rain barrel and permeable paving the proportion of layout in the 2 26 105 usd total annual cost was 31 for green roof 27 for bioretention cell and 11 for both rain barrel and permeable paving as shown in fig 14 besides the infiltration trench and vegetative swales are mainly intended for water transfer in this study being less efficient for flood mitigation in min sheng community in terms of layout strategy green roof rain barrel and bioretention cell should be allocated in residential areas while permeable paving and tree box mostly allocate in roads through hydrologic hydraulic simulation and economic optimization and analysis the average efficiency of each lid technology was obtained inundation loss reduction per unit cost yielding 28 22 20 15 9 and 3 for green roof bioretention cell tree box permeable paving rain barrel and both vegetative swales and infiltration trench respectively among the best lid layout in each subcatchment of min sheng community subcatchment 14 had a 9 85 104 usd annual cost about 43 of total cost and its catchment area is located upstream the pipelines thus the allocated lids are mainly buffer slow action green roof small rain barrel and bioretention cell so as to block part of the flood flow and reduce flood s flow rate subcatchment 87 had a 5 21 104 usd annual cost about 23 of total cost and its catchment area is located in higher places therefore the allocated lids are mainly permeable paving large rain barrel and newly developed tree box that are able to retain flood furthermore the land in this area is mainly used for roads and allocating permeable paving and tree box involves higher benefit per unit area subcatchment 102 had a 7 59 104 usd annual cost about 34 of total cost since it is located in a residential area most construction expenses concern green roof rain barrel and bioretention cell although the largest areas of infiltration trench and vegetative swales are allocated to this subcatchment the flood mitigating efficiency will be insignificant if the flood flow is too large since the permeable area is too small and the mid and upstream devices water retaining and flow rate reducing abilities are too low 4 conclusion in this study an optimization model for combining the layout of multiple lid devices in megacity s large scale communities was established layout choices priorities and strategies for the optimal flood mitigating b c ratio were proposed based on economic analysis the contributions provided by this study include 1 analysis of flooding consequences on the development of a megacity 2 development of an innovative technical approach enabling an automatic and effective optimization process linking with newly considered interdisciplinary embedded flooding economic simulation model and 3 proposal of adaptive solutions using a combined layout scheme by considering the economic hydrology statistic aspect this study sets the benefit cost ratio as the objective function in order to deal with flooding in all return periods rps the decision variables correspond to the allocated areas and quantity of lid devices including porous pavements bioretention cells infiltration trenches rain barrels vegetable swales green roofs and newly developed tree boxes under such layout the flooding loss was simulated with a storm water management model swmm and the optimal solution was solved by employing a simulated annealing sa algorithm that can automatically link with swmm min sheng community in taipei is chosen as a study area for demonstrating the applicability of the developed model and practical solutions results show that the b c ratio of identified optimal design can reach 1 448 with green roofs account for 31 of total cost and bioretention cells 27 of total cost as main devices and rain barrels 11 and porous pavements 11 as secondary supplies since infiltration trenches and vegetable swales are mainly used to transport water the performance of flood reduction is not efficient regarding rainfalls in all return periods the peak flows and delay of peak times downstream of fu yuan pumping station forebay can decrease significantly in the range of 5 75 29 80 and 12 50 20 respectively and 9 52 23 49 and 12 50 37 5 at the subcatchments the efficiency of flood detention is higher for low rps than high rps while the delayed ability of peak time is smaller in terms of each lid s largest allocated area upstream subcatchments are suitable to be allocated with buffer slow action lids bioretention cell rain barrel in small size green roof so as to block part of the flood flow and reduce flood s flow rate subcatchments located in higher places are suitable for layout with retaining lids permeable paving rain barrel in large size newly developed tree box so as to block flood flow that has entered a depression and thus effectively reduce inundation loss finally draining lids infiltration trench vegetative swales are adequate to be allocated in pipeline s downstream subcatchments so as to faster discharge the massive amount of accumulated water into outside rivers regarding layout strategy residential area has higher allocated areas of the green roof rain barrel and bioretention cell the road has higher allocated areas of permeable paving and tree box through hydrologic hydraulic simulation and economic optimization and analysis the average efficiency reduction in inundation loss per unit cost of each lid technology was 28 22 20 15 9 and 3 for green roof bioretention cell tree box permeable paving rain barrel and both vegetative swales and infiltration trench respectively urban afforestation heat island effect improved water quality and other indirect benefits brought about by lid cannot be effectively quantified so far any simulation computation methods that might be available in the future are recommended to consider them furthermore pumping stations in the simulation model were operated according to current regulation however the operation of the water pumping units shall be reduced after lid devices have been allocated thus future operation regulation for pumping stations should be included for discussion in the

7086,droughts cause significant socio economic and environmental impacts so it has become an extremely important element in decision making within water resource systems for this reason the research in this field has increased considerably over the last few decades in order to be capable of making early decisions and reducing drought impacts it is necessary to predict the occurrence of such events months or even years in advance in this sense various methods have been used to predict the occurrence of droughts at present seasonal forecast data can be used to forecast meteorological hydrological agricultural and operational droughts however the seasonal forecast data of these dynamical ocean atmosphere coupled models must be analyzed in an exhaustive way since it is known that these models may not adequately represent the climatic variability at river basin scale hence this paper presents a new methodology for assessing the skill of a climate forecasting system in order to predict the occurrence of droughts by using contingency tables the indices obtained from the contingency tables are necessary to perform the analysis of the predictive ability of the model in a semi distributed way all this taking into account the intensity of droughts using different scenarios based on the threshold below which it is considered to be in drought finally a single value is obtained to determine the predictive ability of the forecasting model for the entire basin the proposed methodology is applied to the júcar river basin in spain it has been found that the analyzed forecast model shows better results than those obtained using an autoregressive model further work is needed to enhance climate forecasting from the perspective of water resources management however it should be mentioned that this type of data could be used for drought forecasting allowing possible mitigation measures keywords drought forecasting forecast verification contingency table jucar river basin 1 introduction over the last decades drought events have been defined in a variety of ways and some of the most common definitions are contained in dracup et al 1980 tate and gustard 2000 and mishra and singh 2010 however drought can generally be defined as the reduction of water availability in a particular area for a specific period of time there are several classifications of droughts for example wilhite and glantz 1985 classify droughts into meteorological hydrologic agricultural and socio economic meteorological droughts can generally be defined as a period in which a particular number of days with rainfall less than a certain value great britain meteorological office 1951 this threshold below which a drought event is considered to occur can be the average precipitation value for the time scale analyzed hisdal and tallaksen 2000 droughts are a phenomenon that can be of varying magnitude duration and intensity and can affect various sectors of society in water resources management is important to be able to predict a possible drought event in order to have the capacity to make decisions that help minimize the damage of this phenomenon the application of early mitigation measures is essential to reduce the socio economic and environmental impacts of drought haro et al 2014a drought forecasting is a critical component in risk management drought preparedness and mitigation and a major research challenge is to develop suitable techniques for forecasting the onset and termination points of droughts one of the deficiencies in mitigating the effects of a drought is the inability to predict drought conditions accurately for months or years in advance mishra and singh 2011 there are different methodologies in drought forecasting regression models time series models probability models neural networks models and hybrid models bacanli et al 2009 cancelliere and salas 2004 fernández et al 2009 leilah and al khateeb 2005 mishra et al 2007 morid et al 2007 nowadays global circulation models and regional climate models are used to produce seasonal forecasts which can be useful for drought forecasting the seasonal forecast system model system4 molteni et al 2011 developed by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf is a dynamical forecasting system which produces time series of 7 months from the first day of each month wetterhall and di giuseppe 2017 system4 has been assessed for skill in predicting asian summer monsoons kim et al 2012b northern hemisphere winter kim et al 2012a below normal rainfall in the horn of africa dutra et al 2013 drought forecasting in east africa mwangi et al 2013 global meteorological drought dutra et al 2014 and for impacts analysis over east africa ogutu et al 2016 however seasonal forecast must be analyzed from the point of view of water resources management to analyze the predictive capacity of a model several indices skill scores can be used which have existed for more than a century peirce 1884 in bartholmes et al 2009 not all indices are suitable for assessing a forecast system and there is no set of indices to obtain all the necessary information which is why several sets of indicators are often used to cover a wider range of properties of the assessed model baldwin and kain 2004 the aim of this paper is to propose a method of forecast verification for seasonal forecast systems by carrying out an assessment of the predictive capacity of the model in drought forecasting as an early warning for a water resources system with high exploitation rates and long lasting droughts data from system4 were analyzed against reference data which in this case are precipitation data from the spain02 v4 model herrera et al 2012 2016 in this paper the data is evaluated by means of contingency tables proposing a new aggregate index that can be easily used to evaluate the ability of seasonal forecast models to predict drought events the proposed methodology is applied to the júcar river basin in spain the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the case study and the data used section 3 focuses on the proposed methodology the results and a general discussion are provided in section 4 and finally section 5 shows the conclusions 2 case study for the analysis of the system4 precipitation data was used the júcar river basin jrb located in the eastern of spain this basin is comprised of a total surface area of 22 261 km2 and is the main of 9 water exploitation systems in the júcar river basin demarcation dhj haro et al 2014b five sub basins were considered for this study see fig 1 the jrb has an average precipitation of 510 mm year and the average temperature is 13 6 c the natural resources reach 1279 hm3 year on the other hand the basin has a total water demand of 1117 hm3 year of which 88 6 is for irrigated agriculture thus the basin has a water exploitation index wei of 87 pedro monzonís et al 2014 the jrb is prone to drought events due to its semi arid environment andreu et al 2013 in the recent decades four events have been recorded which caused serious environmental damages and economic losses the last events recorded are the historic droughts of 1983 84 1985 86 1992 93 1995 96 1997 98 2000 01 and 2004 05 2007 08 ministerio de medio ambiente 2007 to mitigate the impacts of these phenomena the ministry of environmental of spain mma has worked extensively making special plans of drought management which consider three scenarios normal and pre alert alert and emergency estrela and vargas 2008 ferrer et al 2008 in addition the júcar basin agency jba has developed indices that allow determining the appropriate measure to deal with a drought event these indices called operative drought monitoring indicators sodmi use real time information provided by the automatic data acquisition system of the dhj estrela 2006 the data contain information about precipitation and state of reservoirs aquifers and rivers 2 1 forecast data the forecast data used in this study come from the system4 developed by the ecmwf these data are datasets of precipitation and temperature with a lead time of six months the hindcasts re forecasts start on the 1st of every month for the years 1981 2010 and the ensemble size is 15 members the grid point calculations of the datasets are on the corresponding reduced n218 gaussian grid which has about a 0 7 degrees spacing molteni et al 2011 for each of the five sub basins two points were taken from the grid of the system4 model in order to ensure that they were spread over the entire area of interest subsequently the average of the two points was obtained to work with a single dataset per sub basin this approach was chosen because an interpolation produces time series with less dispersion than the original series to obtain the historical time series of the forecast data the first month of each time series was extracted 0 month lead time hindcast and the fifteen scenarios generated by the system4 model were used ensemble members 2 2 observed data to contrast the forecast data were used the dataset of spain02 version v4 herrera et al 2016 which are time series of precipitation and temperature in high resolution grids on a daily scale these data cover the iberian peninsula and the balearic islands the grids correspond to standard grids of euro cordex 0 44 0 22 and 0 11 degrees herrera et al 2012 for this study was selected the thinnest grid of spain02 that is 0 11 degrees inside the datasets exist time series obtained with different interpolation methods and for this work was used the dataset obtained with the area averaged monthly trivariate thin plate splines method aa 3d herrera et al 2016 four points were taken in each sub basin and averaged in order to obtain a representative time series for each sub basin although the data of the system4 model range from 01 01 1981 to 31 12 2015 the analysis only was performed with the period between hydrological years 1981 82 and 2005 06 25 years due to the data range chosen from spain02 which goes from 01 01 1970 to 31 12 2006 once the time series were obtained for each sub basin they were analyzed on a monthly scale 3 methodology 3 1 statistical analysis in the evaluation of hydrological models indices are used to determine their capacity to reproduce reality among the most commonly used indicators are nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the modified kling gupta efficiency kgem kling et al 2012 moriasi et al 2007 spalding fecher et al 2016 therefore a first evaluation of the system4 model data was made obtaining the nse and kgem indicators the nash sutcliffe efficiency eq 1 is a metric that determines the relative magnitude of variance of data modeled with observed variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 1 nse 1 n 1 n o n f n 2 n 1 n o n o n 2 where n is the total number of time steps o n is the forecasted value at time step n f n is the observed value at time step n and o n is the mean of the observed values the modified kling gupta efficiency eq 2 as well as the nse it has a range of inf to 1 and its optimal value is 1 2 kgem 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where r is the correlation coefficient between forecasted f and observed o data β is the ratio of means µf µo and γ is the ratio of coefficients of variation cvf cvo the ideal value of each of the three components is 1 gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 in order to obtain the indicators described above an accumulation of data from the 15 system4 ensemble members was carried out as these time series are equiprobable it was decided to work with a unique dataset that includes the characteristics of each forecast thus a single time series that groups the 15 ensemble members was obtained placing each time series at the end of the previous one that means a total of 4500 precipitation data on a monthly scale on the other hand the time series of observed data was repeated 15 times so that both data observed and forecast have the same length these aggregate time series of both were also used for the forecast verification in addition the nse and the kgem indicators were obtained for the ensemble in order to analyze the performance of the mean of the 15 ensemble members 3 2 forecast verification using a contingency table since what is desired is to assess the predictive capacity of the drought event as an early alert an analysis should be carried out from the perspective of the occurrence of this phenomenon in the management of water resources it is very important to predict droughts in order to adopt measures to reduce the impacts of these events haro et al 2014a thus the correct prediction of a drought event is more important than the correct amount of the runoff when the prediction is optimal for this reason it was decided to analyze the predictive capacity of drought episodes droughts have three main characteristics intensity duration and surface area affected wilhite 2000 intensity refers to the decrease in precipitation and the impacts that this decrease can cause and it is measured by applying the palmer drought severity index or through a threshold which can be a percentage of the mean precipitation and can be arbitrarily selected duration is the period of time that precipitation is below the set threshold for the development of the analysis of this work five drought scenarios were established which correspond to 20 s1 40 s2 60 s3 80 s4 and 100 s5 of the monthly means in each of them the event occurs when the precipitation value for each month is less than the corresponding threshold value in this way the measurement of drought intensity is also included in the analysis the scenarios were analyzed using 2 2 contingency tables for dichotomous events bartholmes et al 2009 which allow the predictive capacity of the model to be assessed based on meteorological droughts these type of droughts occur when the monthly precipitation is below the mean precipitation value of the corresponding month hisdal and tallaksen 2000 in this way a time series of discrete nonprobabilistic values were obtained for each scenario since each value can only take a value of four possibilities hit miss false alarm and correct negative table 1 shows a contingency table where the hits a represent the coincidence of drought of both series the misses c correspond to the presence of a drought in the data of spain02 and the absence of this event in the data of system4 the false alarms b are presented when in the time series of spain02 there is no drought and if there is in system4 and finally the correct negatives d are the months in which there is no drought in both models from the contingency table it can be concluded that a perfect forecast is presented when the value of false alarms b and misses c is equal to zero however given that an actual forecast is imperfect some metrics are required to determine the degree of correspondence between the predicted value and the observed value thus obtaining different characteristics of the predicted time series wilks 2006 there are a large number of metrics developed for model verification using 2 2 contingency tables mason 2003 murphy and daan 1985 in this paper seven different scores were used in order to assess the forecasting system the proportion correct score pc shown in eq 3 proposed by finley 1884 since this score determines the correct portion of the time series and it is a widely used metric being the most direct and intuitive however this score does not differentiate between hits and correct negatives so it is necessary to use other scores the threat score ts is a very useful metric when the event to predict drought occurs less frequently than the non occurrence is eq 4 as well as the pc the ts has the worst possible value of 0 and 1 as the best possible value on the other hand the bias score bias is the comparison of the mean forecast with the mean observation as evident in eq 5 the bias score is not a precision indicator since it does not provide information on the correspondence between forecasts and observations when is dealing with mean values a value below 1 indicates that the drought event was less frequently predicted than observed while a value above 1 indicates that the event was over expected bias ranges from zero to infinite and the best expected value is 1 which would indicate that the predicted time series is unbiased 3 pc hits c o r r e c t n e g a t i v e s n 4 ts hits hits m i s s e s f a l s e a l a r m s 5 bias hits f a l s e a l a r m s hits m i s s e s 6 far false a l a r m s hits f a l s e a l a r m s 7 sr hits hits f a l s e a l a r m s 8 pod hits hits m i s s e s 9 pofd false a l a r m s correct n e g a t i v e s f a l s e a l a r m s the reliability of the model can be evaluated by using the false alarm ratio far which represents the yes portion of the system4 model that is wrong as shown in eq 6 so a better expected value is zero and the worst is 1 on the other hand the success ratio sr provides information on the probability that an observed event will be predicted eq 7 this score is sensitive to false alarms and ignores misses this metric can also be represented as 1 far in other words it is complementary to the false alarm ratio the probability of detection score pod is the ratio between the correct forecasts and the number of times this event has occurred eq 8 on the other hand the probability of false detection score pofd is the ratio of false alarms to the total number of no drought events eq 9 in order to obtain an analysis with the obtained indices the performance diagram is used roebber 2009 where bias sr 1 far pod and ts are evaluated 3 3 contingency table modified despite the different indices used there is information that cannot be collected by them since it should not only be seen as an analysis of the possible occurrence or not of the drought event consideration should also be given to the possibility that the event may be predicted early or late in addition to the permanence of the drought over the months in order to collect these possibilities of dichotomous events the creation of a 3 3 contingency table is proposed leaving it as follows see table 2 when both time series present the start of a drought event in the evaluated month the discrete variable corresponds to a drought start hit e but if an onset drought event occurs in system4 and in spain02 there is a drought initiated prior to the month evaluated a late start f is present on the other hand when in the system4 time series there is a start of a drought and spain02 does not present drought a false start g is taken when in the spain02 time series there is the onset drought and in the system4 time series there is a drought that started earlier the value of the variable is an early start h but if both time series have drought in the month evaluated but in neither case is the start of said event a drought stay hit i is held whereas if in system4 there is a drought initiated prior to the month evaluated while in the spain02 data there is no drought the variable is a false stay j when spain02 presents a start of a drought while in the system4 there is no drought the variable is a false no drought k if the spain02 time series is in a drought that started before the month evaluated and the system4 time series does not have a drought an early exit l is presented and when neither time series has a drought the discrete variable takes the value of a no drought hit m however since the metrics mentioned above have been developed for 2 2 contingency tables table 2 must be transformed from 3 3 to 2 2 to this end the procedure proposed in wilks 2006 should be used for example if the goal is to work with the event drought start hit e table 2 is modified as follows see table 3 thus for any event to be evaluated it will take the place of a hit the sum of the two remaining values of the row of the evaluated event corresponds to a false alarm while the sum of the two values of the column where the studied event is located corresponds to a miss finally the sum of the rest of the values will be a correct negative since the most important event in this analysis is the occurrence of the drought event and its onset the events drought hit e early start h and late start f are evaluated 3 4 assessment of an aggregate index the analysis described above provides a large number of values that are complex to analyze therefore it is necessary to reduce the number of indices in order to obtain a unique value capable of showing the drought forecasting skill of the forecast system model in a simplified way a first approximation is to average the value of each scenario for each index and for each event it is important to take into account the water exploitation index wei of the river basin since when the availability is greater than the wei the drought is not worrying as the volume of resources is greater than the demand therefore in order to obtain the average of the scenarios only those below the wei should be considered even after having averaged the values a large number of parameters have to be analyzed independently since the four possibilities that each discrete value can obtain hits false alarms misses and correct negatives the one that is less interesting is the correct negatives an average of the ts and pod indices is obtained in order to obtain an aggregate index given that the ts indicates the portion of hits of the drought event with respect to the presence of this phenomenon in both series and the pod shows the portion of hits with respect to the presence of the drought in the observed data thus the number of indices is reduced to one per sub basin and per event moreover it should be considered that the drought phenomenon also has a spatial dimension to take this property into account and also to obtain a single value for the entire basin it is proposed to obtain an overall index as the weighted average of the 5 series the annual mean precipitation is proposed as a weighting parameter thus an aggregate index is obtained for the whole basin and for each particular event considering the intensity and spatial variability the aggregate index obtained was contrasted with the relative operating characteristic roc the roc diagram plots the probability of detection score pod and the probability of false detection score pofd this method is widely used for its ability to graph several thresholds in a single diagram nevertheless it can be convenient to summarize a roc diagram using a single scalar value and the usual choice for this purpose is the area under the roc curve as roc curves for perfect forecasts pass through the upper left corner the area under a perfect roc curve includes the entire unit square the perfect area is equal to 1 and the random forecasts lie along the 45 degrees diagonal of the unit square the area under the roc of interest is 2a 1 where a is the area under the curve obtained wilks 2006 4 results and discussion in this section spatio temporal droughts from 15 ensemble member of the model system4 from 1981 to 2006 was compared to the reference data set spain02 v4 after a precipitation analysis the predictive capacity of droughts is analyzed using modified contingency tables in order to obtain an aggregate index for the entire basin seven indices were assessed in the analysis see figs 9 and 10 4 1 precipitation for the comparison of the monthly mean precipitation of the system4 model with respect to the spain02 model the ensemble of the 15 scenarios of the forecast time series was used fig 2 shows the monthly mean of both models for the five sub basins analyzed as can be seen in the previous figure there is a high correlation between both models from march to september months with the least precipitation in the five sub basins however there are notable differences from october to february when the rainfall is greater despite this in all cases a similar trend of the system4 model data is reproduced with respect to the spain02 model the annual precipitation of the system4 model also presents the same trend as the spain02 model as can be seen in fig 3 for this reason the information can be used since it is possible to correct differences by applying some method of bias correction the data of the ensemble collect the mean values of the 15 system4 model scenarios however this time series does not contain the noise presented by each of these scenarios as can be seen in fig 3 therefore it has been decided to work with the fifteen time series on a monthly scale obtaining their statistics as a single series once the single time series containing the data of the 15 system4 model scenarios has been obtained it is contrasted with the observed time series and the nash sutcliffe and kling gupta indices are obtained see figs 4 and 5 fig 4 shows low nse values between 0 26 and 0 01 while kgem values are around 0 4 when analyzing the elements of the kgem see fig 5 it can be seen that the monthly data of the five sub basins show a relationship close to 1 both for the mean ratios bias ratio and the coefficients of variation on the other hand the pearson correlation coefficient is between 0 31 for the contreras sub basin and 0 38 in the alarcón sub basin however in the case of the ensemble the analysis shows in an nse between 0 20 for mulet and 0 27 for tous a kgem between 0 26 for mulet and 0 33 for tous and a pearson correlation coefficient between 0 48 for contreras and 0 57 for alarcón this indicates that the ensemble mean presents a better similarity to the observed data with respect to the 15 ensemble members the reason for this similarity is that the ensemble improves the average of the 15 time series but the noise of these series is lost as in the seasonal management of water resources the noise of the 15 ensemble members is more important than their average it is important to work with all the series and not only with the ensemble 4 2 droughts since the time series of occurrence or absence of drought event is a time series of dichotomous data it can be analyzed using a 2 2 contingency table the indices obtained are shown in the following tables table 4 and 5 show that the correct portion pc of the analyzed time series is between 86 and 81 for scenario s1 while for scenario s5 the correct portion is between 61 and 57 in reducing the threshold of droughts the sub basin that presented the greatest difference between the pc values for the different scenarios was mulet where there was a difference of 27 between the s1 and s5 scenarios in general bias shows that the time series of all sub basins are unbiased or slightly biased light over forecast was obtained for the mulet s1 and tous s5 scenarios on the other hand the greatest biases were obtained in alarcón contreras molinar and tous all on scenario s1 in addition to alarcón s2 and contreras s2 the analysis of the probability of false detection pofd and probability of detection pod is very important because together they form the conceptual basis for the signal detection approach to verify probability forecasts wilks 2006 the pofd obtained shows that the evaluated data have a false alarm percentage with respect to the non occurrence of the drought event of less than 25 for thresholds s1 s2 and s3 except for the mulet and tous sub basins in addition in the previous sub basins in scenario s3 it is slightly higher than 30 however for the rest of the scenarios the percentage of false alarms with respect to non occurrence of drought fluctuates between 35 and 56 the pod indicates that despite having obtained high pc values the percentage of hits with respect to the total occurrence of the event is low reaching a maximum of 68 for scenario s5 of the mulet sub basin the sr and far denote the percentage of hits and false alarms with respect to the yes of the predicted data respectively the values found from sr and far indicate that the forecast model tends to over estimate the drought event when considering low thresholds fig 6 shows the performance diagram obtained where can be seen that for the thresholds of 100 s5 the results are better since the optimum forecast is in the upper right part of the diagram fig 7 shows the roc diagram where it is possible to ascertain what is obtained in the performance diagram that is the predictive capacity of the model improves when droughts are less intense s5 however this predictive capacity is very low since the area of interest under the curve is in the range of 0 18 in the tous sub basin and 0 27 in the alarcón sub basin in order to study the coincidences of the system4 model data with respect to the spain02 model the 2 2 contingency table is extended to a 3 3 table with emphasis on the concordances at the onset of each event these are drought start hit early start and late start events additionally the event drought stay hit was analyzed in order to explore the behavior of the predictions of the system4 model once it has entered a period of drought once the 3 3 contingency table has been obtained it is reduced to 2 2 since the calculated indices have been developed for 2 2 contingency tables table 6 shows as an example the transformation of the contingency table from 3 3 to 2 2 for the alarcón sub basin and for the drought hit event corresponding to scenario s1 fig 8 shows the performance diagrams of the four events analyzed where it can be seen that for all sub basins the climate model gives the best results for the s4 and s5 scenarios while scenario s1 has the worst results in fig 8 it can also be seen that the results of the four events are unbiased for the s4 scenario however for the drought start hit event the pod sr and ts indices are very low the contreras sub basin was the one that obtained the highest values with a pod of 0 39 a sr of 0 35 and a ts of 0 23 on the other hand for the early start event scenario s4 has pod and sr values of around 0 20 while the ts reaches 0 19 and 0 19 for the mulet and tous sub basins respectively as for the late start event the pod and sr values are close to 0 30 and the ts remains around 0 15 finally for the drought stay hit event index values improved slightly the pod and sr are around 0 40 and the ts around 0 20 fig 9 shows the evolution of the seven indices calculated through the five proposed scenarios this for the alarcón sub basin and for the four events analyzed drought start hit early start late start and drought stay hit for each graph shown the optimal value of the first five indices is 1 pc bias pod ts and sr while for the last two the optimal value is 0 far and pofd in the drought start hit event the correct portion is 88 for scenario s1 and decreases for the other scenarios to 71 for scenario s5 the event is sub forecast for scenarios s1 s2 and s3 as they present a bias of less than 1 however for scenarios s4 and s5 it is observed that the event is over forecasted the percentage of hits with respect to the occurrence of the event in the observed time series is only 36 for scenarios s4 and s5 by eliminating the correct negatives from the analysis the drought start hit event has a low success rate ts of between 10 and 21 the early start event presents a more erratic behavior compared to the drought start hit event since the pc decreases up to 57 for the s5 scenario and with bias from 0 096 for the s1 scenario to 1 627 for the s5 scenario however for the s4 scenario the event is unbiased in this event there is a high number of false alarms regarding the predicted events as can be seen in the far index the late start event shows a high over forecast as it reaches up to a value of 3 75 for scenario s1 besides a very high far as well as the early start event finally the drought stay hit event has a similar behavior to the drought start hit event with considerable bias in the first three scenarios and a pc close to its optimal value in the s1 scenario as in all other events the value of the far index is very high due to the considerable number of false alarms in fig 9 it can be seen that after the analysis carried out there are 5 values for each of the calculated indices that is 35 values for each sub basin and this for each event making it difficult to fully analyze the ability of the climate model to predict the drought event therefore an aggregate index is proposed in order to obtain an average of the scenarios analyzed the scenario s5 was not considered given that it is higher than the wei of the jrb is 87 pedro monzonís et al 2014 fig 10 shows the mean of the four scenarios for each sub basin and event by reducing the number of indices considering only ts and pod compound indices are obtained for each sub basin which are shown in table 7 when calculating a weighted average considering the annual mean precipitation an aggregate index is obtained for the entire basin the results are shown in the table 8 the assessment of the areas under the curves of the roc diagram for the drought start hit event considering only the first four scenarios 0 80 results in values ranging from 0 11 for the tous sub basin to 0 17 for alarcón if a weighted average is obtained in the same way as the aggregate index it has a value of 0 19 fig 11 the above results may be considered unoptimistic when describing the predictive capacity of the analyzed model however this conclusion was predictable given the known uncertainty in the occurrence of future precipitation events as a result these cannot be judged on their own they need to be compared with other alternatives in order to obtain forecasts for this purpose the classical method has been chosen which has already been used on some occasions in the management of the jrb andreu et al 2013 haro monteagudo et al 2017 suárez almiñana et al 2017 a stochastic model ar 1 shown in eq 10 has been calibrated for the 5 sub basin time series obtained from spain02 10 x t φ 1 x t 1 θ 0 ε where xt and xt 1 are the variables ϕ 1 is an autocorrelation matrix θ 0 is an matrix of coefficients that multiplies the random n 0 1 values vector represented by ε with this ar 1 model the same number of monthly forecasts have been generated for the same historical period that has been analyzed with the system4 model forecasts the results obtained are shown in fig 12 and tables 9 and 10 when comparing the results of the system4 model with the time series generated with the autoregressive model it can be seen that for the drought start hit event the ar 1 model presents less bias however for the rest of events the performance is very similar between both models see 8 and fig 11 when comparing the results of the aggregated indices it can be observed that although the system4 model values are low they are higher than those obtained for the autoregressive model by 34 for the drought start hit event and up to 42 for the drought stay hit event nevertheless the improvement is between 8 and 12 for early start and late start events since the results of the aggregate index obtained for the droughts onset analysis for the system4 and the ar 1 models are similar it is necessary to perform a contrast test to determine if there is a significant difference in order to determine if exist this difference a mann whitney u test was performed the series of both models that were compared were obtained from the pod and ts indices with 40 values each for each of the two indices there is a value for each of the five sub basins and for each of the four scenarios considered 0 80 the mann whitney u test resulted in a p value of 0 0037 therefore there is a significant difference between the indices of the system4 and the ar 1 models in order to make predictions for basin management it is also important to consider predictive capacity over longer time periods the cumulative forecast for the entire 7 month period could be analyzed from the system4 data sets nonetheless increasing the forecast period will result in a loss of prediction reliability so using the first month is likely to be the most reliable analysis in terms of flow rates is also relevant but in this field it is foreseeable that the ar 1 model will provide a high degree of representativeness due to the subterranean component which in the case of the júcar river is very high therefore it will be useful to explore how to improve this predictive capacity using hydrological models or autoregressive moving average models that include an exogenous variable armax 5 conclusions in the area of watershed management greater attention should be paid to drought prediction so the proposed methodology is skillful to value predictions regardless of the result obtained for the case study climate predictions are a potentially very valuable tool in basin management and it is necessary to continue working on improving the generation methods and their validation the methodology proposed in this work has an important application for the evaluation of the predictive skill of drought events of climatic and stochastic models since it has been demonstrated that with its application it is possible to determine the quality of the forecast of this phenomenon based on the analysis of the system4 model data and despite the low values obtained from nse kgem and the aggregated indices it is concluded that the dynamical system4 coupled model can be used for forecasting drought events given that the aggregated indices obtained were better than those produced by the classical method autoregressive of the four events analyzed the most important is the drought start hit since what we are looking for is that the model can predict when a drought will start from this point of view the climate model system4 is more accurate than the ar 1 model since the aggregate index is 0 21 while for the autoregressive model it is 0 16 on a scale of 0 1 where 1 is the optimal value the analysis of the relative operating characteristic roc allows verifying the results obtained in the calculation of the aggregate index since a weighted area below the curve was obtained with a value of 0 19 for the drought start hit event when as in the aggregate index the optimum value is 1 in order to improve the characterization of the climate model it is necessary to make a bias correction before applying the methodology developed in this paper since as was observed in section 4 1 monthly precipitation data show bias in the months with higher precipitation it is important once the precipitation of the model has been analyzed to carry out an evaluation using this method of the runoff data as this would allow the hydrological and operational droughts of a water resources management system to be assessed acknowledgements the authors

7086,droughts cause significant socio economic and environmental impacts so it has become an extremely important element in decision making within water resource systems for this reason the research in this field has increased considerably over the last few decades in order to be capable of making early decisions and reducing drought impacts it is necessary to predict the occurrence of such events months or even years in advance in this sense various methods have been used to predict the occurrence of droughts at present seasonal forecast data can be used to forecast meteorological hydrological agricultural and operational droughts however the seasonal forecast data of these dynamical ocean atmosphere coupled models must be analyzed in an exhaustive way since it is known that these models may not adequately represent the climatic variability at river basin scale hence this paper presents a new methodology for assessing the skill of a climate forecasting system in order to predict the occurrence of droughts by using contingency tables the indices obtained from the contingency tables are necessary to perform the analysis of the predictive ability of the model in a semi distributed way all this taking into account the intensity of droughts using different scenarios based on the threshold below which it is considered to be in drought finally a single value is obtained to determine the predictive ability of the forecasting model for the entire basin the proposed methodology is applied to the júcar river basin in spain it has been found that the analyzed forecast model shows better results than those obtained using an autoregressive model further work is needed to enhance climate forecasting from the perspective of water resources management however it should be mentioned that this type of data could be used for drought forecasting allowing possible mitigation measures keywords drought forecasting forecast verification contingency table jucar river basin 1 introduction over the last decades drought events have been defined in a variety of ways and some of the most common definitions are contained in dracup et al 1980 tate and gustard 2000 and mishra and singh 2010 however drought can generally be defined as the reduction of water availability in a particular area for a specific period of time there are several classifications of droughts for example wilhite and glantz 1985 classify droughts into meteorological hydrologic agricultural and socio economic meteorological droughts can generally be defined as a period in which a particular number of days with rainfall less than a certain value great britain meteorological office 1951 this threshold below which a drought event is considered to occur can be the average precipitation value for the time scale analyzed hisdal and tallaksen 2000 droughts are a phenomenon that can be of varying magnitude duration and intensity and can affect various sectors of society in water resources management is important to be able to predict a possible drought event in order to have the capacity to make decisions that help minimize the damage of this phenomenon the application of early mitigation measures is essential to reduce the socio economic and environmental impacts of drought haro et al 2014a drought forecasting is a critical component in risk management drought preparedness and mitigation and a major research challenge is to develop suitable techniques for forecasting the onset and termination points of droughts one of the deficiencies in mitigating the effects of a drought is the inability to predict drought conditions accurately for months or years in advance mishra and singh 2011 there are different methodologies in drought forecasting regression models time series models probability models neural networks models and hybrid models bacanli et al 2009 cancelliere and salas 2004 fernández et al 2009 leilah and al khateeb 2005 mishra et al 2007 morid et al 2007 nowadays global circulation models and regional climate models are used to produce seasonal forecasts which can be useful for drought forecasting the seasonal forecast system model system4 molteni et al 2011 developed by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf is a dynamical forecasting system which produces time series of 7 months from the first day of each month wetterhall and di giuseppe 2017 system4 has been assessed for skill in predicting asian summer monsoons kim et al 2012b northern hemisphere winter kim et al 2012a below normal rainfall in the horn of africa dutra et al 2013 drought forecasting in east africa mwangi et al 2013 global meteorological drought dutra et al 2014 and for impacts analysis over east africa ogutu et al 2016 however seasonal forecast must be analyzed from the point of view of water resources management to analyze the predictive capacity of a model several indices skill scores can be used which have existed for more than a century peirce 1884 in bartholmes et al 2009 not all indices are suitable for assessing a forecast system and there is no set of indices to obtain all the necessary information which is why several sets of indicators are often used to cover a wider range of properties of the assessed model baldwin and kain 2004 the aim of this paper is to propose a method of forecast verification for seasonal forecast systems by carrying out an assessment of the predictive capacity of the model in drought forecasting as an early warning for a water resources system with high exploitation rates and long lasting droughts data from system4 were analyzed against reference data which in this case are precipitation data from the spain02 v4 model herrera et al 2012 2016 in this paper the data is evaluated by means of contingency tables proposing a new aggregate index that can be easily used to evaluate the ability of seasonal forecast models to predict drought events the proposed methodology is applied to the júcar river basin in spain the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the case study and the data used section 3 focuses on the proposed methodology the results and a general discussion are provided in section 4 and finally section 5 shows the conclusions 2 case study for the analysis of the system4 precipitation data was used the júcar river basin jrb located in the eastern of spain this basin is comprised of a total surface area of 22 261 km2 and is the main of 9 water exploitation systems in the júcar river basin demarcation dhj haro et al 2014b five sub basins were considered for this study see fig 1 the jrb has an average precipitation of 510 mm year and the average temperature is 13 6 c the natural resources reach 1279 hm3 year on the other hand the basin has a total water demand of 1117 hm3 year of which 88 6 is for irrigated agriculture thus the basin has a water exploitation index wei of 87 pedro monzonís et al 2014 the jrb is prone to drought events due to its semi arid environment andreu et al 2013 in the recent decades four events have been recorded which caused serious environmental damages and economic losses the last events recorded are the historic droughts of 1983 84 1985 86 1992 93 1995 96 1997 98 2000 01 and 2004 05 2007 08 ministerio de medio ambiente 2007 to mitigate the impacts of these phenomena the ministry of environmental of spain mma has worked extensively making special plans of drought management which consider three scenarios normal and pre alert alert and emergency estrela and vargas 2008 ferrer et al 2008 in addition the júcar basin agency jba has developed indices that allow determining the appropriate measure to deal with a drought event these indices called operative drought monitoring indicators sodmi use real time information provided by the automatic data acquisition system of the dhj estrela 2006 the data contain information about precipitation and state of reservoirs aquifers and rivers 2 1 forecast data the forecast data used in this study come from the system4 developed by the ecmwf these data are datasets of precipitation and temperature with a lead time of six months the hindcasts re forecasts start on the 1st of every month for the years 1981 2010 and the ensemble size is 15 members the grid point calculations of the datasets are on the corresponding reduced n218 gaussian grid which has about a 0 7 degrees spacing molteni et al 2011 for each of the five sub basins two points were taken from the grid of the system4 model in order to ensure that they were spread over the entire area of interest subsequently the average of the two points was obtained to work with a single dataset per sub basin this approach was chosen because an interpolation produces time series with less dispersion than the original series to obtain the historical time series of the forecast data the first month of each time series was extracted 0 month lead time hindcast and the fifteen scenarios generated by the system4 model were used ensemble members 2 2 observed data to contrast the forecast data were used the dataset of spain02 version v4 herrera et al 2016 which are time series of precipitation and temperature in high resolution grids on a daily scale these data cover the iberian peninsula and the balearic islands the grids correspond to standard grids of euro cordex 0 44 0 22 and 0 11 degrees herrera et al 2012 for this study was selected the thinnest grid of spain02 that is 0 11 degrees inside the datasets exist time series obtained with different interpolation methods and for this work was used the dataset obtained with the area averaged monthly trivariate thin plate splines method aa 3d herrera et al 2016 four points were taken in each sub basin and averaged in order to obtain a representative time series for each sub basin although the data of the system4 model range from 01 01 1981 to 31 12 2015 the analysis only was performed with the period between hydrological years 1981 82 and 2005 06 25 years due to the data range chosen from spain02 which goes from 01 01 1970 to 31 12 2006 once the time series were obtained for each sub basin they were analyzed on a monthly scale 3 methodology 3 1 statistical analysis in the evaluation of hydrological models indices are used to determine their capacity to reproduce reality among the most commonly used indicators are nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the modified kling gupta efficiency kgem kling et al 2012 moriasi et al 2007 spalding fecher et al 2016 therefore a first evaluation of the system4 model data was made obtaining the nse and kgem indicators the nash sutcliffe efficiency eq 1 is a metric that determines the relative magnitude of variance of data modeled with observed variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 1 nse 1 n 1 n o n f n 2 n 1 n o n o n 2 where n is the total number of time steps o n is the forecasted value at time step n f n is the observed value at time step n and o n is the mean of the observed values the modified kling gupta efficiency eq 2 as well as the nse it has a range of inf to 1 and its optimal value is 1 2 kgem 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where r is the correlation coefficient between forecasted f and observed o data β is the ratio of means µf µo and γ is the ratio of coefficients of variation cvf cvo the ideal value of each of the three components is 1 gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 in order to obtain the indicators described above an accumulation of data from the 15 system4 ensemble members was carried out as these time series are equiprobable it was decided to work with a unique dataset that includes the characteristics of each forecast thus a single time series that groups the 15 ensemble members was obtained placing each time series at the end of the previous one that means a total of 4500 precipitation data on a monthly scale on the other hand the time series of observed data was repeated 15 times so that both data observed and forecast have the same length these aggregate time series of both were also used for the forecast verification in addition the nse and the kgem indicators were obtained for the ensemble in order to analyze the performance of the mean of the 15 ensemble members 3 2 forecast verification using a contingency table since what is desired is to assess the predictive capacity of the drought event as an early alert an analysis should be carried out from the perspective of the occurrence of this phenomenon in the management of water resources it is very important to predict droughts in order to adopt measures to reduce the impacts of these events haro et al 2014a thus the correct prediction of a drought event is more important than the correct amount of the runoff when the prediction is optimal for this reason it was decided to analyze the predictive capacity of drought episodes droughts have three main characteristics intensity duration and surface area affected wilhite 2000 intensity refers to the decrease in precipitation and the impacts that this decrease can cause and it is measured by applying the palmer drought severity index or through a threshold which can be a percentage of the mean precipitation and can be arbitrarily selected duration is the period of time that precipitation is below the set threshold for the development of the analysis of this work five drought scenarios were established which correspond to 20 s1 40 s2 60 s3 80 s4 and 100 s5 of the monthly means in each of them the event occurs when the precipitation value for each month is less than the corresponding threshold value in this way the measurement of drought intensity is also included in the analysis the scenarios were analyzed using 2 2 contingency tables for dichotomous events bartholmes et al 2009 which allow the predictive capacity of the model to be assessed based on meteorological droughts these type of droughts occur when the monthly precipitation is below the mean precipitation value of the corresponding month hisdal and tallaksen 2000 in this way a time series of discrete nonprobabilistic values were obtained for each scenario since each value can only take a value of four possibilities hit miss false alarm and correct negative table 1 shows a contingency table where the hits a represent the coincidence of drought of both series the misses c correspond to the presence of a drought in the data of spain02 and the absence of this event in the data of system4 the false alarms b are presented when in the time series of spain02 there is no drought and if there is in system4 and finally the correct negatives d are the months in which there is no drought in both models from the contingency table it can be concluded that a perfect forecast is presented when the value of false alarms b and misses c is equal to zero however given that an actual forecast is imperfect some metrics are required to determine the degree of correspondence between the predicted value and the observed value thus obtaining different characteristics of the predicted time series wilks 2006 there are a large number of metrics developed for model verification using 2 2 contingency tables mason 2003 murphy and daan 1985 in this paper seven different scores were used in order to assess the forecasting system the proportion correct score pc shown in eq 3 proposed by finley 1884 since this score determines the correct portion of the time series and it is a widely used metric being the most direct and intuitive however this score does not differentiate between hits and correct negatives so it is necessary to use other scores the threat score ts is a very useful metric when the event to predict drought occurs less frequently than the non occurrence is eq 4 as well as the pc the ts has the worst possible value of 0 and 1 as the best possible value on the other hand the bias score bias is the comparison of the mean forecast with the mean observation as evident in eq 5 the bias score is not a precision indicator since it does not provide information on the correspondence between forecasts and observations when is dealing with mean values a value below 1 indicates that the drought event was less frequently predicted than observed while a value above 1 indicates that the event was over expected bias ranges from zero to infinite and the best expected value is 1 which would indicate that the predicted time series is unbiased 3 pc hits c o r r e c t n e g a t i v e s n 4 ts hits hits m i s s e s f a l s e a l a r m s 5 bias hits f a l s e a l a r m s hits m i s s e s 6 far false a l a r m s hits f a l s e a l a r m s 7 sr hits hits f a l s e a l a r m s 8 pod hits hits m i s s e s 9 pofd false a l a r m s correct n e g a t i v e s f a l s e a l a r m s the reliability of the model can be evaluated by using the false alarm ratio far which represents the yes portion of the system4 model that is wrong as shown in eq 6 so a better expected value is zero and the worst is 1 on the other hand the success ratio sr provides information on the probability that an observed event will be predicted eq 7 this score is sensitive to false alarms and ignores misses this metric can also be represented as 1 far in other words it is complementary to the false alarm ratio the probability of detection score pod is the ratio between the correct forecasts and the number of times this event has occurred eq 8 on the other hand the probability of false detection score pofd is the ratio of false alarms to the total number of no drought events eq 9 in order to obtain an analysis with the obtained indices the performance diagram is used roebber 2009 where bias sr 1 far pod and ts are evaluated 3 3 contingency table modified despite the different indices used there is information that cannot be collected by them since it should not only be seen as an analysis of the possible occurrence or not of the drought event consideration should also be given to the possibility that the event may be predicted early or late in addition to the permanence of the drought over the months in order to collect these possibilities of dichotomous events the creation of a 3 3 contingency table is proposed leaving it as follows see table 2 when both time series present the start of a drought event in the evaluated month the discrete variable corresponds to a drought start hit e but if an onset drought event occurs in system4 and in spain02 there is a drought initiated prior to the month evaluated a late start f is present on the other hand when in the system4 time series there is a start of a drought and spain02 does not present drought a false start g is taken when in the spain02 time series there is the onset drought and in the system4 time series there is a drought that started earlier the value of the variable is an early start h but if both time series have drought in the month evaluated but in neither case is the start of said event a drought stay hit i is held whereas if in system4 there is a drought initiated prior to the month evaluated while in the spain02 data there is no drought the variable is a false stay j when spain02 presents a start of a drought while in the system4 there is no drought the variable is a false no drought k if the spain02 time series is in a drought that started before the month evaluated and the system4 time series does not have a drought an early exit l is presented and when neither time series has a drought the discrete variable takes the value of a no drought hit m however since the metrics mentioned above have been developed for 2 2 contingency tables table 2 must be transformed from 3 3 to 2 2 to this end the procedure proposed in wilks 2006 should be used for example if the goal is to work with the event drought start hit e table 2 is modified as follows see table 3 thus for any event to be evaluated it will take the place of a hit the sum of the two remaining values of the row of the evaluated event corresponds to a false alarm while the sum of the two values of the column where the studied event is located corresponds to a miss finally the sum of the rest of the values will be a correct negative since the most important event in this analysis is the occurrence of the drought event and its onset the events drought hit e early start h and late start f are evaluated 3 4 assessment of an aggregate index the analysis described above provides a large number of values that are complex to analyze therefore it is necessary to reduce the number of indices in order to obtain a unique value capable of showing the drought forecasting skill of the forecast system model in a simplified way a first approximation is to average the value of each scenario for each index and for each event it is important to take into account the water exploitation index wei of the river basin since when the availability is greater than the wei the drought is not worrying as the volume of resources is greater than the demand therefore in order to obtain the average of the scenarios only those below the wei should be considered even after having averaged the values a large number of parameters have to be analyzed independently since the four possibilities that each discrete value can obtain hits false alarms misses and correct negatives the one that is less interesting is the correct negatives an average of the ts and pod indices is obtained in order to obtain an aggregate index given that the ts indicates the portion of hits of the drought event with respect to the presence of this phenomenon in both series and the pod shows the portion of hits with respect to the presence of the drought in the observed data thus the number of indices is reduced to one per sub basin and per event moreover it should be considered that the drought phenomenon also has a spatial dimension to take this property into account and also to obtain a single value for the entire basin it is proposed to obtain an overall index as the weighted average of the 5 series the annual mean precipitation is proposed as a weighting parameter thus an aggregate index is obtained for the whole basin and for each particular event considering the intensity and spatial variability the aggregate index obtained was contrasted with the relative operating characteristic roc the roc diagram plots the probability of detection score pod and the probability of false detection score pofd this method is widely used for its ability to graph several thresholds in a single diagram nevertheless it can be convenient to summarize a roc diagram using a single scalar value and the usual choice for this purpose is the area under the roc curve as roc curves for perfect forecasts pass through the upper left corner the area under a perfect roc curve includes the entire unit square the perfect area is equal to 1 and the random forecasts lie along the 45 degrees diagonal of the unit square the area under the roc of interest is 2a 1 where a is the area under the curve obtained wilks 2006 4 results and discussion in this section spatio temporal droughts from 15 ensemble member of the model system4 from 1981 to 2006 was compared to the reference data set spain02 v4 after a precipitation analysis the predictive capacity of droughts is analyzed using modified contingency tables in order to obtain an aggregate index for the entire basin seven indices were assessed in the analysis see figs 9 and 10 4 1 precipitation for the comparison of the monthly mean precipitation of the system4 model with respect to the spain02 model the ensemble of the 15 scenarios of the forecast time series was used fig 2 shows the monthly mean of both models for the five sub basins analyzed as can be seen in the previous figure there is a high correlation between both models from march to september months with the least precipitation in the five sub basins however there are notable differences from october to february when the rainfall is greater despite this in all cases a similar trend of the system4 model data is reproduced with respect to the spain02 model the annual precipitation of the system4 model also presents the same trend as the spain02 model as can be seen in fig 3 for this reason the information can be used since it is possible to correct differences by applying some method of bias correction the data of the ensemble collect the mean values of the 15 system4 model scenarios however this time series does not contain the noise presented by each of these scenarios as can be seen in fig 3 therefore it has been decided to work with the fifteen time series on a monthly scale obtaining their statistics as a single series once the single time series containing the data of the 15 system4 model scenarios has been obtained it is contrasted with the observed time series and the nash sutcliffe and kling gupta indices are obtained see figs 4 and 5 fig 4 shows low nse values between 0 26 and 0 01 while kgem values are around 0 4 when analyzing the elements of the kgem see fig 5 it can be seen that the monthly data of the five sub basins show a relationship close to 1 both for the mean ratios bias ratio and the coefficients of variation on the other hand the pearson correlation coefficient is between 0 31 for the contreras sub basin and 0 38 in the alarcón sub basin however in the case of the ensemble the analysis shows in an nse between 0 20 for mulet and 0 27 for tous a kgem between 0 26 for mulet and 0 33 for tous and a pearson correlation coefficient between 0 48 for contreras and 0 57 for alarcón this indicates that the ensemble mean presents a better similarity to the observed data with respect to the 15 ensemble members the reason for this similarity is that the ensemble improves the average of the 15 time series but the noise of these series is lost as in the seasonal management of water resources the noise of the 15 ensemble members is more important than their average it is important to work with all the series and not only with the ensemble 4 2 droughts since the time series of occurrence or absence of drought event is a time series of dichotomous data it can be analyzed using a 2 2 contingency table the indices obtained are shown in the following tables table 4 and 5 show that the correct portion pc of the analyzed time series is between 86 and 81 for scenario s1 while for scenario s5 the correct portion is between 61 and 57 in reducing the threshold of droughts the sub basin that presented the greatest difference between the pc values for the different scenarios was mulet where there was a difference of 27 between the s1 and s5 scenarios in general bias shows that the time series of all sub basins are unbiased or slightly biased light over forecast was obtained for the mulet s1 and tous s5 scenarios on the other hand the greatest biases were obtained in alarcón contreras molinar and tous all on scenario s1 in addition to alarcón s2 and contreras s2 the analysis of the probability of false detection pofd and probability of detection pod is very important because together they form the conceptual basis for the signal detection approach to verify probability forecasts wilks 2006 the pofd obtained shows that the evaluated data have a false alarm percentage with respect to the non occurrence of the drought event of less than 25 for thresholds s1 s2 and s3 except for the mulet and tous sub basins in addition in the previous sub basins in scenario s3 it is slightly higher than 30 however for the rest of the scenarios the percentage of false alarms with respect to non occurrence of drought fluctuates between 35 and 56 the pod indicates that despite having obtained high pc values the percentage of hits with respect to the total occurrence of the event is low reaching a maximum of 68 for scenario s5 of the mulet sub basin the sr and far denote the percentage of hits and false alarms with respect to the yes of the predicted data respectively the values found from sr and far indicate that the forecast model tends to over estimate the drought event when considering low thresholds fig 6 shows the performance diagram obtained where can be seen that for the thresholds of 100 s5 the results are better since the optimum forecast is in the upper right part of the diagram fig 7 shows the roc diagram where it is possible to ascertain what is obtained in the performance diagram that is the predictive capacity of the model improves when droughts are less intense s5 however this predictive capacity is very low since the area of interest under the curve is in the range of 0 18 in the tous sub basin and 0 27 in the alarcón sub basin in order to study the coincidences of the system4 model data with respect to the spain02 model the 2 2 contingency table is extended to a 3 3 table with emphasis on the concordances at the onset of each event these are drought start hit early start and late start events additionally the event drought stay hit was analyzed in order to explore the behavior of the predictions of the system4 model once it has entered a period of drought once the 3 3 contingency table has been obtained it is reduced to 2 2 since the calculated indices have been developed for 2 2 contingency tables table 6 shows as an example the transformation of the contingency table from 3 3 to 2 2 for the alarcón sub basin and for the drought hit event corresponding to scenario s1 fig 8 shows the performance diagrams of the four events analyzed where it can be seen that for all sub basins the climate model gives the best results for the s4 and s5 scenarios while scenario s1 has the worst results in fig 8 it can also be seen that the results of the four events are unbiased for the s4 scenario however for the drought start hit event the pod sr and ts indices are very low the contreras sub basin was the one that obtained the highest values with a pod of 0 39 a sr of 0 35 and a ts of 0 23 on the other hand for the early start event scenario s4 has pod and sr values of around 0 20 while the ts reaches 0 19 and 0 19 for the mulet and tous sub basins respectively as for the late start event the pod and sr values are close to 0 30 and the ts remains around 0 15 finally for the drought stay hit event index values improved slightly the pod and sr are around 0 40 and the ts around 0 20 fig 9 shows the evolution of the seven indices calculated through the five proposed scenarios this for the alarcón sub basin and for the four events analyzed drought start hit early start late start and drought stay hit for each graph shown the optimal value of the first five indices is 1 pc bias pod ts and sr while for the last two the optimal value is 0 far and pofd in the drought start hit event the correct portion is 88 for scenario s1 and decreases for the other scenarios to 71 for scenario s5 the event is sub forecast for scenarios s1 s2 and s3 as they present a bias of less than 1 however for scenarios s4 and s5 it is observed that the event is over forecasted the percentage of hits with respect to the occurrence of the event in the observed time series is only 36 for scenarios s4 and s5 by eliminating the correct negatives from the analysis the drought start hit event has a low success rate ts of between 10 and 21 the early start event presents a more erratic behavior compared to the drought start hit event since the pc decreases up to 57 for the s5 scenario and with bias from 0 096 for the s1 scenario to 1 627 for the s5 scenario however for the s4 scenario the event is unbiased in this event there is a high number of false alarms regarding the predicted events as can be seen in the far index the late start event shows a high over forecast as it reaches up to a value of 3 75 for scenario s1 besides a very high far as well as the early start event finally the drought stay hit event has a similar behavior to the drought start hit event with considerable bias in the first three scenarios and a pc close to its optimal value in the s1 scenario as in all other events the value of the far index is very high due to the considerable number of false alarms in fig 9 it can be seen that after the analysis carried out there are 5 values for each of the calculated indices that is 35 values for each sub basin and this for each event making it difficult to fully analyze the ability of the climate model to predict the drought event therefore an aggregate index is proposed in order to obtain an average of the scenarios analyzed the scenario s5 was not considered given that it is higher than the wei of the jrb is 87 pedro monzonís et al 2014 fig 10 shows the mean of the four scenarios for each sub basin and event by reducing the number of indices considering only ts and pod compound indices are obtained for each sub basin which are shown in table 7 when calculating a weighted average considering the annual mean precipitation an aggregate index is obtained for the entire basin the results are shown in the table 8 the assessment of the areas under the curves of the roc diagram for the drought start hit event considering only the first four scenarios 0 80 results in values ranging from 0 11 for the tous sub basin to 0 17 for alarcón if a weighted average is obtained in the same way as the aggregate index it has a value of 0 19 fig 11 the above results may be considered unoptimistic when describing the predictive capacity of the analyzed model however this conclusion was predictable given the known uncertainty in the occurrence of future precipitation events as a result these cannot be judged on their own they need to be compared with other alternatives in order to obtain forecasts for this purpose the classical method has been chosen which has already been used on some occasions in the management of the jrb andreu et al 2013 haro monteagudo et al 2017 suárez almiñana et al 2017 a stochastic model ar 1 shown in eq 10 has been calibrated for the 5 sub basin time series obtained from spain02 10 x t φ 1 x t 1 θ 0 ε where xt and xt 1 are the variables ϕ 1 is an autocorrelation matrix θ 0 is an matrix of coefficients that multiplies the random n 0 1 values vector represented by ε with this ar 1 model the same number of monthly forecasts have been generated for the same historical period that has been analyzed with the system4 model forecasts the results obtained are shown in fig 12 and tables 9 and 10 when comparing the results of the system4 model with the time series generated with the autoregressive model it can be seen that for the drought start hit event the ar 1 model presents less bias however for the rest of events the performance is very similar between both models see 8 and fig 11 when comparing the results of the aggregated indices it can be observed that although the system4 model values are low they are higher than those obtained for the autoregressive model by 34 for the drought start hit event and up to 42 for the drought stay hit event nevertheless the improvement is between 8 and 12 for early start and late start events since the results of the aggregate index obtained for the droughts onset analysis for the system4 and the ar 1 models are similar it is necessary to perform a contrast test to determine if there is a significant difference in order to determine if exist this difference a mann whitney u test was performed the series of both models that were compared were obtained from the pod and ts indices with 40 values each for each of the two indices there is a value for each of the five sub basins and for each of the four scenarios considered 0 80 the mann whitney u test resulted in a p value of 0 0037 therefore there is a significant difference between the indices of the system4 and the ar 1 models in order to make predictions for basin management it is also important to consider predictive capacity over longer time periods the cumulative forecast for the entire 7 month period could be analyzed from the system4 data sets nonetheless increasing the forecast period will result in a loss of prediction reliability so using the first month is likely to be the most reliable analysis in terms of flow rates is also relevant but in this field it is foreseeable that the ar 1 model will provide a high degree of representativeness due to the subterranean component which in the case of the júcar river is very high therefore it will be useful to explore how to improve this predictive capacity using hydrological models or autoregressive moving average models that include an exogenous variable armax 5 conclusions in the area of watershed management greater attention should be paid to drought prediction so the proposed methodology is skillful to value predictions regardless of the result obtained for the case study climate predictions are a potentially very valuable tool in basin management and it is necessary to continue working on improving the generation methods and their validation the methodology proposed in this work has an important application for the evaluation of the predictive skill of drought events of climatic and stochastic models since it has been demonstrated that with its application it is possible to determine the quality of the forecast of this phenomenon based on the analysis of the system4 model data and despite the low values obtained from nse kgem and the aggregated indices it is concluded that the dynamical system4 coupled model can be used for forecasting drought events given that the aggregated indices obtained were better than those produced by the classical method autoregressive of the four events analyzed the most important is the drought start hit since what we are looking for is that the model can predict when a drought will start from this point of view the climate model system4 is more accurate than the ar 1 model since the aggregate index is 0 21 while for the autoregressive model it is 0 16 on a scale of 0 1 where 1 is the optimal value the analysis of the relative operating characteristic roc allows verifying the results obtained in the calculation of the aggregate index since a weighted area below the curve was obtained with a value of 0 19 for the drought start hit event when as in the aggregate index the optimum value is 1 in order to improve the characterization of the climate model it is necessary to make a bias correction before applying the methodology developed in this paper since as was observed in section 4 1 monthly precipitation data show bias in the months with higher precipitation it is important once the precipitation of the model has been analyzed to carry out an evaluation using this method of the runoff data as this would allow the hydrological and operational droughts of a water resources management system to be assessed acknowledgements the authors

7087,tidal asymmetry in deltas is caused by both the intrinsic asymmetry resulting from the combination of astronomical tides and by nonlinear tidal interactions that occur in shallow water the relative importance of these sources of tidal asymmetry in delta channel networks have remained poorly studied partly due to the limitations of classical harmonic analysis ha in hindcasting nonstationary tides the pearl river delta prd is a multichannel system with rapidly changing bathymetry subject to severe human interventions this work applies a nonstationary harmonic model ns tide to hydrological data from 15 stations in the prd spanning the period 1961 2012 the spatiotemporal variation of multiple sources of tidal asymmetry is quantified by a skewness metric revealing how similar or dissimilar the development of alternative sources of tidal asymmetry develop in the delta subject to study a relative sensitivity coefficient rsc is introduced to decompose the contribution of tidal amplitude variations to multiple tidal asymmetries analytical results show the development of tides becoming gradually more asymmetric as they propagate into delta channel networks and how this depends on the river flow variation in the orientation of tidal asymmetries induced by different combinations of tidal constituents leads to a complex pattern of the overall tidal asymmetry in the prd our results show that tidal asymmetry in deltas can be significantly dependent on the river flow keywords tidal asymmetry nonstationary tides river flow deltas 1 introduction 1 1 tidal asymmetry tidal asymmetry refers to a periodic difference between the falling and rising tidal periods boon and byrne 1981 speer et al 1991 specifically a shorter duration of the rising tide indicates a flood dominant tidal asymmetry and a shorter duration of falling tide indicates an ebb dominant tidal asymmetry speer and aubrey 1985 friedrichs and aubrey 1988 in a semidiurnal tidal regime tidal form number f ak1 ao1 am2 as2 0 25 where a denotes amplitude the occurrence of tidal asymmetry is mainly associated with the interaction between the m2 tide and its first harmonic the shallow water constituent m4 speer and aubrey 1985 friedrichs and aubrey 1988 van de kreeke and robaczewska 1993 it is common practice to characterize the degree of distortion and the nature of tidal asymmetry by the amplitude ratio m4 m2 and relative phase 2m2 m4 friedrichs and aubrey 1988 savenije and veling 2005 lu et al 2015 thus the generation of m4 is considered the main source of asymmetry in a number of studies asymmetry in the tidal motion can also be produced through the generation of compound overtides parker 1991 wang et al 1999 and even in absence of shallow water tides there is asymmetry inherent in the astronomical tides hoitink et al 2003 nidzieko 2010 song et al 2011 in particular in semidiurnal regimes the combination of m2 tide with the compound tide ms4 and 2ms6 m2 s2 m4 ms4 m2 s2 m4 2ms6 can produce asymmetrical tides byun and cho 2006 in mixed or diurnal regimes where the k1 and o1 tides are stronger than the m2 tide the interaction of astronomical diurnal and semidiurnal tides may be the main source of tidal asymmetry primarily through the combination of k1 o1 and m2 tides ranasinghe and pattiaratchi 2000 hoitink et al 2003 2006 woodworth et al 2005 any combination of tidal constituents with angular frequencies ω1 ω2 and ω3 pairs or triads that satisfy either the frequency relationship 2 ω 1 ω 2 or ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 can contribute to tidal asymmetry the contribution of different combinations of constituents to the overall asymmetry in the rise and fall of water levels can be conveniently quantified adopting a skewness based approach which was proposed by nidzieko 2010 and extended by song et al 2011 by quantifying skewness in the probability density function pdf of water levels from 335 hydrological stations around the world song et al 2011 obtained a global view on the sources of tidal asymmetry the latter analysis only addresses coastal and ocean stations the spatial evolution of skewness in water level pdfs for delta channel networks where significant nonlinear tidal interactions occurs has rarely been discussed 1 2 evolution of tidal asymmetry and related morphological development analysis of the historical evolution of tides can reveal natural and human induced changes in tidal river dynamics hoitink and jay 2016 and morphological evolution hoitink et al 2017 wang et al 2002 numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship between tidal asymmetry and morphological development postma 1961 pingree and maddock 1978 friedrichs and aubrey 1988 van de kreeke and robaczewska 1993 van de kreeke et al 1997 van der molen 2000 lanzoni and seminara 2002 wang et al 2002 bolle et al 2010 guo et al 2016 tidal asymmetry is one of the factors generating residual sediment transport controlling the formation of shoals and tidal flats speer and aubrey 1985 fry and aubrey 1990 moore et al 2009 brown and davies 2010 flood dominant tides generally produce a residual landward sediment transport and ebb dominant tides are associated with sediment export dronkers 1986 van de kreeke and dunsbergen 2000 changes in morphology may in turn alter the tidal asymmetry significantly especially under severe human interventions e g dredging sand extraction dam construction bolle et al 2010 vellinga et al 2014 shallow inlet systems tend to be flood dominant an increase in channel depth may lead to a reduction of the flood dominant type of asymmetry while the presence of large inter tidal basin storage is found to enhance flood dominance dronkers 1986 lanzoni and seminara 1998 wang et al 2002 it is difficult to investigate the temporal evolution of tidal asymmetry in deltas in response to changes of morphology too short a length of record and too long a sampling interval of a tidal record subject to a harmonic analysis limit the degree in which the obtained amplitudes and phases adequately capture tidal asymmetry in nonstationary tidal systems such as deltas the problem is further complicated by the need to obtain the time series of fluvial processes e g river discharge bolle et al 2010 examined the evolution of tidal asymmetry in the western scheldt estuary expressed by amplitude ratios and phase differences between 1970 and 2002 and related the established changes to the deepening of the river channels the work of bolle et al 2010 only considered the m2 m4 and m6 tides ignoring the contributions of other tidal combinations to the total asymmetry of the water level pdf guo et al 2016 used a 1 d model to explore alternative types of tidal interactions inducing tidal asymmetry in an estuary but mainly focused on the morphodynamic impacts of multiple tidal asymmetries the responses of multiple tidal asymmetries to varying river discharge in delta channel networks has remained virtually unstudied 1 3 harmonic analysis for nonstationary tides classical harmonic analysis ha is traditionally used to analyze oceanic tides in seas and coastal shelves however the ha method based on the assumption that the tides are stationary and independent of other forcings darwin 1892 doodson 1921 flinchem and jay 2000 usually fails to predict river tides as the stationary assumption is not fulfilled due to nonstationary interactions of tides with channel geometry bottom friction and river flow river tides do not respond simply to astronomical forcing and in a complex channel network may exhibit a degree of chaos maas and doelman 2002 although short term ha can be applied to resolve major tidal constituents guo et al 2015 it is inappropriate for the analysis of river tides when the river discharge variability is high in recent decades substantial research efforts have been devoted to analyzing nonstationary tides the continuous wavelet transforms cwt is found to be more accurate than ha and can resolve nontidal variations which made it an effective tool in analysis of nonstationary records a major limitation of cwt is that it is unable to distinguish between tidal constituents within a tidal species when tidal fluvial interactions are strong jay and kukulka 2003 matte et al 2013 modified t tide pawlowicz et al 2002 and proposed a harmonic model adapted to nonstationary tides ns tide which builds nonstationary forcing directly into the tidal basis functions the utility of ns tide has been demonstrated by applying it to the columbia river estuary matte et al 2013 and the st lawrence fluvial estuary matte et al 2014 where the oceanic tides are strongly modified by the river flow results showed that ns tide can represent tidal fluvial dynamics much better than ha especially in the upper parts of tidal rivers recently cai et al 2018 applied ns tide to water levels for an entire channel network to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of river tide dynamics demonstrating that complex channel networks can be synoptically analyzed using this method cai et al 2018 mainly focused on the contributions of river tide dynamics on the changes in the residual water level in the pearl river channel networks here we apply ns tide again to the pearl river delta to shed light on the spatial variation of tidal asymmetry resulting from tidal fluvial dynamics in its distributary delta channels 1 4 aim and methodology the purpose of this paper is to establish and understand the spatiotemporal variation in tidal asymmetry in a delta channel network in terms of pairs and triads of tidal constituents contributing to the overall asymmetry specifically we examine 1 the spatiotemporal variation of tidal asymmetries induced by dominant combinations of astronomical tides i e k1 o1 m2 and by shallow water interactions i e m2 s2 ms4 m2 m4 m2 m4 m6 in the pearl river delta 2 the extent to which multiple tidal asymmetries respond to delta morphology developments that have occurred over the past decades 3 the degree in which changes in tidal harmonics and river discharge yield change of tidal asymmetry this paper is structured as follows the next section describes the study region data processing and the analysis methods sections 3 presents the spatiotemporal variations of the main tides in the pearl river delta and the resulting multiple tidal asymmetries the impact of river flows on tidal asymmetry is then evaluated section 4 discusses the preloading of tidal asymmetry in other deltas and estuaries the contribution of tidal asymmetry and river discharge to residual sediment transport and the impact of tidal amplitude attenuation and phase shift on tidal asymmetry finally our conclusions are presented in section 5 2 setting data and methods 2 1 the pearl river delta the pearl river delta prd is located at the south part of china it is bell shaped with a catchment area of approximately 17 200 km2 zhang et al 2009 the pearl river is the third largest river in china debouching in a multichannel delta system with many bifurcations and intersections the three largest tributaries of the pearl river are the west river the north river and the east river river runoff from the pearl river flows into the south china sea scs through eight outlets fig 1 the complicated channel network renders the tidal fluvial processes in the prd very distinct the complex geometry and morphology of the prd are a result of both natural processes and human activities including dredging and sand mining the associated deepening of channels causes the tidal limit to move landward the mean river discharges of the west river the north river and the east river are 7124 m3 s 1465 m3 s 719 m3 s respectively feeding the delta that is subject to a micro tidal regime at its coastal boundary the tidal range is 1 0 1 2 m near the westernmost outlets and 1 0 1 5 m near the eastern outlets tides are mixed mainly semidiurnal in the prd the tidal form number f ranges from 1 to 1 5 and increases upstream m2 is the dominant tidal constituent followed by k1 o1 and s2 due to the combined effects of river flow channel geometry and bottom friction tides in the prd are distorted as they propagate upstream 2 2 data overview water level data were collected from the hydrological yearbooks of the people s republic of china the earliest continuous water level measurements in the prd date back to the 1900s long term time series of water levels were obtained for 15 stations spanning the river networks and the outlets in the prd these hydrological stations are denoted by black circles in fig 1 the record lengths of different stations are shown in table 1 the older data series contained two high and two low water levels occurring each 24 84 hr day data at each station have been quality controlled through visual checks in order to identify values with spurious jumps and glitches outliers were removed after the quality check the water level data were trigonometrically interpolated to 1 hour intervals for harmonic analysis appendix a daily mean river discharges for 3 hydrological stations are used for the analysis which are makou 1961 2012 sanshui 1961 2012 and boluo 1985 2012 time series of monthly mean discharges at makou sanshui and boluo are shown in fig 2 maximum and minimum discharges at makou in the period between 1961 and 2012 are 29530 m3 s 1968 07 and 1205 m3 s 1993 02 respectively which are high values compared with the extremes at boluo which amount to 3093 m3 s 2006 06 and 168 m3 s 2004 11 respectively the corresponding discharge time series of each station are listed in table 2 2 3 methods 2 3 1 harmonic analysis t tide models the tidal heights ζ as 1 ζ t f 0 0 i 1 n f 1 i cos ω i t f 2 i sin ω i t where t is time ω i is frequency of an individual tidal constituent and f 0 0 f 1 i and f 2 i are unknown coefficients to be determined by regression analysis using observations ns tide is a method developed by modifying t tide the nonstationary forcing by the river discharge and ocean tidal range is directly built into the tidal basis functions according to the theoretical analysis of kukulka and jay 2003a 2003b the polynomials f 0 0 f 1 i and f 2 i are modeled as 2 f l i p 0 l i p 1 l i q c l t p 2 l i r d l t q e l t where q is river flow r is greater diurnal tidal range at the most seaward station calculated as the difference between higher high water and lower low water p 0 l i p 1 l i p 2 l i are the model coefficients for each station and frequency c d and e are the exponents for each station and frequency band l is the index for coefficients l 0 1 2 i is the index for tidal constituents i 1 n the coefficients in these polynomials are determined by a robust regression leffler and jay 2009 to account for the distance between the stations at which the q and r time series are measured and the stations where the analysis is performed a constant time lag of the q and r variables is used to represent the time of propagation of the waves to the station table 2 the total tidal height ζ t is then as follows 3 ζ t p 0 0 0 p 1 0 0 q c s t t q p 2 0 0 r d s t t r q e s t t q i 1 n p 0 1 i p 1 1 i q c f t t q p 2 1 i r d f t t r q e f t t q cos ω i t p 0 2 i p 1 2 i q c f t t q p 2 2 i r d f t t r q e f t t q sin ω i t where t r and t q are the time lags applied to the q and r time series the time lags are obtained by calculating the mean maximum correlation between q or r and the observations of water levels the subscripts s and f denote the stage and tidal fluvial models respectively cs ds es cf df and ef are determined using an iterative procedure the non stationary harmonic analysis is performed on windows of one year to approximate the tidal constituents at 15 hydrological stations the main reason for using a one year windows is to assess the sub annual impact of changes in channel geometries the water level time series of some floodplain stations are discontinuous for which the analysis period is shortened some stations show data gaps up to more than one year like wanqinshaxi 2 yr and xipaotai 5 yr these gaps in time series of the annual mean tidal properties are interpolated using polynomials in fig 3 a comparison of results is shown obtained from t tide and ns tide at nanhua and zidong for the analysis period of 2010 the model prediction of ns tide fits well with the observed data during the flood season while the inability of t tide to resolve the nonstationary forcing is manifest as well after the coefficients in eq 2 are determined by a robust regression the tidal amplitudes and phases can be predicted under different quantiles of river flows this way the effect of river discharge on tides and tidal asymmetry can be investigated 2 3 2 tidal skewness following the methods of nidzieko 2010 and song et al 2011 we use tidal skewness instead of the relative phase and amplitude ratio friedrichs and aubrey 1988 to quantify the tidal asymmetry this method can capture the amplitude and phase information of tidal constituents in one metric another advantage of this method is that it can consider different combinations of tidal constituents contributing to the overall tidal asymmetry the skewness created by combination of two or three constituents is obtained as 4 γ 2 3 4 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 ω 2 sin 2 φ 1 φ 2 1 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 3 2 for pairs or 5 γ 3 3 2 a 1 ω 1 a 2 ω 2 a 3 ω 3 sin φ 1 φ 2 φ 3 1 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 a 3 2 ω 3 2 3 2 for triads where a1 a2 and a3 is tidal amplitude φ 1 φ 2 and φ 3 is tidal phase ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 is frequency of tidal constituent the contribution to total tidal skewness by different pairs or triad combinations of tidal constituents is obtained as 6 β 2 γ 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 i 1 n a i 2 ω i 2 3 2 for pairs and 7 β 3 γ 3 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 a 3 2 ω 3 2 i 1 n a i 2 ω i 2 3 2 for triplets the total tidal skewness γ n in the pearl river delta is obtained by 8 γ n β 2 β 3 generally the rising tide duration is shorter than the falling tide for γ n 0 and the falling tide duration is shorter for γ n 0 2 3 3 mann kendall and pettitt test historical analysis of tides can reveal natural and anthropogenic trends in tidal river dynamics and possible regime changes hoitink and jay 2016 in order to evaluate the temporal variations of tidal properties in the prd in response to human activities the linear trends of tidal harmonics and tidal skewness metrics are quantified through a linear regression method the mann kendall mk test is applied to evaluate the statistical significance of these trends the modified pre whitening procedure von storch 1999 kulkarni and von storch 1995 yue and wang 2002 zhang et al 2010 is employed before the mk test is applied to limit the influence of serial correlation since the human interventions took place in a short period sudden changes in the channel geometry due to uncontrolled sand excavations can result in abrupt changes in tidal properties the pettitt test pettitt 1979 is a nonparametric test that can be used to evaluate the occurrence of abrupt changes in a time series here the pettitt test is applied to identify abrupt changes in time series of tidal amplitudes and tidal skewness 2 3 4 choice of tidal constituents included in the analysis m2 is the dominant tidal constituent in the prd followed by k1 o1 and s2 mao et al 2004 wong et al 2003 m4 is the first harmonic of m2 and dominates the non linear signature of many estuaries friedrichs and aubrey 1988 the tidal asymmetry can also be affected by the sixth diurnal tide m6 in some mainly semi diurnal estuaries wang et al 2002 near the coast the effects of the fortnightly tide msf are limited compared with those of the main diurnal and semidiurnal tides while they tend to be more significant in the upstream part of the prd this phenomenon was also observed in many other estuaries buschman et al 2009 jay and flinchem 1997 leblond 1978 sassi et al 2011a b tidal asymmetry in the prd can be related to m2 s2 k1 o1 m4 m6 ms4 msf which are further analyzed here these eight constituents explains altogether over 85 of the total variance of tidal levels at the seaward stations fig 4 shows how the amplitudes of m2 s2 k1 and o1 reduce in the upstream direction and the associated increase of the msf amplitudes the geometric convergence of the huangmao bay and lingding bay leads to a gradual increase in tidal amplitudes towards the end of bay 3 results 3 1 spatial variation of tidal asymmetry 3 1 1 spatial variation of tidal amplitudes and phases focusing on the main diurnal constituents k1 and o1 the ns tide results show that the variations of mean amplitudes averaged over the study period are in the range 0 11 0 37 m and 0 09 0 34 m respectively among the different stations the amplitudes of the main semi diurnal constituents m2 and s2 range between 0 10 and 0 65 m and 0 04 0 24 m respectively the largest amplitudes are found at the stations around the outlets the s2 amplitude is about half the m2 amplitude the overtides and compound tides such as m4 ms4 and m6 are enhanced by the landward shallowing of the bay and narrowing of the outlets and decay further inland due to frictional dampening the peak values of m4 ms4 and m6 amplitudes are 0 048 m 0 036 m and 0 007 m respectively there is a landward increase of the msf amplitude throughout the delta the two largest values of msf amplitudes are observed at sanshui 0 15 m and makou 0 10 m note that the msf tide is insignificant at shilong station based on error estimates the generation of fortnightly tides is partly associated with river discharge tide interactions in the river channels guo et al 2015 the msf tide amplifies up until the most landward point of the study region and may amplify further upstream beyond the most landward stations the tidal form number f is calculated based on the results of harmonic analysis fig 4i the prd is subject to a mixed mainly semi diurnal tidal regime the tidal form number ranges between 1 and 1 5 at all stations the tidal form number increases from the outlets to the upstream parts of the estuary caused by the fact that the damping rate of the diurnal tides is less than that of the semidiurnal tides two main channels are identified within the delta networks which are the western channel makou nanhua zhuyin maliuzhou and the northern channel sanshui zidong sanshan wanqinshaxi for those two channels the along channel variations of the amplitudes and phases of eight tidal constituents are shown in fig 5 the astronomical tides are damped upstream in both the main navigation channels the dominant harmonic m2 is damped more strongly than the other harmonics analyzed here the diurnal tides k1 and o1 are characterized by similar amplitude values and damping rates differences between the amplitudes of m4 and ms4 are small along the two main channels amplification is observed for m4 and ms4 at the entrance of the western channel and the amplitudes of m4 and ms4 decrease at zhuyin where the effect of friction becomes dominant over width convergence wanqinshaxi is located at the end of lingding bay where the effect of channel convergence has become insignificant the m6 amplitude decreases from 0 0047 m to 0 0019 m along the northern channel and from 0 0035 m to 0 0016 m along the western channel tidal phases generally increase with the upstream distance in the two channels and the phase shifts along the channels are larger for tidal constituents with higher frequencies the increasing rates are nearly constant towards the upstream delta for the phases of diurnal tides while the increase of phases of higher harmonics slows down when reaching the upper part of the channels 3 1 2 spatial variation in multiple tidal asymmetries following the analysis of song et al 2011 four combinations of tidal constituents m2 m4 k1 o2 m2 m2 s2 ms4 m2 m4 m6 contributing to tidal asymmetry are chosen to calculate the total tidal skewness in the prd the mean value of tidal skewness is shown in fig 6 for all stations in the larger part of the prd tidal skewness has a positive value indicating a shorter duration of the rising tide than the falling tide the only two stations showing negative values are located at the two most seaward outlets modaomen and jitimen the tidal skewness varies over the prd with higher values in the upstream part and lower values in the downstream part the contributions of four major combinations of tidal constituents to the total tidal skewness along the western channel and northern channel are shown in fig 7 in the downstream and middle parts of the channels the interaction between k1 o1 and m2 contributes most to the total tidal asymmetry at the other stations asymmetry is dominated by m2 m4 the interaction between m2 s2 and ms4 plays a tertiary role and m2 m4 m6 plays a minor role in contributing to total tidal asymmetry due to the relative small amplitude of m6 generally the tidal asymmetry induced by k1 o1 m2 interactions is ebb dominant in the delta indicating that tides are predominantly ebb dominant when entering the distributaries ebb dominant tides are also found in many other tidal systems such as found along the west coast of the continental united states nidzieko 2010 however it is noteworthy that the oceanic tides may also be flood dominant in some estuaries like the yangtze guo et al 2016 which is largely dependent on the geometrical characteristics of the adjacent basin overtides and compound tides partly cancel the duration asymmetry inherent in the astronomical tidal motion in the prd as can be seen from the opposite signs of β k 1 o 1 m 2 β m 2 m 4 and β m 2 s 2 m s 4 at most of the stations the total asymmetry becomes insignificant at stations such as zhuyin thus although the distortion of tides mainly originates from the non linear growth of superharmonics of the principal astronomical tides insignificant tidal asymmetry does not necessarily imply weak shallow water interactions the pre loading of asymmetry inherent to astronomical tides diminishes in the inland part of the delta while m2 m4 asymmetry increases first and then decreases a little with the damping of the m2 and m4 tides as a result the tides entering the prd do not become flood dominant until they have propagated beyond a certain location in the channels fig 8 shows the evolution of tidal skewness along two channels extending from the outlets to the region upstream of the prd between 1961 and 2012 for four main stations along the western channel and four main stations along the northern channel the changes in tidal skewness over time are greatest in the inland parts of the delta tidal skewness continuously decreases at makou and sanshui since the 1970s at these stations abrupt changes occur in the 1980s and 1990s respectively tidal skewness at sanshan shows a similar trend reversal a sharp decrease is observed in the 1990s followed by a slight increase during the 2000s the temporal variations of tidal skewness are larger along the northern channel than along the western channel especially at the sanshui station the average water depth of the cross sectional profiles of sanshui has increased a lot since the mid 1980s liu et al 2018 as a consequence significant temporal variations of the tidal duration asymmetry were observed in response to reduced bottom friction tides become more distorted when propagating along the northern channel than along the western channel which results in larger values of tidal skewness in the northern channel and smaller values in the western channel this can be explained from the fact that the northern channel is located further inland than the western channel and the waterways of the northern channel are smaller and narrower compared with the western channel luo et al 2007 the tidal skewness in the western channel keeps increasing from maliuzhou to makou and the increase is higher at the entrance of the western channel tides entering the western channel are predominantly ebb dominant and gradually develop to become flood dominant when propagating upstream the transition occurs around km 35 50 the switch point of tidal symmetry orientation in the western channel kept moving upstream during the study period no ebb dominant tides were observed along the northern channel except at sanshan in the 1990s 3 2 temporal variation of tidal asymmetry 3 2 1 temporal variations of tidal amplitudes and phases the linear trends of the tidal amplitudes and phases are mapped in fig 9 trends of tidal constituents are large and mainly positive in the upper and middle part of the prd makou sanshui shilong zidong nanhua sanshan except for that of the m6 tide at shilong 0 07 mm yr trends are relatively small at four eastern outlets with magnitudes close to or below zero the m2 amplitude trend is largest at shilong 5 6 mm yr followed by sanshui and zidong with trends of 3 6 mm yr and 3 2 mm yr respectively the tidal phases in most parts of the prd show a decreasing trend indicating that tide propagation is accelerated within the channels in the past decades similar to the trend of tidal amplitudes the decrease of tidal phases is more pronounced in the upper part of the delta and smaller around the outlets 3 2 2 total tidal asymmetry in five different time periods fig 10 shows the decadal variation of tidal skewness in the prd in the period 1961 2012 in the course of the 1990s and 2000s tidal skewness in most parts of the prd has decreased indicating that the tidal asymmetry has reduced the changes in tidal asymmetry are greatest in the upper parts of the prd around makou and sanshui compared to the 1980s tidal skewness at the upstream stations makou sanshui shilong decreased by 50 on average in the 2000s in the middle part of the delta zidong nanhua sanshan the tidal skewness clearly decreased in the 1990s but increased slightly in the 2000s the trends of tidal asymmetry are not the same for the eight outlets no significant decadal trends were observed at huangjin xipaotai and maliuzhou the continuous water level measurements at guanchong begins in 2000 hence only the mean tidal skewness in the 2000s is obtained with a positive value an increase in tidal skewness occurred around the four eastern outlets wanqinshaxi henmen sanshakou nansha at the beginning of the record this was followed by a sharp decrease in tidal skewness in the 1990s and 2000s more specifically tidal skewness decreased to become close to or below zero at sanshakou wanqinshaxi and henmen in the 2000s the sharp decrease in tidal skewness between the 1990s and 2000s may be attributed to the increase in water depth in response to engineering works during that time 3 2 3 linear trends of the total tidal skewness metric the annual based tidal skewness shows a decreasing trend over the study area for the majority of the stations 13 of 15 stations of these 12 stations show a statistically significant decreasing trend at a 95 confidence level the remaining two stations show an increasing annual tidal skewness trend but only one is statistically significant fig 11 shows the location of hydrological stations with decreasing and increasing trends of tidal skewness although a decreasing trend is observed to occur for the larger part of the study region the largest decreasing trends are observed in the upper regions with an average value of 0 0088 yr 1 3 2 4 change points of total tidal asymmetry time series of annual tidal skewness are analyzed to detect abrupt changes in the entire data record fig 12 it is found that 14 of the 15 hydrological stations exhibited a significant abrupt change in yearly mean tidal skewness the change points occur in the 1980s and 1990s severe human interference like sand mining and dredging during that time caused significant changes in the bathymetry of the delta zhang et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 reducing frictional attenuation of the tides in the system and modulating the generation of shallow water tides extreme values of oceanic tidal amplitudes occurred around 1988 due to the influence of the 18 61 year nodal cycle torres and tsimplis 2011 feng et al 2015 but the nodal cycles of tides become insignificant in delta channel network hydrodynamics due to the impact of many confounding factors such as river discharge and bathymetry matte et al 2013 hence the influence of the 18 61 year nodal cycle is not further discussed in the paper 3 3 the effect of discharge on tides and tidal asymmetry 3 3 1 sensitivity of tidal asymmetry to river discharge the tidal data during the period 2001 2012 is taken as an example to investigate the influence of river discharge on the tidal asymmetry along the western channel and northern channel the mean tidal skewness metrics γ m 2 s 2 m s 4 γ m 2 m 4 γ k 1 o 1 m 2 at the stations along the two channels are shown in fig 13 for the 1 0 1 25 1 5 1 75 2 quantiles of observed discharge series modeled by ns tide the region is divided into the tidal regime and the fluvial regime at a certain point the sensitivity of tidal asymmetry to river discharge is large in the upstream region of the delta system the fluvial regime while it decreases towards the seaward stations the tidal regime river discharge is the main contributor to friction and attenuates the tides significantly in the upstream parts of a delta system godin 1991 1999 godin and martínez 1994 as is shown in fig 13 tides become more symmetrical at the upstream stations when the discharge increases however this correlation becomes poor in the middle part of the delta and reverses at the seaside stations this phenomenon indicates that the energy transfer from principal bands to subtidal bands is amplified due to increasing magnitude of discharge in the tidal regime downstream of the system the overall damping of all tidal bands in the fluvial regime directly contributes to the weakening of the tidal asymmetry there in both the western channel and the northern channel the tidal asymmetry induced by interactions between m2 and m4 increases with increasing discharges in the downward stations while reduction occurs upstream of the channels the ebb dominant tidal asymmetry generated by the k1 o1 m2 triad is slightly enhanced with increasing discharges at the downstream part of the western channel maliuzhou and zhuyin and starts to attenuate with increased river discharge when reaching a location in the middle part of the channel since the northern channel is located more inland the k1 o1 m2 asymmetry in the northern channel is constantly reduced with increasing discharges the m2 s2 ms4 asymmetry is less sensitive to discharge variations compared with the other two kinds of asymmetries reduction of the m2 s2 ms4 asymmetry is observed at both the upstream and the downstream parts of the channel 3 3 2 the influence of changes in divided flow ratio dfr river flows from the west river and the north river are mixed at the junction and enter the delta through makou and sanshui see fig 1 a large amount of river water enters the western channel via makou and the rest enters the northern channel through sanshui the share of the flow towards makou was around 85 in the 1980s and has decreased to 79 in the 2000s caused by extensive sand excavation in the upper region that significantly deepened the bed profiles of the northern channel luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 liu et al 2018 changes of the dfr within the river channels have resulted in redistribution of river flows in the river channel network of the delta system the increased river discharge at sanshui is supposed to attenuate the astronomical tides which is inconsistent to the detected increasing trends of astronomical tidal amplitudes in the upstream parts of the delta see fig 9 this suggests that the impact of increased channel depth has overwhelmed the effect of redistribution of river discharges through the channel network of the prd 4 discussion 4 1 preloading of tidal asymmetry in other deltas in the world tidal asymmetry in a delta system is the outcome of a balance between the direct contribution of astronomical tides and the processes associated with shallow water interactions hoitink et al 2003 classified the tidal regimes of the world based on the tidal form number see fig 8 in their paper and a global map of tidal skewness was plotted by song et al 2011 according to the plots of song et al 2011 and hoitink et al 2003 preloading of tidal asymmetry induced by astronomical tides is commonly observed along coasts and in deltas the preloading of tidal asymmetry tends to be ebb dominant in most diurnal and mixed semidiurnal diurnal regimes in the outer sea when tides propagate towards the inlets of a delta the continental shelf characteristics modify the deep water tidal asymmetry since different tidal constituents respond differently to basin geometry and bottom friction godin and martínez 1994 examples can be found from the south china sea the gulf of mexico and caribbean sea according to the plots of hoitink et al 2003 and song et al 2011 where the preloading of strong ebb dominant tidal asymmetry is found at the diurnal and mixed semidiurnal diurnal regimes with tidal form numbers above 1 5 in the particular case of the pearl delta tides in the south china sea and the adjacent ocean have a shorter duration of the falling tide than the rising tide similar characteristics are observed in many other deltas around the world the mixed mainly semidiurnal tides along the west coast of the continental united states also result in the preloading of ebb dominant tidal asymmetry governing asymmetry metrics at the inlets of the three estuaries analyzed by nidzieko 2010 the tidal regime in the mahakam delta is mixed mainly semidiurnal sassi et al 2012 and the preloading of tidal asymmetry is weakly ebb dominant there on the contrary in the yangtze river estuary the tide is characterized by the semidiurnal tidal motion at the mouth of the estuary with a tidal form number of 0 24 and the tidal asymmetry inherent in astronomical tides is found to be flood dominant guo et al 2016 4 2 impact of tidal asymmetry and river tide interaction on sediment transport the interaction between tides and river discharge is a prominent process influencing morphodynamic developments the importance of tidal asymmetry in the tide averaged sediment transport in delta systems is well recognized parker 1991 friedrichs and aubrey 1988 during low flow periods the effect of tidal asymmetry plays a key role in the residual transport of sediment hoitink et al 2017 when the river discharge increases tidal asymmetry will be attenuated in the upper parts of the tidal system fig 13 and the sediment transport induced by river discharge typically directed seaward will become dominant the amazon estuary has the largest river runoff among all the estuaries milliman and farnsworth 2013 but is classified as macrotidal and therefore tides may still play a significant role in morphodynamic developments for most tidal systems such as the pearl river delta and the mahakam delta the land ocean interface can basically be separated into parts where the morphological development is mainly driven by tidal asymmetry and parts where the river discharge is dominant unfortunately the duration asymmetry analyzed here cannot easily be translated to flow velocity asymmetry which is more directly related to residual sediment transport only in short tidal inlets tidal elevation and velocity may expected to be in quadrature nidzieko 2010 gong et al 2016 in channel networks such as in the pearl delta the relation between duration asymmetry and tidal velocity asymmetry is expected to be complex it will require a numerical model to establish the details about how the changes in sources of tidal duration asymmetry will translate to regime changes in residual sediment transport and in turn in gradients in residual sediment transport leading to erosion or deposition 4 3 sand mining and dredging for shipping large scale dredging and sand excavation in the prd have caused significant geometrical changes with a down cutting depth ranging from 0 34 m to 6 48 m luo et al 2007 the alteration of the sediment regime of the pearl river has also contributed to the morphological changes in the prd liu et al 2018 existence of a deep channel can result in a decrease of the positive tendency of tidal duration asymmetry in the prd gong et al 2016 the bottom friction is reduced as the water depth increases which will reduce the energy dissipation due to friction and slow down the tidal attenuation along channels guo et al 2016 since the growth of higher harmonics and the attenuation of principle tides are the main contributors to the generation of tidal duration asymmetry within the delta the flood dominance within the delta has therefore reduced in the past decades fig 11 in addition to sand mining and dredging for shipping damming and reservoir constructions in the drainage basin of the prd have reduced the upper sediment supply significantly since the 1990s luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 liu et al 2018 the reduction of sediment supply along with the effect of sediment transport induced by tidal asymmetry and river discharge may contribute to river channel erosion in the delta system 4 4 the impact of tidal attenuation and phase shift on tidal asymmetry changes in tidal asymmetry within tidal systems are governed by developments of tidal amplitudes and phases sensitivity analysis can help to predict the responses of tidal skewness to the attenuation of tides considering that the tidal amplitudes are of different magnitudes a non dimensional relative sensitivity coefficient beven 1979 gong et al 2006 coleman and decoursey 1976 rana and katerji 1998 qiu et al 1998 hupet and vanclooster 2001 is employed to predict responses of tidal skewness generated by different tidal combinations to perturbations of corresponding amplitudes of constituents the expression of the non dimensional relative sensitivity coefficient is expressed as 9 s x lim δ x 0 δ γ γ δ x x γ x x γ where s x is a relative sensitivity coefficient rsc γ is tidal skewness and x is amplitude of a tidal constituent typically a positive negative rsc means that the tidal skewness γ will increase decrease as the variable x increases for example a sensitivity coefficient of 0 1 for a tidal amplitude x means that a 10 increase of the tidal amplitude x will increase the tidal skewness γ by 1 the tidal asymmetry is enhanced reduced with an increase in the variable x when the rsc is positive negative respectively a larger absolute value of the rsc is correlated with a larger effect of the variable x on tidal asymmetry annual rscs are determined for amplitudes of each tidal constituents contributing to the tidal skewness γ k 1 o 1 m 2 γ m 2 m 4 γ m 2 s 2 m s 4 the averaged rscs relative to amplitudes are illustrated in fig 14 results show that the rscs for amplitude variables contributing to γ k 1 o 1 m 2 γ m 2 m 4 and γ m 2 s 2 m s 4 remain stable across the basin the rscs for the m2 amplitude are negative for the three kinds of tidal skewness studied here indicating that the tidal asymmetry inherent in astronomical tides as well as the asymmetry generated by nonlinearities within the prd are consistently enhanced by the attenuation of the m2 amplitude although the astronomical tides are attenuated along the river channels the effects of their damping on tidal asymmetry are not necessarily the same in the case of the prd the k1 o1 m2 asymmetry is enhanced by the decrease of the m2 amplitude while being reduced by the decrease of the k1 and o1 amplitudes despite the fact that the m2 tide is dominant in the prd and the damping rate of semidiurnal tides is faster than that of diurnal tides the reduction of the m2 amplitude does not lead to an increase in the k1 o1 m2 asymmetry on the contrary the k1 o1 m2 asymmetry is significantly reduced towards the upstream parts of the delta fig 7 where the decrease of tidal amplitudes slows down fig 5 one possible reason is the impact of a phase shift as is discussed later for the tidal asymmetry induced by nonlinearities fig 14b and c γ m 2 m 4 increases with the increase of the m4 amplitude and decreases with the increase of the m2 amplitude which is in accordance with the ratio of constituent amplitudes m4 m2 traditionally used to quantify the degree of tidal distortion it indicates that the tidal asymmetry generated by the combination m2 m4 is enhanced by the attenuation of m2 tide and the growth of the harmonic tide m4 this phenomenon is commonly observed in many tidal systems such as the amazon estuary gallo and vinzon 2005 the yangtze estuary lu et al 2015 and the st lawrence fluvial estuary godin 1999 matte et al 2014 a positive correlation between the s2 amplitude and γ m 2 s 2 m s 4 as well as between ms4 and γ m 2 s 2 m s 4 are observed the summation of rscs for amplitude variables affecting tidal skewness is equal to zero and the following expression can be obtained 10 s k 1 s o 1 s m 2 0 for γ k 1 o 1 m 2 or 11 s m 2 s m 4 0 for γ m 2 m 4 or 12 s m 2 s s 2 s m s 4 0 for γ m 2 s 2 m s 4 where s abbreviates relative sensitivity coefficient rsc and x is the amplitude variable in the tidal skewness this indicates that the signs of rscs for amplitude variables within the tidal skewness are not consistent with at least one positive negative sign of the rsc opposite to the others two amplitude variables a1 a2 with opposite sign of rsc should meet the condition 13 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 0 for pairs or 14 a 3 2 ω 3 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 3 2 ω 3 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 0 for triads these metrics derived above are applicable to any tidal regime and can help to evaluate the interaction between tidal asymmetry and tidal attenuation in tidal systems with a short length scale such as the three california estuaries analysed by nidzieko 2010 the effect of phase shift on tidal asymmetry is limited compared with that of tidal attenuation however for tidal basins spanning hundreds of kilometers such as the st lawrence fluvial estuary matte et al 2014 the amazon estuary gallo and vinzon 2005 and the yangtze estuary guo et al 2016 the phase difference may experience quite obvious modulations in the upstream regions under the influence of discharge dynamics the equal phase difference relationship which is reported by speer et al 1991 and well confirmed in the yangtze estuary guo et al 2016 is also observed in the prd fig 15 it implies that different tidal asymmetries arising from nonlinearities have the same orientation fig 15 shows that the phase difference of astronomical tides experiences larger modulations within the prd than that of the other tidal combinations the largest variation occurs in the upper part of the delta this explains why the k1 o1 m2 asymmetry is significantly reduced in the upstream regions of the prd similar trends were also found in the yangtze estuary where the phase difference of k1 o1 m2 increased significantly upon reaching a location in the upstream part of the estuary guo et al 2016 this indicates that the attenuation of astronomical tidal asymmetry in the upper part of tidal systems is mainly driven by the phase development of astronomical tides 5 conclusions this study introduces an approach to examine the spatial temporal variations of tides and tidal asymmetry in deltas taking the pearl river delta in the period 1961 2012 as an example the asymmetry in the rise and fall duration of water levels is quantified by tidal skewness and the contribution of different combinations of tidal constituents to total tidal asymmetry is evaluated the interaction between delta morphology and tidal asymmetry as well as the effect of river discharge on tides and tidal asymmetry is evaluated a relative sensitive coefficient is introduced to generically investigate the impact of tidal attenuation on tidal asymmetry the main findings are obtained as follows 1 despite the ebb dominant tide at the two outlets most parts of the pearl river delta are flood dominant indicating that the duration of the rising tide is shorter than the falling tide tides become more asymmetric in the upstream parts of the delta under the substantial effect of nonlinear interactions we find that the interaction between k1 o1 and m2 contributes most to the total tidal asymmetry in the lower part and middle parts of the prd while m2 m4 interaction is dominant in the upper part m2 s2 ms4 triad interaction plays the tertiary role and the role of m2 m4 m6 is minor these observations indicate that the tidal asymmetry within deltas is strongly modulated by astronomical tides especially at the mouth of a delta 2 tidal asymmetry in delta systems is a balance of the preloading of tidal asymmetry inherent in astronomical tides and the tidal asymmetry induced through the processes of shallow water interactions the pre loading of tidal asymmetry induced by astronomical tides is progressively attenuated with distance from the tidal inlet while the tidal asymmetry generated by nonlinear interactions is enhanced along the channels until it peaks in the middle or upper part of the delta insignificant tidal asymmetry is not necessarily linked to weak shallow water interactions the preloading of tidal asymmetry is likely to be ebb dominant when the tidal regime is diurnal or mixed semidiurnal diurnal 3 the effect of river discharge on attenuating tidal asymmetry may be particularly large in the upstream parts of a delta system in the downstream reaches the increase in river discharges may accelerate the energy transfer from principal frequency bands to superharmonic frequency bands explaining amplification of shallow water tides and attenuation of astronomical tides as a result the tidal asymmetry inherent in astronomical tides is enhanced at seaward stations with increasing river discharges and a reversed pattern is found at the upper part of the delta 4 according to the theory of friedrichs and aubrey 1988 tides are more distorted and more asymmetric with a larger amplitude ratio m4 m2 our work extends this theory to multiple tidal asymmetries by means of a sensitivity analysis positive negative correlations between tidal amplitudes and tidal skewness are determined for each amplitude variable contributing to tidal skewness the relative sensitivity coefficients offer insight in the effect of tidal amplitude variations on multiple tidal asymmetries within delta systems while the damping rate of tides slows down with distance from the inlet the phase shift becomes dominant in controlling the variation of k1 o1 m2 asymmetry in the upstream parts of a tide influenced delta the results presented here only considered the contribution of four main tidal combinations to total tidal asymmetry however the dominant tidal constituents may vary in other delta systems therefore for future research including all the significant tidal constituents is recommended numerical models can be established to help evaluate the relationship between the tidal duration asymmetry and flow velocity asymmetry under different delta morphologies since flow velocity asymmetry is more directly related with the sediment transport in deltas and estuaries than water levels acknowledgments this work was jointly supported by

008 thanks should be extended to the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their invaluable and constructive suggestions which greatly improved the quality of this paper appendix a to convert the high water low water data to continuous data at a one hour interval a trigonometric interpolation method is adopted a brief summary of this method is presented in this appendix the tidal heights h during a sampling interval are modeled as a 1 h t h 1 h 2 2 sin π 2 t t1 t 2 t 1 0 5 q h1 h2 2 where t is time t 1 is start time t2 is end time h 1 is tidal height at t t 1 and h 2 is tidal height at t t 2 the coefficient q is defined as a 2 q 1 h 1 h 2 0 h 1 h 2 the agreement of water levels at sanshui station in 2007 observed at a one hour interval and corresponding values interpolated from the high water low water data is shown in fig a1 the root mean square error rmse and pearson correlation coefficient r are calculated to evaluate the performance of the interpolation method results show that the interpolated water levels are in line with the observed ones with r 0 9959 and the rmse takes a value of 0 067 m suggesting that the errors are negligible moreover we measure the skill of the interpolation method by the ratio γ 2 thompson et al 2003 which is defined as a 3 γ 2 i 1 n h o b s i h int i 2 i 1 n h o b s i hobs 2 where hobs is water levels observed at a one hour interval h int is water levels interpolated from the high water low water data generally small values of γ 2 indicate a high skill of the model the value of γ 2 is 0 0085 at sanshui station which is lower than the lowest values obtained by thompson et al 2003 for their predicting model 0 18 the power spectra of observed and interpolated water levels are compared in fig a2 the low frequency bands and shallow tides are prominent as sanshui is one of the most landward stations it can be seen from fig a2 that the two frequency structures are nearly the same in the low frequency bands the basic tides derived from interpolated water levels are in good agreement with those derived from observed water levels although the power spectra of high frequency bands d8 and higher are not well predicted the effect is negligible for the purpose of the present study appendix b the skewness γ 3 created by combination of three constituents is calculated from eq 5 the partial derivative of the skewness γ 3 is obtained

7087,tidal asymmetry in deltas is caused by both the intrinsic asymmetry resulting from the combination of astronomical tides and by nonlinear tidal interactions that occur in shallow water the relative importance of these sources of tidal asymmetry in delta channel networks have remained poorly studied partly due to the limitations of classical harmonic analysis ha in hindcasting nonstationary tides the pearl river delta prd is a multichannel system with rapidly changing bathymetry subject to severe human interventions this work applies a nonstationary harmonic model ns tide to hydrological data from 15 stations in the prd spanning the period 1961 2012 the spatiotemporal variation of multiple sources of tidal asymmetry is quantified by a skewness metric revealing how similar or dissimilar the development of alternative sources of tidal asymmetry develop in the delta subject to study a relative sensitivity coefficient rsc is introduced to decompose the contribution of tidal amplitude variations to multiple tidal asymmetries analytical results show the development of tides becoming gradually more asymmetric as they propagate into delta channel networks and how this depends on the river flow variation in the orientation of tidal asymmetries induced by different combinations of tidal constituents leads to a complex pattern of the overall tidal asymmetry in the prd our results show that tidal asymmetry in deltas can be significantly dependent on the river flow keywords tidal asymmetry nonstationary tides river flow deltas 1 introduction 1 1 tidal asymmetry tidal asymmetry refers to a periodic difference between the falling and rising tidal periods boon and byrne 1981 speer et al 1991 specifically a shorter duration of the rising tide indicates a flood dominant tidal asymmetry and a shorter duration of falling tide indicates an ebb dominant tidal asymmetry speer and aubrey 1985 friedrichs and aubrey 1988 in a semidiurnal tidal regime tidal form number f ak1 ao1 am2 as2 0 25 where a denotes amplitude the occurrence of tidal asymmetry is mainly associated with the interaction between the m2 tide and its first harmonic the shallow water constituent m4 speer and aubrey 1985 friedrichs and aubrey 1988 van de kreeke and robaczewska 1993 it is common practice to characterize the degree of distortion and the nature of tidal asymmetry by the amplitude ratio m4 m2 and relative phase 2m2 m4 friedrichs and aubrey 1988 savenije and veling 2005 lu et al 2015 thus the generation of m4 is considered the main source of asymmetry in a number of studies asymmetry in the tidal motion can also be produced through the generation of compound overtides parker 1991 wang et al 1999 and even in absence of shallow water tides there is asymmetry inherent in the astronomical tides hoitink et al 2003 nidzieko 2010 song et al 2011 in particular in semidiurnal regimes the combination of m2 tide with the compound tide ms4 and 2ms6 m2 s2 m4 ms4 m2 s2 m4 2ms6 can produce asymmetrical tides byun and cho 2006 in mixed or diurnal regimes where the k1 and o1 tides are stronger than the m2 tide the interaction of astronomical diurnal and semidiurnal tides may be the main source of tidal asymmetry primarily through the combination of k1 o1 and m2 tides ranasinghe and pattiaratchi 2000 hoitink et al 2003 2006 woodworth et al 2005 any combination of tidal constituents with angular frequencies ω1 ω2 and ω3 pairs or triads that satisfy either the frequency relationship 2 ω 1 ω 2 or ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 can contribute to tidal asymmetry the contribution of different combinations of constituents to the overall asymmetry in the rise and fall of water levels can be conveniently quantified adopting a skewness based approach which was proposed by nidzieko 2010 and extended by song et al 2011 by quantifying skewness in the probability density function pdf of water levels from 335 hydrological stations around the world song et al 2011 obtained a global view on the sources of tidal asymmetry the latter analysis only addresses coastal and ocean stations the spatial evolution of skewness in water level pdfs for delta channel networks where significant nonlinear tidal interactions occurs has rarely been discussed 1 2 evolution of tidal asymmetry and related morphological development analysis of the historical evolution of tides can reveal natural and human induced changes in tidal river dynamics hoitink and jay 2016 and morphological evolution hoitink et al 2017 wang et al 2002 numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship between tidal asymmetry and morphological development postma 1961 pingree and maddock 1978 friedrichs and aubrey 1988 van de kreeke and robaczewska 1993 van de kreeke et al 1997 van der molen 2000 lanzoni and seminara 2002 wang et al 2002 bolle et al 2010 guo et al 2016 tidal asymmetry is one of the factors generating residual sediment transport controlling the formation of shoals and tidal flats speer and aubrey 1985 fry and aubrey 1990 moore et al 2009 brown and davies 2010 flood dominant tides generally produce a residual landward sediment transport and ebb dominant tides are associated with sediment export dronkers 1986 van de kreeke and dunsbergen 2000 changes in morphology may in turn alter the tidal asymmetry significantly especially under severe human interventions e g dredging sand extraction dam construction bolle et al 2010 vellinga et al 2014 shallow inlet systems tend to be flood dominant an increase in channel depth may lead to a reduction of the flood dominant type of asymmetry while the presence of large inter tidal basin storage is found to enhance flood dominance dronkers 1986 lanzoni and seminara 1998 wang et al 2002 it is difficult to investigate the temporal evolution of tidal asymmetry in deltas in response to changes of morphology too short a length of record and too long a sampling interval of a tidal record subject to a harmonic analysis limit the degree in which the obtained amplitudes and phases adequately capture tidal asymmetry in nonstationary tidal systems such as deltas the problem is further complicated by the need to obtain the time series of fluvial processes e g river discharge bolle et al 2010 examined the evolution of tidal asymmetry in the western scheldt estuary expressed by amplitude ratios and phase differences between 1970 and 2002 and related the established changes to the deepening of the river channels the work of bolle et al 2010 only considered the m2 m4 and m6 tides ignoring the contributions of other tidal combinations to the total asymmetry of the water level pdf guo et al 2016 used a 1 d model to explore alternative types of tidal interactions inducing tidal asymmetry in an estuary but mainly focused on the morphodynamic impacts of multiple tidal asymmetries the responses of multiple tidal asymmetries to varying river discharge in delta channel networks has remained virtually unstudied 1 3 harmonic analysis for nonstationary tides classical harmonic analysis ha is traditionally used to analyze oceanic tides in seas and coastal shelves however the ha method based on the assumption that the tides are stationary and independent of other forcings darwin 1892 doodson 1921 flinchem and jay 2000 usually fails to predict river tides as the stationary assumption is not fulfilled due to nonstationary interactions of tides with channel geometry bottom friction and river flow river tides do not respond simply to astronomical forcing and in a complex channel network may exhibit a degree of chaos maas and doelman 2002 although short term ha can be applied to resolve major tidal constituents guo et al 2015 it is inappropriate for the analysis of river tides when the river discharge variability is high in recent decades substantial research efforts have been devoted to analyzing nonstationary tides the continuous wavelet transforms cwt is found to be more accurate than ha and can resolve nontidal variations which made it an effective tool in analysis of nonstationary records a major limitation of cwt is that it is unable to distinguish between tidal constituents within a tidal species when tidal fluvial interactions are strong jay and kukulka 2003 matte et al 2013 modified t tide pawlowicz et al 2002 and proposed a harmonic model adapted to nonstationary tides ns tide which builds nonstationary forcing directly into the tidal basis functions the utility of ns tide has been demonstrated by applying it to the columbia river estuary matte et al 2013 and the st lawrence fluvial estuary matte et al 2014 where the oceanic tides are strongly modified by the river flow results showed that ns tide can represent tidal fluvial dynamics much better than ha especially in the upper parts of tidal rivers recently cai et al 2018 applied ns tide to water levels for an entire channel network to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of river tide dynamics demonstrating that complex channel networks can be synoptically analyzed using this method cai et al 2018 mainly focused on the contributions of river tide dynamics on the changes in the residual water level in the pearl river channel networks here we apply ns tide again to the pearl river delta to shed light on the spatial variation of tidal asymmetry resulting from tidal fluvial dynamics in its distributary delta channels 1 4 aim and methodology the purpose of this paper is to establish and understand the spatiotemporal variation in tidal asymmetry in a delta channel network in terms of pairs and triads of tidal constituents contributing to the overall asymmetry specifically we examine 1 the spatiotemporal variation of tidal asymmetries induced by dominant combinations of

and methods 2 1 the pearl river delta the pearl river delta prd is located at the south part of china it is bell shaped with a catchment area of approximately 17 200 km2 zhang et al 2009 the pearl river is the third largest river in china debouching in a multichannel delta system with many bifurcations and intersections the three largest tributaries of the pearl river are the west river the north river and the east river river runoff from the pearl river flows into the south china sea scs through eight outlets fig 1 the complicated channel network renders the tidal fluvial processes in the prd very distinct the complex geometry and morphology of the prd are a result of both natural processes and human activities including dredging and sand mining the associated deepening of channels causes the tidal limit to move landward the mean river discharges of the west river the north river and the east river are 7124 m3 s 1465 m3 s 719 m3 s respectively feeding the delta that is subject to a micro tidal regime at its coastal boundary the tidal range is 1 0 1 2 m near the westernmost outlets and 1 0 1 5 m near the eastern outlets tides are mixed mainly semidiurnal in the prd the tidal form number f ranges from 1 to 1 5 and increases upstream m2 is the dominant tidal constituent followed by k1 o1 and s2 due to the combined effects of river flow channel geometry and bottom friction tides in the prd are distorted as they propagate upstream 2 2 data overview water level data were collected from the hydrological yearbooks of the people s republic of china the earliest continuous water level measurements in the prd date back to the 1900s long term time series of water levels were obtained for 15 stations spanning the river networks and the outlets in the prd these hydrological stations are denoted by black circles in fig 1 the record lengths of different stations are shown in table 1 the older data series contained two high and two low water levels occurring each 24 84 hr day data at each station have been quality controlled through visual checks in order to identify values with spurious jumps and glitches outliers were removed after the quality check the water level data were trigonometrically interpolated to 1 hour intervals for harmonic analysis appendix a daily mean river discharges for 3 hydrological stations are used for the analysis which are makou 1961 2012 sanshui 1961 2012 and boluo 1985 2012 time series of monthly mean discharges at makou sanshui and boluo are shown in fig 2 maximum and minimum discharges at makou in the period between 1961 and 2012 are 29530 m3 s 1968 07 and 1205 m3 s 1993 02 respectively which are high values compared with the extremes at boluo which amount to 3093 m3 s 2006 06 and 168 m3 s 2004 11 respectively the corresponding discharge time series of each station are listed in table 2 2 3 methods 2 3 1 harmonic analysis t tide models the tidal heights ζ as 1 ζ t f 0 0 i 1 n f 1 i cos ω i t f 2 i sin ω i t where t is time ω i is frequency of an individual tidal constituent and f 0 0 f 1 i and f 2 i are unknown coefficients to be determined by regression analysis using observations ns tide is a method developed by modifying t tide the nonstationary forcing by the river discharge and ocean tidal range is directly built into the tidal basis functions according to the theoretical analysis of kukulka and jay 2003a 2003b the polynomials f 0 0 f 1 i and f 2 i are modeled as 2 f l i p 0 l i p 1 l i q c l t p 2 l i r d l t q e l t where q is river flow r is greater diurnal tidal range at the most seaward station calculated as the difference between higher high water and lower low water p 0 l i p 1 l i p 2 l i are the model coefficients for each station and frequency c d and e are the exponents for each station and frequency band l is the index for coefficients l 0 1 2 i is the index for tidal constituents i 1 n the coefficients in these polynomials are determined by a robust regression leffler and jay 2009 to account for the distance between the stations at which the q and r time series are measured and the stations where the analysis is performed a constant time lag of the q and r variables is used to represent the time of propagation of the waves to the station table 2 the total tidal height ζ t is then as follows 3 ζ t p 0 0 0 p 1 0 0 q c s t t q p 2 0 0 r d s t t r q e s t t q i 1 n p 0 1 i p 1 1 i q c f t t q p 2 1 i r d f t t r q e f t t q cos ω i t p 0 2 i p 1 2 i q c f t t q p 2 2 i r d f t t r q e f t t q sin ω i t where t r and t q are the time lags applied to the q and r time series the time lags are obtained by calculating the mean maximum correlation between q or r and the observations of water levels the subscripts s and f denote the stage and tidal fluvial models respectively cs ds es cf df and ef are determined using an iterative procedure the non stationary harmonic analysis is performed on windows of one year to approximate the tidal constituents at 15 hydrological stations the main reason for using a one year windows is to assess the sub annual impact of changes in channel geometries the water level time series of some floodplain stations are discontinuous for which the analysis period is shortened some stations show data gaps up to more than one year like wanqinshaxi 2 yr and xipaotai 5 yr these gaps in time series of the annual mean tidal properties are interpolated using polynomials in fig 3 a comparison of results is shown obtained from t tide and ns tide at nanhua and zidong for the analysis period of 2010 the model prediction of ns tide fits well with the observed data during the flood season while the inability of t tide to resolve the nonstationary forcing is manifest as well after the coefficients in eq 2 are determined by a robust regression the tidal amplitudes and phases can be predicted under different quantiles of river flows this way the effect of river discharge on tides and tidal asymmetry can be investigated 2 3 2 tidal skewness following the methods of nidzieko 2010 and song et al 2011 we use tidal skewness instead of the relative phase and amplitude ratio friedrichs and aubrey 1988 to quantify the tidal asymmetry this method can capture the amplitude and phase information of tidal constituents in one metric another advantage of this method is that it can consider different combinations of tidal constituents contributing to the overall tidal asymmetry the skewness created by combination of two or three constituents is obtained as 4 γ 2 3 4 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 ω 2 sin 2 φ 1 φ 2 1 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 3 2 for pairs or 5 γ 3 3 2 a 1 ω 1 a 2 ω 2 a 3 ω 3 sin φ 1 φ 2 φ 3 1 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 a 3 2 ω 3 2 3 2 for triads where a1 a2 and a3 is tidal amplitude φ 1 φ 2 and φ 3 is tidal phase ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 is frequency of tidal constituent the contribution to total tidal skewness by different pairs or triad combinations of tidal constituents is obtained as 6 β 2 γ 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 i 1 n a i 2 ω i 2 3 2 for pairs and 7 β 3 γ 3 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 a 3 2 ω 3 2 i 1 n a i 2 ω i 2 3 2 for triplets the total tidal skewness γ n in the pearl river delta is obtained by 8 γ n β 2 β 3 generally the rising tide duration is shorter than the falling tide for γ n 0 and the falling tide duration is shorter for γ n 0 2 3 3 mann kendall and pettitt test historical analysis of tides can reveal natural and anthropogenic trends in tidal river dynamics and possible regime changes hoitink and jay 2016 in order to evaluate the temporal variations of tidal properties in the prd in response to human activities the linear trends of tidal harmonics and tidal skewness metrics are quantified through a linear regression method the mann kendall mk test is applied to evaluate the statistical significance of these trends the modified pre whitening procedure von storch 1999 kulkarni and von storch 1995 yue and wang 2002 zhang et al 2010 is employed before the mk test is applied to limit the influence of serial correlation since the human interventions took place in a short period sudden changes in the channel geometry due to uncontrolled sand excavations can result in abrupt changes in tidal properties the pettitt test pettitt 1979 is a nonparametric test that can be used to evaluate the occurrence of abrupt changes in a time series here the pettitt test is applied to identify abrupt changes in time series of tidal amplitudes and tidal skewness 2 3 4 choice of tidal constituents included in the analysis m2 is the dominant tidal constituent in the prd followed by k1 o1 and s2 mao et al 2004 wong et al 2003 m4 is the first harmonic of m2 and dominates the non linear signature of many estuaries friedrichs and aubrey 1988 the tidal asymmetry can also be affected by the sixth diurnal tide m6 in some mainly semi diurnal estuaries wang et al 2002 near the coast the effects of the fortnightly tide msf are limited compared with those of the main diurnal and semidiurnal tides while they tend to be more significant in the upstream part of the prd this phenomenon was also observed in many other estuaries buschman et al 2009 jay and flinchem 1997 leblond 1978 sassi et al 2011a b tidal asymmetry in the prd can be related to m2 s2 k1 o1 m4 m6 ms4 msf which are further analyzed here these eight constituents explains altogether over 85 of the total variance of tidal levels at the seaward stations fig 4 shows how the amplitudes of m2 s2 k1 and o1 reduce in the upstream direction and the associated increase of the msf amplitudes the geometric convergence of the huangmao bay and lingding bay leads to a gradual increase in tidal amplitudes towards the end of bay 3 results 3 1 spatial variation of tidal asymmetry 3 1 1 spatial variation of tidal amplitudes and phases focusing on the main diurnal constituents k1 and o1 the ns tide results show that the variations of mean amplitudes averaged over the study period are in the range 0 11 0 37 m and 0 09 0 34 m respectively among the different stations the amplitudes of the main semi diurnal constituents m2 and s2 range between 0 10 and 0 65 m and 0 04 0 24 m respectively the largest amplitudes are found at the stations around the outlets the s2 amplitude is about half the m2 amplitude the overtides and compound tides such as m4 ms4 and m6 are enhanced by the landward shallowing of the bay and narrowing of the outlets and decay further inland due to frictional dampening the peak values of m4 ms4 and m6 amplitudes are 0 048 m 0 036 m and 0 007 m respectively there is a landward increase of the msf amplitude throughout the delta the two largest values of msf amplitudes are observed at sanshui 0 15 m and makou 0 10 m note that the msf tide is insignificant at shilong station based on error estimates the generation of fortnightly tides is partly associated with river discharge tide interactions in the river channels guo et al 2015 the msf tide amplifies up until the most landward point of the study region and may amplify further upstream beyond the most landward stations the tidal form number f is calculated based on the results of harmonic analysis fig 4i the prd is subject to a mixed mainly semi diurnal tidal regime the tidal form number ranges between 1 and 1 5 at all stations the tidal form number increases from the outlets to the upstream parts of the estuary caused by the fact that the damping rate of the diurnal tides is less than that of the semidiurnal tides two main channels are identified within the delta networks which are the western channel makou nanhua zhuyin maliuzhou and the northern channel sanshui zidong sanshan wanqinshaxi for those two channels the along channel variations of the amplitudes and phases of eight tidal constituents are shown in fig 5 the astronomical tides are damped upstream in both the main navigation channels the dominant harmonic m2 is damped more strongly than the other harmonics analyzed here the diurnal tides k1 and o1 are characterized by similar amplitude values and damping rates differences between the amplitudes of m4 and ms4 are small along the two main channels amplification is observed for m4 and ms4 at the entrance of the western channel and the amplitudes of m4 and ms4 decrease at zhuyin where the effect of friction becomes dominant over width convergence wanqinshaxi is located at the end of lingding bay where the effect of channel convergence has become insignificant the m6 amplitude decreases from 0 0047 m to 0 0019 m along the northern channel and from 0 0035 m to 0 0016 m along the western channel tidal phases generally increase with the upstream distance in the two channels and the phase shifts along the channels are larger for tidal constituents with higher frequencies the increasing rates are nearly constant towards the upstream delta for the phases of diurnal tides while the increase of phases of higher harmonics slows down when reaching the upper part of the channels 3 1 2 spatial variation in multiple tidal asymmetries following the analysis of song et al 2011 four combinations of tidal constituents m2 m4 k1 o2 m2 m2 s2 ms4 m2 m4 m6 contributing to tidal asymmetry are chosen to calculate the total tidal skewness in the prd the mean value of tidal skewness is shown in fig 6 for all stations in the larger part of the prd tidal skewness has a positive value indicating a shorter duration of the rising tide than the falling tide the only two stations showing negative values are located at the two most seaward outlets modaomen and jitimen the tidal skewness varies over the prd with higher values in the upstream part and lower values in the downstream part the contributions of four major combinations of tidal constituents to the total tidal skewness along the western channel and northern channel are shown in fig 7 in the downstream and middle parts of the channels the interaction between k1 o1 and m2 contributes most to the total tidal asymmetry at the other stations asymmetry is dominated by m2 m4 the interaction between m2 s2 and ms4 plays a tertiary role and m2 m4 m6 plays a minor role in contributing to total tidal asymmetry due to the relative small amplitude of m6 generally the tidal asymmetry induced by k1 o1 m2 interactions is ebb dominant in the delta indicating that tides are predominantly ebb dominant when entering the distributaries ebb dominant tides are also found in many other tidal systems such as found along the west coast of the continental united states nidzieko 2010 however it is noteworthy that the oceanic tides may also be flood dominant in some estuaries like the yangtze guo et al 2016 which is largely dependent on the geometrical characteristics of the adjacent basin overtides and compound tides partly cancel the duration asymmetry inherent in the astronomical tidal motion in the prd as can be seen from the opposite signs of β k 1 o 1 m 2 β m 2 m 4 and β m 2 s 2 m s 4 at most of the stations the total asymmetry becomes insignificant at stations such as zhuyin thus although the distortion of tides mainly originates from the non linear growth of superharmonics of the principal astronomical tides insignificant tidal asymmetry does not necessarily imply weak shallow water interactions the pre loading of asymmetry inherent to astronomical tides diminishes in the inland part of the delta while m2 m4 asymmetry increases first and then decreases a little with the damping of the m2 and m4 tides as a result the tides entering the prd do not become flood dominant until they have propagated beyond a certain location in the channels fig 8 shows the evolution of tidal skewness along two channels extending from the outlets to the region upstream of the prd between 1961 and 2012 for four main stations along the western channel and four main stations along the northern channel the changes in tidal skewness over time are greatest in the inland parts of the delta tidal skewness continuously decreases at makou and sanshui since the 1970s at these stations abrupt changes occur in the 1980s and 1990s respectively tidal skewness at sanshan shows a similar trend reversal a sharp decrease is observed in the 1990s followed by a slight increase during the 2000s the temporal variations of tidal skewness are larger along the northern channel than along the western channel especially at the sanshui station the average water depth of the cross sectional profiles of sanshui has increased a lot since the mid 1980s liu et al 2018 as a consequence significant temporal variations of the tidal duration asymmetry were observed in response to reduced bottom friction tides become more distorted when propagating along the northern channel than along the western channel which results in larger values of tidal skewness in the northern channel and smaller values in the western channel this can be explained from the fact that the northern channel is located further inland than the western channel and the waterways of the northern channel are smaller and narrower compared with the western channel luo et al 2007 the tidal skewness in the western channel keeps increasing from maliuzhou to makou and the increase is higher at the entrance of the western channel tides entering the western channel are predominantly ebb dominant and gradually develop to become flood dominant when propagating upstream the transition occurs around km 35 50 the switch point of tidal symmetry orientation in the western channel kept moving upstream during the study period no ebb dominant tides were observed along the northern channel except at sanshan in the 1990s 3 2 temporal variation of tidal asymmetry 3 2 1 temporal variations of tidal amplitudes and phases the linear trends of the tidal amplitudes and phases are mapped in fig 9 trends of tidal constituents are large and mainly positive in the upper and middle part of the prd makou sanshui shilong zidong nanhua sanshan except for that of the m6 tide at shilong 0 07 mm yr trends are relatively small at four eastern outlets with magnitudes close to or below zero the m2 amplitude trend is largest at shilong 5 6 mm yr followed by sanshui and zidong with trends of 3 6 mm yr and 3 2 mm yr respectively the tidal phases in most parts of the prd show a decreasing trend indicating that tide propagation is accelerated within the channels in the past decades similar to the trend of tidal amplitudes the decrease of tidal phases is more pronounced in the upper part of the delta and smaller around the outlets 3 2 2 total tidal asymmetry in five different time periods fig 10 shows the decadal variation of tidal skewness in the prd in the period 1961 2012 in the course of the 1990s and 2000s tidal skewness in most parts of the prd has decreased indicating that the tidal asymmetry has reduced the changes in tidal asymmetry are greatest in the upper parts of the prd around makou and sanshui compared to the 1980s tidal skewness at the upstream stations makou sanshui shilong decreased by 50 on average in the 2000s in the middle part of the delta zidong nanhua sanshan the tidal skewness clearly decreased in the 1990s but increased slightly in the 2000s the trends of tidal asymmetry are not the same for the eight outlets no significant decadal trends were observed at huangjin xipaotai and maliuzhou the continuous water level measurements at guanchong begins in 2000 hence only the mean tidal skewness in the 2000s is obtained with a positive value an increase in tidal skewness occurred around the four eastern outlets wanqinshaxi henmen sanshakou nansha at the beginning of the record this was followed by a sharp decrease in tidal skewness in the 1990s and 2000s more specifically tidal skewness decreased to become close to or below zero at sanshakou wanqinshaxi and henmen in the 2000s the sharp decrease in tidal skewness between the 1990s and 2000s may be attributed to the increase in water depth in response to engineering works during that time 3 2 3 linear trends of the total tidal skewness metric the annual based tidal skewness shows a decreasing trend over the study area for the majority of the stations 13 of 15 stations of these 12 stations show a statistically significant decreasing trend at a 95 confidence level the remaining two stations show an increasing annual tidal skewness trend but only one is statistically significant fig 11 shows the location of hydrological stations with decreasing and increasing trends of tidal skewness although a decreasing trend is observed to occur for the larger part of the study region the largest decreasing trends are observed in the upper regions with an average value of 0 0088 yr 1 3 2 4 change points of total tidal asymmetry time series of annual tidal skewness are analyzed to detect abrupt changes in the entire data record fig 12 it is found that 14 of the 15 hydrological stations exhibited a significant abrupt change in yearly mean tidal skewness the change points occur in the 1980s and 1990s severe human interference like sand mining and dredging during that time caused significant changes in the bathymetry of the delta zhang et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 reducing frictional attenuation of the tides in the system and modulating the generation of shallow water tides extreme values of oceanic tidal amplitudes occurred around 1988 due to the influence of the 18 61 year nodal cycle torres and tsimplis 2011 feng et al 2015 but the nodal cycles of tides become insignificant in delta channel network hydrodynamics due to the impact of many confounding factors such as river discharge and bathymetry matte et al 2013 hence the influence of the 18 61 year nodal cycle is not further discussed in the paper 3 3 the effect of discharge on tides and tidal asymmetry 3 3 1 sensitivity of tidal asymmetry to river discharge the tidal data during the period 2001 2012 is taken as an example to investigate the influence of river discharge on the tidal asymmetry along the western channel and northern channel the mean tidal skewness metrics γ m 2 s 2 m s 4 γ m 2 m 4 γ k 1 o 1 m 2 at the stations along the two channels are shown in fig 13 for the 1 0 1 25 1 5 1 75 2 quantiles of observed discharge series modeled by ns tide the region is divided into the tidal regime and the fluvial regime at a certain point the sensitivity of tidal asymmetry to river discharge is large in the upstream region of the delta system the fluvial regime while it decreases towards the seaward stations the tidal regime river discharge is the main contributor to friction and attenuates the tides significantly in the upstream parts of a delta system godin 1991 1999 godin and martínez 1994 as is shown in fig 13 tides become more symmetrical at the upstream stations when the discharge increases however this correlation becomes poor in the middle part of the delta and reverses at the seaside stations this phenomenon indicates that the energy transfer from principal bands to subtidal bands is amplified due to increasing magnitude of discharge in the tidal regime downstream of the system the overall damping of all tidal bands in the fluvial regime directly contributes to the weakening of the tidal asymmetry there in both the western channel and the northern channel the tidal asymmetry induced by interactions between m2 and m4 increases with increasing discharges in the downward stations while reduction occurs upstream of the channels the ebb dominant tidal asymmetry generated by the k1 o1 m2 triad is slightly enhanced with increasing discharges at the downstream part of the western channel maliuzhou and zhuyin and starts to attenuate with increased river discharge when reaching a location in the middle part of the channel since the northern channel is located more inland the k1 o1 m2 asymmetry in the northern channel is constantly reduced with increasing discharges the m2 s2 ms4 asymmetry is less sensitive to discharge variations compared with the other two kinds of asymmetries reduction of the m2 s2 ms4 asymmetry is observed at both the upstream and the downstream parts of the channel 3 3 2 the influence of changes in divided flow ratio dfr river flows from the west river and the north river are mixed at the junction and enter the delta through makou and sanshui see fig 1 a large amount of river water enters the western channel via makou and the rest enters the northern channel through sanshui the share of the flow towards makou was around 85 in the 1980s and has decreased to 79 in the 2000s caused by extensive sand excavation in the upper region that significantly deepened the bed profiles of the northern channel luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 liu et al 2018 changes of the dfr within the river channels have resulted in redistribution of river flows in the river channel network of the delta system the increased river discharge at sanshui is supposed to attenuate the astronomical tides which is inconsistent to the detected increasing trends of astronomical tidal amplitudes in the upstream parts of the delta see fig 9 this suggests that the impact of increased channel depth has overwhelmed the effect of redistribution of river discharges through the channel network of the prd 4 discussion 4 1 preloading of tidal asymmetry in other deltas in the world tidal asymmetry in a delta system is the outcome of a balance between the direct contribution of astronomical tides and the processes associated with shallow water interactions hoitink et al 2003 classified the tidal regimes of the world based on the tidal form number see fig 8 in their paper and a global map of tidal skewness was plotted by song et al 2011 according to the plots of song et al 2011 and hoitink et al 2003 preloading of tidal asymmetry induced by astronomical tides is commonly observed along coasts and in deltas the preloading of tidal asymmetry tends to be ebb dominant in most diurnal and mixed semidiurnal diurnal regimes in the outer sea when tides propagate towards the inlets of a delta the continental shelf characteristics modify the deep water tidal asymmetry since different tidal constituents respond differently to basin geometry and bottom friction godin and martínez 1994 examples can be found from the south china sea the gulf of mexico and caribbean sea according to the plots of hoitink et al 2003 and song et al 2011 where the preloading of strong ebb dominant tidal asymmetry is found at the diurnal and mixed semidiurnal diurnal regimes with tidal form numbers above 1 5 in the particular case of the pearl delta tides in the south china sea and the adjacent ocean have a shorter duration of the falling tide than the rising tide similar characteristics are observed in many other deltas around the world the mixed mainly semidiurnal tides along the west coast of the continental united states also result in the preloading of ebb dominant tidal asymmetry governing asymmetry metrics at the inlets of the three estuaries analyzed by nidzieko 2010 the tidal regime in the mahakam delta is mixed mainly semidiurnal sassi et al 2012 and the preloading of tidal asymmetry is weakly ebb dominant there on the contrary in the yangtze river estuary the tide is characterized by the semidiurnal tidal motion at the mouth of the estuary with a tidal form number of 0 24 and the tidal asymmetry inherent in astronomical tides is found to be flood dominant guo et al 2016 4 2 impact of tidal asymmetry and river tide interaction on sediment transport the interaction between tides and river discharge is a prominent process influencing morphodynamic developments the importance of tidal asymmetry in the tide averaged sediment transport in delta systems is well recognized parker 1991 friedrichs and aubrey 1988 during low flow periods the effect of tidal asymmetry plays a key role in the residual transport of sediment hoitink et al 2017 when the river discharge increases tidal asymmetry will be attenuated in the upper parts of the tidal system fig 13 and the sediment transport induced by river discharge typically directed seaward will become dominant the amazon estuary has the largest river runoff among all the estuaries milliman and farnsworth 2013 but is classified as macrotidal and therefore tides may still play a significant role in morphodynamic developments for most tidal systems such as the pearl river delta and the mahakam delta the land ocean interface can basically be separated into parts where the morphological development is mainly driven by tidal asymmetry and parts where the river discharge is dominant unfortunately the duration asymmetry analyzed here cannot easily be translated to flow velocity asymmetry which is more directly related to residual sediment transport only in short tidal inlets tidal elevation and velocity may expected to be in quadrature nidzieko 2010 gong et al 2016 in channel networks such as in the pearl delta the relation between duration asymmetry and tidal velocity asymmetry is expected to be complex it will require a numerical model to establish the details about how the changes in sources of tidal duration asymmetry will translate to regime changes in residual sediment transport and in turn in gradients in residual sediment transport leading to erosion or deposition 4 3 sand mining and dredging for shipping large scale dredging and sand excavation in the prd have caused significant geometrical changes with a down cutting depth ranging from 0 34 m to 6 48 m luo et al 2007 the alteration of the sediment regime of the pearl river has also contributed to the morphological changes in the prd liu et al 2018 existence of a deep channel can result in a decrease of the positive tendency of tidal duration asymmetry in the prd gong et al 2016 the bottom friction is reduced as the water depth increases which will reduce the energy dissipation due to friction and slow down the tidal attenuation along channels guo et al 2016 since the growth of higher harmonics and the attenuation of principle tides are the main contributors to the generation of tidal duration asymmetry within the delta the flood dominance within the delta has therefore reduced in the past decades fig 11 in addition to sand mining and dredging for shipping damming and reservoir constructions in the drainage basin of the prd have reduced the upper sediment supply significantly since the 1990s luo et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 liu et al 2018 the reduction of sediment supply along with the effect of sediment transport induced by tidal asymmetry and river discharge may contribute to river channel erosion in the delta system 4 4 the impact of tidal attenuation and phase shift on tidal asymmetry changes in tidal asymmetry within tidal systems are governed by developments of tidal amplitudes and phases sensitivity analysis can help to predict the responses of tidal skewness to the attenuation of tides considering that the tidal amplitudes are of different magnitudes a non dimensional relative sensitivity coefficient beven 1979 gong et al 2006 coleman and decoursey 1976 rana and katerji 1998 qiu et al 1998 hupet and vanclooster 2001 is employed to predict responses of tidal skewness generated by different tidal combinations to perturbations of corresponding amplitudes of constituents the expression of the non dimensional relative sensitivity coefficient is expressed as 9 s x lim δ x 0 δ γ γ δ x x γ x x γ where s x is a relative sensitivity coefficient rsc γ is tidal skewness and x is amplitude of a tidal constituent typically a positive negative rsc means that the tidal skewness γ will increase decrease as the variable x increases for example a sensitivity coefficient of 0 1 for a tidal amplitude x means that a 10 increase of the tidal amplitude x will increase the tidal skewness γ by 1 the tidal asymmetry is enhanced reduced with an increase in the variable x when the rsc is positive negative respectively a larger absolute value of the rsc is correlated with a larger effect of the variable x on tidal asymmetry annual rscs are determined for amplitudes of each tidal constituents contributing to the tidal skewness γ k 1 o 1 m 2 γ m 2 m 4 γ m 2 s 2 m s 4 the averaged rscs relative to amplitudes are illustrated in fig 14 results show that the rscs for amplitude variables contributing to γ k 1 o 1 m 2 γ m 2 m 4 and γ m 2 s 2 m s 4 remain stable across the basin the rscs for the m2 amplitude are negative for the three kinds of tidal skewness studied here indicating that the tidal asymmetry inherent in astronomical tides as well as the asymmetry generated by nonlinearities within the prd are consistently enhanced by the attenuation of the m2 amplitude although the astronomical tides are attenuated along the river channels the effects of their damping on tidal asymmetry are not necessarily the same in the case of the prd the k1 o1 m2 asymmetry is enhanced by the decrease of the m2 amplitude while being reduced by the decrease of the k1 and o1 amplitudes despite the fact that the m2 tide is dominant in the prd and the damping rate of semidiurnal tides is faster than that of diurnal tides the reduction of the m2 amplitude does not lead to an increase in the k1 o1 m2 asymmetry on the contrary the k1 o1 m2 asymmetry is significantly reduced towards the upstream parts of the delta fig 7 where the decrease of tidal amplitudes slows down fig 5 one possible reason is the impact of a phase shift as is discussed later for the tidal asymmetry induced by nonlinearities fig 14b and c γ m 2 m 4 increases with the increase of the m4 amplitude and decreases with the increase of the m2 amplitude which is in accordance with the ratio of constituent amplitudes m4 m2 traditionally used to quantify the degree of tidal distortion it indicates that the tidal asymmetry generated by the combination m2 m4 is enhanced by the attenuation of m2 tide and the growth of the harmonic tide m4 this phenomenon is commonly observed in many tidal systems such as the amazon estuary gallo and vinzon 2005 the yangtze estuary lu et al 2015 and the st lawrence fluvial estuary godin 1999 matte et al 2014 a positive correlation between the s2 amplitude and γ m 2 s 2 m s 4 as well as between ms4 and γ m 2 s 2 m s 4 are observed the summation of rscs for amplitude variables affecting tidal skewness is equal to zero and the following expression can be obtained 10 s k 1 s o 1 s m 2 0 for γ k 1 o 1 m 2 or 11 s m 2 s m 4 0 for γ m 2 m 4 or 12 s m 2 s s 2 s m s 4 0 for γ m 2 s 2 m s 4 where s abbreviates relative sensitivity coefficient rsc and x is the amplitude variable in the tidal skewness this indicates that the signs of rscs for amplitude variables within the tidal skewness are not consistent with at least one positive negative sign of the rsc opposite to the others two amplitude variables a1 a2 with opposite sign of rsc should meet the condition 13 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 0 for pairs or 14 a 3 2 ω 3 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 a 3 2 ω 3 2 a 1 2 ω 1 2 2 a 2 2 ω 2 2 0 for triads these metrics derived above are applicable to any tidal regime and can help to evaluate the interaction between tidal asymmetry and tidal attenuation in tidal systems with a short length scale such as the three california estuaries analysed by nidzieko 2010 the effect of phase shift on tidal asymmetry is limited compared with that of tidal attenuation however for tidal basins spanning hundreds of kilometers such as the st lawrence fluvial estuary matte et al 2014 the amazon estuary gallo and vinzon 2005 and the yangtze estuary guo et al 2016 the phase difference may experience quite obvious modulations in the upstream regions under the influence of discharge dynamics the equal phase difference relationship which is reported by speer et al 1991 and well confirmed in the yangtze estuary guo et al 2016 is also observed in the prd fig 15 it implies that different tidal asymmetries arising from nonlinearities have the same orientation fig 15 shows that the phase difference of astronomical tides experiences larger modulations within the prd than that of the other tidal combinations the largest variation occurs in the upper part of the delta this explains why the k1 o1 m2 asymmetry is significantly reduced in the upstream regions of the prd similar trends were also found in the yangtze estuary where the phase difference of k1 o1 m2 increased significantly upon reaching a location in the upstream part of the estuary guo et al 2016 this indicates that the attenuation of astronomical tidal asymmetry in the upper part of tidal systems is mainly driven by the phase development of astronomical tides 5 conclusions this study introduces an approach to examine the spatial temporal variations of tides and tidal asymmetry in deltas taking the pearl river delta in the period 1961 2012 as an example the asymmetry in the rise and fall duration of water levels is quantified by tidal skewness and the contribution of different combinations of tidal constituents to total tidal asymmetry is evaluated the interaction between delta morphology and tidal asymmetry as well as the effect of river discharge on tides and tidal asymmetry is evaluated a relative sensitive coefficient is introduced to generically investigate the impact of tidal attenuation on tidal asymmetry the main findings are obtained as follows 1 despite the ebb dominant tide at the two outlets most parts of the pearl river delta are flood dominant indicating that the duration of the rising tide is shorter than the falling tide tides become more asymmetric in the upstream parts of the delta under the substantial effect of nonlinear interactions we find that the interaction between k1 o1 and m2 contributes most to the total tidal asymmetry in the lower part and middle parts of the prd while m2 m4 interaction is dominant in the upper part m2 s2 ms4 triad interaction plays the tertiary role and the role of m2 m4 m6 is minor these observations indicate that the tidal asymmetry within deltas is strongly modulated by astronomical tides especially at the mouth of a delta 2 tidal asymmetry in delta systems is a balance of the preloading of tidal asymmetry inherent in astronomical tides and the tidal asymmetry induced through the processes of shallow water interactions the pre loading of tidal asymmetry induced by astronomical tides is progressively attenuated with distance from the tidal inlet while the tidal asymmetry generated by nonlinear interactions is enhanced along the channels until it peaks in the middle or upper part of the delta insignificant tidal asymmetry is not necessarily linked to weak shallow water interactions the preloading of tidal asymmetry is likely to be ebb dominant when the tidal regime is diurnal or mixed semidiurnal diurnal 3 the effect of river discharge on attenuating tidal asymmetry may be particularly large in the upstream parts of a delta system in the downstream reaches the increase in river discharges may accelerate the energy transfer from principal frequency bands to superharmonic frequency bands explaining amplification of shallow water tides and attenuation of astronomical tides as a result the tidal asymmetry inherent in astronomical tides is enhanced at seaward stations with increasing river discharges and a reversed pattern is found at the upper part of the delta 4 according to the theory of friedrichs and aubrey 1988 tides are more distorted and more asymmetric with a larger amplitude ratio m4 m2 our work extends this theory to multiple tidal asymmetries by means of a sensitivity analysis positive negative correlations between tidal amplitudes and tidal skewness are determined for each amplitude variable contributing to tidal skewness the relative sensitivity coefficients offer insight in the effect of tidal amplitude variations on multiple tidal asymmetries within delta systems while the damping rate of tides slows down with distance from the inlet the phase shift becomes dominant in controlling the variation of k1 o1 m2 asymmetry in the upstream parts of a tide influenced delta the results presented here only considered the contribution of four main tidal combinations to total tidal asymmetry however the dominant tidal constituents may vary in other delta systems therefore for future research including all the significant tidal constituents is recommended numerical models can be established to help evaluate the relationship between the tidal duration asymmetry and flow velocity asymmetry under different delta morphologies since flow velocity asymmetry is more directly related with the sediment transport in deltas and estuaries than water levels acknowledgments this work was jointly supported by

008 thanks should be extended to the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their invaluable and constructive suggestions which greatly improved the quality of this paper appendix a to convert the high water low water data to continuous data at a one hour interval a trigonometric interpolation method is adopted a brief summary of this method is presented in this appendix the tidal heights h during a sampling interval are modeled as a 1 h t h 1 h 2 2 sin π 2 t t1 t 2 t 1 0 5 q h1 h2 2 where t is time t 1 is start time t2 is end time h 1 is tidal height at t t 1 and h 2 is tidal height at t t 2 the coefficient q is defined as a 2 q 1 h 1 h 2 0 h 1 h 2 the agreement of water levels at sanshui station in 2007 observed at a one hour interval and corresponding values interpolated from the high water low water data is shown in fig a1 the root mean square error rmse and pearson correlation coefficient r are calculated to evaluate the performance of the interpolation method results show that the interpolated water levels are in line with the observed ones with r 0 9959 and the rmse takes a value of 0 067 m suggesting that the errors are negligible moreover we measure the skill of the interpolation method by the ratio γ 2 thompson et al 2003 which is defined as a 3 γ 2 i 1 n h o b s i h int i 2 i 1 n h o b s i hobs 2 where hobs is water levels observed at a one hour interval h int is water levels interpolated from the high water low water data generally small values of γ 2 indicate a high skill of the model the value of γ 2 is 0 0085 at sanshui station which is lower than the lowest values obtained by thompson et al 2003 for their predicting model 0 18 the power spectra of observed and interpolated water levels are compared in fig a2 the low frequency bands and shallow tides are prominent as sanshui is one of the most landward stations it can be seen from fig a2 that the two frequency structures are nearly the same in the low frequency bands the basic tides derived from interpolated water levels are in good agreement with those derived from observed water levels although the power spectra of high frequency bands d8 and higher are not well predicted the effect is negligible for the purpose of the present study appendix b the skewness γ 3 created by combination of three constituents is calculated from eq 5 the partial derivative of the skewness γ 3 is obtained

7088,the study aims to examine the effect of ponds on changes in water quality in a young glacial river catchment the goal was to identify situations where a periodic hydrographic network is formed in outflow free areas which is connected with a higher order receiving area as well as to study the circulation of matter in this type of system this study answers the following key question do ponds affected by areal pollution substantially affect water quality in streams in periods where they become joined with the hydrographic network the purpose of the research was to identify patterns associated with the functioning of ponds in young glacial areas in northern poland on the example of the borucinka catchment ponds were selected in order to generate a study sample characterized by different types of land use local hydrology and pond surface area the study focused on the effects of catchment land use on pond water quality and the effects of periodic changes in local hydrology linkage of surface flows with bodies of water on pond water quality research has shown that land use in a pond catchment yields a substantial effect on pond water quality the basic reason for the higher concentration of selected ions is close proximity to farms that generate wastewater which reaches bodies of water in the study area seasonal changes in the concentration of biogenic substances were not observed in ponds only notable changes in the concentration of total nitrogen were observed due the episodic formation of a hydrographic network consisting of a collection of linked depressions one of the more surprising findings was that permanently isolated ponds which theoretically collect catchment pollutants all the time are characterized by good hydrochemical conditions keywords ponds water quality land use young glacial areas closed circulation areas 1 introduction ponds are a very important part of geographic space in young glacial areas due to their capacity to retain water as well as their numerous hydrologic functions and biological value oertli et al 2005 they are highly susceptible to external influence due to their specific morphometry ecological characteristics davis et al 2008 oertli et al 2009 as well as a frequent lack of connectivity with rivers gerke et al 2010 the location of a pond in a given type of catchment yields a number of consequences associated with pond functioning and the formation of a specific ecological state in the past most researchers argued that ponds form closed circulation areas which are not part of a main hydrographic system this would make ponds a physical trap for pollutants moving across a catchment waldon 2012 however more recent research suggests that ponds sometimes do connect with other bodies of water which produces consequences not only in terms of water circulation and water resources in a catchment but also in terms of water chemistry through a loss of pollutants previously deposited therein tiner 2003 argues that the pond and pond catchment system constitutes an isolated feature of geographic space at the same time due to natural and anthropogenic changes ponds and their catchments can form entire hydrographic systems along with other bodies of water in their vicinity if a hydraulic connection is created in one way or another ponds strongly affect catchment water circulation by serving as a natural reservoir of rainwater brooks 2004 the research literature suggests that many natural determinants physical biological geographic hydrologic meteorological affect pond water chemistry hayashi et al 2004 however it is the intensification of agriculture that represents the greatest threat to ponds by indirectly accelerating the gradual decline of ponds through the excessive use of phosphorus fertilizers schoumans et al 2014 yan et al 2016 excessive phosphorus in water contributes to the massive development of phytoplankton organisms as a consequence the transparency of the water is reduced submerging vegetation subsides this is the effect of deteriorating light conditions this leads to the reconstruction of the existing fauna excessive supply of phosphorus also leads to the depletion of oxygen resources in the bottom layer of water reservoirs which leads to the disappearance of deep water fauna also climate change adversely affects the ponds and above all on the vegetation structure hydrologic function and biodiversity johnson and poiani 2016 changes in pond water chemistry should be associated with vertical water exchange or atmospheric and evaporation as well as horizontal water exchange in the form of groundwater influx and loss for this second element winter and rosenberry 1995 turner and townley 2006 and kacimov 2007 indicate that lakes and ponds in lowland areas are usually hydraulically connected to a shallow groundwater system in effect pond water chemistry should be reflective of rainwater chemistry or groundwater chemistry however this is not the case in many instances in such cases it is reasonable to presume that surface water influx occurs at certain times of the year thanks to changes in catchment water levels golus and bajkiewicz grabowska 2016 hence pond water chemistry depends first and foremost on the source of water ion chemistry of ponds and lakes water provides important information about the sources of dissolved ions weathering and hydrogeochemical processes as well as anthropogenic activities taking place in the lake environment singh et al 2016 while ponds do differ in terms of their hydrologic origin it is also a fact that recharge is dominated by two sources of water atmospheric and groundwater influx it is also quite possible that other environmental sources affect the water chemistry of ponds lowenstein and risacher 2009 first and foremost this is applicable to land use in the studied pond catchments relief atmospheric precipitation anthropogenic pollution and seasonal plant growth patterns yet other factors that may affect pond water chemistry include pond morphometry lischeid and kalettka 2012 work on ponds in northern germany lischeid and kalettka 2012 has shown that these key factors explain 90 of variance in pond water chemistry finally remaining factors include land use agricultural pollution primary production and type of soil cover it is important to note that ponds are highly sensitive to external factors due to their unique morphometry and hydrology gałczyńska et al 2011 the purpose of the paper is to discuss changes and differences in water chemistry in selected ponds based on water exchange type outflow free flow through and land use in the direct catchment i e woodland agricultural immediate vicinity of a farm this will make it possible to assess how different water circulation patterns and land use affect water chemistry in the studied ponds the research results will help us understand how ponds function as well as how they are comparable to one another 2 methods most of the research consisted of fieldwork which commenced in november of 2012 and was completed in october of 2014 yielding a total of 15 field excursions the study area consisted of the borucinka river catchment in the kaszubski lake district found in northern poland as an example of areas covered by the last glaciations ten ponds were studied in this study area figs 1 and 2 most of the ponds were located in the western part of the studied catchment this particular area is characterized by significant seasonal changes in the local hydrographic structure manifested in the form of a periodically emerging hydrographic network that connects ponds together this unique study area made it possible to determine the effects of changes in local water circulation patterns on pond water chemistry research has shown that ponds no 2 4 and 8 are permanently outflow free while the remaining seven ponds are periodically connected with the area river network in addition ponds were selected for research purposes based on key differences in catchment land use 1 agricultural land use 2 forest land use 3 farm adjacent land use or very close proximity to a working farm this choice of ponds made it possible to determine which forms of land use produce the largest effects on pond water quality a multi parameter hach hq40d gauge was used in the course of the fieldwork to determine water parameters such as ph and electrolytic conductivity water samples collected in the field were then analyzed at the hydrochemical laboratory at the department of hydrology at the university of gdańsk the concentrations of selected cations na nh4 mg2 k ca2 as well as anions cl no2 no3 po4 3 so4 2 were determined using a dionex ics 1100 capillary ion chromatograph with ionpac as 22 4 250 mm and cs16 5 250 mm columns at 30 c using dionex concentrate as 22 and methanesulfonic acid msa as a eluents for the analysis of anions and cations respectively for the filtration of water samples we used 0 45 µs milliphore membrane moreover total nitrogen ntot and total phosphorus ptot were determined via colorimetry using a merck nova 400 spectrophotometer instrumental calibration was carried out using multi element standard solution for cations ca2 k mg2 na multi element ic standard solution for anions cl so4 2 no3 po4 3 no2 and mono element calibration solution for ammonium nh4 ion calibration was based on 7 points obtained diluting suitably batch solutions in the range 0 1 50 ppm experimental uncertainty was determined by 10 replicates of a suitable standard solution with a concentration level of ions enclosed within the calibration concentration range the margin of error for the analyses was less than 2 in addition water levels were measured in the field using gauges affixed in ponds the first measurement was assumed to be a base level while subsequent measurements were used as data to be compared with the base water level in order to assess fluctuations in the water level meteorologic data were obtained from the meteorologic station of the university of gdańsk located in borucin the classification of temperature conditions and precipitation for each studied month was done based on a method proposed by miętus et al 2005 the studied ponds fall within three different categories of land use 1 agricultural 2 woodland 3 farm adjacent the dominant type of land use in the study area is agricultural mostly arable land while this is the primary land use in each of the studied areas only some study areas were classified as agricultural in nature the share of woodland is relatively low although ponds surrounded by relatively large woodland areas were classified as woodland type as forested areas provide some measure of protection from the influx of pollutants some of the studied catchments were located adjacent to working farms featuring residential infrastructure which may yield substantial amounts of pollution to ponds these ponds were classified as farm adjacent table 1 the work uses various statistical calculations comprehensive perkal index and grouping by ward method among others 3 results 3 1 meteorological situation during the research period the annual atmospheric precipitation total for the study period hydrologic years 2013 and 2014 was lower than the long term average for the period 1961 2000 668 5 mm and stood at 614 9 mm in 2013 and 598 2 mm in 2014 however average annual air temperatures were higher than the long term average during the study period 6 8 c and stood at 7 3 c in 2013 and 9 0 c in 2014 the highest average monthly air temperatures were noted in july 18 1 20 2 c fig 3 shows the distribution of monthly atmospheric precipitation totals and air temperatures 3 2 changes in the amount of water stored in each pond research has shown that water levels in the studied ponds change frequently fig 4 fluctuations of water levels were measured with a tape in relation to the adopted fixed reference point where the first measurement was considered as initial zero and the remaining measurements were referred to the first one maximum water levels noted in all the studied ponds occurred in may of 2014 due to a large atmospheric event preceding the measurement date high water levels were also noted in april of 2013 the pond water level maximum is fleeting in nature as it is caused by the melting of the snow cover higher water levels in the winter and spring are not only due to higher atmospheric rainfall but also due to limited losses caused by evaporation in low air temperatures low pond water levels are noted in the summer months when evaporation is not offset by atmospheric fig 5 minimum water levels were noted in november in the case of all ponds beyond pond no 5 where the lowest water levels were recorded in july the pond water level fluctuation range is quite large ranging from 27 cm to 98 5 cm fig 4 the largest fluctuations are noted for ponds with the smallest surface area except for pond 4 which appears to have a large surface area in the map fig 1 but also exhibits a large fluctuation in water level pond no 1 has an area of 0 05 ha and pond no 3 has an area of 0 04 ha both are characterized by a periodic disappearance of their water content the pond featuring the third smallest surface area pond no 9 0 24 ha is characterized by the largest fluctuations in water level research has also shown that large changes in water level occur in ponds with the smallest mean depth of less than 1 m ponds no 6 and 9 0 7 and 0 9 m respectively ponds with the largest surface area and capacity are characterized by smaller fluctuations in water levels ponds no 5 and 7 were observed to experience the smallest water level fluctuations 3 3 hydrologic characteristics of the studied ponds seasonal changes in the hydrologic function of the ten studied ponds were observed in the course of the research for most of the studied period they function as out of flow ponds fig 6 at this time the accumulation of matter flows from the catchment to the ponds in the period of high retention in the catchment after spring snow thaws or after very intense precipitation the ponds retention capacity and the overflowing of water to the lower located objects is completed in this way a periodic river network is formed connecting the ponds with each other during this time the accumulated matter is leached out and transferred through the waterway to other parts of the catchment in the period of increased evaporation some of the ponds dry up fig 6 ponds no 9 and 10 were flow through ponds from the beginning of the observation period on november 28 2012 on the other hand ponds no 3 5 6 and 7 were observed to experience surface water flow on december 19 2012 pond no 1 was observed to experience surface water flow on january 13 2013 due to the increased water retention of the catchment surface flow was still observed in the case of all of the above listed ponds in the course of surveying on april 16 2013 outflow from ponds decreased to zero by may mostly due to increased evaporation the quantity of water stored in ponds decreases in the summer and autumn months which leads to lower water levels in ponds what was observed during the study all the studied ponds were outflow free in throughout the study period ponds no 9 and 10 periodically joined the local river network following spring snowmelt events in 2014 a relatively warm winter and low atmospheric precipitation forced other ponds to remain outflow free on may 26 2014 a large atmospheric precipitation event in the studied catchment and greater surface flow expanded the local river network with some of the studied ponds temporarily becoming outflow type ponds ponds no 1 3 5 6 7 9 10 the remaining three ponds nos 2 4 8 remained outflow free throughout the entire study period fig 6 3 4 the concentration of selected physical and chemical indicators 3 4 1 electrolytic conductivity the highest mean values of electrolytic conductivity for the entire study period were calculated for pond no 1 153 8 µs cm 1 while the highest measured values were noted for ponds experiencing the highest degree of human impact ponds no 1 3 9 the lowest mean electrolytic conductivity was calculated in the case of pond no 2 which is a pond without outflows 23 4 µs cm 1 the least changing values of electrolytic conductivity were noted for outflow free pond no 4 table 2 the other studied ponds were characterized by low values of electrolytic conductivity in effect it may be argued that ponds are recharged mostly by atmospheric precipitation that is characterized by low electrolytic conductivity elevated values of water electrolytic conductivity were noted in the winter months and in the course of spring snowmelt events 3 4 2 ph levels the mean ph values obtained for the studied ponds over the course of the study period were close to neutral ranging from 6 3 for pond no 3 to 7 4 for pond no 1 the mean ph for all the studied ponds was 6 9 while the minimum was 5 8 pond no 3 and the maximum was 8 9 pond no 2 the ph range over the study period was quite significant table 2 slightly basic ph was detected in the studied ponds in the summer months while slightly acidic ph was noted mainly in the spring and winter months 3 5 characteristics of selected predominant ions bicarbonate was found to be the predominant anion in the studied ponds all the studied ponds are considered to be low mineral content bicarbonate is formed in the majority of cases from the dissolution of carbon dioxide in water and also the leaching of carbonate containing rocks major 2012 benjamin 2014 essington 2015 the mean maximum and minimum concentration of bicarbonate varies quite substantially between the studied ponds the mean concentration of bicarbonate ranged from 11 80 mg dm 3 in pond no 2 to 86 44 mg dm 3 in pond no 1 the bicarbonate mean for all the studied ponds was 26 31 mg dm 3 the largest changes in bicarbonate content were noted for ponds experiencing the greatest degree of human impact where the pond catchment features a working farm in the immediate vicinity ponds no 1 3 9 fig 7 chloride is the second most commonly occurring anion in the water chemistry of the studied ponds chloride enters bodies of surface water mostly via atmospheric precipitation as well as the leaching of rocks and soils some chloride also enters pond water as part of wastewater streams labaugh et al 2016 mccarter and price 2017 the mean concentration of chloride in the studied ponds ranges from 2 94 mg dm 3 in pond no 2 to 6 94 mg dm 3 in pond no 9 the mean value for all the studied ponds is 4 27 mg dm 3 fig 7 the pond water concentration of chloride was found to increase following intense rainfall which suggests that the primary source of this ion is atmospheric precipitation the calcium ion is the predominant cation in the studied pond water the mean concentration of calcium in the studied ponds was in the range from 2 97 mg dm 3 in pond no 2 to 28 09 mg dm 3 in pond no 1 the mean value for all the studied ponds was 7 43 mg dm 3 pond no 1 is characterized by an especially broad spectrum of calcium concentrations over the study period 11 97 39 38 mg dm 3 relative to the other studied ponds all of the other studied ponds are characterized by more stable concentrations of the calcium ion the smallest fluctuations in the calcium concentration were noted in permanently outflow free ponds ponds no 2 and 4 as well as in pond no 7 which is the largest surface area and overall water capacity fig 7 3 6 biogenic substance content in water the paper covers biogenic substances in pond water by analyzing total nitrogen ntot and total phosphorus ptot as comprehensive indicators of biogenic pollution in pond water the mean ntot concentration did not vary substantially in the studied ponds lowest concentrations were noted in pond no 6 1 78 mg dm 3 while the highest were noted in pond no 3 2 73 mg dm 3 the mean ntot concentration for all the studied ponds was 2 07 mg dm 3 fig 7 the ntot concentration range for ponds is similar to that in large lakes while the mean ntot concentration in ponds is somewhat higher than that in most larger lakes the ntot content in the study period varied over fairly short and irregular periods of time it may be stated that it is stored in various features of the ecosystem to be gradually released into the water pond no 1 was characterized by the largest ntot concentration range in the study period from 0 97 to 5 01 mg dm 3 fig 7 in most of the 10 studied ponds the lowest ntot concentrations were noted at the beginning of the 2013 hydrologic year november december analyzing individual forms of total nitrogen ntot a marked increase in n no3 and n no2 concentrations was observed in may after very intense rainfall during this period concentration values of n no3 increased about three times the mean concentration of ptot varied significantly between the ten studied ponds the highest mean concentration was noted for pond no 3 0 728 mg dm 3 while the lowest was noted for pond no 2 0 114 mg dm 3 the mean for all the studied ponds was 0 204 mg dm 3 the two ponds were also characterized by the largest and smallest range of ptot concentrations in the study period pond no 3 ranged from 0 251 to 1 750 mg dm 3 while pond no 2 ranged from 0 063 to 0 208 mg dm 3 fig 7 the concentration of ptot measured in this study resembles that obtained by researchers monitoring water quality in ponds situated in the olsztyńskie lake district in northeastern poland range from 0 002 to 0 900 mg dm 3 and mean of 0 241 mg dm 3 koc et al 2001 the ptot concentrations obtained in the current pond study are higher than those for lakes in the kaszubski lake district the ptot concentration for lakes ranged from below the detection limit to 0 11 mg dm 3 for lake surface water to 0 54 mg dm 3 for lake floor water lange 2005 a study conducted two years later produced a concentration range from 0 06 to 0 35 mg dm 3 borowiak 2007 no seasonal increases or decreases in the total phosphorus concentration were observed in the studied pond water 3 7 relationship between the geographic environment and water chemistry as in the case of the highest concentrations the largest concentration ranges were also observed for farm adjacent ponds ponds no 1 3 9 on the other hand pond no 7 or the pond with the largest surface area was characterized by a small concentration range in the case of most of the studied ions fig 7 a large pond surface area and large water capacity may attenuate the concentration fluctuation range of many ions and elements the largest ranges were identified for ponds with the smallest surface area which may prove the effect of area and capacity on water quality in the case of a comprehensive determination of the quality of water in the studied mesh and an attempt to refer the obtained results to the prevailing conditions of the geographical environment a number of statistics were calculated the obtained results were referred to the management of the basin ie the dominant method of its use table 1 the obtained results were also referred to the hydrological type represented by the given ponds out of flow or periodically flow the obtained results were also compared with the surface and capacity of the ponds fig 7 is presented comprehensive perkal index which can be used to order ponds on the number line based on selected concentrations for the perkal index the paper uses the hellwig critical interval method in the classification process for k 0 5 the weights of all the variables examined were equal in this study high values of the perkal index imply low water quality in the examined ponds four pond groups were identified using perkal index values group one includes pond no 1 characterized by a very high perkal index value worst water quality group two includes ponds with a high perkal index value low water quality ponds no 3 and 9 group three includes ponds with a medium perkal index value medium water quality ponds no 8 and 10 group four includes ponds with a low perkal index value or best water quality ponds no 2 4 5 6 7 fig 8 the obtained results are shown in the form of a tree diagram featuring a multi characteristic classification all the examined ponds are divided into two groups a and b group a ponds are numbered 2 4 5 6 7 and 8 this group is characterized by low total nitrogen chloride sodium and total phosphorus content group b includes ponds no 1 3 9 and 10 the main characteristics of this group are the following high total nitrogen chloride and magnesium content fig 9 table 3 provides values of the comprehensive perkal index along with a classification based on multiple characteristics the relationship between index values and the classification may be observed here as ponds classified as group a are characterized by low and medium index values and ponds classified as group b are characterized by high and very high index values a clear effect of land use on the concentration of the elements studied was observed the most numerous group are ponds classified as type a table 3 characterized by a low value of the synthetic index i e the best quality of water from all examined facilities this group includes ponds whose water catchments have been classified as forest no 5 and 6 table 1 the trees around the ponds constitute the buffer zone of vegetation they separate the water of the ponds from the areas of cultivation and farms ryszkowski and kędziora 1987 according to gałczyńska and gamrat 2007 the occurrence around trees especially in reservoirs without vegetation on the water surface has a positive effect on nutrient concentrations and lowering the water temperature on the other hand ponds found close to farms featured the worst water quality among the studied ponds type b in comprehensive perkal index table 3 this may indicate a significant impact of point pollution in the form of residential and commercial buildings ponds exposed to high impact of farms very often not connected to the sewage system may be a receiver of economic wastewater to a large extent agricultural pollutants brought to the ponds come from the liquid manure stored in the farms the remaining ponds were classified as agricultural ponds no 2 4 7 8 10 table 1 characterized by the dominant type of use of their catchment in the form of agricultural land significant impact of farms and buffer in the form of forest areas has not been observed these ponds were characterized by medium or low synthetic index and mostly belong to type a exception is pond no 10 belonging to group b table 3 the reservoir no 7 was also characterized by a low value of the measured synthetic index i e the best water quality the pond has the largest area 0 96 ha and capacity 8582 8 m3 large

depth the group of ponds characterized by a low value of the synthetic index also included two ponds with no outflow no 2 and 4 it is possible that in the ecosystem of small reservoirs accumulation of pollutants occurs in bottom sediments and the process of their release depends on many factors lack of connection of this type of ponds with periodic watercourse causes that pollution from other parts of the basin do not get into the permanently outflow ponds so there is also no possibility of excitation of pollutants accumulated in the sediments into the water depth 4 discussion changes in pond water levels are large ranging from 27 to 98 5 cm with an average of 55 cm and depend on local relief sediment structure ground permeability and meteorologic conditions labaugh et al 2016 the greatest degree of stability is noted for ponds with the largest surface area and volume the smallest ponds tend to dry out in periods of accelerated evaporation for the most part of the examined period the ponds function as outflow depressions at this time the accumulation of matter in the reservoirs flows primarily from the basin at high catchment water stages following spring snowmelts or very heavy precipitation some ponds reach their capacity and overflow onto lower areas or bodies of water this leads to the formation of a temporary river network connecting a number of different ponds at that time the river network is transported with accumulated matter into other parts of the catchment the studied ponds are characterized by low water mineral content and low electrical conductivity which is true of most ponds located in young glacial areas as reported by many different researchers including gołdyn et al 2015 and golus and bajkiewicz grabowska 2016 the concentrations of main cations and anions were also low which suggests a main role of atmospheric precipitation in pond recharge the effect of land use on the concentration of the examined elements in the pond waters was noted the best water quality was detected in the ponds whose catchments were classified as woodland type a in comprehensive perkal index the trees around the ponds constitute the buffer zone of vegetation they separate the water of the ponds from the areas of cultivation and farms ryszkowski and kędziora 1987 according to gałczyńska and gamrat 2007 the occurrence around trees especially in reservoirs without vegetation on the water surface has a positive effect on nutrient concentrations and lowering the water temperature on the other hand ponds found close to farms featured the worst water quality among the studied ponds type b in comprehensive perkal index this may indicate a significant impact of point pollution in the form of residential and commercial buildings ponds exposed to high impact of farms very often not connected to the sewage system may be a receiver of economic wastewater to a large extent agricultural pollutants brought to the ponds come from the liquid manure stored in the farms the reservoir no 7 was also characterized by a low value of the measured synthetic index i e the best water quality the pond has the largest area 0 96 ha and capacity 8582 8 m3 large surface area and capacity can affect the reduction and equalization of the amplitude of the concentrations of the tested compounds cl hco3 k mg2 ca2 by diluting the impurities getting into its water

pollutants occurs in bottom sediments and the process of their release depends on many factors lack of connection of this type of ponds with periodic watercourse causes that pollution from other parts of the basin do not get into the permanently outflow ponds so there is also no possibility of excitation of pollutants accumulated in the sediments into the water depth a clear effect of land use on the amount of concentrations of the analyzed elements in the ponds was observed the best quality of water from all the examined objects was characterized by ponds whose basins were classified as forest in turn the ponds adjacent to agricultural holdings had the worst water quality from all examined facilities this may indicate a significant impact of point pollution in the form of residential and commercial buildings the group of ponds representing the agricultural catchment type is characterized by moderate concentrations of the analyzed compounds there was no clear influence of the change in the hydrological function of the examined ponds the appearance of periodic watercourses connecting the examined objects on the quality of their waters maximum concentrations of ntot and ptot do not show any tendencies during the research period in individual ponds the increase in concentrations occurred at different times only the increase of n no3 and n no2 content was found after very intense rainfall in may and the episodic appearance of the periodic river network such an increase in the content of nutrients after rainfall is natural nitrates get into the water mainly with precipitation and surface runoff the mobility of different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus varies in the natural environment nitrate migrates easily in water which explains the decreasing concentration of ntot in ponds whose function changed from outflow free to flow through conversely phosphorus based ions feature a greater tendency to adsorb onto soil particles and tend to remain in the soil profile and in deposits in the context of mean boundary ntot concentrations established through monitoring research on lakes in the kaszubskie lake district in northern poland borowiak 2007 the water quality of the studied ponds may be described as either moderately good ponds no 6 5 2 8 4 or poor ponds no 3 9 1 10 7 the mean ntot concentration in lakes in the kaszubski lake district ranged from 0 2 to 3 5 mg dm 3 in 2005 lange 2005 the range in 2007 was found to be 0 9 to 2 53 mg dm 3 borowiak 2007 in the context of mean boundary concentrations for ptot established as part of lake water monitoring studies in the kaszubskie lake district in the northwestern part of poland borowiak 2007 the water quality of the studied ponds may be described as either poor ponds no 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 or very poor ponds no 1 and 3 small ponds can significantly impact the hydrological regime of river basins including on downstream river flow quality of river waters and quantified evaporation losses wisser et al 2010 it appears particularly important to determine the effects of changes in water resources and changes in water quality at times when ponds become linked with the river network the occurrence of areas without surface outflows and this includes ponds stops some material from directly reaching the regional river system and instead it becomes deposited or temporarily stored in them koc et al 2001 grochowska et al 2004 periodic changes in the river network help include ponds in the surface drainage system via intermittent watercourses this situation makes it very important to identify not only water circulation pathways but also material transport pathways and material deposition patterns the temporal variability of this supply flow is dependent first and foremost on changes in weather conditions major 2012 young glacial catchments such as the borucianka catchment feature a large number of ponds and are characterized by a different pattern of pollutant circulation than typical upland lowland and mountain catchments this difference is associated with the pond capability to accumulate pollutants at low and medium water stages in the catchment and release pollutants at high water stages hierarchical and branching river networks interact with dynamic watershed disturbances such as storms and floods with consequences for biological and chemical conditions benda et al 2004 this is confirmed by verhoeven et al 2017 who note that the most important feature of catchment functioning is the water transport process hence extreme meteorologic events constitute a special case in young glacial catchments and yield large quantities of water in a short period of time often triggering flood conditions as in the case of flooding in quebec canada saad et al 2015 extreme events help flush out and transport nitrogen compounds and less mobile phosphorus compounds away from ponds and wetlands as well as the soil dodds and smith 2017 the first group consists of streams located on the floor of a glacial valley where the water chemistry is linked with a longer period of water circulation in the catchment as well as groundwater recharge the second group consists of streams located in moraine uplands and recharged almost exclusively by atmospheric precipitation and ponds triggering surface flow higher concentrations of total nitrogen were observed in intermittent streams functioning at high catchment water stages and redirecting excess water away from outflow free depressions filled completely with water on the other hand an increase in the total phosphorus concentration in surface waters was noted following heavy rainfall events these types of events lead to increased migration of biogenic substances in a catchment hence the water chemistry of intermittent streams is largely a reflection of water chemistry observed in ponds differences in concentration may suggest that permanent streams systematically redirect biogenic substances away from their recharge areas while intermittent streams only periodically redirect pollutants accumulated throughout the course of a year at the same time the inclusion of ponds in the drainage system does not affect their water chemistry to any significant extent the occurrence of ponds is associated with vertical exchange especially atmospheric precipitation and evaporation lehsten et al 2011 which is readily observable in the studied ponds this means that the volume of water in a pond depends on the stream of air exchange with water although correlations between water levels and climate indices are characterized by a one year delay in response this effect favors increased evaporation in the summer and increased atmospheric precipitation in the winter in effect it is possible to speak of a certain seasonal variability in water resources as well as a seasonal variability of water quality as discussed by anshumali and ramanathan 2007 however many hydrologists argue that ponds are also connected with groundwater sources lehsten et al 2011 although this was not observed in the studied ponds as a result water circulation in a pond is more complex than one would expect according to hayashi et al 2016 the water balance of individual wetlands is strongly influenced by runoff from the catchment and the exchange of groundwater between the central pond and its moist margin land use practices in the catchment have a sensitive effect on runoff and hence the water balance surface and subsurface storage and connectivity among individual wetlands controls the diversity of pond permanence within a wetland complex resulting in a variety of eco hydrological functionalities necessary for maintaining the integrity of prairie wetland ecosystems the borucianka study confirms research by hayashi et al 2016 especially in the area of runoff pollutant effects on the water chemistry of bodies of water as well as the effect of land use on the overall functioning of the catchment changes occurring in the catchment and human impact often determine the permanence of ponds and hydrologic changes therein given that ponds rarely make surface contact with the entire hydrographic network their water quality depends primarily on vertical water exchange and especially on precipitation sobel et al 2003 on the other hand lischeid and kalettka 2012 argue that pond water retention times and water exchange pathways serve as the main determinants of the stability of water chemistry in ponds other ideas are proposed by golus and bajkiewicz grabowska 2016 who argue that pond water quality is determined by water through flow according to yu et al 2015 small shallow seasonal wetlands with short hydroperiod play an important role in the entrapment of organic matter and nutrients and due to their wide distribution in determining the water quality of watersheds as a result it is very important to study the hydrochemistry of ponds as well as the processes that affect ponds including pollutant accumulation precipitation and transport in addition it is important to determine the effect of the amount and intensity of any precipitation in the pond area on hydrologic conditions including the connection of ponds with main hydrographic networks likelihood of the outflow of previously deposited pollutants and changes in pond water chemistry it seems that a more integrated and holistic approach to environmental monitoring is now needed petrie et al 2015 water appears to escape ponds in the course of heavy rainfall via underground as well as surface pathways chernet et al 2001 this process may occur also in some other cases work by kalettka and rudat 2006 appears to confirm this finding by showing that some moraine ponds in northeastern germany possess a tendency to overflow at high water stages the same was observed in the case of the studied ponds what is important is that this is not a local phenomenon research work by downing 2010 shows that small bodies of water play an important role in both water and sediment circulation not only on a regional scale but also on a global scale changes in the concentration of biogenic substances deserve special attention as the influx of pollutants is particularly dangerous to pond water this applies not only to point sources of pollution but to the rate of flow which is high and this leads to an increase in water pollution evaporation is yet another relevant process in this case rapid evaporation across open water surfaces in the summer months leads not only to a reduction in water level but also changes in water chemistry as well as the onset of eutrophication and overgrowth in the pond basin according to young and abnizova 2011 a positive water balance is highly relevant to pond functioning as are various types of hydrologic connections recharge and water loss in ponds are regulated primarily by pond morphometry land use soil conditions in the catchment as well as seasonal changes in climate conditions and hydrologic conditions as shown by the research results in the studied catchment the chemical stability of pond water is larger in the presence of a larger number of sources of recharge the hydrologic resilience of ponds is limited in cases where most of the recharge arrives from underground sources or comes from atmospheric precipitation ponds are not very permanent features of the natural landscape according to pienkowski et al 2010 more than 43 of ponds present across moraine areas of poland in the 19th century disappeared by the end of the 20th century according to gołdyn et al 2015 the most important factors affecting water chemistry in ponds during years with average precipitation are pond morphometry and pond catchment morphometry however in the event of a drought the factors that determine pond water quality are the type of vegetation and pond depth nevertheless the most important factor determining pond water quality is the length of the time period when catchment soils are moist and hydrographic sites including ponds are filled with water gołdyn et al 2015 5 conclusions research has shown that land use strongly affects the concentration and concentration range of the studied ions and biogenic substances the largest mean concentrations and their fluctuations were noted for ponds located near working farms this may suggest that pollution originates mostly from point sources such as farms as well as areal sources such as the runoff generated by agricultural fields ponds surrounded by a forest buffer zone are characterized by lower concentrations of the studied ions trees separate ponds from land used for agriculture and from working farm infrastructure however research did not show an effect of woodland belts on the reduction of fluctuations in the concentration of selected ions and elements and consequently greater chemical stability on the other hand the largest pond in the study sample is characterized by significant regularity and small range of concentration of ions and biogenic substances a pond s large volume and surface area may help improve its chemical stability the same is true of ponds which permanently remain outflow free one surprising finding in this study was the fact that permanently outflow free ponds which theoretically constantly accumulate pollutants arriving from their catchments without a pathway for them to out migrate via a temporary hydrographic network are characterized by good hydrochemical conditions it is certainly possible that in small ponds the accumulation of pollutants occurs in floor sediments and their release is determined by a variety of factors different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus show different mobility rates in the natural environment nitrate readily migrates in water which is why ntot concentrations were found to increase in ponds affected by a change in hydrologic function if a hydrographic network is able to connect individual ponds on a periodic basis then this forms a pathway for pollution to follow however it cannot be determined whether the increase in concentrations was caused by the occurrence of periodic flow in ponds or was caused by a large supply from atmospheric precipitation which was preserved at that time research has shown a decrease in total nitrogen concentration in most of the analyzed ponds an average decline of 30 on the other hand phosphorus ions are better able to adsorb onto soil particles and tend to remain in the soil profile and in sediments research did not show a change pattern in the concentration of ptot in pond water at the point of activation of outflow from the studied ponds 
7088,the study aims to examine the effect of ponds on changes in water quality in a young glacial river catchment the goal was to identify situations where a periodic hydrographic network is formed in outflow free areas which is connected with a higher order receiving area as well as to study the circulation of matter in this type of system this study answers the following key question do ponds affected by areal pollution substantially affect water quality in streams in periods where they become joined with the hydrographic network the purpose of the research was to identify patterns associated with the functioning of ponds in young glacial areas in northern poland on the example of the borucinka catchment ponds were selected in order to generate a study sample characterized by different types of land use local hydrology and pond surface area the study focused on the effects of catchment land use on pond water quality and the effects of periodic changes in local hydrology linkage of surface flows with bodies of water on pond water quality research has shown that land use in a pond catchment yields a substantial effect on pond water quality the basic reason for the higher concentration of selected ions is close proximity to farms that generate wastewater which reaches bodies of water in the study area seasonal changes in the concentration of biogenic substances were not observed in ponds only notable changes in the concentration of total nitrogen were observed due the episodic formation of a hydrographic network consisting of a collection of linked depressions one of the more surprising findings was that permanently isolated ponds which theoretically collect catchment pollutants all the time are characterized by good hydrochemical conditions keywords ponds water quality land use young glacial areas closed circulation areas 1 introduction ponds are a very important part of geographic space in young glacial areas due to their capacity to retain water as well as their numerous hydrologic functions and biological value oertli et al 2005 they are highly susceptible to external influence due to their specific morphometry ecological characteristics davis et al 2008 oertli et al 2009 as well as a frequent lack of connectivity with rivers gerke et al 2010 the location of a pond in a given type of catchment yields a number of consequences associated with pond functioning and the formation of a specific ecological state in the past most researchers argued that ponds form closed circulation areas which are not part of a main hydrographic system this would make ponds a physical trap for pollutants moving across a catchment waldon 2012 however more recent research suggests that ponds sometimes do connect with other bodies of water which produces consequences not only in terms of water circulation and water resources in a catchment but also in terms of water chemistry through a loss of pollutants previously deposited therein tiner 2003 argues that the pond and pond catchment system constitutes an isolated feature of geographic space at the same time due to natural and anthropogenic changes ponds and their catchments can form entire hydrographic systems along with other bodies of water in their vicinity if a hydraulic connection is created in one way or another ponds strongly affect catchment water circulation by serving as a natural reservoir of rainwater brooks 2004 the research literature suggests that many natural determinants physical biological geographic hydrologic meteorological affect pond water chemistry hayashi et al 2004 however it is the intensification of agriculture that represents the greatest threat to ponds by indirectly accelerating the gradual decline of ponds through the excessive use of phosphorus fertilizers schoumans et al 2014 yan et al 2016 excessive phosphorus in water contributes to the massive development of phytoplankton organisms as a consequence the transparency of the water is reduced submerging vegetation subsides this is the effect of deteriorating light conditions this leads to the reconstruction of the existing fauna excessive supply of phosphorus also leads to the depletion of oxygen resources in the bottom layer of water reservoirs which leads to the disappearance of deep water fauna also climate change adversely affects the ponds and above all on the vegetation structure hydrologic function and biodiversity johnson and poiani 2016 changes in pond water chemistry should be associated with vertical water exchange or atmospheric and evaporation as well as horizontal water exchange in the form of groundwater influx and loss for this second element winter and rosenberry 1995 turner and townley 2006 and kacimov 2007 indicate that lakes and ponds in lowland areas are usually hydraulically connected to a shallow groundwater system in effect pond water chemistry should be reflective of rainwater chemistry or groundwater chemistry however this is not the case in many instances in such cases it is reasonable to presume that surface water influx occurs at certain times of the year thanks to changes in catchment water levels golus and bajkiewicz grabowska 2016 hence pond water chemistry depends first and foremost on the source of water ion chemistry of ponds and lakes water provides important information about the sources of dissolved ions weathering and hydrogeochemical processes as well as anthropogenic activities taking place in the lake environment singh et al 2016 while ponds do differ in terms of their hydrologic origin it is also a fact that recharge is dominated by two sources of water atmospheric and groundwater influx it is also quite possible that other environmental sources affect the water chemistry of ponds lowenstein and risacher 2009 first and foremost this is applicable to land use in the studied pond catchments relief atmospheric precipitation anthropogenic pollution and seasonal plant growth patterns yet other factors that may affect pond water chemistry include pond morphometry lischeid and kalettka 2012 work on ponds in northern germany lischeid and kalettka 2012 has shown that these key factors explain 90 of variance in pond water chemistry finally remaining factors include land use agricultural pollution primary production and type of soil cover it is important to note that ponds are highly sensitive to external factors due to their unique morphometry and hydrology gałczyńska et al 2011 the purpose of the paper is to discuss changes and differences in water chemistry in selected ponds based on water exchange type outflow free flow through and land use in the direct catchment i e woodland agricultural immediate vicinity of a farm this will make it possible to assess how different water circulation patterns and land use affect water chemistry in the studied ponds the research results will help us understand how ponds function as well as how they are comparable to one another 2 methods most of the research consisted of fieldwork which commenced in november of 2012 and was completed in october of 2014 yielding a total of 15 field excursions the study area consisted of the borucinka river catchment in the kaszubski lake district found in northern poland as an example of areas covered by the last glaciations ten ponds were studied in this study area figs 1 and 2 most of the ponds were located in the western part of the studied catchment this particular area is characterized by significant seasonal changes in the local hydrographic structure manifested in the form of a periodically emerging hydrographic network that connects ponds together this unique study area made it possible to determine the effects of changes in local water circulation patterns on pond water chemistry research has shown that ponds no 2 4 and 8 are permanently outflow free while the remaining seven ponds are periodically connected with the area river network in addition ponds were selected for research purposes based on key differences in catchment land use 1 agricultural land use 2 forest land use 3 farm adjacent land use or very close proximity to a working farm this choice of ponds made it possible to determine which forms of land use produce the largest effects on pond water quality a multi parameter hach hq40d gauge was used in the course of the fieldwork to determine water parameters such as ph and electrolytic conductivity water samples collected in the field were then analyzed at the hydrochemical laboratory at the department of hydrology at the university of gdańsk the concentrations of selected cations na nh4 mg2 k ca2 as well as anions cl no2 no3 po4 3 so4 2 were determined using a dionex ics 1100 capillary ion chromatograph with ionpac as 22 4 250 mm and cs16 5 250 mm columns at 30 c using dionex concentrate as 22 and methanesulfonic acid msa as a eluents for the analysis of anions and cations respectively for the filtration of water samples we used 0 45 µs milliphore membrane moreover total nitrogen ntot and total phosphorus ptot were determined via colorimetry using a merck nova 400 spectrophotometer instrumental calibration was carried out using multi element standard solution for cations ca2 k mg2 na multi element ic standard solution for anions cl so4 2 no3 po4 3 no2 and mono element calibration solution for ammonium nh4 ion calibration was based on 7 points obtained diluting suitably batch solutions in the range 0 1 50 ppm experimental uncertainty was determined by 10 replicates of a suitable standard solution with a concentration level of ions enclosed within the calibration concentration range the margin of error for the analyses was less than 2 in addition water levels were measured in the field using gauges affixed in ponds the first measurement was assumed to be a base level while subsequent measurements were used as data to be compared with the base water level in order to assess fluctuations in the water level meteorologic data were obtained from the meteorologic station of the university of gdańsk located in borucin the classification of temperature conditions and precipitation for each studied month was done based on a method proposed by miętus et al 2005 the studied ponds fall within three different categories of land use 1 agricultural 2 woodland 3 farm adjacent the dominant type of land use in the study area is agricultural mostly arable land while this is the primary land use in each of the studied areas only some study areas were classified as agricultural in nature the share of woodland is relatively low although ponds surrounded by relatively large woodland areas were classified as woodland type as forested areas provide some measure of protection from the influx of pollutants some of the studied catchments were located adjacent to working farms featuring residential infrastructure which may yield substantial amounts of pollution to ponds these ponds were classified as farm adjacent table 1 the work uses various statistical calculations comprehensive perkal index and grouping by ward method among others 3 results 3 1 meteorological situation during the research period the annual atmospheric precipitation total for the study period hydrologic years 2013 and 2014 was lower than the long term average for the period 1961 2000 668 5 mm and stood at 614 9 mm in 2013 and 598 2 mm in 2014 however average annual air temperatures were higher than the long term average during the study period 6 8 c and stood at 7 3 c in 2013 and 9 0 c in 2014 the highest average monthly air temperatures were noted in july 18 1 20 2 c fig 3 shows the distribution of monthly atmospheric precipitation totals and air temperatures 3 2 changes in the amount of water stored in each pond research has shown that water levels in the studied ponds change frequently fig 4 fluctuations of water levels were measured with a tape in relation to the adopted fixed reference point where the first measurement was considered as initial zero and the remaining measurements were referred to the first one maximum water levels noted in all the studied ponds occurred in may of 2014 due to a large atmospheric event preceding the measurement date high water levels were also noted in april of 2013 the pond water level maximum is fleeting in nature as it is caused by the melting of the snow cover higher water levels in the winter and spring are not only due to higher atmospheric rainfall but also due to limited losses caused by evaporation in low air temperatures low pond water levels are noted in the summer months when evaporation is not offset by atmospheric fig 5 minimum water levels were noted in november in the case of all ponds beyond pond no 5 where the lowest water levels were recorded in july the pond water level fluctuation range is quite large ranging from 27 cm to 98 5 cm fig 4 the largest fluctuations are noted for ponds with the smallest surface area except for pond 4 which appears to have a large surface area in the map fig 1 but also exhibits a large fluctuation in water level pond no 1 has an area of 0 05 ha and pond no 3 has an area of 0 04 ha both are characterized by a periodic disappearance of their water content the pond featuring the third smallest surface area pond no 9 0 24 ha is characterized by the largest fluctuations in water level research has also shown that large changes in water level occur in ponds with the smallest mean depth of less than 1 m ponds no 6 and 9 0 7 and 0 9 m respectively ponds with the largest surface area and capacity are characterized by smaller fluctuations in water levels ponds no 5 and 7 were observed to experience the smallest water level fluctuations 3 3 hydrologic characteristics of the studied ponds seasonal changes in the hydrologic function of the ten studied ponds were observed in the course of the research for most of the studied period they function as out of flow ponds fig 6 at this time the accumulation of matter flows from the catchment to the ponds in the period of high retention in the catchment after spring snow thaws or after very intense precipitation the ponds retention capacity and the overflowing of water to the lower located objects is completed in this way a periodic river network is formed connecting the ponds with each other during this time the accumulated matter is leached out and transferred through the waterway to other parts of the catchment in the period of increased evaporation some of the ponds dry up fig 6 ponds no 9 and 10 were flow through ponds from the beginning of the observation period on november 28 2012 on the other hand ponds no 3 5 6 and 7 were observed to experience surface water flow on december 19 2012 pond no 1 was observed to experience surface water flow on january 13 2013 due to the increased water retention of the catchment surface flow was still observed in the case of all of the above listed ponds in the course of surveying on april 16 2013 outflow from ponds decreased to zero by may mostly due to increased evaporation the quantity of water stored in ponds decreases in the summer and autumn months which leads to lower water levels in ponds what was observed during the study all the studied ponds were outflow free in throughout the study period ponds no 9 and 10 periodically joined the local river network following spring snowmelt events in 2014 a relatively warm winter and low atmospheric precipitation forced other ponds to remain outflow free on may 26 2014 a large atmospheric precipitation event in the studied catchment and greater surface flow expanded the local river network with some of the studied ponds temporarily becoming outflow type ponds ponds no 1 3 5 6 7 9 10 the remaining three ponds nos 2 4 8 remained outflow free throughout the entire study period fig 6 3 4 the concentration of selected physical and chemical indicators 3 4 1 electrolytic conductivity the highest mean values of electrolytic conductivity for the entire study period were calculated for pond no 1 153 8 µs cm 1 while the highest measured values were noted for ponds experiencing the highest degree of human impact ponds no 1 3 9 the lowest mean electrolytic conductivity was calculated in the case of pond no 2 which is a pond without outflows 23 4 µs cm 1 the least changing values of electrolytic conductivity were noted for outflow free pond no 4 table 2 the other studied ponds were characterized by low values of electrolytic conductivity in effect it may be argued that ponds are recharged mostly by atmospheric precipitation that is characterized by low electrolytic conductivity elevated values of water electrolytic conductivity were noted in the winter months and in the course of spring snowmelt events 3 4 2 ph levels the mean ph values obtained for the studied ponds over the course of the study period were close to neutral ranging from 6 3 for pond no 3 to 7 4 for pond no 1 the mean ph for all the studied ponds was 6 9 while the minimum was 5 8 pond no 3 and the maximum was 8 9 pond no 2 the ph range over the study period was quite significant table 2 slightly basic ph was detected in the studied ponds in the summer months while slightly acidic ph was noted mainly in the spring and winter months 3 5 characteristics of selected predominant ions bicarbonate was found to be the predominant anion in the studied ponds all the studied ponds are considered to be low mineral content bicarbonate is formed in the majority of cases from the dissolution of carbon dioxide in water and also the leaching of carbonate containing rocks major 2012 benjamin 2014 essington 2015 the mean maximum and minimum concentration of bicarbonate varies quite substantially between the studied ponds the mean concentration of bicarbonate ranged from 11 80 mg dm 3 in pond no 2 to 86 44 mg dm 3 in pond no 1 the bicarbonate mean for all the studied ponds was 26 31 mg dm 3 the largest changes in bicarbonate content were noted for ponds experiencing the greatest degree of human impact where the pond catchment features a working farm in the immediate vicinity ponds no 1 3 9 fig 7 chloride is the second most commonly occurring anion in the water chemistry of the studied ponds chloride enters bodies of surface water mostly via atmospheric precipitation as well as the leaching of rocks and soils some chloride also enters pond water as part of wastewater streams labaugh et al 2016 mccarter and price 2017 the mean concentration of chloride in the studied ponds ranges from 2 94 mg dm 3 in pond no 2 to 6 94 mg dm 3 in pond no 9 the mean value for all the studied ponds is 4 27 mg dm 3 fig 7 the pond water concentration of chloride was found to increase following intense rainfall which suggests that the primary source of this ion is atmospheric precipitation the calcium ion is the predominant cation in the studied pond water the mean concentration of calcium in the studied ponds was in the range from 2 97 mg dm 3 in pond no 2 to 28 09 mg dm 3 in pond no 1 the mean value for all the studied ponds was 7 43 mg dm 3 pond no 1 is characterized by an especially broad spectrum of calcium concentrations over the study period 11 97 39 38 mg dm 3 relative to the other studied ponds all of the other studied ponds are characterized by more stable concentrations of the calcium ion the smallest fluctuations in the calcium concentration were noted in permanently outflow free ponds ponds no 2 and 4 as well as in pond no 7 which is the largest surface area and overall water capacity fig 7 3 6 biogenic substance content in water the paper covers biogenic substances in pond water by analyzing total nitrogen ntot and total phosphorus ptot as comprehensive indicators of biogenic pollution in pond water the mean ntot concentration did not vary substantially in the studied ponds lowest concentrations were noted in pond no 6 1 78 mg dm 3 while the highest were noted in pond no 3 2 73 mg dm 3 the mean ntot concentration for all the studied ponds was 2 07 mg dm 3 fig 7 the ntot concentration range for ponds is similar to that in large lakes while the mean ntot concentration in ponds is somewhat higher than that in most larger lakes the ntot content in the study period varied over fairly short and irregular periods of time it may be stated that it is stored in various features of the ecosystem to be gradually released into the water pond no 1 was characterized by the largest ntot concentration range in the study period from 0 97 to 5 01 mg dm 3 fig 7 in most of the 10 studied ponds the lowest ntot concentrations were noted at the beginning of the 2013 hydrologic year november december analyzing individual forms of total nitrogen ntot a marked increase in n no3 and n no2 concentrations was observed in may after very intense rainfall during this period concentration values of n no3 increased about three times the mean concentration of ptot varied significantly between the ten studied ponds the highest mean concentration was noted for pond no 3 0 728 mg dm 3 while the lowest was noted for pond no 2 0 114 mg dm 3 the mean for all the studied ponds was 0 204 mg dm 3 the two ponds were also characterized by the largest and smallest range of ptot concentrations in the study period pond no 3 ranged from 0 251 to 1 750 mg dm 3 while pond no 2 ranged from 0 063 to 0 208 mg dm 3 fig 7 the concentration of ptot measured in this study resembles that obtained by researchers monitoring water quality in ponds situated in the olsztyńskie lake district in northeastern poland range from 0 002 to 0 900 mg dm 3 and mean of 0 241 mg dm 3 koc et al 2001 the ptot concentrations obtained in the current pond study are higher than those for lakes in the kaszubski lake district the ptot concentration for lakes ranged from below the detection limit to 0 11 mg dm 3 for lake surface water to 0 54 mg dm 3 for lake floor water lange 2005 a study conducted two years later produced a concentration range from 0 06 to 0 35 mg dm 3 borowiak 2007 no seasonal increases or decreases in the total phosphorus concentration were observed in the studied pond water 3 7 relationship between the geographic environment and water chemistry as in the case of the highest concentrations the largest concentration ranges were also observed for farm adjacent ponds ponds no 1 3 9 on the other hand pond no 7 or the pond with the largest surface area was characterized by a small concentration range in the case of most of the studied ions fig 7 a large pond surface area and large water capacity may attenuate the concentration fluctuation range of many ions and elements the largest ranges were identified for ponds with the smallest surface area which may prove the effect of area and capacity on water quality in the case of a comprehensive determination of the quality of water in the studied mesh and an attempt to refer the obtained results to the prevailing conditions of the geographical environment a number of statistics were calculated the obtained results were referred to the management of the basin ie the dominant method of its use table 1 the obtained results were also referred to the hydrological type represented by the given ponds out of flow or periodically flow the obtained results were also compared with the surface and capacity of the ponds fig 7 is presented comprehensive perkal index which can be used to order ponds on the number line based on selected concentrations for the perkal index the paper uses the hellwig critical interval method in the classification process for k 0 5 the weights of all the variables examined were equal in this study high values of the perkal index imply low water quality in the examined ponds four pond groups were identified using perkal index values group one includes pond no 1 characterized by a very high perkal index value worst water quality group two includes ponds with a high perkal index value low water quality ponds no 3 and 9 group three includes ponds with a medium perkal index value medium water quality ponds no 8 and 10 group four includes ponds with a low perkal index value or best water quality ponds no 2 4 5 6 7 fig 8 the obtained results are shown in the form of a tree diagram featuring a multi characteristic classification all the examined ponds are divided into two groups a and b group a ponds are numbered 2 4 5 6 7 and 8 this group is characterized by low total nitrogen chloride sodium and total phosphorus content group b includes ponds no 1 3 9 and 10 the main characteristics of this group are the following high total nitrogen chloride and magnesium content fig 9 table 3 provides values of the comprehensive perkal index along with a classification based on multiple characteristics the relationship between index values and the classification may be observed here as ponds classified as group a are characterized by low and medium index values and ponds classified as group b are characterized by high and very high index values a clear effect of land use on the concentration of the elements studied was observed the most numerous group are ponds classified as type a table 3 characterized by a low value of the synthetic index i e the best quality of water from all examined facilities this group includes ponds whose water catchments have been classified as forest no 5 and 6 table 1 the trees around the ponds constitute the buffer zone of vegetation they separate the water of the ponds from the areas of cultivation and farms ryszkowski and kędziora 1987 according to gałczyńska and gamrat 2007 the occurrence around trees especially in reservoirs without vegetation on the water surface has a positive effect on nutrient concentrations and lowering the water temperature on the other hand ponds found close to farms featured the worst water quality among the studied ponds type b in comprehensive perkal index table 3 this may indicate a significant impact of point pollution in the form of residential and commercial buildings ponds exposed to high impact of farms very often not connected to the sewage system may be a receiver of economic wastewater to a large extent agricultural pollutants brought to the ponds come from the liquid manure stored in the farms the remaining ponds were classified as agricultural ponds no 2 4 7 8 10 table 1 characterized by the dominant type of use of their catchment in the form of agricultural land significant impact of farms and buffer in the form of forest areas has not been observed these ponds were characterized by medium or low synthetic index and mostly belong to type a exception is pond no 10 belonging to group b table 3 the reservoir no 7 was also characterized by a low value of the measured synthetic index i e the best water quality the pond has the largest area 0 96 ha and capacity 8582 8 m3 large surface area and capacity can affect the reduction and equalization of the amplitude of the concentrations of the tested compounds cl hco3 k mg2 ca2 by diluting the impurities getting into its water depth the group of ponds characterized by a low value of the synthetic index also included two ponds with no outflow no 2 and 4 it is possible that in the ecosystem of small reservoirs accumulation of pollutants occurs in bottom sediments and the process of their release depends on many factors lack of connection of this type of ponds with periodic watercourse causes that pollution from other parts of the basin do not get into the permanently outflow ponds so there is also no possibility of excitation of pollutants accumulated in the sediments into the water depth 4 discussion changes in pond water levels are large ranging from 27 to 98 5 cm with an average of 55 cm and depend on local relief sediment structure ground permeability and meteorologic conditions labaugh et al 2016 the greatest degree of stability is noted for ponds with the largest surface area and volume the smallest ponds tend to dry out in periods of accelerated evaporation for the most part of the examined period the ponds function as outflow depressions at this time the accumulation of matter in the reservoirs flows primarily from the basin at high catchment water stages following spring snowmelts or very heavy precipitation some ponds reach their capacity and overflow onto lower areas or bodies of water this leads to the formation of a temporary river network connecting a number of different ponds at that time the river network is transported with accumulated matter into other parts of the catchment the studied ponds are characterized by low water mineral content and low electrical conductivity which is true of most ponds located in young glacial areas as reported by many different researchers including gołdyn et al 2015 and golus and bajkiewicz grabowska 2016 the concentrations of main cations and anions were also low which suggests a main role of atmospheric precipitation in pond recharge the effect of land use on the concentration of the examined elements in the pond waters was noted the best water quality was detected in the ponds whose catchments were classified as woodland type a in comprehensive perkal index the trees around the ponds constitute the buffer zone of vegetation they separate the water of the ponds from the areas of cultivation and farms ryszkowski and kędziora 1987 according to gałczyńska and gamrat 2007 the occurrence around trees especially in reservoirs without vegetation on the water surface has a positive effect on nutrient concentrations and lowering the water temperature on the other hand ponds found close to farms featured the worst water quality among the studied ponds type b in comprehensive perkal index this may indicate a significant impact of point pollution in the form of residential and commercial buildings ponds exposed to high impact of farms very often not connected to the sewage system may be a receiver of economic wastewater to a large extent agricultural pollutants brought to the ponds come from the liquid manure stored in the farms the reservoir no 7 was also characterized by a low value of the measured synthetic index i e the best water quality the pond has the largest area 0 96 ha and capacity 8582 8 m3 large surface area and capacity can affect the reduction and equalization of the amplitude of the concentrations of the tested compounds cl hco3 k mg2 ca2 by diluting the impurities getting into its water

of the basin do not get into the permanently outflow ponds so there is also no possibility of excitation of pollutants accumulated in the sediments into the water depth a clear effect of land use on the amount of concentrations of the analyzed elements in the ponds was observed the best quality of water from all the examined objects was characterized by ponds whose basins were classified as forest in turn the ponds adjacent to agricultural holdings had the worst water quality from all examined facilities this may indicate a significant impact of point pollution in the form of residential and commercial buildings the group of ponds representing the agricultural catchment type is characterized by moderate concentrations of the analyzed compounds there was no clear influence of the change in the hydrological function of the examined ponds the appearance of periodic watercourses connecting the examined objects on the quality of their waters maximum concentrations of ntot and ptot do not show any tendencies during the research period in individual ponds the increase in concentrations occurred at different times only the increase of n no3 and n no2 content was found after very intense rainfall in may and the episodic appearance of the periodic river network such an increase in the content of nutrients after rainfall is natural nitrates get into the water mainly with precipitation and surface runoff the mobility of different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus varies in the natural environment nitrate migrates easily in water which explains the decreasing concentration of ntot in ponds whose function changed from outflow free to flow through conversely phosphorus based ions feature a greater tendency to adsorb onto soil particles and tend to remain in the soil profile and in deposits in the context of mean boundary ntot concentrations established through monitoring research on lakes in the kaszubskie lake district in northern poland borowiak 2007 the water quality of the studied ponds may be described as either moderately good ponds no 6 5 2 8 4 or poor ponds no 3 9 1 10 7 the mean ntot concentration in lakes in the kaszubski lake district ranged from 0 2 to 3 5 mg dm 3 in 2005 lange 2005 the range in 2007 was found to be 0 9 to 2 53 mg dm 3 borowiak 2007 in the context of mean boundary concentrations for ptot established as part of lake water monitoring studies in the kaszubskie lake district in the northwestern part of poland borowiak 2007 the water quality of the studied ponds may be described as either poor ponds no 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 or very poor ponds no 1 and 3 small ponds can significantly impact the hydrological regime of river basins including on downstream river flow quality of river waters and quantified evaporation losses wisser et al 2010 it appears particularly important to determine the effects of changes in water resources and changes in water quality at times when ponds become linked with the river network the occurrence of areas without surface outflows and this includes ponds stops some material from directly reaching the regional river system and instead it becomes deposited or temporarily stored in them koc et al 2001 grochowska et al 2004 periodic changes in the river network help include ponds in the surface drainage system via intermittent watercourses this situation makes it very important to identify not only water circulation pathways but also material transport pathways and material deposition patterns the temporal variability of this supply flow is dependent first and foremost on changes in weather conditions major 2012 young glacial catchments such as the borucianka catchment feature a large number of ponds and are characterized by a different pattern of pollutant circulation than typical upland lowland and mountain catchments this difference is associated with the pond capability to accumulate pollutants at low and medium water stages in the catchment and release pollutants at high water stages hierarchical and branching river networks interact with dynamic watershed disturbances such as storms and floods with consequences for biological and chemical conditions benda et al 2004 this is confirmed by verhoeven et al 2017 who note that the most important feature of catchment functioning is the water transport process hence extreme meteorologic events constitute a special case in young glacial catchments and yield large quantities of water in a short period of time often triggering flood conditions as in the case of flooding in quebec canada saad et al 2015 extreme events help flush out and transport nitrogen compounds and less mobile phosphorus compounds away from ponds and wetlands as well as the soil dodds and smith 2017 the first group consists of streams located on the floor of a glacial valley where the water chemistry is linked with a longer period of water circulation in the catchment as well as groundwater recharge the second group consists of streams located in moraine uplands and recharged almost exclusively by atmospheric precipitation and ponds triggering surface flow higher concentrations of total nitrogen were observed in intermittent streams functioning at high catchment water stages and redirecting excess water away from outflow free depressions filled completely with water on the other hand an increase in the total phosphorus concentration in surface waters was noted following heavy rainfall events these types of events lead to increased migration of biogenic substances in a catchment hence the water chemistry of intermittent streams is largely a reflection of water chemistry observed in ponds differences in concentration may suggest that permanent streams systematically redirect biogenic substances away from their recharge areas while intermittent streams only periodically redirect pollutants accumulated throughout the course of a year at the same time the inclusion of ponds in the drainage system does not affect their water chemistry to any significant extent the occurrence of ponds is associated with vertical exchange especially atmospheric precipitation and evaporation lehsten et al 2011 which is readily observable in the studied ponds this means that the volume of water in a pond depends on the stream of air exchange with water although correlations between water levels and climate indices are characterized by a one year delay in response this effect favors increased evaporation in the summer and increased atmospheric precipitation in the winter in effect it is possible to speak of a certain seasonal variability in water resources as well as a seasonal variability of water quality as discussed by anshumali and ramanathan 2007 however many hydrologists argue that ponds are also connected with groundwater sources lehsten et al 2011 although this was not observed in the studied ponds as a result water circulation in a pond is more complex than one would expect according to hayashi et al 2016 the water balance of individual wetlands is strongly influenced by runoff from the catchment and the exchange of groundwater between the central pond and its moist margin land use practices in the catchment have a sensitive effect on runoff and hence the water balance surface and subsurface storage and connectivity among individual wetlands controls the diversity of pond permanence within a wetland complex resulting in a variety of eco hydrological functionalities necessary for maintaining the integrity of prairie wetland ecosystems the borucianka study confirms research by hayashi et al 2016 especially in the area of runoff pollutant effects on the water chemistry of bodies of water as well as the effect of land use on the overall functioning of the catchment changes occurring in the catchment and human impact often determine the permanence of ponds and hydrologic changes therein given that ponds rarely make surface contact with the entire hydrographic network their water quality depends primarily on vertical water exchange and especially on precipitation sobel et al 2003 on the other hand lischeid and kalettka 2012 argue that pond water retention times and water exchange pathways serve as the main determinants of the stability of water chemistry in ponds other ideas are proposed by golus and bajkiewicz grabowska 2016 who argue that pond water quality is determined by water through flow according to yu et al 2015 small shallow seasonal wetlands with short hydroperiod play an important role in the entrapment of organic matter and nutrients and due to their wide distribution in determining the water quality of watersheds as a result it is very important to study the hydrochemistry of ponds as well as the processes that affect ponds including pollutant accumulation precipitation and transport in addition it is important to determine the effect of the amount and intensity of any precipitation in the pond area on hydrologic conditions including the connection of ponds with main hydrographic networks likelihood of the outflow of previously deposited pollutants and changes in pond water chemistry it seems that a more integrated and holistic approach to environmental monitoring is now needed petrie et al 2015 water appears to escape ponds in the course of heavy rainfall via underground as well as surface pathways chernet et al 2001 this process may occur also in some other cases work by kalettka and rudat 2006 appears to confirm this finding by showing that some moraine ponds in northeastern germany possess a tendency to overflow at high water stages the same was observed in the case of the studied ponds what is important is that this is not a local phenomenon research work by downing 2010 shows that small bodies of water play an important role in both water and sediment circulation not only on a regional scale but also on a global scale changes in the concentration of biogenic substances deserve special attention as the influx of pollutants is particularly dangerous to pond water this applies not only to point sources of pollution but to the rate of flow which is high and this leads to an increase in water pollution evaporation is yet another relevant process in this case rapid evaporation across open water surfaces in the summer months leads not only to a reduction in water level but also changes in water chemistry as well as the onset of eutrophication and overgrowth in the pond basin according to young and abnizova 2011 a positive water balance is highly relevant to pond functioning as are various types of hydrologic connections recharge and water loss in ponds are regulated primarily by pond morphometry land use soil conditions in the catchment as well as seasonal changes in climate conditions and hydrologic conditions as shown by the research results in the studied catchment the chemical stability of pond water is larger in the presence of a larger number of sources of recharge the hydrologic resilience of ponds is limited in cases where most of the recharge arrives from underground sources or comes from atmospheric precipitation ponds are not very permanent features of the natural landscape according to pienkowski et al 2010 more than 43 of ponds present across moraine areas of poland in the 19th century disappeared by the end of the 20th century according to gołdyn et al 2015 the most important factors affecting water chemistry in ponds during years with average precipitation are pond morphometry and pond catchment morphometry however in the event of a drought the factors that determine pond water quality are the type of vegetation and pond depth nevertheless the most important factor determining pond water quality is the length of the time period when catchment soils are moist and hydrographic sites including ponds are filled with water gołdyn et al 2015 5 conclusions research has shown that land use strongly affects the concentration and concentration range of the studied ions and biogenic substances the largest mean concentrations and their fluctuations were noted for ponds located near working farms this may suggest that pollution originates mostly from point sources such as farms as well as areal sources such as the runoff generated by agricultural fields ponds surrounded by a forest buffer zone are characterized by lower concentrations of the studied ions trees separate ponds from land used for agriculture and from working farm infrastructure however research did not show an effect of woodland belts on the reduction of fluctuations in the concentration of selected ions and elements and consequently greater chemical stability on the other hand the largest pond in the study sample is characterized by significant regularity and small range of concentration of ions and biogenic substances a pond s large volume and surface area may help improve its chemical stability the same is true of ponds which permanently remain outflow free one surprising finding in this study was the fact that permanently outflow free ponds which theoretically constantly accumulate pollutants arriving from their catchments without a pathway for them to out migrate via a temporary hydrographic network are characterized by good hydrochemical conditions it is certainly possible that in small ponds the accumulation of pollutants occurs in floor sediments and their release is determined by a variety of factors different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus show different mobility rates in the natural environment nitrate readily migrates in water which is why ntot concentrations were found to increase in ponds affected by a change in hydrologic function if a hydrographic network is able to connect individual ponds on a periodic basis then this forms a pathway for pollution to follow however it cannot be determined whether the increase in concentrations was caused by the occurrence of periodic flow in ponds or was caused by a large supply from atmospheric precipitation which was preserved at that time research has shown a decrease in total nitrogen concentration in most of the analyzed ponds an average decline of 30 on the other hand phosphorus ions are better able to adsorb onto soil particles and tend to remain in the soil profile and in sediments research did not show a change pattern in the concentration of ptot in pond water at the point of activation of outflow from the studied ponds 
7089,a comprehensive framework composed of stormwater indices e g stormwater runoff runoff pollution and anthropogenic heat is proposed to facilitate selection of key areas for sponge like urban reconstruction based on the integration of emergy analysis and gis models a case study in shenzhen is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in aiding the implementation of sponge city reconstruction specifically natural and man made releases are identified and accounted for in emergy units sej when compared to the emergy values of natural releases 4 99e 14 7 59e 14 sej and man made releases 1 79e 14 5 8e 16 sej within the shenzhen basic ecological control line designated as an ecological preservation area the emergy values of both types of releases outside the basic ecological control line are higher ranging from 7 59e 14 sej to 8 32e 14 sej for the former and from 5 8e 16 sej to 1 86e 17 sej for the latter nine sub districts in shenzhen china such as industrial parks transportation and bare land for construction are preliminarily chosen as areas for potential sponge like urban reconstruction on the basis of man made releases and are then confirmed by examining natural releases the proposed emergy gis framework can bridge the gap between empirical studies and standardize research to ensure that the results of the green infrastructure plan live up to the rhetoric keywords sponge city emergy gis natural release man made release 1 introduction many unpleasant consequences of urbanization such as urban waterlogging environmental pollution and the urban heat island effect li et al 2013 qin et al 2012 have frequently been observed in cities around the world to address these problems the concept of urban resilience which is the ability of an urban region to bounce back following major natural events bunster ossa 2013 meerow et al 2016 has become popular among urban planners and designers in this light the low impact development lid concept of sponge cities has recently been introduced jiang et al 2018 this term is associated with the ability of an urban area to tolerate undesired disturbances bunster ossa 2013 a sponge city refers to a city in which stormwater management at a moderate scale as well as urban microclimate is strengthened by sponge like urban reconstruction specifically a sponge city relies on green and gray infrastructure for managing runoff usepa 2013 the sustainable stormwater management and its adaptability to climate change gains a growing concern shishegar et al 2018 wang et al 2018 however a completely fresh start for an already constructed city is not practical instead urban reconstruction of certain areas in a city according to the local situation might be a more practical approach at present the most important question is how to select suitable areas for sponge city practices to the best of our knowledge there are very few studies dedicated to identifying the most suitable target areas for sponge city initiative jiang et al 2018 li et al 2017 although some studies focused on lid development in residential areas martin et al 2015 sponge city reconstruction is in urgent need of a city level analysis xia et al 2017 additionally aside from the weighted green infrastructure spatial planning gisp model developed by meerow and newell 2017 there has been no discussion of how to screen appropriate areas for sponge city practices with high resolution in other words there are no ground rules for judging where to begin sponge like urban reconstruction from a practical perspective li and bergen 2018 emergy analysis is a powerful environmental economic theory and a systematic analytical method based on systems ecology environmental engineering and environmental economics odum 1996 according to this theory the systems of nature and society on all scales are involved in a universal energy hierarchy which forms an energy network brown and ulgiati 2004b each environmental item that constitutes a certain system can be quantified by emergy accounting odum 1996 analysis of emergy in combination with energy materials and other parameters has been applied to quantitatively evaluate sustainability in individual buildings activity processes urban areas and countries amaral et al 2016 the relationships between land use and socioeconomic factors can be discerned by analyzing emergy huang et al 2006 moreover some studies examined specific flows among inputs internal processes and outputs in terms of emergy theory for bridging evaluations of and strategies for urban sustainability liu et al 2011 mellino et al 2014 in general these assessments combine indicators with weighting factors that sometimes lead to a subjective or separated conclusion in contrast the assessment results are evaluated and synthesized into common summary of energetic flows in this context the emergy approach can be regarded as a useful tool for analysis and policy making and can therefore also be used as an effective tool to select areas for sponge like urban reconstruction planning mellino et al 2015 mellino and ulgiati 2015 pulselli 2010 due to the distributions of specific flows on large scales spatial information can be considered to be the crucial factor for analysis and policy making emergy theory is enhanced by the use of geographical information systems gis the integration of emergy and gis has been highlighted as a potential method for regional studies and policy making pulselli 2010 a number of studies have investigated the integration of emergy with gis using a relatively advanced emergy gis framework huang et al 2007 developed a spatial model to simulate the energy and spatial hierarchy of an urban system huang et al 2007 chang and huang 2015 established an emergy gis framework incorporating the interactions between exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity for assessing a city s vulnerability to flooding chang and huang 2015 more recently the spatial distributions and quantities of renewable natural resources and net primary productivity were investigated in terms of emergy in japan wang et al 2016 china has experienced rapid urbanization and must confront the adverse effects of urbanization in fact china experimented with sponge like urban design ideas more than a decade ago to date thirty potential sponge city projects have been approved by the chinese central government jiang et al 2018 mof 2015 however no synthesized assessment has been established regarding the performance evaluation i e desired outcomes of china s sponge city project pecscp with specific indicators mohurd 2015 shenzhen is currently among those 30 cities as it has been suffering from urban waterlogging almost every year due to the dual pressures of its subtropical climate and rapid urbanization zhao et al 2006 as is typical of a rapidly urbanizing region shenzhen provides an ideal study site for exploring how to practically implement a sponge city project hence the present study attempts to identify the pivotal areas for sponge like urban reconstruction with an emergy gis approach in shenzhen to pursue water resilience and security in the context of climate change this approach will facilitate the effective management of stormwater and the urban heat island effect at moderate scales meanwhile the high precision information of environment economy system can be analyzed with feasible models in gis both quantitatively and visually xia et al 2017 2 material and methods 2 1 study area shenzhen one of the fastest growing cities in the world in the 1990s and the 2000s is in the southern guangdong province and sits south of the tropic of cancer over the past three decades shenzhen has grown from a tiny border town into a modern metropolis the amount of runoff in guangdong province is much higher than that in north china especially in shenzhen mohurd 2014 which requires much more sufficient water permeability during construction the study area is located in western shenzhen within the coordinates 22 3 n 22 9 n and 113 7 e 114 5 e fig 1 fig 1 also highlights the boundary lines of the

2011 2 3 the emergy gis framework emergy evaluation works in integrated systems rather than segments it also links inputs from human activities and environments to outputs in the system based on historical and real data to comprehensively answer questions about environmental and public management brown and ulgiati 2004a emergy is able to convert one unit of each product or service to a common unit namely the unit emergy value uev or emergy intensity solar equivalent joules joule sej j etc specifically the ratio of emergy to energy in sej unit is the transformity which is defined as the solar energy that produces or provides one unit of the specific outputs or services emergy methods aid ecosystem management and policy making especially in understanding human environmental interactions emergy can be integrated with gis in different approaches such as spatial analysis li and luo 2015 to form an emergy gis framework the emergy gis framework is an emergy analysis that is displayed visually and spatially using a gis therefore spatiotemporal information can be obtained on a larger scale in these studies wang et al 2016 the representation of spectral patterns can identify an organizational configuration pulselli 2010 a new emergy gis framework with the available energy indicators can be selected according to the pecscp mohurd 2015 and related studies agostinho et al 2008 different energy fluxes with different units can be integrated into emergy analysis mellino et al 2014 thus the selected emergy flows can be calculated and integrated to reflect the issues of interest the energy system diagrams showing emergy accounting are comprised of inflows internal processes and outflows huang et al 2011 here we pay attention to the outflows because they reflect crucial city issues that are in great need of a response the replacement of natural lands with impervious surfaces results in changes to the urban environment such as those to thermal and moisture properties colombert et al 2011 for instance the distribution of precipitation is influenced by the urban heat island effect colombert et al 2011 while an improved water environment mitigates the adverse effects of urban heat island rydin et al 2012 besides anthropogenic heat release plays an important role in urban heat island and needs to be addressed for climate adaption zhang et al 2013 overall the interaction between water and the thermal environment may play an important role in urban health coutts et al 2012 the integration of stormwater management managi et al 2016 and urban heat island management rydin et al 2012 concerns many disciplines such as geography hydrology and urban planning using the available data runoff huang et al 2011 tilley and brown 2006 nonpoint source pollution liu et al 2011 and anthropogenic heat liu et al 2011 lou et al 2015 are spatially quantified within the urban ecosystem to determine the most appropriate areas for sponge city practices in shenzhen mohurd 2015 2 3 1 emergy baselines odum et al 2000 elaborated that the inputs within the emergy network support emergy evaluations the global emergy reference baseline is defined as the main emergy inputs to the geobiosphere of the earth considering earth s energy absorption the emergy baseline was recalculated in 2000 15 83e 24 sej yr adopted by our study after its initial calculation in 1996 9 44e 24 sej yr odum et al 2000 the emergy baseline for 2000 was recently updated in 2015 to visualize and identify the areas with emergy we chose the 2000 emergy values as the baseline to ensure consistency with previous studies the results from the other studies bjorklund et al 2001 brandt williams 1999 are converted to baseline with specific coefficients specifically we only focus the outflows of emergy theory instead of the whole urban system thus all transformities in this study based on past studies were assumed to be the average values in shenzhen 2 3 2 stormwater runoff maps rainfall that exceeds the soil capacity becomes surface runoff as does the surface water in impervious areas brandt williams 1999 therefore the runoff that reaches land is calculated in seconds with the common water budget equation mellino et al 2014 1 q p et i where q is the stormwater runoff p is the yearly precipitation mbsm 2011 et is the yearly evapotranspiration and i is the infiltration into ground all these parameters are in mm here evapotranspiration can be ignored given a short observation time because one of the sponge city principles is that rainfall should soak into soil as soon as possible to eliminate runoff the short observation time only includes the precipitation process in each rainfall event therefore to model runoff in this study q p i simply describes runoff in our map to elaborate on this assumption stormwater runoff is described by the soil conservation service curve number scs cn model water infiltration into the ground is primarily governed by soil type moisture and land use etc to display these effects for different land use types different assignments are set for specific land uses according to the information provided by shi et al 2007 36 scenarios are assigned to 4 types of hydrological soil groups for nine types of land use in shenzhen table 1 the scs cn runoff equation is described as following usda 1986 2 q p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s p 0 2 s 0 p 0 2 s where q is surface runoff p is the precipitation and s is the potential maximum retention volume all of which are in mm and relate to surface depression vegetation infiltration and so on at the same time s is also related to the curve number cn for different land use types as mentioned above specifically the calculation equation of s is 3 s 25400 cn 254 where cn represents the runoff potential of land use governed by several factors which refers to a previous study by shi et al 2007 in shenzhen then the obtained runoff map is converted into energy using the following equation 4 en runoff v ρ water g where v is the volume of runoff water in m3 v q a a is the area in m2 ρ water is the water density 1e 6 g m3 and g is the gibbs free energy 4 82 j g brandt williams 1999 the uev is 1 06e 5 sej j and is derived from multiplying 6 31e 4 sej j brandt williams 1999 by 1 68 odum et al 2000 2 3 3 nonpoint source pollution maps nonpoint source pollution is caused by stormwater runoff carrying away natural and man made pollutants stormwater runoff in urban areas also contains pollutants that eventually contaminate receiving water bodies managi et al 2016 using long term hydrological impact assessment l thia models based on the scs cn specific event mean concentration emc values are assigned to different land use types to gain the nonpoint source pollution loading for each land use table 2 due to lack of the transformity of cod chemical oxygen demand the emergy value in cod can be derived from the emergy accounting of wastewater qin et al 2010 suggested that the first 50 of storm water is heavily polluted similar to wastewater to simplify the calculation the first 50 of stormwater runoff volume along with the concentration of cod table 2 were treated as wastewater in the present study hence the estimated pollutant loadings are obtained by using half the volume of the estimated runoff and emc lim et al 2006 bjorklund et al 2001 calculated the total energy in wastewater including the energy content in water and cod and suggested that the largest emergy contribution was wastewater itself in the present study the energy content in cod is calculated using following equation bjorklund et al 2001 5 en cod c cod e cod a 1 2 v water where e cod is the energy content in cod j which represents the organic material c cod g l is the concentration of cod e cod is the energy content in each gram of cod 3 4 kcal g haug 1993 a is 4186 j kcal 1 2 v water is half of the amount of runoff water in l which is considered to be wastewater cod is the only variable that is considered in the stormwater pollution model which is consistent with emergy accounting of wastewater in bjorklund et al 2001 thus to calculate the emergy value of cod based on the assumption that both water and wastewater constitute the wastewater the energy content of cod can be multiplied by the transformity of wastewater to obtain the emergy of cod the transformity of wastewater inflows and treated wastewater is 6 38e 6 sej j obtained by multiplying 3 80e 6 sej j bjorklund et al 2001 by 1 68 odum et al 2000 2 3 4 anthropogenic heat maps according to pecscp mohurd 2015 anthropogenic heat emissions ahe encourage a discussion of the urban heat island effect dhakal and hanaki 2002 moreover explicit combustion efficiency values are not available lu et al 2016 and neither is the proportion of energy consumption at the prefecture level therefore energy consumption structure is assumed to be uniform in western shenzhen in terms of energy types the energy sources consist of coal raw coal briquettes and washery coal oil crude oil gasoline kerosene and fuel oil and gas coal gas and natural gas electricity thermal energy and others wind and nuclear lu et al 2016 the composition of primary energy consumption was acquired in standard coal equivalents sce from the 2011 guangdong statistical yearbook coal 48 1 oil 29 1 electricity 19 1 and natural gas 3 7 for

three models were employed for three specific indicators the stormwater runoff map was associated with the pollution map then these maps were converted into emergy values by multiplying their transformities later maps were identified as either natural or man made water releases accordingly the areas with high emergy values can be identified stormwater runoff nonpoint source pollution and anthropogenic heat were identified individually and plotted on maps to spot the priority areas the natural release map was considered as the verification map 3 1 natural release maps in the present study stormwater runoff is regarded as uncontaminated natural runoff to obtain the emergy in runoff without human disturbance fig 3 exhibits the distribution of stormwater runoff in emergy units the calculation was at a 30 m scale the maximum spatial resolution available which was fairly detailed and suitable for implementation apparently stormwater runoff is associated with land use as seen in fig 3 and depends on the amount of rainfall infiltration characteristics such as impervious areas soil features and other factors in terms of emergy natural releases are higher beyond the shenzhen basic ecological control line ranging from 7 59e 14 sej to 8 32e 14 sej in addition the emergy flow was higher along the seacoast due to the land use types there commercial residential and water bodies though the emergy density is well distributed high value areas are concentrated zonally it indicates that soil and cover conditions moderately affect the distribution of stormwater runoff 3 2 man made release map nonpoint source pollution is mainly attributed to land use and human activities qin et al 2010 yusop et al 2005 similarly heat release is also derived from human activities both of these are regarded as the human made releases an overlay of both runoff pollution and heat releases yields the spatial distribution of man made releases fig 4 represents the distributions of emergy stock density sej 900 m2 in terms of nonpoint source pollution fig 4a and anthropogenic heat fig 4b in western shenzhen despite the different land use types several homogenous high emergy zones in fig 4b were identified three evident regions of heat release including the baoan airport shekou industrial zone and yantian port were observed in fig 4 reconfirming the findings of the previous study xie et al 2013 3 3 emergy distribution the calculated values for natural and man made releases according to different land use types are summarized in table 2 the average value for each land use type was calculated reflecting the density of outflows in a given area according to the emergy distribution of natural releases no fluctuations were found from impervious to permeable areas however the average emergy value is evidently higher in areas where human activities exist than in natural areas commercial areas residential areas roads and forests account for the most of total emergy it is notable that the average emergy value in forest is the least but accounts for the maximum percentage of the total emergy for the average emergy in man made releases commercial areas residential areas roads streets and forest are characterized by higher values than other categories of land use all the results confirmed that human activities have strong impacts on the urban ecosystem as shown in table 2 commercial residential and road areas constitute half of the total land use this indicates that shenzhen has abundant natural resources but is affected by large urban areas and disrupted by human activities forests usually contain plenty of organic matter and can output cod pollutants during rainfall however the runoff from forests does not create more severe environmental pollution than that from other land use types this indicated that forests make important contributions to urban resilience table 2 shows that commercial areas residential areas and transportation areas often harbor higher emergy values due a higher number of natural and man made releases this finding again calls for careful policymaking since natural ecosystems sustain human society through multiple ecosystem services wang et al 2016 to maintain a low emergy value rational exploitation should be conducted on natural lands 3 4 selection of key areas for sponge city practices the basic ecological control line was created by the government of shenzhen in 2005 covering most natural lands including woodland orchard farmland grassland hilly areas water conservation areas river systems nature reserves ecological corridors and more uplrcsm 2011 according to the basic ecological control line policy construction is prohibited except for traffic infrastructure municipal and tourism facilities and parks shenzhen municipal government 2005 hence areas outside the basic ecological control line except for forests should be a priority to be considered for sponge like urban reconstruction fig 5 a and b display the distributions of total emergy in natural and man made releases respectively the emergy distribution was non homogenous through these areas and varied in different types of land use the areas within the basic ecological control line had lower emergy values than those outside the line the relatively low emergy in natural areas indicated low human presences nonetheless we also identified some sites with extensive activities inside the basic ecological control line such as a quarry and waste landfill fig 5b overall the western areas have high emergy values for natural and man made releases specifically nine out of the 55 sub districts e g gongming ranked high on the map of human release ranging from 5 8e 16 sej to 1 86e 17 sej other areas relatively high in emergy values are potentially associated with land use and human activities fig 5b in terms of human use industrial commercial and transportation activities are extensive throughout these nine sub districts most of these sub districts are in coastal areas that have been exploited over time for instance urban sprawl has accelerated in futian and yantian since 1980s both of which are in shenzhen s special economic zone the validation through satellite image was conducted and industrial parks transportation and bare land for construction were identified with high emergy values table 3 unlike the previous studies focusing on residential areas martin et al 2015 we suggested that other land than residential areas may require special attention such as industrial and transportation areas even though residential areas were reconstructed with proper measurements the foregoing other areas with high emergy values especially areas far away from the sea still pose a pressure on the residential areas in terms of stormwater and heat release these nine sub districts can be potentially reconfigured for improving the coexistence between urban and natural systems generally natural releases only include stormwater runoff while man made releases involve nonpoint source pollution and anthropogenic heat releases man made releases in western shenzhen are over a thousand times higher than natural releases due to the heavy consumption of non renewable resources both local and imported obviously when compared with man made releases emergy in runoff is small in comparison therefore the overlay map showing both natural releases and man made releases may generate unreliable maps for the unbiased selection of key areas fig 5a is closely associated with fig 5b since the distribution of nonpoint source pollution is influenced by the volume of runoff and land use in short the distribution of emergy values in fig 5b could represent the integration of stormwater runoff runoff pollution and heat release target area for sponge like urban reconstruction can be acquired from fig 5b then verified using fig 5a for example the large scale target areas are identified within each sub district fig 5b so that small scale sponge city reconstruction can be put into practice including permeable pavers and gardens though small scale practices are primarily recommended in light of our study some large scale applications in adjacent land units can be incorporated for implementation e g large greenway frameworks and corridors for pollutant removal smart stormwater system can be applied with real time control mullapudi et al 2017 notably sponge city reconstruction must be based on the local strengths and weaknesses of the cities wang et al 2018 therefore data obtained from available sources and processed by this framework can serve as city specific foundations for reconstruction projects in a specific city 3 5 uncertainty analysis the emergy gis method can be applied to approximately estimate the environmental degradation of urban systems however uncertainties are inevitable due to the underlying assumptions and data accuracy under specific conditions mellino et al 2015 many models have evolved independently of the emergy accounting method and these have been used to simulate release maps with their same units used in the present study hence deviations may occur during both model execution and emergy synthesis for example the runoff volumes and cod levels for each land unit are roughly estimated based on the assumption that they are related to land use obviously this is not necessarily true again the transformity might be inconsistent across the study areas specifically the transformity of wastewater was borrowed from sweden though there is no significant difference between the transformity in the two regions thus the deviations and errors caused by different models and emergy accounting methods may affect the results slightly in this study apparently the modification of model parameters and transformities for emergy accounting are expected to reduce the probability of deviations and errors as mentioned above the satellite imagery used does not fit the administrative boundary of shenzhen exactly since the final image mosaic exhibits spectral differences between the two paths which results in final calculation errors nonetheless a more detailed follow up analysis can be conducted based on the geographic boundaries of natural ecosystems or other features for example the eastern part of shenzhen can be evaluated using the emergy gis method after which a comparison of emergy values between the east and western areas of the city can be performed 3 6 comparative analysis of relevant studies recently several studies have been carried out regarding spatial area selection for green infrastructure a green infrastructure spatial planning gisp model was introduced integrating stormwater management social vulnerability green space air quality urban heat island and landscape connectivity to select the suitable areas for multifunctional green infrastructure meerow and newell 2017 different weighting methods such as equal weights and stakeholder ranking weights were used to consolidate these data unlike that framework we proposed a more concentrated on stormwater management and anthropologic heat method with a higher resolution 900 m2 for key area selection in the present study the overlay and analysis of multi sources data without weighting may allow a less debatable spatial identification comparing with another study conducted by garcia cuerva et al 2018 which focused on underprivileged areas in terms of environmental justice for green infrastructure placement our method is repeatable at a city or a larger scale therefore the established method in this study can provide different implications for area selection despite some limitations mentioned above 4 conclusions generally impervious land associated with human activities requires urgent action natural and man made releases are associated with certain land use types which coincides with the observation that environmental and human health risks are related to land use anilkumar et al 2010 pulselli 2010 key areas can be objectively identified by emergy accounting emergy distributions can mirror the degree to which human activities influence an ecosystem the greater the calculated emergy value the greater the effort necessary to regenerate by using gis to visualize our analysis the suitable areas where sponge like reconstruction can be implemented efficiently and provide economic environmental and societal benefits can be identified this method could increase our awareness of the relationship between ecosystems and policy providing policymakers with suggestions and strategies to manage cities through sustainable development as a result emergy analysis in combination with gis allows for the holistic and objective analysis of urban systems and explains the outflows of socio economic systems in detail acknowledgment this study was financially supported by the national key research and development program of china 2017yfc0505801 
7089,a comprehensive framework composed of stormwater indices e g stormwater runoff runoff pollution and anthropogenic heat is proposed to facilitate selection of key areas for sponge like urban reconstruction based on the integration of emergy analysis and gis models a case study in shenzhen is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in aiding the implementation of sponge city reconstruction specifically natural and man made releases are identified and accounted for in emergy units sej when compared to the emergy values of natural releases 4 99e 14 7 59e 14 sej and man made releases 1 79e 14 5 8e 16 sej within the shenzhen basic ecological control line designated as an ecological preservation area the emergy values of both types of releases outside the basic ecological control line are higher ranging from 7 59e 14 sej to 8 32e 14 sej for the former and from 5 8e 16 sej to 1 86e 17 sej for the latter nine sub districts in shenzhen china such as industrial parks transportation and bare land for construction are preliminarily chosen as areas for potential sponge like urban reconstruction on the basis of man made releases and are then confirmed by examining natural releases the proposed emergy gis framework can bridge the gap between empirical studies and standardize research to ensure that the results of the green infrastructure plan live up to the rhetoric keywords sponge city emergy gis natural release man made release 1 introduction many unpleasant consequences of urbanization such as urban waterlogging environmental pollution and the urban heat island effect li et al 2013 qin et al 2012 have frequently been observed in cities around the world to address these problems the concept of urban resilience which is the ability of an urban region to bounce back following major natural events bunster ossa 2013 meerow et al 2016 has become popular among urban planners and designers in this light the low impact development lid concept of sponge cities has recently been introduced jiang et al 2018 this term is associated with the ability of an urban area to tolerate undesired disturbances bunster ossa 2013 a sponge city refers to a city in which stormwater management at a moderate scale as well as urban microclimate is strengthened by sponge like urban reconstruction specifically a sponge city relies on green and gray infrastructure for managing runoff usepa 2013 the sustainable stormwater management and its adaptability to climate change gains a growing concern shishegar et al 2018 wang et al 2018 however a completely fresh start for an already constructed city is not practical instead urban reconstruction of certain areas in a city according to the local situation might be a more practical approach at present the most important question is how to select suitable areas for sponge city practices to the best of our knowledge there are very few studies dedicated to identifying the most suitable target areas for sponge city initiative jiang et al 2018 li et al 2017 although some studies focused on lid development in residential areas martin et al 2015 sponge city reconstruction is in urgent need of a city level analysis xia et al 2017 additionally aside from the weighted green infrastructure spatial planning gisp model developed by meerow and newell 2017 there has been no discussion of how to screen appropriate areas for sponge city practices with high resolution in other words there are no ground rules for judging where to begin sponge like urban reconstruction from a practical perspective li and bergen 2018 emergy analysis is a powerful environmental economic theory and a systematic analytical method based on systems ecology environmental engineering and environmental economics odum 1996 according to this theory the systems of nature and society on all scales are involved in a universal energy hierarchy which forms an energy network brown and ulgiati 2004b each environmental item that constitutes a certain system can be quantified by emergy accounting odum 1996 analysis of emergy in combination with energy materials and other parameters has been applied to quantitatively evaluate sustainability in individual buildings activity processes urban areas and countries amaral et al 2016 the relationships between land use and socioeconomic factors can be discerned by analyzing emergy huang et al 2006 moreover some studies examined specific flows among inputs internal processes and outputs in terms of emergy theory for bridging evaluations of and strategies for urban sustainability liu et al 2011 mellino et al 2014 in general these assessments combine indicators with weighting factors that sometimes lead to a subjective or separated conclusion in contrast the assessment results are evaluated and synthesized into common summary of energetic flows in this context the emergy approach can be regarded as a useful tool for analysis and policy making and can therefore also be used as an effective tool to select areas for sponge like urban reconstruction planning mellino et al 2015 mellino and ulgiati 2015 pulselli 2010 due to the distributions of specific flows on large scales spatial information can be considered to be the crucial factor for analysis and policy making emergy theory is enhanced by the use of geographical information systems gis the integration of emergy and gis has been highlighted as a potential method for regional studies and policy making pulselli 2010 a number of studies have investigated the integration of emergy with gis using a relatively advanced emergy gis framework huang et al 2007 developed a spatial model to simulate the energy and spatial hierarchy of an urban system huang et al 2007 chang and huang 2015 established an emergy gis framework incorporating the interactions between exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity for assessing a city s vulnerability to flooding chang and huang 2015 more recently the spatial distributions and quantities of renewable natural resources and net primary productivity were investigated in terms of emergy in japan wang et al 2016 china has experienced rapid urbanization and must confront the adverse effects of urbanization in fact china experimented with sponge like urban design ideas more than a decade ago to date thirty potential sponge city projects have been approved by the chinese central government jiang et al 2018 mof 2015 however no synthesized assessment has been established regarding the performance evaluation i e desired outcomes of china s sponge city project pecscp with specific indicators mohurd 2015 shenzhen is currently among those 30 cities as it has been suffering from urban waterlogging almost every year due to the dual pressures of its subtropical climate and rapid urbanization zhao et al 2006 as is typical of a rapidly urbanizing region shenzhen provides an ideal study site for exploring how to practically implement a sponge city project hence the present study attempts to identify the pivotal areas for sponge like urban reconstruction with an emergy gis approach in shenzhen to pursue water resilience and security in the context of climate change this approach will facilitate the effective management of stormwater and the urban heat island effect at moderate scales meanwhile the high precision information of environment economy system can be analyzed with feasible models in gis both quantitatively and visually xia et al 2017 2 material and methods 2 1 study area shenzhen one of the fastest growing cities in the world in the 1990s and the 2000s is in the southern guangdong province and sits south of the tropic of cancer over the past three decades shenzhen has grown from a tiny border town into a modern metropolis the amount of runoff in guangdong province is much higher than that in north china especially in shenzhen mohurd 2014 which requires much more sufficient water permeability during construction the study area is located in western shenzhen within the coordinates 22 3 n 22 9 n and 113 7 e 114 5 e fig 1 fig 1 also highlights the boundary lines of the ecological preservation areas in shenzhen with the study area covering a majority of the ecological preservation land area 738 km2 out of 974 km2 shenzhen city spans across two paths path 121 row 44 path 122 row 44 of the landsat 5 tm dataset allowing us to avoid inaccuracies in the imagery product western shenzhen is chosen as the target zone 1698 km2 covering 85 area of shenzhen here human activity is intense compared to the eastern part of the city which falls in the other landsat path the shenzhen basic ecological control line is taken into account which was established based on indicators e g forest coverage and per capita green area and local situations shenzhen municipal government 2013 therefore the areas outside of the basic ecological control line are priorities for reconstruction projects that sustain enormous human activities 2 2 data collection the land use data was the second national land survey data in 2010 to maintain data consistency the data in 2010 were used to establish the emergy gis method landsat 5 tm images path 121 row 44 taken on december 23 2010 usgs 2010 were used for anthropogenic heat calculations and integrated with digital elevation

site cnic chinese academy of sciences http www gscloud cn the soil coverage data are provided by the landscape of shenzhen map product with digital processing huang 1983 meteorological data i e temperature from december 23 2010 were acquired from the shenzhen meteorological data system mbsm 2010 additionally precipitation data were obtained from the 2011 shenzhen statistical yearbook in mbsm 2011 2 3 the emergy gis framework emergy evaluation works in integrated systems rather than segments it also links inputs from human activities and environments to outputs in the system based on historical and real data to comprehensively answer questions about environmental and public management brown and ulgiati 2004a emergy is able to convert one unit of each product or service to a common unit namely the unit emergy value uev or emergy intensity solar equivalent joules joule sej j etc specifically the ratio of emergy to energy in sej unit is the transformity which is defined as the solar energy that produces or provides one unit of the specific outputs or services emergy methods aid ecosystem management and policy making especially in understanding human environmental interactions emergy can be integrated with gis in different approaches such as spatial analysis li and luo 2015 to form an emergy gis framework the emergy gis framework is an emergy analysis that is displayed visually and spatially using a gis therefore spatiotemporal information can be obtained on a larger scale in these studies wang et al 2016 the representation of spectral patterns can identify an organizational configuration pulselli 2010 a new emergy gis framework with the available energy indicators can be selected according to the pecscp mohurd 2015 and related studies agostinho et al 2008 different energy fluxes with different units can be integrated into emergy analysis mellino et al 2014 thus the selected emergy flows can be calculated and integrated to reflect the issues of interest the energy system diagrams showing emergy accounting are comprised of inflows internal processes and outflows huang et al 2011 here we pay attention to the outflows because they reflect crucial city issues that are in great need of a response the replacement of natural lands with impervious surfaces results in changes to the urban environment such as those to thermal and moisture properties colombert et al 2011 for instance the distribution of precipitation is influenced by the urban heat island effect colombert et al 2011 while an improved water environment mitigates the adverse effects of urban heat island rydin et al 2012 besides anthropogenic heat release plays an important role in urban heat island and needs to be addressed for climate adaption zhang et al 2013 overall the interaction between water and the thermal environment may play an important role in urban health coutts et al 2012 the integration of stormwater management managi et al 2016 and urban heat island management rydin et al 2012 concerns many disciplines such as geography hydrology and urban planning using the available data runoff huang et al 2011 tilley and brown 2006 nonpoint source pollution liu et al 2011 and anthropogenic heat liu et al 2011 lou et al 2015 are spatially quantified within the urban ecosystem to determine the most appropriate areas for sponge city practices in shenzhen mohurd 2015 2 3 1 emergy baselines odum et al 2000 elaborated that the inputs within the emergy network support emergy evaluations the global emergy reference baseline is defined as the main emergy inputs to the geobiosphere of the earth considering earth s energy absorption the emergy baseline was recalculated in 2000 15 83e 24 sej yr adopted by our study after its initial calculation in 1996 9 44e 24 sej yr odum et al 2000 the emergy baseline for 2000 was recently updated in 2015 to visualize and identify the areas with emergy we chose the 2000 emergy values as the baseline to ensure consistency with previous studies the results from the other studies bjorklund et al 2001 brandt williams 1999 are converted to baseline with specific coefficients specifically we only focus the outflows of emergy theory instead of the whole urban system thus all transformities in this study based on past studies were assumed to be the average values in shenzhen 2 3 2 stormwater runoff maps rainfall that exceeds the soil capacity becomes surface runoff as does the surface water in impervious areas brandt williams 1999 therefore the runoff that reaches land is calculated in seconds with the common water budget equation mellino et al 2014 1 q p et i where q is the stormwater runoff p is the yearly precipitation mbsm 2011 et is the yearly evapotranspiration and i is the infiltration into ground all these parameters are in mm here evapotranspiration can be ignored given a short observation time because one of the sponge city principles is that rainfall should soak into soil as soon as possible to eliminate runoff the short observation time only includes the precipitation process in each rainfall event therefore to model runoff in this study q p i simply describes runoff in our map to elaborate on this assumption stormwater runoff is described by the soil conservation service curve number scs cn model water infiltration into the ground is primarily governed by soil type moisture and land use etc to display these effects for different land use types different assignments are set for specific land uses according to the information provided by shi et al 2007 36 scenarios are assigned to 4 types of hydrological soil groups for nine types of land use in shenzhen table 1 the scs cn runoff equation is described as following usda 1986 2 q p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s p 0 2 s 0 p 0 2 s where q is surface runoff p is the precipitation and s is the potential maximum retention volume all of which are in mm and relate to surface depression vegetation infiltration and so on at the same time s is also related to the curve number cn for different land use types as mentioned above specifically the calculation equation of s is 3 s 25400 cn 254 where cn represents the runoff potential of land use governed by several factors which refers to a previous study by shi et al 2007 in shenzhen then the obtained runoff map is converted into energy using the following equation 4 en runoff v ρ water g where v is the volume of runoff water in m3 v q a a is the area in m2 ρ water is the water density 1e 6 g m3 and g is the gibbs free energy 4 82 j g brandt williams 1999 the uev is 1 06e 5 sej j and is derived from multiplying 6 31e 4 sej j brandt williams 1999 by 1 68 odum et al 2000 2 3 3 nonpoint source pollution maps nonpoint source pollution is caused by stormwater runoff carrying away natural and man made pollutants stormwater runoff in urban areas also contains pollutants that eventually contaminate receiving water bodies managi et al 2016 using long term hydrological impact assessment l thia models based on the scs cn specific event mean concentration emc values are assigned to different land use types to gain the nonpoint source pollution loading for each land use table 2 due to lack of the transformity of cod chemical oxygen demand the emergy value in cod can be derived from the emergy accounting of wastewater qin et al 2010 suggested that the first 50 of storm water is heavily polluted similar to wastewater to simplify the calculation the first 50 of stormwater runoff volume along with the concentration of cod table 2 were treated as wastewater in the present study hence the estimated pollutant loadings are obtained by using half the volume of the estimated runoff and emc lim et al 2006 bjorklund et al 2001 calculated the total energy in wastewater including the energy content in water and cod and suggested that the largest emergy contribution was wastewater itself in the present study the energy content in cod is calculated using following equation bjorklund et al 2001 5 en cod c cod e cod a 1 2 v water where e cod is the energy content in cod j which represents the organic material c cod g l is the concentration of cod e cod is the energy content in each gram of cod 3 4 kcal g haug 1993 a is 4186 j kcal 1 2 v water is half of the amount of runoff water in l which is considered to be wastewater cod is the only variable that is considered in the stormwater pollution model which is consistent with emergy accounting of wastewater in bjorklund et al 2001 thus to calculate the emergy value of cod based on the assumption that both water and wastewater constitute the wastewater the energy content of cod can be multiplied by the transformity of wastewater to obtain the emergy of cod the transformity of wastewater inflows and treated wastewater is 6 38e 6 sej j obtained by multiplying 3 80e 6 sej j bjorklund et al 2001 by 1 68 odum et al 2000 2 3 4 anthropogenic heat maps according to pecscp mohurd 2015 anthropogenic heat emissions ahe encourage a discussion of the urban heat island effect dhakal and hanaki 2002 moreover explicit combustion efficiency values are not available lu et al 2016 and neither is the proportion of energy consumption at the prefecture level therefore energy consumption structure is assumed to be uniform in western shenzhen in terms of energy types the energy sources consist of coal raw coal briquettes and washery coal oil crude oil gasoline kerosene and fuel oil and gas coal gas and natural gas electricity thermal energy and others wind and nuclear lu et al 2016 the composition of primary energy consumption was acquired in standard coal equivalents sce from the 2011 guangdong statistical yearbook coal 48 1 oil 29 1 electricity 19 1 and natural gas 3 7 for

three models were employed for three specific indicators the stormwater runoff map was associated with the pollution map then these maps were converted into emergy values by multiplying their transformities later maps were identified as either natural or man made water releases accordingly the areas with high emergy values can be identified stormwater runoff nonpoint source pollution and anthropogenic heat were identified individually and plotted on maps to spot the priority areas the natural release map was considered as the verification map 3 1 natural release maps in the present study stormwater runoff is regarded as uncontaminated natural runoff to obtain the emergy in runoff without human disturbance fig 3 exhibits the distribution of stormwater runoff in emergy units the calculation was at a 30 m scale the maximum spatial resolution available which was fairly detailed and suitable for implementation apparently stormwater runoff is associated with land use as seen in fig 3 and depends on the amount of rainfall infiltration characteristics such as impervious areas soil features and other factors in terms of emergy natural releases are higher beyond the shenzhen basic ecological control line ranging from 7 59e 14 sej to 8 32e 14 sej in addition the emergy flow was higher along the seacoast due to the land use types there commercial residential and water bodies though the emergy density is well distributed high value areas are concentrated zonally it indicates that soil and cover conditions moderately affect the distribution of stormwater runoff 3 2 man made release map nonpoint source pollution is mainly attributed to land use and human activities qin et al 2010 yusop et al 2005 similarly heat release is also derived from human activities both of these are regarded as the human made releases an overlay of both runoff pollution and heat releases yields the spatial distribution of man made releases fig 4 represents the distributions of emergy stock density sej 900 m2 in terms of nonpoint source pollution fig 4a and anthropogenic heat fig 4b in western shenzhen despite the different land use types several homogenous high emergy zones in fig 4b were identified three evident regions of heat release including the baoan airport shekou industrial zone and yantian port were observed in fig 4 reconfirming the findings of the previous study xie et al 2013 3 3 emergy distribution the calculated values for natural and man made releases according to different land use types are summarized in table 2 the average value for each land use type was calculated reflecting the density of outflows in a given area according to the emergy distribution of natural releases no fluctuations were found from impervious to permeable areas however the average emergy value is evidently higher in areas where human activities exist than in natural areas commercial areas residential areas roads and forests account for the most of total emergy it is notable that the average emergy value in forest is the least but accounts for the maximum percentage of the total emergy for the average emergy in man made releases commercial areas residential areas roads streets and forest are characterized by higher values than other categories of land use all the results confirmed that human activities have strong impacts on the urban ecosystem as shown in table 2 commercial residential and road areas constitute half of the total land use this indicates that shenzhen has abundant natural resources but is affected by large urban areas and disrupted by human activities forests usually contain plenty of organic matter and can output cod pollutants during rainfall however the runoff from forests does not create more severe environmental pollution than that from other land use types this indicated that forests make important contributions to urban resilience table 2 shows that commercial areas residential areas and transportation areas often harbor higher emergy values due a higher number of natural and man made releases this finding again calls for careful policymaking since natural ecosystems sustain human society through multiple ecosystem services wang et al 2016 to maintain a low emergy value rational exploitation should be conducted on natural lands 3 4 selection of key areas for sponge city practices the basic ecological control line was created by the government of shenzhen in 2005 covering most natural lands including woodland orchard farmland grassland hilly areas water conservation areas river systems nature reserves ecological corridors and more uplrcsm 2011 according to the basic ecological control line policy construction is prohibited except for traffic infrastructure municipal and tourism facilities and parks shenzhen municipal government 2005 hence areas outside the basic ecological control line except for forests should be a priority to be considered for sponge like urban reconstruction fig 5 a and b display the distributions of total emergy in natural and man made releases respectively the emergy distribution was non homogenous through these areas and varied in different types of land use the areas within the basic ecological control line had lower emergy values than those outside the line the relatively low emergy in natural areas indicated low human presences nonetheless we also identified some sites with extensive activities inside the basic ecological control line such as a quarry and waste landfill fig 5b overall the western areas have high emergy values for natural and man made releases specifically nine out of the 55 sub districts e g gongming ranked high on the map of human release ranging from 5 8e 16 sej to 1 86e 17 sej other areas relatively high in emergy values are potentially associated with land use and human activities fig 5b in terms of human use industrial commercial and transportation activities are extensive throughout these nine sub districts most of these sub districts are in coastal areas that have been exploited over time for instance urban sprawl has accelerated in futian and yantian since 1980s both of which are in shenzhen s special economic zone the validation through satellite image was conducted and industrial parks transportation and bare land for construction were identified with high emergy values table 3 unlike the previous studies focusing on residential areas martin et al 2015 we suggested that other land than residential areas may require special attention such as industrial and transportation areas even though residential areas were reconstructed with proper measurements the foregoing other areas with high emergy values especially areas far away from the sea still pose a pressure on the residential areas in terms of stormwater and heat release these nine sub districts can be potentially reconfigured for improving the coexistence between urban and natural systems generally natural releases only include stormwater runoff while man made releases involve nonpoint source pollution and anthropogenic heat releases man made releases in western shenzhen are over a thousand times higher than natural releases due to the heavy consumption of non renewable resources both local and imported obviously when compared with man made releases emergy in runoff is small in comparison therefore the overlay map showing both natural releases and man made releases may generate unreliable maps for the unbiased selection of key areas fig 5a is closely associated with fig 5b since the distribution of nonpoint source pollution is influenced by the volume of runoff and land use in short the distribution of emergy values in fig 5b could represent the integration of stormwater runoff runoff pollution and heat release target area for sponge like urban reconstruction can be acquired from fig 5b then verified using fig 5a for example the large scale target areas are identified within each sub district fig 5b so that small scale sponge city reconstruction can be put into practice including permeable pavers and gardens though small scale practices are primarily recommended in light of our study some large scale applications in adjacent land units can be incorporated for implementation e g large greenway frameworks and corridors for pollutant removal smart stormwater system can be applied with real time control mullapudi et al 2017 notably sponge city reconstruction must be based on the local strengths and weaknesses of the cities wang et al 2018 therefore data obtained from available sources and processed by this framework can serve as city specific foundations for reconstruction projects in a specific city 3 5 uncertainty analysis the emergy gis method can be applied to approximately estimate the environmental degradation of urban systems however uncertainties are inevitable due to the underlying assumptions and data accuracy under specific conditions mellino et al 2015 many models have evolved independently of the emergy accounting method and these have been used to simulate release maps with their same units used in the present study hence deviations may occur during both model execution and emergy synthesis for example the runoff volumes and cod levels for each land unit are roughly estimated based on the assumption that they are related to land use obviously this is not necessarily true again the transformity might be inconsistent across the study areas specifically the transformity of wastewater was borrowed from sweden though there is no significant difference between the transformity in the two regions thus the deviations and errors caused by different models and emergy accounting methods may affect the results slightly in this study apparently the modification of model parameters and transformities for emergy accounting are expected to reduce the probability of deviations and errors as mentioned above the satellite imagery used does not fit the administrative boundary of shenzhen exactly since the final image mosaic exhibits spectral differences between the two paths which results in final calculation errors nonetheless a more detailed follow up analysis can be conducted based on the geographic boundaries of natural ecosystems or other features for example the eastern part of shenzhen can be evaluated using the emergy gis method after which a comparison of emergy values between the east and western areas of the city can be performed 3 6 comparative analysis of relevant studies recently several studies have been carried out regarding spatial area selection for green infrastructure a green infrastructure spatial planning gisp model was introduced integrating stormwater management social vulnerability green space air quality urban heat island and landscape connectivity to select the suitable areas for multifunctional green infrastructure meerow and newell 2017 different weighting methods such as equal weights and stakeholder ranking weights were used to consolidate these data unlike that framework we proposed a more concentrated on stormwater management and anthropologic heat method with a higher resolution 900 m2 for key area selection in the present study the overlay and analysis of multi sources data without weighting may allow a less debatable spatial identification comparing with another study conducted by garcia cuerva et al 2018 which focused on underprivileged areas in terms of environmental justice for green infrastructure placement our method is repeatable at a city or a larger scale therefore the established method in this study can provide different implications for area selection despite some limitations mentioned above 4 conclusions generally impervious land associated with human activities requires urgent action natural and man made releases are associated with certain land use types which coincides with the observation that environmental and human health risks are related to land use anilkumar et al 2010 pulselli 2010 key areas can be objectively identified by emergy accounting emergy distributions can mirror the degree to which human activities influence an ecosystem the greater the calculated emergy value the greater the effort necessary to regenerate by using gis to visualize our analysis the suitable areas where sponge like reconstruction can be implemented efficiently and provide economic environmental and societal benefits can be identified this method could increase our awareness of the relationship between ecosystems and policy providing policymakers with suggestions and strategies to manage cities through sustainable development as a result emergy analysis in combination with gis allows for the holistic and objective analysis of urban systems and explains the outflows of socio economic systems in detail acknowledgment this study was financially supported by the national key research and development program of china
