15175,pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps have captured global concern due to their detrimental effects on aquatic organisms thirty ppcps were analyzed in the water of the jiaozhou bay watershed the yellow sea ys and the east china sea ecs in china to investigate the distribution and risk of ppcps from rivers to coastal seas which are not yet well documented the results showed the prevalence of the target ppcps with a downward trend in detection frequencies and total concentrations from rivers 675 ng l on average to bay 166 ng l and to coastal seas 103 ng l antibiotics and personal care products pcps were dominated by amoxicillin amox and p hydroxybenzoic acid respectively while the dominant estrogens were inconsistent in different regions spatially the total ppcp concentrations were higher in the ecs than that in the ys due to the larger quantity of sewage flowing into the ecs additionally higher total ppcp concentrations were appeared in the southeastern waters outside the yangtze estuary and hangzhou bay of the ecs the ppcp mixtures might pose medium to high risk to aquatic organisms in general the total risk quotient rqt of antibiotics and pcps to algae was higher than that to crustacean and fish while estrogens may cause the greatest damage to fish despite the higher ppcp concentrations in river water than in seawater the rqt of ppcps in bay water was generally higher than that in river water which may be associated with the susceptibility of marine organisms furthermore the high risk pollutants that need special concern in different regions were clarified showing that amox 17ß estradiol and estriol deserve the highest priority in rivers bay and coastal waters respectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pharmaceuticals and personal care products coastal seas distribution characteristics ecological risks priority pollutants data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps including diverse collections of drugs and the related components in personal care products pcps and household chemicals are one of the major groups of widely used emerging contaminants with global concern due to their potential detrimental effects on wild organisms and human health chen et al 2022 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2021a 2021b china is one of the largest producers and users of pharmaceuticals in the world with the exports accounting for more than 60 of the global industry and the annual antibiotic usage occupying 45 of global consumption chen et al 2022 tiseo et al 2020 in addition china possesses the highest growth rate of the pcp market worldwide and the proportion of the global total industry value in china is approximately 10 liu and wong 2013 liu et al 2020 ppcps cannot be completely metabolized by organisms and the conventional wastewater treatment processes are inadequate for removing ppcps carvalho and santos 2016 chen et al 2022 petrie et al 2015 thus various types of ppcps are continuously released into the environment during excretion rinsing manufacturing and disposal which has led to the prevalence of these contaminants in aquatic environments worldwide cantwell et al 2018 fonseca et al 2020 he et al 2019 mijangos et al 2018 xu et al 2022 in the coastal watersheds various ppcps from land based point sources riverine runoff and direct sewage discharge or nonpoint sources aquaculture effluent and recreational activities are eventually discharged into estuaries bays and coastal regions which are critical areas for human habitation as well as ecologically fragile regions with abundant marine resources lyu et al 2020 yang et al 2020 to date various types of ppcps and their metabolites are ubiquitously observed in marine environments worldwide celic et al 2021 han et al 2020 kötke et al 2019 miller et al 2021 song et al 2020 and even in remote undeveloped areas such as the mariana trench and the antarctic hernandez et al 2019 yang et al 2021 from rivers to bays and to coastal areas the distribution patterns of ppcps are highly heterogeneous in different regions which are affected by anthropogenic emissions and the environmental processes of ppcps under complicated marine conditions kafaei et al 2018 meng et al 2022 wang et al 2022 xu et al 2019 however compared with estuaries and bays the distribution patterns of chemically diverse ppcps in coastal waters are relatively less understood furthermore a comprehensive knowledge on ppcp occurrence from rivers to bays and to coastal areas on a large regional scale which has not yet been reported is needed despite the relatively low ppcp concentrations ng l or µg l levels in aquatic environments the potential nonreversible ecotoxicological impacts of ppcps on aquatic organisms have attracted considerable concern worldwide celic et al 2021 fonseca et al 2020 han et al 2020 liang et al 2022 thornber et al 2022 long term exposure to ppcps may inhibit primary productivity cause oxidative stress toxicity disrupt the endocrine system damage the thyroid and impact the endocrine system and metabolic pathways in aquatic organisms bilal and iqbal 2019 cui et al 2021 liang et al 2022 xin et al 2019 2020 additionally the prevalence of drugs can promote the emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance amr which has become one of the greatest threats to global public health chen et al 2021 thornber et al 2022 furthermore recent studies have reported the coexistence and interactions of antibiotics and microplastics which can enrich amr from the surrounding environment atugoda et al 2021 wang et al 2021a 2021b in addition the plant accumulation and bioaccumulation of ppcps has been proven in several studies li et al 2022 xu et al 2022 xue et al 2017 thus a comprehensive risk assessment of ppcps along with the proper identification of priority pollutants in coastal waters is necessary for the prevention and control of ppcp contamination nonetheless the related studies in coastal waters are sorely lacking at present this study focused on the jiaozhou bay watershed the yellow sea ys and the east china sea ecs in china jiaozhou bay an urbanized bay in the yellow sea coast is deeply affected by the anthropogenic activities of qingdao city and its adjacent rivers the yellow sea and east china sea are important marginal seas of china and receive large amounts of wastewater contains various contaminants from developed eastern china which significantly deteriorates the coastal environment mee 2022 to our knowledge few studies have explored the occurrence of emerging contaminants in the seawater of the yellow and east china seas zhang et al 2013 du et al 2017 zhong et al 2020 an early study in 2010 investigated the presence of eleven antibiotics in offshore water of the yellow sea and found that the detection rates for most antibiotics were below 10 zhang et al 2013 du et al 2017 found that the distribution of antibiotics demonstrated a seaward decreasing trend in the seawater of the south yellow sea beside yancheng city zhong et al 2020 reported the wide occurrence of organophosphorus flame retardants and plasticizers in the yellow and east china seas and these pollutants were observed at higher concentrations in the yellow sea than in the east china sea in general the distribution and ecological risks of ppcps in the coastal waters of the yellow and east china seas are still unclear and the related comprehensive investigation from rivers to coastal regions is even more lacking accordingly a total of 100 surface and bottom water samples were collected from the watershed of jiaozhou bay the yellow sea and the east china sea to i systematically investigate the occurrence and composition of thirty target ppcps including fifteen antibiotics six estrogens and nine personal care products in the water from river to coastal regions ii illustrate the spatial distribution of ppcps in coastal waters iii assess the ecological risk of multiple ppcps to aquatic organisms and iv identify the priority ppcps with high ecological risk the results of this study can provide valuable information for understanding the behavior of ppcps from rivers to coastal seas and assessing the potential risk and priority of ppcps which could be significant for better management of emerging contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection jiaozhou bay is a semi enclosed bay surrounded by qingdao an international city with rapid socioeconomic development the bay is seriously affected by the intensive anthropogenic activities and the surrounding rivers are accompanied by abundant industrial and domestic waste partial contaminants contained in the bay will enter the yellow sea through the narrow channel located in the southeast of the bay fig 1 the yellow sea and east china sea of china are marginal seas located at the western edge of the pacific ocean and their coastal area is among the most developed and densely populated areas in china hundreds of pollution sources are directly adjacent to the sea which have an annual sewage emission of more than six billion tons mee 2022 water samples were collected at 26 27 18 and 20 sites in six main rivers flowing into jiaozhou bay jiaozhou bay the ys and the ecs respectively fig 1 in detail surface water samples approximately 1 m below the water surface were collected at each site and layered seawater samples were collected at y7 10 20 30 and 40 m and y9 10 20 30 40 and 60 m in the ys fig 1 thus a total of 100 water samples were obtained by the sampling campaign conducted from may to october of 2019 the gathered water samples 2 l for each sample were placed in umber glass bottles cleaned in advance and adjusted to a ph of 3 0 5 lu et al 2022a 2022b subsequently the samples were transported to the laboratory in iceboxes and preprocessed in 48 h 2 2 chemicals and reagents thirty ppcps were selected mainly based on their categories application purposes potential toxic effects and usage in china ec 2018 lu et al 2022a who 2017 the target ppcps comprised fifteen antibiotics belonging to five classes β lactam amphenicols macrolides fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides six estrogens natural and synthetic estrogens and nine personal care products preservatives disinfectants and antioxidants correspondingly twenty three isotopically labeled compounds were used as internal standards iss the chemicals purity 98 were obtained from sigma aldrich uk and toronto research chemicals inc canada more information on the target ppcps and corresponding iss is shown in table s1 2 3 sample pretreatment instrumental analysis and quality control the process of sample pretreatment and quantification of ppcps was conducted following previous studies lu et al 2022a 2022b simply stated filtered water samples from each site 2 l were divided into duplicate and mixed with 100 ng iss to verify recoveries of the samples the water samples were then extracted by preprepared hlb cartridges waters usa and eluted with a mixture of methanol acetonitrile and ethyl acetate 12 6 and 6 ml respectively then the elute was evaporated with gentle nitrogen and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography lc 20adxr shimadzu japan coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry api 4500 applied biosystems usa a detailed description of sample pretreatment and instrumental analysis is provided in text s1 and table s2 the experiment was subject to strict quality assurance and control procedures method accuracy and instrumental performance were checked by spiked river water and seawater at 10 50 and 100 ng l in triplicate the recovery of the method was in the range of 66 9 111 for river water and 61 0 114 for seawater and relative standard deviations for triplicate samples were less than 15 table s3 for each batch of samples to be analyzed field samples solvent blanks procedural blanks and standard mixtures were run to check for cross contamination and quantification additionally the recovery rates corresponding to the iss for 30 ppcps ranged from 64 to 105 the detailed recovery rates relative standard deviation linearity limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq are shown in text s2 and table s4 2 4 ecological risk assessment and identification of priority ppcps the long term exposure ecotoxicity of ppcps was assessed by calculating the total risk quotient rqt of ppcp mixtures to algae crustacean and fish respectively backhaus and faust 2012 ec 2003 eca 2008 the computational method is shown in eq 1 1 r q t i 1 n r q i i 1 n m e c i p n e c i where meci and pneci represent the measured environmental concentration and predicted no effect concentration for compound i respectively detailed explanations for the selection of toxicity data and calculation method are described in text s3 and table s5 accordingly the ecological risk was categorized into high risk rqt 1 0 medium risk 1 0 rqt 0 1 and low risk rqt 0 1 ec 2003 riva et al 2019 furthermore to identify the priority ppcps with high ecological risk the prioritization index pi of each ppcp was obtained according to eq 2 2 p i i r q m i f i r q m i n i n 100 rqmi refers to the mean risk quotient value of compound i which was calculated based on its most sensitive aquatic organism the lowest pnec among the three aquatic species ni and n refer to the number of samples with concentrations higher than pneci and the total number of samples n in rivers the bay the ys and the ecs were 26 27 27 and 20 respectively respectively thereafter the target ppcps could be divided into five levels high risk pi 1 moderate risk 1 pi 0 1 endurable risk 0 1 pi 0 01 negligible risk 0 1 pi 0 01 and safe pi 0 du et al 2020 2 5 statistical analysis the map visualizations for the sampling sites and spatial distribution of ppcps were plotted by arcgis 10 3 box plots and histograms were drawn by using originpro 2022 statistical analyses one way anova were conducted by spss 26 0 and the p value used to indicate statistical significance was below 0 05 for statistical purposes ppcp concentrations below the lod were assigned random values between 0 and lod and concentrations in the range of lod and loq were assigned randomly between the two values 3 results and discussion 3 1 levels and composition of ppcps in water from rivers to coastal sea the target ppcps were ubiquitous in the waters with a downward trend in ppcp detection frequencies dfs and concentrations from rivers to bay and to coastal seas fig 2 and table s6 in general all 30 target ppcps were detected at least once in the river water while 25 20 and 19 target ppcps were detected in the bay ys and ecs waters respectively fig 2 the total concentrations of ppcps in the water of rivers bay the ys and the ecs were 239 1714 143 212 76 7 121 and 77 5 162 ng l respectively with averages of 675 166 95 6 and 114 ng l respectively fig 3 a in the process of ppcp transport from rivers to coastal seas the proportion of antibiotic concentrations to total ppcp concentrations decreased from 76 to 70 bay 37 ys and 29 ecs while the pcp proportion increased from 14 to 20 49 and 60 fig 3b the estrogen proportion was relatively stable the characteristics of ppcp concentrations and compositions might be comprehensibly influenced by ppcp sources such as terrestrial input mariculture and coastal entertainment degradation and seawater dilution effects during the transport of contaminants from land to open sea for example according to the united states environmental protection agency ecotox database the biodegradation half life of target antibiotics shorter than 3 5 days for most of the target antibiotics was generally shorter than that of pcps and estrogens which may be an underlying cause of the lower proportion of antibiotics in seawater 3 1 1 antibiotics the results showed that the overall dfs and concentrations of antibiotics in the waters followed the order river bay coastal areas fig 2 and table s6 fifteen 12 6 and 6 target antibiotics were detected in the water of rivers bay the ys and the ecs respectively with dfs in the range of 15 100 11 100 4 100 and 10 100 respectively fig 2 and table s6 amox were detected in all water samples and the dfs of six antibiotics ff atm ofx cfx nfx and smm were 100 in both river water and bay water additionally the dfs of nfx were above 50 in river water and seawater in contrast three antibiotics cap tyl and sdz were absent in the seawater the total antibiotic concentrations were in the range of 97 0 1545 81 2 151 9 98 62 2 and 18 2 59 1 ng l in the water of rivers bay the ys and the ecs respectively fig 3 antibiotic concentrations in the seawater of the ys 35 4 ng l mean value and ecs 32 6 ng l were significantly p 0 05 lower than those in river water 515 ng l and bay water 115 ng l antibiotics in the waters were dominated by the classes ß lactams and fluoroquinolones which accounted for over 90 of the total antibiotic concentrations fig 4 amox was identified as the dominant antibiotic with maximum concentrations of 1334 93 1 66 0 and 54 6 ng l in the water of rivers bay the ys and the ecs respectively table s6 the average concentrations of amox ranged from 27 1 to 420 ng l which contributed to more than 60 of the total antibiotic concentrations in both river water and seawater fig 2 and 4 as a commonly used access group antibiotic recommended by the world health organization who 2017 the relatively higher concentration of amox was consistent with its higher usage in china zhang et al 2015 furthermore the mean value of nfx concentrations were 28 8 9 40 4 03 and 1 26 ng l in the water of rivers bay the ys and the ecs respectively which were higher than those of other target antibiotics except amox 3 1 2 estrogens the dfs of target estrogens were generally higher than those of antibiotics fig 2 the target estrogens were detected in all the water samples in rivers and the bay and were detected at least once in the water of the ys with dfs ranging from 11 to 100 fig 2 and table s6 in addition five estrogens except e2 were detected in the water of the ecs with dfs ranging from 25 to 100 fig 2 and table s6 the dfs of e1 and des were 100 in both river water and seawater while the dfs of e2 and ee2 were below 50 in coastal waters in the seawater samples the total estrogen concentrations were in the range of 13 4 28 1 5 17 28 0 and 2 73 29 3 ng l in the bay ys and ecs respectively with averages of 16 0 13 2 and 12 7 ng l which were significantly p 0 05 lower than those in river water 29 3 348 ng l 69 8 ng l in average as shown in fig 2 the concentrations of e1 e2 and des decreased gradually in the water from rivers to coastal seas while the concentrations of e3 and bpa in the bay water were lower than those in coastal waters which indicated that there may exist extra pollution sources of these chemicals in coastal regions bpa contamination was the most prominent issue with respect to estrogen pollution in the water of rivers and the ecs with average concentrations of 36 5 and 4 62 ng l respectively which accounted for 52 and 36 of the total estrogen concentrations respectively figs 2 and 4 the dominant estrogens in the water of bay and ys waters were des and e3 respectively and accounted for more than 30 of the total estrogen concentrations fig 4 of interest the total concentrations of synthesized estrogens ee2 des and bpa were higher than those of natural estrogens e1 e2 and e3 in both river water and seawater bpa is a common industrial additive employed in polycarbonate plastic epoxy resins and flame retardants and it has been identified as a substance of very concern due to its reproductive toxicity salgueiro gonzalez et al 2019 wee et al 2019 in addition the use of des in livestock and aquaculture was banned in china in twenty years ago mapra 2002 the higher dfs and concentrations of bpa and des reflected the higher usage and release of these compounds which should be given constant attention ee2 a principal component of oral contraceptive pills has been proven to be a major contributor to estrogenic activity lei et al 2020 lu et al 2021 despite the longer biodegradation half life of ee2 58 days than bpa 15 days and des 6 5 days the concentration of ee2 was generally lower than that of the other two synthesized estrogens 3 1 3 personal care products the dfs and concentrations of the target personal care products pcps are shown in fig 2 and table s6 all the target pcps were detected in river water with dfs ranging from 4 to 100 and eight of the nine pcps except tcc were detected in the seawater phab mep tcs and bha were detected in almost all the water samples dfs exceeded 85 while prp and bup presented higher dfs in coastal waters 94 100 than in river water and bay water 0 23 the total average concentrations of pcps in the water of rivers bay ys and ecs waters were 90 3 24 0 254 ng l 34 6 24 4 51 2 ng l 46 9 37 3 64 7 ng l and 68 2 ng l 51 7 94 5 ng l respectively fig 3a and table s6 it is worth noting that the pcp concentrations in coastal waters were significantly p 0 05 higher than those in bay water which indicated that there might be more direct pollution sources of pcps in offshore environments phba a precursor of parabens preservative used in pharmaceuticals cosmetics and foodstuffs was identified as the dominant pcp in river water and coastal waters accounting for up to 64 58 and 70 of the total pcp concentrations in the water of river ys and ecs waters respectively fig 4 in addition tcs and mep were subdominant in river water and coastal waters respectively contributing more than 15 of the total pcp concentrations in the bay water the average concentrations of tcs 15 1 ng l and phba 14 3 ng l were significantly higher than those of the other pcps and the contribution of the two compounds to the total pcp burden exceeded 80 figs 2c and 4 as a commonly used antimicrobial in consumer products and medical disinfectants tcs is one of the most frequently detected organic compounds in surface water li et al 2021a lu et al 2022b singh and suthar 2021 xu et al 2022 additionally mep is reported to be the predominant paraben of china and phba is the major hydrolysate of mep haman et al 2015 ma et al 2016 thus the relatively higher residual concentrations of phba mep and tcs than other pcps are largely relevant to their relatively higher consumption in daily life 3 2 spatial distribution of ppcps in the water of the yellow and east china seas 3 2 1 horizontal distribution of ppcps the spatial distributions of the total ppcp concentrations in the surface seawater of the ys and ecs are illustrated in fig 5 the results showed that the ppcp concentrations in the water of the ecs were generally higher than those in the ys despite the stronger water exchange ability of the ecs which is closer to the pacific ocean it has been reported that the quantity of direct land based outfalls around the ecs 166 and sewage flowing into the ecs approximately 4196 million tons exceeds that in the ys 80 outfalls 897 million tons of sewage mee 2022 which may be an important cause of the higher ppcp concentrations in the water of the ecs than in that of the ys the total ppcp concentrations in the surface seawater of the ecs were generally higher in the southeastern waters outside the yangtze estuary and hangzhou bay as the largest river in china the yangtze river flows through several large cities such as shanghai nanjing wuhan and chongqing in southern china and receives various contaminants from sewage treatment plants and anthropogenic activities leng et al 2021 li et al 2021b luo et al 2021 studies conducted in recent years have revealed that the waters in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and yangtze estuary were seriously polluted by ppcps guo et al 2019 nie et al 2015 yao et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 in addition the qiantang river the largest river of zhejiang province flows into the ecs through hangzhou bay in which various antibiotics have been detected bao et al 2021 li et al 2020 yuan et al 2019 the ppcps in the seawater of the yangtze estuary and hanzhou bay spread to the southeast under the action of the subei coastal water and changjiang diluted water zhong et al 2020 which led to higher ppcp concentrations in the adjacent southeastern coastal area than in other regions however the total ppcp concentrations presented a generally smaller spatial variation in the surface seawater of the ys showing a homogeneous distribution pattern 3 2 2 vertical variation in ppcp concentrations the variation in ppcp concentrations with water depth was evaluated by investigating the ppcp concentrations in seawater collected from different depths in the ys y7 and y9 fig s1 the concentrations of antibiotics and pcps in surface seawater 28 4 47 8 ng l were lower than those at 10 m depth 40 6 67 4 ng l this change might be caused by the photodecomposition or photodegradation of antibiotics and pcps from 10 m depth to bottom 40 m for the y7 site and 60 m for the y9 site the antibiotic and pcp concentrations generally showed a decreasing trend fig s1 however the concentration profiles of estrogen along seawater depth were different from those of antibiotics and pcps probably because marine animals excrete some estrogens which may affect the vertical variation in estrogen concentrations in addition the coefficients of variation cvs of the antibiotic estrogen and pcp concentrations at the y7 site were 37 67 and 19 respectively these values for the y9 site were 28 22 and 18 respectively suggesting the relatively homogenous vertical mixing of the water column at station y9 in addition the lower cv of pcp indicated a relatively small vertical variation of pcp concentrations compared to antibiotics and estrogens 3 3 ecological risks of ppcps to different aquatic taxa considering the distinction in the composition of ppcps between different regions combined with the greater diversity in the marine environment compared to that in freshwater the difference in ppcp levels does not fully reflect the difference in ecological risks of ppcps in rivers bay and coastal seas therefore the potential ecological risks of the target ppcps to different trophic levels of aquatic organisms algae crustacean and fish were assessed by calculating the total risk quotient rqt of the ppcp mixtures fig 6 the results revealed that the target ppcps presented high risk rqt 1 0 to algae and fish in river water bay water and almost all the coastal water samples indicating that the ppcps are extremely likely to interfere with the growth and reproduction of algae and fish the mean values of rqt to algae were 6 92 20 6 5 94 and 5 90 in the river bay ys and ecs waters respectively and for fish these values were 13 6 39 4 26 0 and 16 8 respectively the ppcps posed a median risk 0 1 rqt 1 0 to crustacean in the river water and coastal water but elicited a high risk in the bay water these findings suggested that algae and fish are more sensitive to ppcp mixtures than crustacean of interest the rqt of ppcps in bay water was generally higher than that in river water despite the higher ppcp concentrations in river water than in bay water which may be related to the susceptibility of marine organisms eca 2008 by categories of ppcps the rqt of antibiotics and pcps to algae 0 46 17 4 was higher than that to crustacean 0 01 0 11 and fish 0 01 0 64 while the rqt of estrogens to fish 0 04 137 was highest among the three aquatic organisms fig 6 overall the 15 target antibiotics may pose high risk to algae low to medium risk to fish and low risk to crustacean the six estrogens mainly presented high risk to fish as well as algae in seawater while posing medium risk to crustacean for pcps the rqt to the three aquatic organisms were below 1 0 in the overwhelming majority of the water samples in consideration of the complexity and vulnerability of marine ecosystems the protection of marine ecosystems needs further enhancement 3 4 risk ranking and priority of ppcps the results of the ecological risk assessment identified the general impact of ppcps on aquatic organisms however the crucial contaminants of great concern are less specific thus the risk grading of the target ppcps was evaluated based on the prioritization index of each compound fig 7 and table s7 four 7 6 and 5 high risk pollutants were identified in the water of rivers bays the ys and the ecs respectively fig 7 and table s7 furthermore the general risk level of different categories of ppcps was in the rank order of estrogens antibiotics and pcps fig 7 specifically e3 and ee2 were classified as high risk pollutants in both river water and seawater and e1 was likewise a high risk pollutant in the water of the bay and ys while it was a moderate risk compound in the water of rivers and the ecs fig 7 although des was not detected in the water of rivers it was categorized as a high risk pollutant in the seawater additionally e2 was a high risk pollutant in the water of rivers and bays and bpa in the coastal seawater was proven to be a high risk pollutant as well for antibiotics amox was categorized as a high risk pollutant and nfx posed an endurable risk in the bay water regarding the risk level of pcps as a compound on the priority list set by the european demonstration program tousova et al 2017 the antimicrobial tcs was determined to be a high risk pollutant in the bay water and a moderate risk pollutant in the water of rivers and coastal seas the other pcps detected in the water were all proven to be safe for their most sensitive aquatic organism generally special attention should be given to these high risk pollutants particularly to amox e2 and e3 which presented the highest ecological risk in the river water bay water and coastal water respectively with prioritization indices of 5 18 14 0 11 7 and 8 74 in the water of rives bay the ys and the ecs respectively table s7 it is noteworthy that the degradation products of some ppcps are much more toxic and persistent than their parent substance sodhi et al 2021 furthermore some ppcps show high potential for bioaccumulation which leads to the trophic transfer of ppcps in marine ecosystem hence the degradation products and food web bioaccumulation of ppcps especially for priority ppcps should be considered in future research 4 conclusions the distribution risks and priority of thirty ppcps were first investigated on a large scale in the waters from the jiaozhou bay watershed to the yellow and east china seas in china target ppcps were ubiquitous in the waters with a downward trend in detection frequencies and concentrations from rivers 675 ng l on average to bay 166 ng l and to coastal seas 103 ng l from rivers to coastal seas the proportion of antibiotic concentrations to total ppcp concentrations decreased and the proportion of pcp concentrations increased which may affect by pollution sources degradation and seawater dilution effects during the transport of contaminants amox and phba were the prominent antibiotic and pcp respectively spatially the total ppcp concentrations in the seawater of ecs were generally higher than those in the ys and higher ppcp concentrations appeared in the southeastern waters outside the yangtze estuary and hangzhou bay of the ecs additionally seawater depth could influence ppcp concentrations ppcp mixtures might elicit high risk to algae and fish and median to high risk to crustacean the rqt of ppcps in bay water was generally higher than that in rivers which may be related to the susceptibility of marine organisms the rqt of antibiotics and pcps to algae were highest while estrogens might cause the greatest damage to fish furthermore the high risk pollutants were identified based on pi values and special attention should be given to amox e2 and e3 due to the highest pi values of these compounds in rivers bay and coastal seas respectively future studies should dig deep into the degradation products and food web bioaccumulation of ppcps especially for priority ppcps credit authorship contribution statement shuang lu methodology formal analysis writing original draft jing wang conceptualization writing review

15175,pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps have captured global concern due to their detrimental effects on aquatic organisms thirty ppcps were analyzed in the water of the jiaozhou bay

consumption chen et al 2022 tiseo et al 2020 in addition china possesses the highest growth rate of the pcp market worldwide and the proportion of the global total industry value in china is approximately 10 liu and wong 2013 liu et al 2020 ppcps cannot be completely metabolized by organisms and the conventional wastewater treatment processes are inadequate for removing ppcps carvalho and santos 2016 chen et al 2022 petrie et al 2015 thus various types of ppcps are continuously released into the environment during excretion rinsing manufacturing and disposal which has led to the prevalence of these contaminants in aquatic environments worldwide cantwell et al 2018 fonseca et al 2020 he et al 2019 mijangos et al 2018 xu et al 2022 in the coastal watersheds various ppcps from land based point sources riverine runoff and direct sewage discharge or nonpoint sources aquaculture effluent and recreational activities are eventually discharged into estuaries bays and coastal regions which are critical areas for human habitation as well as ecologically fragile regions with abundant marine resources lyu et al 2020 yang et al 2020 to date various types of ppcps and their metabolites are ubiquitously observed in marine environments worldwide celic et al 2021 han et al 2020 kötke et al 2019 miller et al 2021 song et al 2020 and even in remote undeveloped areas such as the mariana trench and the antarctic hernandez et al 2019 yang et al 2021 from rivers to bays and to coastal areas the distribution patterns of ppcps are highly heterogeneous in different regions which are affected by anthropogenic emissions and the environmental processes of ppcps under complicated marine conditions kafaei et al 2018 meng et al 2022 wang et al 2022 xu et al 2019 however compared with estuaries and bays the distribution patterns of chemically diverse ppcps in coastal waters are relatively less understood furthermore a comprehensive knowledge on ppcp occurrence from rivers to bays and to coastal areas on a large regional scale which has not yet been reported is needed despite the relatively low ppcp concentrations ng l or µg l levels in aquatic environments the potential nonreversible ecotoxicological impacts of ppcps on aquatic organisms have attracted considerable concern worldwide celic et al 2021 fonseca et al 2020 han et al 2020 liang et al 2022 thornber et al 2022 long term exposure to ppcps may inhibit primary productivity cause oxidative stress toxicity disrupt the endocrine system damage the thyroid and impact the endocrine system and metabolic pathways in aquatic organisms bilal and iqbal 2019 cui et al 2021 liang et al 2022 xin et al 2019 2020 additionally the prevalence of drugs can promote the emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance amr which has become one of the greatest threats to global public health chen et al 2021 thornber et al 2022 furthermore recent studies have reported the coexistence and interactions of antibiotics and microplastics which can enrich amr from the surrounding environment atugoda et al 2021 wang et al 2021a 2021b in addition the plant accumulation and bioaccumulation of ppcps has been proven in several studies li et al 2022 xu et al 2022 xue et al 2017 thus a comprehensive risk assessment of ppcps along with the proper identification of priority pollutants in coastal waters is necessary for the prevention and control of ppcp contamination nonetheless the related studies in coastal waters are sorely lacking at present this study focused on the jiaozhou bay watershed the yellow sea ys and the east china sea ecs in china jiaozhou bay an urbanized bay in the yellow sea coast is deeply affected by the anthropogenic activities of qingdao city and its adjacent rivers the yellow sea and east china sea are important marginal seas of china and receive large amounts of wastewater contains various contaminants from developed eastern china which significantly deteriorates the coastal environment mee 2022 to our knowledge few studies have explored the occurrence of emerging contaminants in the seawater of the yellow and east china seas zhang et al 2013 du et al 2017 zhong et al 2020 an early study in 2010 investigated the presence of eleven antibiotics in offshore water of the yellow sea and found that the detection rates for most antibiotics were below 10 zhang et al 2013 du et al 2017 found that the distribution of antibiotics demonstrated a seaward decreasing trend in the seawater of the south yellow sea beside yancheng city zhong et al 2020 reported the wide occurrence of organophosphorus flame retardants and plasticizers in the yellow and east china seas and these pollutants were observed at higher concentrations in the yellow sea than in the east china sea in general the distribution and ecological risks of ppcps in the coastal waters of the yellow and east china seas are still unclear and the related comprehensive investigation from rivers to coastal regions is even more lacking accordingly a total of 100 surface and bottom water samples were collected from the watershed of jiaozhou bay the yellow sea and the east china sea to i systematically investigate the occurrence and composition of thirty target ppcps including fifteen antibiotics six estrogens and nine personal care products in the water from river to coastal regions ii illustrate the spatial distribution of ppcps in coastal waters iii assess the ecological risk of multiple ppcps to aquatic organisms and iv identify the priority ppcps with high ecological risk the results of this study can provide valuable information for understanding the behavior of ppcps from rivers to coastal seas and assessing the potential risk and priority of ppcps which could be significant for better management of emerging contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection jiaozhou bay is a semi enclosed bay surrounded by qingdao an international city with rapid socioeconomic development the bay is seriously affected by the intensive anthropogenic activities and the surrounding rivers are accompanied by abundant industrial and domestic waste partial contaminants contained in the bay will enter the yellow sea through the narrow channel located in the southeast of the bay fig 1 the yellow sea and east china sea of china are marginal seas located at the western edge of the pacific ocean and their coastal area is among the most developed and densely populated areas in china hundreds of pollution sources are directly adjacent to the sea which have an annual sewage emission of more than six billion tons mee 2022 water samples were collected at 26 27 18 and 20 sites in six main rivers flowing into jiaozhou bay jiaozhou bay the ys and the ecs respectively fig 1 in detail surface water samples approximately 1 m below the water surface were collected at each site and layered seawater samples were collected at y7 10 20 30 and 40 m and y9 10 20 30 40 and 60 m in the ys fig 1 thus a total of 100 water samples were obtained by the sampling campaign conducted from may to october of 2019 the gathered water samples 2 l for each sample were placed in umber glass bottles cleaned in advance and adjusted to a ph of 3 0 5 lu et al 2022a 2022b subsequently the samples were transported to the laboratory in iceboxes and preprocessed in 48 h 2 2 chemicals and reagents thirty ppcps were selected mainly based on their categories application purposes potential toxic effects and usage in china ec 2018 lu et al 2022a who 2017 the target ppcps comprised fifteen antibiotics belonging to five classes β lactam amphenicols macrolides fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides six estrogens natural and synthetic estrogens and nine personal care products preservatives disinfectants and antioxidants correspondingly twenty three isotopically labeled compounds were used as internal standards iss the chemicals purity 98 were obtained from sigma aldrich uk and toronto research chemicals inc canada more information on the target ppcps and corresponding iss is shown in table s1 2 3 sample pretreatment instrumental analysis and quality control the process of sample pretreatment and quantification of ppcps was conducted following previous studies lu et al 2022a 2022b simply stated filtered water samples from each site 2 l were divided into duplicate and mixed with 100 ng iss to verify recoveries of the samples the water samples were then extracted by preprepared hlb cartridges waters usa and eluted with a mixture of methanol acetonitrile and ethyl acetate 12 6 and 6 ml respectively then the elute was evaporated with gentle nitrogen and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography lc 20adxr shimadzu japan coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry api 4500 applied biosystems usa a detailed description of sample pretreatment and instrumental analysis is provided in text s1 and table s2 the experiment was subject to strict quality assurance and control procedures method accuracy and instrumental performance were checked by spiked river water and seawater at 10 50 and 100 ng l in triplicate the recovery of the method was in the range of 66 9 111 for river water and 61 0 114 for seawater and relative standard deviations for triplicate samples were less than 15 table s3 for each batch of samples to be analyzed field samples solvent blanks procedural blanks and standard mixtures were run to check for cross contamination and quantification additionally the recovery rates corresponding to the iss for 30 ppcps ranged from 64 to 105 the detailed recovery rates relative standard deviation linearity limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq are shown in text s2 and table s4 2 4 ecological risk assessment and identification of priority ppcps the long term exposure ecotoxicity of ppcps was assessed by calculating the total risk quotient rqt of ppcp mixtures to algae crustacean and fish respectively backhaus and faust 2012 ec 2003 eca 2008 the computational method is shown in eq 1 1 r q t i 1 n r q i i 1 n m e c i p n e c i where meci and pneci represent the measured environmental concentration and predicted no effect concentration for compound i respectively detailed explanations for the selection of toxicity data and calculation method are described in text s3 and table s5 accordingly the ecological risk was categorized into high risk rqt 1 0 medium risk 1 0 rqt 0 1 and low risk rqt 0 1 ec 2003 riva et al 2019 furthermore to identify the priority ppcps with high ecological risk the prioritization index pi of each ppcp was obtained according to eq 2 2 p i i r q m i f i r q m i n i n 100 rqmi refers to the mean risk quotient value of compound i which was calculated based on its most sensitive aquatic organism the lowest pnec among the three aquatic species ni and n refer to the number of samples with concentrations higher than pneci and the total number of samples n in rivers the bay the ys and the ecs were 26 27 27 and 20 respectively respectively thereafter the target ppcps could be divided into five levels high risk pi 1 moderate risk 1 pi 0 1 endurable risk 0 1 pi 0 01 negligible risk 0 1 pi 0 01 and safe pi 0 du et al 2020 2 5 statistical analysis the map visualizations for the sampling sites and spatial distribution of ppcps were plotted by arcgis 10 3 box plots and histograms were drawn by using originpro 2022 statistical analyses one way anova were conducted by spss 26 0 and the p value used to indicate statistical significance was below 0 05 for statistical purposes ppcp concentrations below the lod were assigned random values between 0 and lod and concentrations in the range of lod and loq were assigned randomly between the two values 3 results and discussion 3 1 levels and composition of ppcps in water from rivers to coastal sea the target ppcps were ubiquitous in the waters with a downward trend in ppcp detection frequencies dfs and concentrations from rivers to bay and to coastal seas fig 2 and table s6 in general all 30 target ppcps were detected at least once in the river water while 25 20 and 19 target ppcps were detected in the bay ys and ecs waters respectively fig 2 the total concentrations of ppcps in the water of rivers bay the ys and the ecs were 239 1714 143 212 76 7 121 and 77 5 162 ng l respectively with averages of 675 166 95 6 and 114 ng l respectively fig 3 a in the process of ppcp transport from rivers to coastal seas the proportion of antibiotic concentrations to total ppcp concentrations decreased from 76 to 70 bay 37 ys and 29 ecs while the pcp proportion increased from 14 to 20 49 and 60 fig 3b the estrogen proportion was relatively stable the characteristics of ppcp concentrations and compositions might be comprehensibly influenced by ppcp sources such as terrestrial input mariculture and coastal entertainment degradation and seawater dilution effects during the transport of contaminants from land to open sea for example according to the united states environmental protection agency ecotox database the biodegradation half life of target antibiotics shorter than 3 5 days for most of the target antibiotics was generally shorter than that of pcps and estrogens which may be an underlying cause of the lower proportion of antibiotics in seawater 3 1 1 antibiotics the results showed that the overall dfs and concentrations of antibiotics in the waters followed the order river bay coastal areas fig 2 and table s6 fifteen 12 6 and 6 target antibiotics were detected in the water of rivers bay the ys and the ecs respectively with dfs in the range of 15 100 11 100 4 100 and 10 100 respectively fig 2 and table s6 amox were detected in all water samples and the dfs of six antibiotics ff atm ofx cfx nfx and smm were 100 in both river water and bay water additionally the dfs of nfx were above 50 in river water and seawater in contrast three antibiotics cap tyl and sdz were absent in the seawater the total antibiotic concentrations were in the range of 97 0 1545 81 2 151 9 98 62 2 and 18 2 59 1 ng l in the water of rivers bay the ys and the ecs respectively fig 3 antibiotic concentrations in the seawater of the ys 35 4 ng l mean value and ecs 32 6 ng l were significantly p 0 05 lower than those in river water 515 ng l and bay water 115 ng l antibiotics in the waters were dominated by the classes ß lactams and fluoroquinolones which accounted for over 90 of the total antibiotic concentrations fig 4 amox was identified as the dominant antibiotic with maximum concentrations of 1334 93 1 66 0 and 54 6 ng l in the water of rivers bay the ys and the ecs respectively table s6 the average concentrations of amox ranged from 27 1 to 420 ng l which contributed to more than 60 of the total antibiotic concentrations in both river water and seawater fig 2 and 4 as a commonly used access group antibiotic recommended by the world health organization who 2017 the relatively higher concentration of amox was consistent with its higher usage in china zhang et al 2015 furthermore the mean value of nfx concentrations were 28 8 9 40 4 03 and 1 26 ng l in the water of rivers bay the ys and the ecs respectively which were higher than those of other target antibiotics except amox 3 1 2 estrogens the dfs of target estrogens were generally higher than those of antibiotics fig 2 the target estrogens were detected in all the water samples in rivers and the bay and were detected at least once in the water of the ys with dfs ranging from 11 to 100 fig 2 and table s6 in addition five estrogens except e2 were detected in the water of the ecs with dfs ranging from 25 to 100 fig 2 and table s6 the dfs of e1 and des were 100 in both river water and seawater while the dfs of e2 and ee2 were below 50 in coastal waters in the seawater samples the total estrogen concentrations were in the range of 13 4 28 1 5 17 28 0 and 2 73 29 3 ng l in the bay ys and ecs respectively with averages of 16 0 13 2 and 12 7 ng l which were significantly p 0 05 lower than those in river water 29 3 348 ng l 69 8 ng l in average as shown in fig 2 the concentrations of e1 e2 and des decreased gradually in the water from rivers to coastal seas while the concentrations of e3 and bpa in the bay water were lower than those in coastal waters which indicated that there may exist extra pollution sources of these chemicals in coastal regions bpa contamination was the most prominent issue with respect to estrogen pollution in the water of rivers and the ecs with average concentrations of 36 5 and 4 62 ng l respectively which accounted for 52 and 36 of the total estrogen concentrations respectively figs 2 and 4 the dominant estrogens in the water of bay and ys waters were des and e3 respectively and accounted for more than 30 of the total estrogen concentrations fig 4 of interest the total concentrations of synthesized estrogens ee2 des and bpa were higher than those of natural estrogens e1 e2 and e3 in both river water and seawater bpa is a common industrial additive employed in polycarbonate plastic epoxy resins and flame retardants and it has been identified as a substance of very concern due to its reproductive toxicity salgueiro gonzalez et al 2019 wee et al 2019 in addition the use of des in livestock and aquaculture was banned in china in twenty years ago mapra 2002 the higher dfs and concentrations of bpa and des reflected the higher usage and release of these compounds which should be given constant attention ee2 a principal component of oral contraceptive pills has been proven to be a major contributor to estrogenic activity lei et al 2020 lu et al 2021 despite the longer biodegradation half life of ee2 58 days than bpa 15 days and des 6 5 days the concentration of ee2 was generally lower than that of the other two synthesized estrogens 3 1 3 personal care products the dfs and concentrations of the target personal care products pcps are shown in fig 2 and table s6 all the target pcps were detected in river water with dfs ranging from 4 to 100 and eight of the nine pcps except tcc were detected in the seawater phab mep tcs and bha were detected in almost all the water samples dfs exceeded 85 while prp and bup presented higher dfs in coastal waters 94 100 than in river water and bay water 0 23 the total average concentrations of pcps in the water of rivers bay ys and ecs waters were 90 3 24 0 254 ng l 34 6 24 4 51 2 ng l 46 9 37 3 64 7 ng l and 68 2 ng l 51 7 94 5 ng l respectively fig 3a and table s6 it is worth noting that the pcp concentrations in coastal waters were significantly p 0 05 higher than those in bay water which indicated that there might be more direct pollution sources of pcps in offshore environments phba a precursor of parabens preservative used in pharmaceuticals cosmetics and foodstuffs was identified as the dominant pcp in river water and coastal waters accounting for up to 64 58 and 70 of the total pcp concentrations in the water of river ys and ecs waters respectively fig 4 in addition tcs and mep were subdominant in river water and coastal waters respectively contributing more than 15 of the total pcp concentrations in the bay water the average concentrations of tcs 15 1 ng l and phba 14 3 ng l were significantly higher than those of the other pcps and the contribution of the two compounds to the total pcp burden exceeded 80 figs 2c and 4 as a commonly used antimicrobial in consumer products and medical disinfectants tcs is one of the most frequently detected organic compounds in surface water li et al 2021a lu et al 2022b singh and suthar 2021 xu et al 2022 additionally mep is reported to be the predominant paraben of china and phba is the major hydrolysate of mep haman et al 2015 ma et al 2016 thus the relatively higher residual concentrations of phba mep and tcs than other pcps are largely relevant to their relatively higher consumption in daily life 3 2 spatial distribution of ppcps in the water of the yellow and east china seas 3 2 1 horizontal distribution of ppcps the spatial distributions of the total ppcp concentrations in the surface seawater of the ys and ecs are illustrated in fig 5 the results showed that the ppcp concentrations in the water of the ecs were generally higher than those in the ys despite the stronger water exchange ability of the ecs which is closer to the pacific ocean it has been reported that the quantity of direct land based outfalls around the ecs 166 and sewage flowing into the ecs approximately 4196 million tons exceeds that in the ys 80 outfalls 897 million tons of sewage mee 2022 which may be an important cause of the higher ppcp concentrations in the water of the ecs than in that of the ys the total ppcp concentrations in the surface seawater of the ecs were generally higher in the southeastern waters outside the yangtze estuary and hangzhou bay as the largest river in china the yangtze river flows through several large cities such as shanghai nanjing wuhan and chongqing in southern china and receives various contaminants from sewage treatment plants and anthropogenic activities leng et al 2021 li et al 2021b luo et al 2021 studies conducted in recent years have revealed that the waters in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and yangtze estuary were seriously polluted by ppcps guo et al 2019 nie et al 2015 yao et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 in addition the qiantang river the largest river of zhejiang province flows into the ecs through hangzhou bay in which various antibiotics have been detected bao et al 2021 li et al 2020 yuan et al 2019 the ppcps in the seawater of the yangtze estuary and hanzhou bay spread to the southeast under the action of the subei coastal water and changjiang diluted water zhong et al 2020 which led to higher ppcp concentrations in the adjacent southeastern coastal area than in other regions however the total ppcp concentrations presented a generally smaller spatial variation in the surface seawater of the ys showing a homogeneous distribution pattern 3 2 2 vertical variation in ppcp concentrations the variation in ppcp concentrations with water depth was evaluated by investigating the ppcp concentrations in seawater collected from different depths in the ys y7 and y9 fig s1 the concentrations of antibiotics and pcps in surface seawater 28 4 47 8 ng l were lower than those at 10 m depth 40 6 67 4 ng l this change might be caused by the photodecomposition or photodegradation of antibiotics and pcps from 10 m depth to bottom 40 m for the y7 site and 60 m for the y9 site the antibiotic and pcp concentrations generally showed a decreasing trend fig s1 however the concentration profiles of estrogen along seawater depth were different from those of antibiotics and pcps probably because marine animals excrete some estrogens which may affect the vertical variation in estrogen concentrations in addition the coefficients of variation cvs of the antibiotic estrogen and pcp concentrations at the y7 site were 37 67 and 19 respectively these values for the y9 site were 28 22 and 18 respectively suggesting the relatively homogenous vertical mixing of the water column at station y9 in addition the lower cv of pcp indicated a relatively small vertical variation of pcp concentrations compared to antibiotics and estrogens 3 3 ecological risks of ppcps to different aquatic taxa considering the distinction in the composition of ppcps between different regions combined with the greater diversity in the marine environment compared to that in freshwater the difference in ppcp levels does not fully reflect the difference in ecological risks of ppcps in rivers bay and coastal seas therefore the potential ecological risks of the target ppcps to different trophic levels of aquatic organisms algae crustacean and fish were assessed by calculating the total risk quotient rqt of the ppcp mixtures fig 6 the results revealed that the target ppcps presented high risk rqt 1 0 to algae and fish in river water bay water and almost all the coastal water samples indicating that the ppcps are extremely likely to interfere with the growth and reproduction of algae and fish the mean values of rqt to algae were 6 92 20 6 5 94 and 5 90 in the river bay ys and ecs waters respectively and for fish these values were 13 6 39 4 26 0 and 16 8 respectively the ppcps posed a median risk 0 1 rqt 1 0 to crustacean in the river water and coastal water but elicited a high risk in the bay water these findings suggested that algae and fish are more sensitive to ppcp mixtures than crustacean of interest the rqt of ppcps in bay water was generally higher than that in river water despite the higher ppcp concentrations in river water than in bay water which may be related to the susceptibility of marine organisms eca 2008 by categories of ppcps the rqt of antibiotics and pcps to algae 0 46 17 4 was higher than that to crustacean 0 01 0 11 and fish 0 01 0 64 while the rqt of estrogens to fish 0 04 137 was highest among the three aquatic organisms fig 6 overall the 15 target antibiotics may pose high risk to algae low to medium risk to fish and low risk to crustacean the six estrogens mainly presented high risk to fish as well as algae in seawater while posing medium risk to crustacean for pcps the rqt to the three aquatic organisms were below 1 0 in the overwhelming majority of the water samples in consideration of the complexity and vulnerability of marine ecosystems the protection of marine ecosystems needs further enhancement 3 4 risk ranking and priority of ppcps the results of the ecological risk assessment identified the general impact of ppcps on aquatic organisms however the crucial contaminants of great concern are less specific thus the risk grading of the target ppcps was evaluated based on the prioritization index of each compound fig 7 and table s7 four 7 6 and 5 high risk pollutants were identified in the water of rivers bays the ys and the ecs respectively fig 7 and table s7 furthermore the general risk level of different categories of ppcps was in the rank order of estrogens antibiotics and pcps fig 7 specifically e3 and ee2 were classified as high risk pollutants in both river water and seawater and e1 was likewise a high risk pollutant in the water of the bay and ys while it was a moderate risk compound in the water of rivers and the ecs fig 7 although des was not detected in the water of rivers it was categorized as a high risk pollutant in the seawater additionally e2 was a high risk pollutant in the water of rivers and bays and bpa in the coastal seawater was proven to be a high risk pollutant as well for antibiotics amox was categorized as a high risk pollutant and nfx posed an endurable risk in the bay water regarding the risk level of pcps as a compound on the priority list set by the european demonstration program tousova et al 2017 the antimicrobial tcs was determined to be a high risk pollutant in the bay water and a moderate risk pollutant in the water of rivers and coastal seas the other pcps detected in the water were all proven to be safe for their most sensitive aquatic organism generally special attention should be given to these high risk pollutants particularly to amox e2 and e3 which presented the highest ecological risk in the river water bay water and coastal water respectively with prioritization indices of 5 18 14 0 11 7 and 8 74 in the water of rives bay the ys and the ecs respectively table s7 it is noteworthy that the degradation products of some ppcps are much more toxic and persistent than their parent substance sodhi et al 2021 furthermore some ppcps show high potential for bioaccumulation which leads to the trophic transfer of ppcps in marine ecosystem hence the degradation products and food web bioaccumulation of ppcps especially for priority ppcps should be considered in future research 4 conclusions the distribution risks and priority of thirty ppcps were first investigated on a large scale in the waters from the jiaozhou bay watershed to the yellow and east china seas in china target ppcps were ubiquitous in the waters with a downward trend in detection frequencies and concentrations from rivers 675 ng l on average to bay 166 ng l and to coastal seas 103 ng l from rivers to coastal seas the proportion of antibiotic concentrations to total ppcp concentrations decreased and the proportion of pcp concentrations increased which may affect by pollution sources degradation and seawater dilution effects during the transport of contaminants amox and phba were the prominent antibiotic and pcp respectively spatially the total ppcp concentrations in the seawater of ecs were generally higher than those in the ys and higher ppcp concentrations appeared in the southeastern waters outside the yangtze estuary and hangzhou bay of the ecs additionally seawater depth could influence ppcp concentrations ppcp mixtures might elicit high risk to algae and fish and median to high risk to crustacean the rqt of ppcps in bay water was generally higher than that in rivers which may be related to the susceptibility of marine organisms the rqt of antibiotics and pcps to algae were highest while estrogens might cause the greatest damage to fish furthermore the high risk pollutants were identified based on pi values and special attention should be given to amox e2 and e3 due to the highest pi values of these compounds in rivers bay and coastal seas respectively future studies should dig deep into the degradation products and food web bioaccumulation of ppcps especially for priority ppcps credit authorship contribution statement shuang lu methodology formal analysis writing original draft jing wang conceptualization writing review

15176,linear and branched isomers of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are simultaneously present in the environment however isomer profiles of pfass in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps are still unknown because of the limitations of standards here influent and effluent samples from 148 municipal wwtps in china were collected ion mobility spectrometry was introduced into high resolution mass spectrometry based suspect screening methods to identify the target and suspect pfas isomers a total of 38 branched isomers of 14 typical pfass were identified in wastewater samples linear pfass had higher detection rates 22 3 100 than branched isomers 2 0 98 compared to the influents proportions of branched isomers of most pfass except for perfluoropentanoic acid and perfluorohexanoic acid increased in the effluents the conventional biological treatment processes such as anaerobic anoxic aerobic and oxidation ditch treatments had poor removal efficiency for linear pfass 21 4 and branched isomers 13 4 no difference on removal efficiency among treatment processes was found furthermore isomer composition in the wwtps showed obvious differences between east china region and other regions and the usage of short chain pfass perfluorobutanesulfonic acid and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid may be a key factor for driving this difference this study sheds lights on the identification and characterization of pfas isomers in wwtps which would be useful for development of monitoring and control strategies of pfass graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords per and polyfluoroalkyl substances isomer wastewater treatment plant removal efficiency ion mobility spectrometry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are a range of synthetic organic compounds which are extensively applied in various consumer and industrial applications gluege et al 2020 because of their persistence bioaccumulation toxicity and long distance migration properties pfass are attracting attentions chohan et al 2021 ma et al 2022 typically pfass are produced primarily through two processes telomerisation and electrochemical fluorination ecf the telomerisation process yields relatively pure linear or isopropyl branched isomers while the ecf products contain approximately 70 80 linear structure and 20 30 branched isomers buck et al 2011 although telomerisation is becoming the main process for the production of perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas the large scale productions of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos and related chemicals are mainly produced by ecf process in china jiang et al 2015 which might result in residual branched pfass in the products accompanying emissions from production and usage pfass and their isomers have been detected in variety of environmental matrix and biological samples schulz et al 2020 because of their different physical and chemical properties the diverse isomers are found to have different environment behaviors and biological effects such as distribution bioaccumulation factors and elimination difference for example linear pfass are preferentially adsorbed by soil or sediment while branched isomers tend to exist in aqueous phase chen et al 2015 the different behavior of branched isomers might be related to their smaller octanol water partitioning coefficient and organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient than linear isomers londhe et al 2022 animal studies have shown preferential accumulation of the linear pfos and pfoa but the toxicity of pfass were isomer specific de silva et al 2009 greaves and letcher 2013 o brien et al 2011 found that a mixture of linear and branched isomers of pfos caused a greater transcriptional response than pure linear pfos in cultured chick embryo hepatocytes in particular the total branched isomer crosses the placenta more efficiently than the linear structure in humans beesoon et al 2011 gützkow et al 2012 thus it is essential to pay attention to isomers during measurement and assessment of pfass although both linear and branched isomers of pfass are simultaneously present in the environment most studies on pfas analysis were performed by eluting and integrating all isomers as a single peak for analysis or only focusing on linear structures cai et al 2022 wang et al 2021 besides because branched isomer standards of pfass are difficult to obtain only few studies on pfas isomers have been performed with reliable linear and branched reference standards of pfoa and pfos yu et al 2013 zhou et al 2019 the analyses that exclude branched isomers may lead to a deviation in understanding the environmental

suspect screening of pfas isomers is available municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered a sink for receiving pfas isomers released from human activities and the major source of pfas isomers discharged into the aquatic environment coggan et al 2019 however profiles of pfas isomers in influent and effluent of wwtps are still unknown relative composition of linear and branched isomers in wastewater influents could reflect the manufacture or emission characteristics to some extent benskin et al 2010 further comparison of pfas isomers in influents and effluents could provide

mobile phase a and 2 mm ammonium acetate in 95 methanol mobile phase b mass spectrometry data were obtained in high definition mse mode over the m z range of 50 1700 a collision energy of 6 ev was used for low energy scan and a collision energy range of 10 50 ev was set for high energy scan detailed description on the sample extraction instrument analysis and parameter setting are shown in the text s4 and text s5 2 4 data processing waters unifi software v 1 9 was used to acquire and process the data first an in house database was built based on the elemental composition information of 14 typical pfass including c5 c10 pfcas c4 c8 pfsas 6 2 fts 6 2 cl pfesa and pfosa then a peak picking algorithm was applied to extract chromatographic peaks and the minimum intensity for peak extraction was set to 100 counts for low energy spectra and 20 counts for high energy spectra then a feature list including m z retention time drift time and intensity was used for screening by matching the features with substances in the database to avoid missing potential branched isomers the formula with more than one feature were displayed by all matching features minimum relative intensity threshold for features with the same m z was set to 0 001 finally the linear structures were confirmed by the reference standards the detailed isomers identification flow is displayed in fig s1 due to the lack of linear reference standard for perfluoropentanesulfonic acid pfpes its linear structure was determined by the ccs reported in literature and error between measured ccs and reported ccs was 0 1

kit waters leucine enkephalin m z 554 2621 in negative ionization mode was injected every two minutes for mass correction linear standards of pfass were used to characterize the quality assurance and quality control process matrix spiked recovery of wastewater samples were carried to assess the sample treatment process and demonstrated a high level of accuracy mean recovery 78 102 the relative standard deviation rsd of inter day and intra day repeated injection of linear standard response was used to evaluate the stability of the instrument the inter day and intra day rsd values were all less than 15 detailed information on recovery and rsd are given in table s3 response value of peaks in the samples were calibrated by the corresponding linear internal standards procedure blanks were injected to examine the background values from different batch process and measurement before data analysis the blank responses were subtracted from signals in the samples 2 6 statistical analysis the removal efficiency of pfas isomers between influent and effluent were calculated based on the response of peaks with the internal standard calibration principal component analysis pca was conducted using factominer package to clarify the geographical distribution characteristics of isomer compositions the r software was employed for the all diagramming and statistical analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of pfas isomers analysis method for pfas isomers was established using uplc ims qtof first the commercial standards of t pfos and t pfhxs were employed to optimize operation parameters and their 14 isomers were identified table s4 the observed chromatography traces of t pfos and t pfhxs fig s2 and s3 were similar to previous reports which characterized branched isomers of pfos and pfhxs from multicomponent mixture standards jiang et al 2015 ma et al 2018 the scatter plot constructed by the mobility and chromatographic behavior of pfhxs and pfos isomers in fig 1 showed that the synergistic use of chromatography and mobility can improve the resolution of isomer separation for example the 1m pfos had a similar retention time to l pfos but they can be easily resolved by the ccs values conversely the 1m pfos and 3 5m pfos had very similar ccs values but the retention time of 3 5m pfos was smaller than 1m pfos moreover compared with branched isomers linear structures had longer retention times and greater ccs values which may be related to the stronger hydrophobicity and more stretched molecular structures of linear structures based on above results combination of retention time ccs value accurate mass and feature fragment information acquired by uplc ims qtof could ensure the identification accuracy and improve the separation resolution of pfas isomers besides the isomers in t pfos and t pfhxs this study also found 26 branched isomers of the other 12 pfass in the 296 wastewater samples by suspect screening method fig s4 s5 and table s5 usually the pfass with more than six carbons are called long chain pfass and those with less or equal to six carbons are called short chain pfass on the whole the number of isomer peaks of long chain pfass was generally more than that of short chain substances and the number of branched isomer peaks of perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas was more than that of perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas under the same carbon chain length for pfsas pfos had the highest number 7 of branched isomers followed by perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid pfhps 6 branched isomers and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid pfhxs 5 branched isomers perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs and perfluoropentanesulfonic acid pfpes had 2 branched isomer peaks it should be noted that this was the first time that the branched isomers of pfpes and pfhps were reported for pfcas pfoa had the highest number 4 of branched isomers for perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa and perfluorononanoic acid pfna two branched isomers were observed one branched isomer was observed for perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea while no isomer was observed for perfluorodecanoic acid pfda further no branched isomer peak was found for 6 2 fts and 6 2 cl pfesa which might be related to the production of the two substances by telomerisation process charbonnet et al 2021 additionally no branched isomer of pfas with less than six carbons has been reported in environmental samples benskin et al 2012 vyas et al 2007 while 5 branched isomers of short chain pfass pfpea pfbs and pfpes were observed in this study the occurrence of the branched isomers of short chain pfass might be due to their increasing usage as main substitutes of typical pfoa and pfos additionally the production processes for these new pfass are not yet transparent and novel sources of branched isomers have been identified beyond the known ecf source schulz et al 2020 some unknown production processes may lead to the generation of short chain pfas isomers the above results show the diversity and universal presence of branched isomers of pfass in wastewater emphasizing the importance of pfas isomers analyses 3 2 isomer profiles of pfass in wwtps isomer profiles of pfass in wwtp influents and effluents were determined table s6 among 11 pfass with detectable branched isomers detection rates of linear pfass in wwtps ranged from 22 3 to 100 the detection rates of branched pfass were lower than linear structures which were in the range of 2 0 to 98 detection rates of linear and branched isomers of pfoa and pfos were higher than other pfass for example the l pfoa was observed in 95 9 of influents and 100 of effluents and the branched pfoa isomers were observed in 74 3 of influents and 90 5 of effluents the almost ubiquitous linear and branched isomers of pfoa and pfos indicate that they are dominant pfass in the wastewater as for the main short chain surrogates for typical pfass l pfbs and l pfhxs had obviously higher detection rates 90 wwtps than their branched isomers 28 4 41 2 wwtps the pfpea had the lowest detection rates for both linear and branched isomers relative composition of pfas isomers in wastewater were further explored fig 2 in the influents branched isomers of pfhxa had the highest proportion 41 9 followed by pfos pfpea and pfoa high proportion of branched isomers of short chain pfcas pfpea and pfhxa might be related to their low response and decarboxylation in the analysis instrument ahmed et al 2019 gonzalez de vega et al 2021 for most pfsas except pfos their proportions of branched isomers were less than 6 furthermore proportions of branched isomers of long chain pfsas were higher than those of short chain pfsas which may be related to the high number of branched isomer of long chain substances additionally it has been reported that the ecf productive process could yield 20 30 branched pfos 15 20 branched pfoa and approximately 5 branched pfhxs schulz et al 2020 this study found that the proportions of branched pfos pfoa and pfhxs in the influents were 21 3 20 5 and 3 6 respectively which were basically consistent with the composition proportions in the products compared to the influents the proportions of branched isomers of most pfass except pfpea and pfhxa increased in the effluents due to the high break energy of c f bond up to 130 kcal mol it is difficult for organisms to utilize and destroy pfass and their isomers pan et al 2016 zhang et al 2022b thus adsorption in sludge is the primary mechanism for removal of pfass in wwtps kibambe et al 2020 generally a linear structure has stronger hydrophobicity and weaker polarity than its corresponding branched isomers londhe et al 2022 which has been verified by the fact that linear structure elutes at the latest on the chromatography column in this study as a result the linear pfass may be more easily adsorbed into the sludge phase than its branched isomers during wastewater treatment moreover the decreased proportion of branched isomers of pfpea and pfhxa in the effluents may be related to the increase of l pfpea and l pfhxa after treatment previous reports have shown that l pfpea and l pfhxa were the most dominant degradation products of telomerisation products such as 6 2 fts under microbial effect in wwtps thereby increasing the levels of l pfpea and l pfhxa in the effluents helmer et al 2022 houtz et al 2016 furthermore it should be noted that branched isomers with high detection rate in effluents also have high response proportion thus more attentions should be paid to them especially the branched isomers of typical pfos and pfoa further we attempted to explore the potential sources of pfas in the influents from different regions using cluster analysis fig s6 three main clusters were observed cluster 1 included hd and hz regions with the highest percentage 20 of branched isomers cluster 2 included hb xn and db regions with the percentage of branched isomers ranging from 18 to 20 and cluster 3 consisted of xb and hn regions with the percentage of branched isomers of 15 3 and 13 3 respectively the differences on the percentage of branched isomers among different regions were very small which indicate that there was no significant point source contributing branched or linear pfas in chinese municipal wastewater 3 3 removal efficiency of pfas isomers in wwtps removal efficiency of pfas isomers was low in wwtps fig 3 for linear pfass the removal efficiency ranged from 20 3 to 52 1 among them l pfda had the highest removal rate median 52 1 while l pfhps had the lowest removal rate median 20 3 as for the branched pfass their removal efficiency was in the range of 156 to 24 8 except br pfpes the high removal rate of br pfpes median 81 0 might be related to its low detection rate one detection in influent by comparing the removal efficiency of different pfass it can be found that the general removal efficiency of carboxylic acids was higher than that of sulfonic acids for both the linear and branched isomers additionally as the carbon chain grows the removal efficiency of linear isomers increased whereas that of branched isomers didn t vary regularly with the change of carbon chain length for example the removal efficiency of linear carboxylic acids showed a clear increasing trend with the increase of carbon chain length while that of branched carboxylic acids were basically the same fig 3a some of the possible reasons for the poor removal of pfas have been well known due to their low biodegradability pan et al 2016 zhang et al 2022b besides xiao et al 2012 reported that the degradation and transformation of precursors could lead to the secondary generation of pfass which might also contribute to the poor removal of pfass in this study it has been reported that fluorotelomer alcohols fluorotelomer sulfonates and polyfluoroalkyl phosphates can be degraded to pfcas when undergoing aerobic biological treatment houtz et al 2016 lewis et al 2016 perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides are the direct precursors of many pfsas peng et al 2014 in this study it was found that the remove efficiencies of potential precursor substances such as pfosa median 46 8 6 2 cl pfesa median 39 7 and 6 2 fts median 22 were higher than other linear and branched pfass while the median removal efficiencies of some pfcas and pfsas were even negative in addition the preferential transformation of br pfas precursors over l pfas precursors might also lead to the worse removal of branched isomers than linear pfass liu et al 2019 the removal efficiencies of different treatment processes in wwtps were further compared the removal efficiencies of linear and branched pfass in different treatment systems are displayed in fig s7 for linear isomers the following trend was found in terms of the median removal efficiencies ao 21 4 a2o 15 7 sbr 15 3 od 5 3 others 3 3 for branched isomers the removal efficiency varied widely and the trend of median removal efficiencies was ao 13 4 od 7 2 a2o 1 9 sbr 0 8 others 55 0 however there was no significant difference p 0 05 in each of different treatment process between linear and branched pfass expect a2o fig 3b prior to the aerobic treatment a2o process has more anaerobic anoxic treatment processes than other processes ebrahim et al 2021 found that the adsorption capacity of anaerobic biosolids to pfas was greater than that of aerobic biosolids the anaerobic anoxic pretreatment of a2o might increase the removal of linear structures and enlarge the removal difference between linear and branched isomer of pfass the above results show that the traditional biological treatment processes are inadequate to remove linear and branched isomers of pfass and even less effective in removing branched isomers 3 4 region distribution of pfas isomers the pca was performed to clarify the geographical distribution characteristics of isomer composition in the influents and effluents from different wwtps the results show that distribution patterns of pfas isomers in the influents and effluents were very similar fig s8 verifying that the wastewater treatment process had little effect on the isomer composition a positive correlation was observed between the linear pfass and their corresponding branched isomers fig 4 however contribution of branched isomers to the geographical distribution was smaller than that of linear isomers which may be related to the small proportion of branched isomers and also implied that the branched isomers might exist primarily as impurities of related linear products rather than specific products for usage it should be noticed that the contribution of branched isomers increased in the effluents compared to the influents thus attentions should be paid to branched isomer of pfass especially in assessing the pfass ecological risk of effluents among the branched isomers br pfos offered the greatest contribution to geographical differences followed by br pfhxs and br pfoa small contributions from br pfbs and other branched substances were identified the pca analysis also found that the isomer profiles in chinese wwtps were mainly divided into two clusters the hd region and other regions fig 4 linear and branched isomers of short chain pfass pfbs and pfhxs made an important contribution to the cluster of hd region while linear and branched isomers of long chain pfass pfoa and pfos had higher influence on the cluster of other regions fig 4 with the restrictions on the production and usage of pfoa and pfos in china short chain pfass are becoming the major substitutes for pfoa and pfos lu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022a however this process can be lengthy and not synchronized among regions short chain pfass in wastewater of hd region usually took up a larger proportion of total pfass than that in other regions which was also found in other water environment of this region an et al 2021 chen et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 this contribution feature in this study also reflected the trend of using short chain pfass to replace long chain pfass in the production and usage in hd region 4 conclusions this study identified 38 branched isomers of typical pfass in 148 wwtps by uplc ims qtof based suspect screening method linear pfass had higher detection rates than branched isomers however compared with the influents the proportions of branched isomers of most pfass except pfpea and pfhxa increased in the effluents further conventional biological treatment processes have poor removal efficiency for pfas isomers and removal efficiency of branched isomers was usually lower than that of linear isomers no difference on removal efficiency among treatment processes was found as for spatial variations on pfass isomers in wwtps isomer composition showed obvious difference between hd region and other regions and the usage of short chain alternatives may be a key factor for driving the difference this study sheds lights on the identification and characterization of pfas isomers in wwtps which would be of great significance for pfass supervision declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

15176,linear and branched isomers of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are simultaneously present in the environment however isomer profiles of pfass in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps are still unknown because of the limitations of standards here influent and effluent samples from 148 municipal wwtps in china were collected ion mobility spectrometry was introduced into high resolution mass spectrometry based suspect screening methods to identify the target and suspect pfas isomers a total of 38 branched isomers of 14 typical pfass were identified in wastewater samples linear pfass had higher detection rates 22 3 100 than branched isomers 2 0 98 compared to the influents proportions of branched isomers of most pfass except for perfluoropentanoic acid and perfluorohexanoic acid increased in the effluents the conventional biological treatment processes such as anaerobic anoxic aerobic and oxidation ditch treatments had poor removal efficiency for linear pfass 21 4 and branched isomers 13 4 no difference on removal efficiency among treatment processes was found furthermore isomer composition in the wwtps showed obvious differences between east china region and other regions and the usage of short chain pfass perfluorobutanesulfonic acid and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid may be a key factor for driving this difference this study sheds lights on the identification and characterization of pfas isomers in wwtps which would be useful for development of monitoring and control strategies of pfass graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords per and polyfluoroalkyl substances isomer wastewater treatment plant removal efficiency ion mobility spectrometry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are a range of synthetic organic compounds which are extensively applied in various consumer and industrial applications gluege et al 2020 because of their persistence bioaccumulation toxicity and long distance migration properties pfass are attracting attentions chohan et al 2021 ma et al 2022 typically pfass are produced primarily through two processes telomerisation and electrochemical fluorination ecf the telomerisation process yields relatively pure linear or isopropyl branched isomers while the ecf products contain approximately 70 80 linear structure and 20 30 branched isomers buck et al 2011 although telomerisation is becoming the main process for the production of perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas the large scale productions of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos and related chemicals are mainly produced by ecf process in china jiang et al 2015 which might result in residual branched pfass in the products accompanying emissions from production and usage pfass and their isomers have been detected in variety of environmental matrix and biological samples schulz et al 2020 because of their different physical and chemical properties the diverse isomers are found to have different environment behaviors and biological effects such as distribution bioaccumulation factors and elimination difference for example linear pfass are preferentially adsorbed by soil or sediment while branched isomers tend to exist in aqueous phase chen et al 2015 the different behavior of branched isomers might be related to their smaller octanol water partitioning coefficient and organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient than linear isomers londhe et al 2022 animal studies have shown preferential accumulation of the linear pfos and pfoa but the toxicity of pfass were isomer specific de silva et al 2009 greaves and letcher 2013 o brien et al 2011 found that a mixture of linear and branched isomers of pfos caused a greater transcriptional response than pure linear pfos in cultured chick embryo hepatocytes in particular the total branched isomer crosses the placenta more efficiently than the linear structure in humans beesoon et al 2011 gützkow et al 2012 thus it is essential to pay attention to isomers during measurement and assessment of pfass although both linear and branched isomers of pfass are simultaneously present in the environment most studies on pfas analysis were performed by eluting and integrating all isomers as a single peak for analysis or only focusing on linear structures cai et al 2022 wang et al 2021 besides because branched isomer standards of pfass are difficult to obtain only few studies on pfas isomers have been performed with

gonzalez de vega et al 2021 the potential branched isomers were determined according to the criteria 1 exact mass error 10 ppm 2 isotope matching error 30 3 product spectra interpretation error 5mda 4 rtlinear rtbranched 2 min and ccslinear ccsbranch ccslinear 20 the identified branched isomers may not assign their structures so they were labeled as bx in increasing order of retention time x 1 2 3 etc 2 5 quality assurance and quality control before mass spectrometry measurement calibration of the mass axis and drift cell was conducted using the major mix solution major mix ims tof calibration kit waters leucine enkephalin m z 554 2621 in negative ionization mode was injected every two minutes for mass correction linear standards of pfass were used to characterize the quality assurance and quality control process matrix spiked recovery of wastewater samples were carried to assess the sample treatment process and demonstrated a high level of accuracy mean recovery 78 102 the relative standard deviation rsd of inter day and intra day repeated injection of linear standard response was used to evaluate the stability of the instrument the inter day and intra day rsd values were all less than 15 detailed information on recovery and rsd are given in table s3 response value of peaks in the samples were calibrated by the corresponding linear internal standards procedure blanks were injected to examine the background values from different batch process and measurement before data analysis the blank responses were subtracted from signals in the samples 2 6 statistical analysis the removal efficiency of pfas isomers between influent and effluent were calculated based on the response of peaks with the internal standard calibration principal component analysis pca was conducted using factominer package to clarify the geographical distribution characteristics of isomer compositions the r software was employed for the all diagramming and statistical analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of pfas isomers analysis method for pfas isomers was established using uplc ims qtof first the commercial standards of t pfos and t pfhxs were employed to optimize operation parameters and their 14 isomers were identified table s4 the observed chromatography traces of t pfos and t pfhxs fig s2 and s3 were similar to previous reports which characterized branched isomers of pfos and pfhxs from multicomponent mixture standards jiang et al 2015 ma et al 2018 the scatter plot constructed by the mobility and chromatographic behavior of pfhxs and pfos isomers in fig 1 showed that the synergistic use of chromatography and mobility can improve the resolution of isomer separation for example the 1m pfos had a similar retention time to l pfos but they can be easily resolved by the ccs values conversely the 1m pfos and 3 5m pfos had very similar ccs values but the retention time of 3 5m pfos was smaller than 1m pfos moreover compared with branched isomers linear structures had longer retention times and greater ccs values which may be related to the stronger hydrophobicity and more stretched molecular structures of linear structures based on above results combination of retention time ccs value accurate mass and feature fragment information acquired by uplc ims qtof could ensure the identification accuracy and improve the separation resolution of pfas isomers besides the isomers in t pfos and t pfhxs this study also found 26 branched isomers of the other 12 pfass in the 296 wastewater samples by suspect screening method fig s4 s5 and table s5 usually the pfass with more than six carbons are called long chain pfass and those with less or equal to six carbons are called short chain pfass on the whole the number of isomer peaks of long chain pfass was generally more than that of short chain substances and the number of branched isomer peaks of perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas was more than that of perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas under the same carbon chain length for pfsas pfos had the highest number 7 of branched isomers followed by perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid pfhps 6 branched isomers and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid pfhxs 5 branched isomers perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs and perfluoropentanesulfonic acid pfpes had 2 branched isomer peaks it should be noted that this was the first time that the branched isomers of pfpes and pfhps were reported for pfcas pfoa had the highest number 4 of branched isomers for perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa and perfluorononanoic acid pfna two branched isomers were observed one branched isomer was observed for perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea while no isomer was observed for perfluorodecanoic acid pfda further no branched isomer peak was found for 6 2 fts and 6 2 cl pfesa which might be related to the production of the two substances by telomerisation process charbonnet et al 2021 additionally no branched isomer of pfas with less than six carbons has been reported in environmental samples benskin et al 2012 vyas et al 2007 while 5 branched isomers of short chain pfass pfpea pfbs and pfpes were observed in this study the occurrence of the branched isomers of short chain pfass might be due to their increasing usage as main substitutes of typical pfoa and pfos additionally the production processes for these new pfass are not yet transparent and novel sources of branched isomers have been identified beyond the known ecf source schulz et al 2020 some unknown production processes may lead to the generation of short chain pfas isomers the above results show the diversity and universal presence of branched isomers of pfass in wastewater emphasizing the importance of pfas isomers analyses 3 2 isomer profiles of pfass in wwtps isomer profiles of pfass in wwtp influents and effluents were determined table s6 among 11 pfass with detectable branched isomers detection rates of linear pfass in wwtps ranged from 22 3 to 100 the detection rates of branched pfass were lower than linear structures which were in the range of 2 0 to 98 detection rates of linear and branched isomers of pfoa and pfos were higher than other pfass for example the l pfoa was observed in 95 9 of influents and 100 of effluents and the branched pfoa isomers were observed in 74 3 of influents and 90 5 of effluents the almost ubiquitous linear and branched isomers of pfoa and pfos indicate that they are dominant pfass in the wastewater as for the main short chain surrogates for typical pfass l pfbs and l pfhxs had obviously higher detection rates 90 wwtps than their branched isomers 28 4 41 2 wwtps the pfpea had the lowest detection rates for both linear and branched isomers relative composition of pfas isomers in wastewater were further explored fig 2 in the influents branched isomers of pfhxa had the highest proportion 41 9 followed by pfos pfpea and pfoa high proportion of branched isomers of short chain pfcas pfpea and pfhxa might be related to their low response and decarboxylation in the analysis instrument ahmed et al 2019 gonzalez de vega et al 2021 for most pfsas except pfos their proportions of branched isomers were less than 6 furthermore proportions of branched isomers of long chain pfsas were higher than those of short chain pfsas which may be related to the high number of branched isomer of long chain substances additionally it has been reported that the ecf productive process could yield 20 30 branched pfos 15 20 branched pfoa and approximately 5 branched pfhxs schulz et al 2020 this study found that the proportions of branched pfos pfoa and pfhxs in the influents were 21 3 20 5 and 3 6 respectively which were basically consistent with the composition proportions in the products compared to the influents the proportions of branched isomers of most pfass except pfpea and pfhxa increased in the effluents due to the high break energy of c f bond up to 130 kcal mol it is difficult for organisms to utilize and destroy pfass and their isomers pan et al 2016 zhang et al 2022b thus adsorption in sludge is the primary mechanism for removal of pfass in wwtps kibambe et al 2020 generally a linear structure has stronger hydrophobicity and weaker polarity than its corresponding branched isomers londhe et al 2022 which has been verified by the fact that linear structure elutes at the latest on the chromatography column in this study as a result the linear pfass may be more easily adsorbed into the sludge phase than its branched isomers during wastewater treatment moreover the decreased proportion of branched isomers of pfpea and pfhxa in the effluents may be related to the increase of l pfpea and l pfhxa after treatment previous reports have shown that l pfpea and l pfhxa were the most dominant degradation products of telomerisation products such as 6 2 fts under microbial effect in wwtps thereby increasing the levels of l pfpea and l pfhxa in the effluents helmer et al 2022 houtz et al 2016 furthermore it should be noted that branched isomers with high detection rate in effluents also have high response proportion thus more attentions should be paid to them especially the branched isomers of typical pfos and pfoa further we attempted to explore the potential sources of pfas in the influents from different regions using cluster analysis fig s6 three main clusters were observed cluster 1 included hd and hz regions with the highest percentage 20 of branched isomers cluster 2 included hb xn and db regions with the percentage of branched isomers ranging from 18 to 20 and cluster 3 consisted of xb and hn regions with the percentage of branched isomers of 15 3 and 13 3 respectively the differences on the percentage of branched isomers among different regions were very small which indicate that there was no significant point source contributing branched or linear pfas in chinese municipal wastewater 3 3 removal efficiency of pfas isomers in wwtps removal efficiency of pfas isomers was low in wwtps fig 3 for linear pfass the removal efficiency ranged from 20 3 to 52 1 among them l pfda had the highest removal rate median 52 1 while l pfhps had the lowest removal rate median 20 3 as for the branched pfass their removal efficiency was in the range of 156 to 24 8 except br pfpes the high removal rate of br pfpes median 81 0 might be related to its low detection rate one detection in influent by comparing the removal efficiency of different pfass it can be found that the general removal efficiency of carboxylic acids was higher than that of sulfonic acids for both the linear and branched isomers additionally as the carbon chain grows the removal efficiency of linear isomers increased whereas that of branched isomers didn t vary regularly with the change of carbon chain length for example the removal efficiency of linear carboxylic acids showed a clear increasing trend with the increase of carbon chain length while that of branched carboxylic acids were basically the same fig 3a some of the possible reasons for the poor removal of pfas have been well known due to their low biodegradability pan et al 2016 zhang et al 2022b besides xiao et al 2012 reported that the degradation and transformation of precursors could lead to the secondary generation of pfass which might also contribute to the poor removal of pfass in this study it has been reported that fluorotelomer alcohols fluorotelomer sulfonates and polyfluoroalkyl phosphates can be degraded to pfcas when undergoing aerobic biological treatment houtz et al 2016 lewis et al 2016 perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides are the direct precursors of many pfsas peng et al 2014 in this study it was found that the remove efficiencies of potential precursor substances such as pfosa median 46 8 6 2 cl pfesa median 39 7 and 6 2 fts median 22 were higher than other linear and branched pfass while the median removal efficiencies of some pfcas and pfsas were even negative in addition the preferential transformation of br pfas precursors over l pfas precursors might also lead to the worse removal of branched isomers than linear pfass liu et al 2019 the removal efficiencies of different treatment processes in wwtps were further compared the removal efficiencies of linear and branched pfass in different treatment systems are displayed in fig s7 for linear isomers the following trend was found in terms of the median removal efficiencies ao 21 4 a2o 15 7 sbr 15 3 od 5 3 others 3 3 for branched isomers the removal efficiency varied widely and the trend of median removal efficiencies was ao 13 4 od 7 2 a2o 1 9 sbr 0 8 others 55 0 however there was no significant difference p 0 05 in each of different treatment process between linear and branched pfass expect a2o fig 3b prior to the aerobic treatment a2o process has more anaerobic anoxic treatment processes than other processes ebrahim et al 2021 found that the adsorption capacity of anaerobic biosolids to pfas was greater than that of aerobic biosolids the anaerobic anoxic pretreatment of a2o might increase the removal of linear structures and enlarge the removal difference between linear and branched isomer of pfass the above results show that the traditional biological treatment processes are inadequate to remove linear and branched isomers of pfass and even less effective in removing branched isomers 3 4 region distribution of pfas isomers the pca was performed to clarify the geographical distribution characteristics of isomer composition in the influents and effluents from different wwtps the results show that distribution patterns of pfas isomers in the influents and effluents were very similar fig s8 verifying that the wastewater treatment process had little effect on the isomer composition a positive correlation was observed between the linear pfass and their corresponding branched isomers fig 4 however contribution of branched isomers to the geographical distribution was smaller than that of linear isomers which may be related to the small proportion of branched isomers and also implied that the branched isomers might exist primarily as impurities of related linear products rather than specific products for usage it should be noticed that the contribution of branched isomers increased in the effluents compared to the influents thus attentions should be paid to branched isomer of pfass especially in assessing the pfass ecological risk of effluents among the branched isomers br pfos offered the greatest contribution to geographical differences followed by br pfhxs and br pfoa small contributions from br pfbs and other branched substances were identified the pca analysis also found that the isomer profiles in chinese wwtps were mainly divided into two clusters the hd region and other regions fig 4 linear and branched isomers of short chain pfass pfbs and pfhxs made an important contribution to the cluster of hd region while linear and branched isomers of long chain pfass pfoa and pfos had higher influence on the cluster of other regions fig 4 with the restrictions on the production and usage of pfoa and pfos in china short chain pfass are becoming the major substitutes for pfoa and pfos lu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022a however this process can be lengthy and not synchronized among regions short chain pfass in wastewater of hd region usually took up a larger proportion of total pfass than that in other regions which was also found in other water environment of this region an et al 2021 chen et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 this contribution feature in this study also reflected the trend of using short chain pfass to replace long chain pfass in the production and usage in hd region 4 conclusions this study identified 38 branched isomers of typical pfass in 148 wwtps by uplc ims qtof based suspect screening method linear pfass had higher detection rates than branched isomers however compared with the influents the proportions of branched isomers of most pfass except pfpea and pfhxa increased in the effluents further conventional biological treatment processes have poor removal efficiency for pfas isomers and removal efficiency of branched isomers was usually lower than that of linear isomers no difference on removal efficiency among treatment processes was found as for spatial variations on pfass isomers in wwtps isomer composition showed obvious difference between hd region and other regions and the usage of short chain alternatives may be a key factor for driving the difference this study sheds lights on the identification and characterization of pfas isomers in wwtps which would be of great significance for pfass supervision declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

15177,we developed and studied one of the first high flow uv led water disinfection reactors applicable to point of entry poe water disinfection a multiphysics computational model was created to predict the performance of uv reactor design concepts by modeling the synergic effect of radiation hydrodynamics and the inactivation kinetics of microorganisms the geometrical optics that describe light propagation in terms of rays were employed to model the radiation profile of multiple uv leds with optical components in complex reactor geometries the first account of such an approach the computational solution of the mass momentum and species equations was applied to model the hydrodynamics and kinetics we designed a reactor through a detailed computational study of the optical and hydrodynamic performance of various design strategies highly efficient uv fluence distribution in the reactor was achieved by creating nearly collimated uv radiation beams across the reactor and managing the hydrodynamics using a flow distributor we fabricated a prototype of the optimized reactor design for experimental studies biodosimetry tests were conducted for various flow rates and uv transmittances uvts and the experimental results were compared with the model predictions the design which employed 14 uv leds assembled over custom made optical modules resulted in a reduction equivalent dose red of 65 mj cm2 at a flow rate of 20 liters per minute lpm while consuming about 50 w energy this reactor design required only 0 05 w radiant power per lpm flow rate to achieve an nsf class a uv dose equivalent of 40 mj cm2 the findings of this study provide insights into uv led reactor development strategies as well as the creation and application of reactor virtual prototyping tools for designing and optimizing highly efficient uv led reactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv water disinfection point of entry biodosimetry uv leds virtual prototyping computational fluid dynamics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction uv led is an emerging technology that is replacing conventional mercury lamps in many applications due to its numerous advantages such as low voltage operation wavelength diversity and instant on off ability among others for water disinfection applications uv led can be a favorable option as it is mercury free has a small footprint and offers efficient back plate heat dissipation that reduces the formation of fouling over the protective windows chen et al 2017 uv led technology is also a more sustainable option as it facilitates the development of low voltage energy efficient water disinfection systems that can be powered using small batteries and renewable energy sources e g solar wind and unlike mercury lamps can be frequently turned on and off based on the flow the main challenge in adopting uv led technology in water disinfection applications is the limitations of conventional reactor designs to harness the full capabilities of uv leds therefore specific reactor designs must be developed which can effectively employ the radiant power of uv led by utilizing radiation and hydrodynamic management techniques to improve the performance of these reactors the radiation profile of uv led can be easily adjusted using reflectors and lenses this radiation profile must be aligned with the flow pattern of the reactor to ensure the satisfactory performance of these systems keshavarzfathy et al 2020 over the past few years several research groups have worked on small scale point of use pou uv led water disinfection reactors and the disinfection ability of these novel uv sources has been demonstrated on a benchtop scale keshavarzfathy and taghipour 2019 jenny et al 2015 oguma et al 2013 uv leds have the potential to be implemented in larger scale applications and they can be beneficial for households and small remote communities although the design of pou systems was previously investigated changes in the flow regime and the radiant power requirements in larger reactors operating with multiple leds and higher flow rates would create the need for new reactor designs to achieve optimum performance the development of large scale point of entry poe uv led systems may extend uv water disinfection technology to a greater number of communities however to the best of our knowledge no prior study has addressed the development of poe water disinfection reactors to address this gap we designed a poe uv led water disinfection system using virtual prototyping and computational modeling investigation of the synergic effect of radiation and flow profiles on the inactivation of microorganisms in this article general design considerations for poe uv led water disinfection reactors are discussed considering these factors and utilizing a comprehensive computational model an optimized design was created and its physical prototype was built and studied detailed information on the design and characterization of radiation and hydrodynamic management strategies for poe uv led reactors is presented elsewhere mohaghegh montazeri and taghipour 2023 mohaghegh montazeri and taghipour 2022 mohaghegh montazeri 2022 the reactor included multi parabolic reflectors for radiation management and a multi opening flow distributor for hydrodynamic management the physical prototype was characterized using the biodosimetry technique and the effects of flow rate and uv transmittance uvt on the performance of the reactor were investigated experimentally and compared with the simulation results the results and discussion presented here provide insights into effective strategies for designing high performance uv led water disinfection reactors this research provides information applicable to the design and optimization of larger scale industrial and municipal drinking water and wastewater uv led disinfection reactors 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the reactor fig 1 had a tubular stainless steel body with stainless steel flow distributors installed on both ends of the reactor where the inlet and outlet were located the flow distributors were designed to promote a relatively uniform flow profile and mitigate dead zones and flow bypass both distributors had an internal diameter id equal to the reactor s id to minimize the shadowing effect on the radiation profile during the operation of the reactor at the inlet the water first entered a small gap and then passed through a custom made cylindrical shaped baffle with four circular and four semicircular openings after passing through the main reactor void volume the water was guided through another baffle with a truncated cylinder shape and an 8 cut angle to help the visualization of the flow throughout the reactor the velocity profiles near the distributors are shown in figure s1 the void volume of the reactor excluding the distributor gaps had an id of 10 cm and was 35 cm long the logic of this design is discussed elsewhere mohaghegh montazeri 2022 two optical modules one on each end were installed on both ends of the reactor each optical module had seven parabolic reflectors machined from aluminum 6061 with one led assembled over each reflector total of 14 the parabolic reflectors covered a circular area with a 10 cm reflector set diameter while the diameter of the aluminum part was 14 cm the skirt area around the reflectors was left for mechanical sealing of the reactor mohaghegh montazeri and taghipour 2022 the images of the optical module and the radiation pattern are shown in figure s2 epdm rubber o rings dash number 048 were used to seal both ends of the reactor the uv leds employed in this study were smd 6060 leds from bolb inc livermore ca usa the leds spectral distribution was measured using a usb2000 spectrometer ocean insight orlando fl usa equipped with an ilx511b ccd detector sony tokyo japan which had a resolution of 0 38 nm from 200 nm to 800 nm the spectrometer also included a 25 cm qp600 025 xsr fiber optics cable ocean insight orlando fl usa equipped with a cosine corrector diffuser a cary 100 uv visible spectrophotometer agilent technologies santa clara ca usa was used to measure the uv vis transmittance of water and the quartz fused silica protective windows an experimental setup as shown in fig 2 was developed to perform a biodosimetry characterization of the reactor in this setup the reactor was connected to the feed and product tanks equipped with a mixer and the flow was pressurized using a centrifugal pump a digital turbine flow meter and a manual flow adjustment valve were installed over the outlet of the reactor to control and monitor the flow rate two pressure gauges model 1287n1 mcmaster carr chicago il usa were installed over the inlet and outlet to read the pressure drop across the reactor other components used in the setup included 1 in id polyurethane rubber tubing and pvc fittings a 3 way valve was used to switch the flow between the purge and product tank 2 2 biodosimetry test bacteriophage ms2 was used for the biodosimetry where the water was filtered by passing it through two fxwtc filters general electric usa placed in series and then collected in the feed tank the filtered water was passed through the reactor to fill it before starting the biodosimetry test by adding a highly concentrated ms2 solution to the collected filtered water an ms2 concentration of 107 plaque forming units pfu ml 1 was achieved inside the tank and was mixed for about five minutes at this point one initial sample was taken from the feed tank next the uv leds were turned on before starting the flow after turning on the centrifuge pump and correcting the flow rate using the flow adjustment valve to ensure a steady state condition in the system the first sample was taken from the outlet of the reactor after at least t 15 τ where τ is the nominal average residence time during each test at least three samples were taken in δt 15 τ time intervals to investigate the consistency of the results finally while the water was still flowing the uv leds were turned off and after δt 15 τ one final sample was taken from the reactor outlet the consistency between the initial sample from the feed tank and the final sample when the uv was inactivated was used to ensure that uv radiation was the only phenomenon causing the inactivation of ms2 the enumeration of ms2 from biodosimetry samples was done using the single layer plating method according to the us epa method 1602 and standard methods 9224e american public health association 2017 environmental protection agency 2001 to adjust the uvt of the mixture vanillin cas 121 33 5 sigma aldrich was used as it has a high solubility in the water while effectively reducing the uvt vanillin is recommended by the nsf 55 microbial performance testing protocol as the uv absorbent to be used for the characterization of uv disinfection reactors nsf international standard 2021 vanillin was found to have a relatively consistent uvt in the vicinity of the 275 nm wavelength especially at higher uvts where the reactor is more sensitive to fluctuations figure s3a the correlation between the vanillin concentration in deionized di water and the uvt of the solution followed a linear trend figure s3b and the fitted function was used to create various uvt solutions for this study 2 3 numerical modeling a comprehensive 3d multiphysics model was developed using comsol multiphysics version 6 0 0 354 the model included governing equations of radiation hydrodynamics mass transfer and kinetics which were solved to predict the behavior of the uv led water disinfection system under a variety of conditions the reactor geometry i e computational domain was divided into a number of smaller sub domains mesh for linear approximation of the governing differential equations the details of radiation and hydrodynamic models and their evaluation are discussed elsewhere mohaghegh montazeri and taghipour 2022 mohaghegh montazeri 2022 in summary the geometrical optics turbulent flow and transport of diluted species representing microorganisms modules of comsol multiphysics were employed the uv leds were defined as 14 radiation source points and the radiation profile was defined as provided by the manufacturer the radiation modeling of this optical module was evaluated experimentally with close agreement between the modeling and experimental results the details of the model development and its experimental validation are provided elsewhere mohaghegh montazeri and taghipour 2022 in summary a total of 8000 rays were generated per uv led and traveled across the reactor for 4 ns or until stopped by reaching the boundaries of the virtual model the duration of 4 ns was chosen as a reasonable stop time as the rays generated from uv leds could travel about 120 cm during this time limit which was more than three times the length of the reactor longer stop time values would add unnecessary computational intensity to the simulation without changing the results in a notable way the deposited ray power sub node was used to collect information about the amount of energy passed through each mesh inside the reactor volume for calculating the fluence rate the turbulence model used in this study was the reynolds averaged navier stokes wilcox k ω for the boundary conditions the inlet was defined as a fully developed flow and the outlet was defined as having an average pressure of 5 psi the boundary condition of the reactor walls were defined as no slip and standard wall functions were employed the transport of diluted species model included diffusion and convection mass transport phenomena and the velocity profile from the turbulent flow module was used as the input of this module to predict the concentration of microorganisms across the reactor this module also calculated the inactivation of microorganisms in each mesh using the residence time from the velocity profile and the fluence rate from the hydrodynamic and radiation modules respectively therefore the transport of diluted species was always the last step to be performed for the boundary conditions of the transport of diluted species model the reactor walls were selected as the no flux condition the inlet was defined as an arbitrary constant inflow concentration e g 5000 mol m3 and the reactor outlet was set as outflow allowing the convection of species via the flow through the boundary the most challenging part of the simulation was ensuring the convergence of the hydrodynamic model the criteria for convergence were errors of scaled residuals below 10 6 for two successive iterations the simulation was found to be highly sensitive to the mesh profile of the reactor due to the complex 3d geometry of the flow distributors to improve the convergence of the simulation each part of the reactor was meshed based on the governing phenomena and expected behavior of the reactor therefore the sections of the reactor that were in contact with the flow had a more refined mesh especially near the walls the flow distributors had the most refined mesh sizes as they had a small and more detailed design compared with the rest of the system overall the reactor geometry was divided into 1469 084 elements mesh with an average volume of 2 6 mm3 a visualization of the mesh profile in the reactor is shown in fig 3 2 4 optical hydrodynamic and total efficiency to compare different reactor designs we needed to define parameters which represented the performance of the system the main indicator for reactor performance was the reduction equivalent dose red which could be calculated by implementing experimental or simulation results into the chick watson microbial inactivation model 1 log c o u t c i n k r e d where cin and cout are the concentration of the microorganism at the inlet and outlet of the reactor and k is the inactivation rate constant hijnen et al 2006 the red could then be used directly to compare the performance of various reactor designs another effective method is calculating reactors optical hydrodynamic and total efficiencies using parameters such as delivered dose flow rate and radiant power in this method an ultimate design was defined based on a plug flow reactor pfr with uniform velocity and radiation profiles the total dose uv fluence delivered in such an ideal reactor ft j m2 can be expressed as 2 f t p q 1 10 α l ln 10 α where p w is uv led s germicidal output power l m is the length of the reactor q m3 s is the flow rate and α is the uv absorption of water keshavarzfathy and taghipour 2019 the hydrodynamic efficiency ηh optical efficiency ηr and total efficiency or mixing efficiency factor ηt can be defined as the red divided by the ideal hydrodynamic dose fh ideal radiation dose fr and the ideal reactor dose ft respectively 3 η x r e d f x x h r t fh the theoretical maximum delivered dose assuming the ideal hydrodynamics but actual radiation profile can be calculated using the volume averaged fluence rate ē 0 measured experimentally or using simulation and the nominal average residence time τ according to the following equation keshavarzfathy and taghipour 2019 4 f h e 0 τ which means that the hydrodynamics are perfectly aligned with the actual radiation profile and where the fluence rate is higher the velocity is higher lower residence time and vice versa the volume averaged fluence rate ē 0 employed for this study was calculated using a numerical model that was developed and evaluated by experimental studies details of the numerical model design and the corresponding experiments are provided elsewhere mohaghegh montazeri and taghipour 2022 similar to the fh the fr indicates a situation in which radiation is perfectly aligned with the actual flow profile the optical efficiency ηr can be rewritten as the volume averaged fluence rate ē 0 divided by the theoretical average fluence rate which would ultimately lead to 5 η r e 0 f t τ 2 5 combined variable model approach another approach to predict the performance of an already built reactor in various operating conditions is to employ the combined variable approach which can provide a quick overall view of the reactor performance in various operating conditions further discussed in the results section beck et al 2021 wright et al 2020 this model can be expressed as 6 r e d o r log n n 0 10 a u v a b s s 0 q c d u v a e u v a 2 where uva is the uv absorbance at 275 nm for this study and the q is the flow rate e g l min the s s 0 would account for changes in the radiant power of the uv source and is the current radiant power or irradiance s over the initial condition of radiant power or irradiance s 0 the s s 0 was equal to one for this study as new uv leds were used also a b c d and e are the coefficients which can be obtained by fitting the equation to the experimental results using regression analysis the equation was fitted to the experimental data using the matlab curve fitting toolbox and the nonlinear least squares method 3 results and discussion the reactor design including a few considerations related to the manufacturing of the reactor and the synergic effect of various phenomena on the performance of the system are presented here the main focus of this section however is the reactor characterization in various flow rates and uvt conditions and the reactor performance model evaluation by comparing the experiment results and simulation data 3 1 reactor design uv led water disinfection reactors can be designed in numerous ways but to reduce the number of variables and simplify geometrical optimization we chose a specific design strategy the overall design idea was based as much as possible on collimating the uv rays using focused uv radiation has shown promising results and in some cases has achieved significant improvement in uv led reactor disinfection performance keshavarzfathy et al 2020 taghipour 2018 autin and bolton 2019 optically focused rays unlike uv led regular rays can maintain relatively constant irradiance over a long distance assuming a non uv absorbing medium the general reactor design had a tubular body with two optical modules assembled over both ends of the reactor and flow distributors placed over the inlet and outlet in this design the collimated fully or partially beams and fluid flow would ideally have an aligned radiation and velocity profile 3 1 1 radiation management based on this general design strategy several collimating optical module designs were numerically studied collimation in general can be better achieved by optical lensing compared with reflectors which cannot collimate the uv rays emitted from the central areas of uv led however we chose the parabolic reflectors over the lenses as we believed they were a more economically feasible option that would deliver comparable performance for our reactor concept the design of the parabolic reflectors was optimized by altering parameters such as the number of reflectors their arrangement and their geometry mohaghegh montazeri and taghipour 2022 the final optimum design had seven parabolic reflectors placed uniformly inside the circular cross section area of the reactor one uv led was assembled over each parabolic reflector and a total of 14 uv leds were used in the final prototype 3 1 2 hydrodynamic management with regard to hydrodynamics the flow bypass and stagnant regions can significantly reduce the performance of the reactor especially near the inlet and outlet to mitigate these flow distributors were placed over the inlet and outlet of the reactor which significantly increased the hydrodynamic efficiency of the system the final flow distributors were designed by considering the pressure profile near the inlet and outlet of the reactor therefore they had smaller openings where the pressure was higher and vice versa mohaghegh montazeri 2022 we found that the use of such flow distributors was not a concern with regard to the pressure difference across the inlet and outlet as the reactor created a pressure drop of around 4 psi at 70 liters per minute lpm 3 1 3 dimensions to reduce design optimization complexity the diameter of the reactor was selected as 10 cm which is within the industry norm and results in a reactor cross section large enough to accommodate high flow rates at a reasonable length to specify the length of the reactor we analyzed both the hydrodynamic and radiation behavior of the system we found that at a constant uvt the red of the reactor increased in longer reactors due to a higher average residence time the larger volume and also higher ultimate optical efficiencies due to rays longer travel paths however a very long reactor is neither cost effective nor practical also in reactor designs based on collimated beams longer reactors are generally more sensitive to fluctuations in the uvt of water even though the collimated beam conserved the irradiance over a long distance at 100 uvt as shown in fig 4 a for example for the 50 uvt condition the collimated beam lost almost all its initial power at the first 10 cm length of the reactor however the influent of the uv water disinfection systems would be expected to be prefiltered and would have a relatively high uvt therefore we considered the 95 uvt as the common condition and specified the length of the reactor based on that in addition it would not have been reasonable to increase the size of the reactor beyond a point where the collimated beam lost the majority of its energy therefore we chose a 20 radiation cutoff point fig 4b as a reasonable design condition which was the distance in the reactor where the collimated beam lost 80 of its initial power and had only 20 left the reactor design with a 20 radiation cutoff point for the 95 uvt condition would have a 32 cm length therefore we chose a marginally higher value 35 cm as the length of the reactor 3 1 4 other design considerations cooling one important parameter that needs to be considered in the design of uv led water disinfection systems is to ensure that the uv leds operate below the temperature limit suggested by the manufacturer the uv leds employed in this study must operate under 38 c therefore the reactor was designed in a way that the continuous flow of water kept the leds below that temperature this strategy was found to be effective and during the benchtop study the uv led printed circuit board pcb was at a stable temperature of 29 2 c while the water was at 16 c protective windows the quartz windows are suitable for the uvc range as they have a high uvt in that region figure s4 it is worth mentioning that one of the concerns about using quartz windows is the high risk of fractures upon impact therefore the reactor must be designed with precautions to reduce stress over the protective windows in the final prototype epdm rubber o rings in addition to sealing were used as shock absorbers the reactor was tested at pressures of up to 17 psi and no sign of leakage or fracture was observed also the quartz windows assembled over the reactor were able to tolerate moderate impacts during shipping table 1 3 2 biodosimetry 3 2 1 red vs flow rate the biodosimetry test using bacteriophage ms2 was done for flow rates of 5 to 50 lpm as shown in figure 5the log reduction was adversely affected by the flow rate this was mainly due to the reduction in average residence time with the flow rate figure s5 the red fig 5 acquired from the biodosimetry results shows that the reactor met the class a and class b dose equivalents of the nsf 55 standard for uv water disinfection systems nsf international standard 2021 this reactor required 0 05 mw radiant power per ml min flow rate to achieve a dose of 40 mj cm2 to put this value in perspective it performed 26 times better than an earlier uv led flow through reactors presented in the literature several years ago chatterley and linden 2010 the ideal hydrodynamics fh with actual radiation and ideal dose ft ideal hydrodynamics and radiation are shown in fig 5 and the hydrodynamics ηh optical ηr and total ηt efficiencies are shown in figure s6 despite the reduction in red when the flow rate was increased the reactor efficiency seemed to increase as the gap between the experimental red and the ideal dose decreased which was likely due to the narrower uv dose distribution figure s7 and therefore closer to ideal dose at higher flow rates a total efficiency ηt of about 45 was estimated at the flow rate of 40 lpm which is significantly higher than other uv led systems reported in the literature as achieving 5 to 30 total efficiency ηt keshavarzfathy et al 2020 keshavarzfathy and taghipour 2019 decreasing the overall dose of a reactor either by reducing the uv source power or increasing the flow rate reduces the variance in the dose distribution and therefore necessarily increases the ratio of actual to ideal uv dose of the reactor the results can also be examined with respect to turbulence in the reactor the reynolds number estimation figure s8 shows that the reactor is mostly turbulent after 20 lpm and more turbulence enhances the mixing and can improve hydrodynamic efficiency as a result the disinfection performance of the system is increased the simulation was able to predict the general trend of the reactor performance with the change in the flow rate as well as the delivered uv dose at flow rates higher than 10 lpm however the simulation considerably overpredicted the red at a flow rate of 5 lpm the simulation followed the theoretical trend which we expected to be about two times higher red when the flow rate was halved from 10 to 5 lpm other than common sources of error in the experimental results ms2 biodosimetry has a limitation based mainly on the feed concentration the ms2 concentration in the feed was approximately 107 pfu ml and therefore the biodosimetry test done in this study was able to measure only around a maximum 7 log reduction the large deviation and also the higher experimental error ranges at 5 lpm were most likely the result of such limitations the slightly higher red predicted by the model compared with experiments at other flow rates could have been due to variations in the radiant power of the leds caused by operating conditions and aging to help visualize the behavior of the reactor at various flow rates the computer generated uv dose and velocity profiles are provided in fig 6 the uv dose profile shows the combined effect of radiation and velocity profiles regions with a low uv dose are the weak spots of the reactor in which microorganisms are allowed to pass through the system therefore an ideal reactor design would have a uniform uv dose profile delivered to the water at the reactor outlet in our reactor despite the identical radiation profiles uv dose was adversely affected by flow rate the uv dose was found to be more uniform in the middle of the reactor and the most non uniform region was near the inlet this shows the potential for improvement in the design of the flow distributor for the inlet the velocity profiles of the 40 and 20 lpm flow rates were visually alike however the reactor was estimated to be fully turbulent at 40 lpm the 5 lpm velocity profile was generally similar to the two other flow rates but it showed a more evident flow bypass near the reactor walls the concentration profile of the reactor is illustrated in figure s9 which indicates relatively uniform inactivation across the reactor but less inactivation near the reactor wall dark spots near the wall are likely the cause of lower inactivation in these regions in future designs this issue can be prevented by promoting mixing and turbulence near the reactor walls such that the water can be exposed to higher uv fluence rates 3 2 2 red vs uvt the increase in uvt resulted in a higher ms2 log reduction across the reactor fig 7 according to the red results the system was able to meet the nsf 55 class b dose equivalent at the uvt of 70 and more the red of this reactor design was highly sensitive to the reduction in the uvt at higher ranges as it relied on the collimated beams which traveled a relatively large distance across the reactor the main reduction in the performance of the reactor happened at higher uvts and no significant change was seen in the 70 85 uvt range the reactor behaved more similarly to an ideal reactor in lower uvts which can be seen as an indicator of a good alignment of radiation and flow profile near both ends of the reactor the simulation predicted a trend in the change in the performance of the reactor with uvt but showed deviations under lower uvt conditions the experimental results indicated a nearly ideal performance at 70 uvt which may be impossible to reach under actual operating conditions this ideal performance is likely the result of overlooked phenomena in the simulation or the ideal dose formulation inaccurate experimental results at lower uvt could also be the cause of this nearly ideal performance other than small variations between the simulation and experiment in terms of the geometry and the flow pattern the higher error at the lower uvt was suspected of being caused by the tyndall effect which meant that the vanillin solution despite being homogeneous had promoted scattering as opposed to absorption the scattering was previously reported as a significant factor affecting the transmittance of surface water samples belzile et al 2002 and was also found to be the reason behind unexpected uvt trends in other fields such as uv polymerization désilles et al 2005 assuming the same uvt a medium that scatters uv radiation would promote relatively higher fluence rate levels and a more uniform profile compared with an absorbing medium fig 8 in our reactor design scattering could result in a more uniform radiation profile near the optical modules therefore at higher concentrations of vanillin lower uvt the red of the reactor would be closer to the ideal dose it is expected that waters with the same uvt but less scattering will not show such an increase in the optical efficiency this shows the importance of considering both absorbance and scattering as opposed to solely relying on uvt measurements therefore further investigations of the definition of the ideal dose ft eq 2 may be required to cover a wide range of conditioned and a more comprehensive definition of ft may need to include the scattering characteristics of the media if the tyndall effect in the uv led reactor is proven to be a major contributor the estimation of the ideal dose ft eq 2 should be modified such that radiation scattering is accounted for which increases the ideal dose ft thus the ideal ft will deviate from the results shown in fig 7 and the actual reactor performance in lower uvts may not be as close to that of an ideal reactor to better visualize the system behavior in various uvt conditions the dose and fluence rate profiles of the reactor under three different uvt conditions are shown in fig 9 besides the significant reduction of dose and fluence rate with the uvt comparing the middle parts to the ends of the reactor the radiation distribution was less uniform under the lower uvt conditions therefore there were larger dark regions in the reactor which significantly reduced the performance of the system at an 80 uvt condition the fluence rate in the middle of the reactor was almost negligible and therefore a significant volume of the reactor made no considerable contribution to the inactivation of microorganisms therefore under low uvt conditions the reactor can be much shorter while delivering the same red the simulation did not show the effect of scattering caused by vanillin and it is expected that in low uvts for a scattering media there will be more uniform radiation and dose profiles at both ends of the reactor 3 3 combined variable model the biodosimetry data were fitted to the combined variable model and the coefficients are presented in table 2 the computer program was not able to calculate all the coefficients therefore to decrease the complexity of the problem the parameter e was manually selected using trial and error to achieve the highest r2 the model fits well with the experimental biodosimetry results and could be used to predict the performance of the reactor in various flowrates uvts and uv led radiant power conditions as shown in fig 10 the combined variable model predicted a considerable change in the reactor performance at high uvts and low flow rates this aligns with previous findings that a reactor s red is most sensitive in high uvt and low flow rate regions especially for reactors with a long radiation path making them relatively sensitive to a reduction in uvt despite their high efficiency at high uvts despite the great value of such a model for predicting the performance of the reactor in various operating conditions it cannot provide any information about the performance of conceptual reactor designs as the combined variable model does not exist without the experimental biodosimetry results of the physical reactor a detailed multiphysics model similar to the model developed in this study would be the best solution for research and development applications despite the higher complexity and computational intensity a potential application for the combined variable model could be the employment of the model as an auxiliary tool to the detailed multiphysics models to expand the range of their results the detailed model developed in this study would require several hours to generate every single data point and it would be time consuming to calculate thousands of data points for a wide range of operating conditions the combined variable approach can be fitted to a limited number of data points from the detailed computational model to instantly predict the performance of the conceptual reactor design in a variety of operating conditions which would save further time and resources in the research and development of uv led water disinfection reactors 4 conclusion in this study we developed and characterized one of the first poe uv led water disinfection reactors by including optimized optical and hydrodynamic management modules a total of 14 uv leds were assembled on multi parabolic reflectors which created collimated beams across the reactor flow distributors with multi openings were installed at the inlet and outlet which generated a relatively uniform flow distribution this reactor was able to meet the nsf 55 class a dose equivalent for flow rates of up to 50 lpm and required only 0 05 mw radiant power per ml min flow rate to achieve a dose of 40 mj cm2 at 99 uvt the performance was primarily only affected by the reduction of water uvt especially under higher uvt conditions it was also found that for uvts below 90 such collimated beam based reactors can be made much shorter while maintaining their red the results of this study showed the potential of an accurately developed computational model to predict the performance of uv led water disinfection reactors even with complex radiation and flow distribution the computational model that we developed successfully predicted the behavior of the reactor with changes in the large range of flow rates and uvt conditions for comparison the combined variable model approach was explored and found to be helpful in predicting the performance of already existing reactors under various operating conditions however it cannot be used as an alternative to detailed computational models to explore various design concepts and to design novel optimized reactors this study provided a modeling based approach for designing high flow uv led water disinfection reactors with engineered radiation and flow distribution that will result in high efficiency the overall approach demonstrated here can offer valuable information to researchers in the field to design and develop larger scale uv led water disinfection systems the multiphysics computational model presented in this study may be applied to virtual prototyping of unlimited reactor design possibilities and predict their performance in various operating conditions which would result in a significant reduction in cost and the time required in the research and development of these systems such models can generate immense amounts of detailed information about the critical parameters needed for design troubleshooting e g

15177,we developed and studied one of the first high flow uv led water disinfection reactors applicable to point of entry poe water disinfection a multiphysics computational model was created to predict the performance of uv reactor design concepts by modeling the synergic effect of radiation hydrodynamics and the inactivation kinetics of microorganisms the geometrical optics that describe light propagation in terms of rays were employed to model the radiation profile of multiple uv leds with optical components in complex reactor geometries the first account of such an approach the computational solution of the mass momentum and species equations was applied to model the hydrodynamics and kinetics we designed a reactor through a detailed computational study of the optical and hydrodynamic performance of various design strategies highly efficient uv fluence distribution in the reactor was achieved by creating nearly collimated uv radiation beams across the reactor and managing the hydrodynamics using a flow distributor we fabricated a prototype of the optimized reactor design for experimental studies biodosimetry tests were conducted for various flow rates and uv transmittances uvts and the experimental results were compared with the model predictions the design which employed 14 uv leds assembled over custom made optical modules resulted in a reduction equivalent dose red of 65 mj cm2 at a flow rate of 20 liters per minute lpm while consuming about 50 w energy this reactor design required only 0 05 w radiant power per lpm flow rate to achieve an nsf class a uv dose equivalent of 40 mj cm2 the findings of this study provide insights into uv led reactor development strategies as well as the creation and application of reactor virtual prototyping tools for designing and optimizing highly efficient uv led reactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv water disinfection point of entry biodosimetry uv leds virtual prototyping computational fluid dynamics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction uv led is an emerging technology that is replacing conventional mercury lamps in many applications due to its numerous advantages such as low voltage operation wavelength diversity and instant on off ability among others for water disinfection applications uv led can be a favorable option as it is mercury free has a small footprint and offers efficient back plate heat dissipation that reduces the formation of fouling over the protective windows chen et al 2017 uv led technology is also a more sustainable option as it facilitates the development of low voltage energy efficient water disinfection systems that can be powered using small batteries and renewable energy sources e g solar wind and unlike mercury lamps can be frequently turned on and off based on the flow the main challenge in adopting uv led technology in water disinfection applications is the limitations of conventional reactor designs to harness the full capabilities of uv leds therefore specific reactor designs must be developed which can effectively employ the radiant power of uv led by utilizing radiation and hydrodynamic management techniques to improve the performance of these reactors the radiation profile of uv led can be easily adjusted using reflectors and lenses this radiation profile must be aligned with the flow pattern of the reactor to ensure the satisfactory performance of these systems keshavarzfathy et al 2020 over the past few years several research groups have worked on small scale point of use pou uv led water disinfection reactors and the disinfection ability of these novel uv sources has been demonstrated on a benchtop scale keshavarzfathy and taghipour 2019 jenny et al 2015 oguma et al 2013 uv leds have the potential to be implemented in larger scale applications and they can be beneficial for households and small remote communities although the design of pou systems was previously investigated changes in the flow regime and the radiant power requirements in larger reactors operating with multiple leds and higher flow rates would create the need for new reactor designs to achieve optimum performance the development of large scale point of entry poe uv led systems may extend uv water disinfection technology to a greater number of communities however to the best of our knowledge no prior study has addressed the development of poe water disinfection reactors to address this gap we designed a poe uv led water disinfection system using virtual prototyping and computational modeling investigation of the synergic effect of radiation and flow profiles on the inactivation of microorganisms in this article general design considerations for poe uv led water disinfection reactors are discussed considering these factors and utilizing a comprehensive computational model an optimized design was created and its physical prototype was built and studied detailed information on the design and characterization of radiation and hydrodynamic management strategies for poe uv led reactors is presented elsewhere mohaghegh montazeri and taghipour 2023 mohaghegh montazeri and taghipour 2022 mohaghegh montazeri 2022 the reactor included multi parabolic reflectors for radiation management and a multi opening flow distributor for hydrodynamic management the physical prototype was characterized using the biodosimetry technique and the effects of flow rate and uv transmittance uvt on the performance of the reactor were investigated experimentally and compared with the simulation results the results and discussion presented here provide insights into effective strategies for designing high performance uv led water disinfection reactors this research provides information applicable to the design and optimization of larger scale industrial and municipal drinking water and wastewater uv led disinfection reactors 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the reactor fig 1 had a tubular stainless steel body with stainless steel flow distributors installed on both ends of the reactor where the inlet and outlet were located the flow distributors were designed to promote a relatively uniform flow profile and mitigate dead zones and flow bypass both distributors had an internal diameter id equal to the reactor s id to minimize the shadowing effect on the radiation profile during the operation of the reactor at the inlet the water first entered a small gap and then passed through a custom made cylindrical shaped baffle with four circular and four semicircular openings after passing through the main reactor void volume the water was guided through another baffle with a truncated cylinder shape and an 8 cut angle to help the visualization of the flow throughout the reactor the velocity profiles near the distributors are shown in figure s1 the void volume of the reactor excluding the distributor gaps had an id of 10 cm and was 35 cm long the logic of this design is discussed elsewhere mohaghegh montazeri 2022 two optical modules one on each end were installed on both ends of the reactor each optical module had seven parabolic reflectors machined from aluminum 6061 with one led assembled over each reflector total of 14 the parabolic reflectors covered a circular area with a 10 cm reflector set diameter while the diameter of the aluminum part was 14 cm the skirt area around the reflectors was left for mechanical sealing of the reactor mohaghegh montazeri and taghipour 2022 the images of the optical module and the radiation pattern are shown in figure s2 epdm rubber o rings dash number 048 were used to seal both ends of the reactor the uv leds employed in this study were smd 6060 leds from bolb inc livermore ca usa the leds spectral distribution was measured using a usb2000 spectrometer ocean insight orlando fl usa equipped with an ilx511b ccd detector sony tokyo japan which had a resolution of 0 38 nm from 200 nm to 800 nm the spectrometer also included a 25 cm qp600 025 xsr fiber optics cable ocean insight orlando fl usa equipped with a cosine corrector diffuser a cary 100 uv visible spectrophotometer agilent technologies santa clara ca usa was used to measure the uv vis transmittance of water and the quartz fused silica protective windows an experimental setup as shown in fig 2 was developed to perform a biodosimetry characterization of the reactor in this setup the reactor was connected to the feed and product tanks equipped with a mixer and the flow was pressurized using a centrifugal pump a digital turbine flow meter and a manual flow adjustment valve were installed over the outlet of the reactor to control and monitor the flow rate two pressure gauges model 1287n1 mcmaster carr chicago il usa were installed over the inlet and outlet to read the pressure drop across the reactor other components used in the setup included 1 in id polyurethane rubber tubing and pvc fittings a 3 way valve was used to switch the flow between the purge and product tank 2 2 biodosimetry test bacteriophage ms2 was used for the biodosimetry where the water was filtered by passing it through two fxwtc filters general electric usa placed in series and then collected in the feed tank the filtered water was passed through the reactor to fill it before starting the biodosimetry test by adding a highly concentrated ms2 solution to the collected filtered water an ms2 concentration of 107 plaque forming units pfu ml 1 was achieved inside the tank and was mixed for about five minutes at this point one initial sample was taken from the feed tank next the uv leds were turned on before starting the flow after turning on the centrifuge pump and correcting the flow rate using the flow adjustment valve to ensure a steady state condition in the system the first sample was taken from the outlet of the reactor after at least t 15 τ where τ is the nominal average residence time during each test at least three samples were taken in δt 15 τ time intervals to investigate the consistency of the results finally while the water was still flowing the uv leds were turned off and after δt 15 τ one final sample was taken from the reactor outlet the consistency between the initial sample from the feed tank and the final sample when the uv was inactivated was used to ensure that uv radiation was the only phenomenon causing the inactivation of ms2 the enumeration of ms2 from biodosimetry samples was done using the single layer plating method according to the us epa method 1602 and standard methods 9224e american public health association 2017 environmental protection agency 2001 to adjust the uvt of the mixture vanillin cas 121 33 5 sigma aldrich was used as it has a high solubility in the water while effectively reducing the uvt vanillin is recommended by the nsf 55 microbial performance testing protocol as the uv absorbent to be used for the characterization of uv disinfection reactors nsf international standard 2021 vanillin was found to have a relatively consistent uvt in the vicinity of the 275 nm wavelength especially at higher uvts where the reactor is more sensitive to fluctuations figure s3a the correlation between the vanillin concentration in deionized di water and the uvt of the solution followed a linear trend figure s3b and the fitted function was used to create various uvt solutions for this study 2 3 numerical modeling a comprehensive 3d multiphysics model was developed using comsol multiphysics version 6 0 0 354 the model included governing equations of radiation hydrodynamics mass transfer and kinetics which were solved to predict the behavior of the uv led water disinfection system under a variety of conditions the reactor geometry i e computational domain was divided into a number of smaller sub domains mesh for linear approximation of the governing differential equations the details of radiation and hydrodynamic models and their evaluation are discussed elsewhere mohaghegh montazeri and taghipour 2022 mohaghegh montazeri 2022 in summary the geometrical optics turbulent flow and transport of diluted species representing microorganisms modules of comsol multiphysics were employed the uv leds were defined as 14 radiation source points and the radiation profile was defined as provided by the manufacturer the radiation modeling of this optical module was evaluated experimentally with close agreement between the modeling and experimental results the details of the model development and its experimental validation are provided elsewhere mohaghegh montazeri and taghipour 2022 in summary a total of 8000 rays were generated per uv led and traveled across the reactor for 4 ns or until stopped by reaching the boundaries of the virtual model the duration of 4 ns was chosen as a reasonable stop time as the rays generated from uv leds could travel about 120 cm during this time limit which was more than three times the length of the reactor longer stop time values would add unnecessary computational intensity to the simulation without changing the results in a notable way the deposited ray power sub node was used to collect information about the amount of energy passed through each mesh inside the reactor volume for calculating the fluence rate the turbulence model used in this study was the reynolds averaged navier stokes wilcox k ω for the boundary conditions the inlet was defined as a fully developed flow and the outlet was defined as having an average pressure of 5 psi the boundary condition of the reactor walls were defined as no slip and standard wall functions were employed the transport of diluted species model included diffusion and convection mass transport phenomena and the velocity profile from the turbulent flow module was used as the input of this module to predict the concentration of microorganisms across the reactor this module also calculated the inactivation of microorganisms in each mesh using the residence time from the velocity profile and the fluence rate from the hydrodynamic and radiation modules respectively therefore the transport of diluted species was always the last step to be performed for the boundary conditions of the transport of diluted species model the reactor walls were selected as the no flux condition the inlet was defined as an arbitrary constant inflow concentration e g 5000 mol m3 and the reactor outlet was set as outflow allowing the convection of species via the flow through the boundary the most challenging part of the simulation was ensuring the convergence of the hydrodynamic model the criteria for convergence were errors of scaled residuals below 10 6 for two successive iterations the simulation was found to be highly sensitive to the mesh profile of the reactor due to the complex 3d geometry of the flow distributors to improve the convergence of the simulation each part of the reactor was meshed based on the governing phenomena and expected behavior of the reactor therefore the sections of the reactor that were in contact with the flow had a more refined mesh especially near the walls the flow distributors had the most refined mesh sizes as they had a small and more detailed design compared with the rest of the system overall the reactor geometry was divided into 1469 084 elements mesh with an average volume of 2 6 mm3 a visualization of the mesh profile in the reactor is shown in fig 3 2 4 optical hydrodynamic and total efficiency to compare different reactor designs we needed to define parameters which represented the performance of the system the main indicator for reactor performance was the reduction equivalent dose red which could be calculated by implementing experimental or simulation results into the chick watson microbial inactivation model 1 log c o u t c i n k r e d where cin and cout are the concentration of the microorganism at the inlet and outlet of the reactor and k is the inactivation rate constant hijnen et al 2006 the red could then be used directly to compare the performance of various reactor designs another effective method is calculating reactors optical hydrodynamic and total efficiencies using parameters such as delivered dose flow rate and radiant power in this method an ultimate design was defined based on a plug flow reactor pfr with uniform velocity and radiation profiles the total dose uv fluence delivered in such an ideal reactor ft j m2 can be expressed as 2 f t p q 1 10 α l ln 10 α where p w is uv led s germicidal output power l m is the length of the reactor q m3 s is the flow rate and α is the uv absorption of water keshavarzfathy and taghipour 2019 the hydrodynamic efficiency ηh optical efficiency ηr and total efficiency or mixing efficiency factor ηt can be defined as the red divided by the ideal hydrodynamic dose fh ideal radiation dose fr and the ideal reactor dose ft respectively 3 η x r e d f x x h r t fh the theoretical maximum delivered dose assuming the ideal hydrodynamics but actual radiation profile can be calculated using the volume averaged fluence rate ē 0 measured experimentally or using simulation and the nominal average residence time τ according to the following equation keshavarzfathy and taghipour 2019 4 f h e 0 τ which means that the hydrodynamics are perfectly aligned with the actual radiation profile and where the fluence rate is higher the velocity is higher lower residence time and vice versa the volume averaged fluence rate ē 0 employed for this study was calculated using a numerical model that was developed and evaluated by experimental studies details of the numerical model design and the corresponding experiments are provided elsewhere mohaghegh montazeri and taghipour 2022 similar to the fh the fr indicates a situation in which radiation is perfectly aligned with the actual flow profile the optical efficiency ηr can be rewritten as the volume averaged fluence rate ē 0 divided by the theoretical average fluence rate which would ultimately lead to 5 η r e 0 f t τ 2 5 combined variable model approach another approach to predict the performance of an already built reactor in various operating conditions is to employ the combined variable approach which can provide a quick overall view of the reactor performance in various operating conditions further discussed in the results section beck et al 2021 wright et al 2020 this model can be expressed as 6 r e d o r log n n 0 10 a u v a b s s 0 q c d u v a e u v a 2 where uva is the uv absorbance at 275 nm for this study and the q is the flow rate e g l min the s s 0 would account for changes in the radiant power of the uv source and is the current radiant power or irradiance s over the initial condition of radiant power or irradiance s 0 the s s 0 was equal to one for this study as new uv leds were used also a b c d and e are the coefficients which can be obtained by fitting the equation to the experimental results using regression analysis the equation was fitted to the experimental data using the matlab curve fitting toolbox and the nonlinear least squares method 3 results and discussion the reactor design including a few considerations related to the manufacturing of the reactor and the synergic effect of various phenomena on the performance of the system are presented here the main focus of this section however is the reactor characterization in various flow rates and uvt conditions and the reactor performance model evaluation by comparing the experiment results and simulation data 3 1 reactor design uv led water disinfection reactors can be designed in numerous ways but to reduce the number of variables and simplify geometrical optimization we chose a specific design strategy the overall design idea was based as much as possible on collimating the uv rays using focused uv radiation has shown promising results and in some cases has achieved significant improvement in uv led reactor disinfection performance keshavarzfathy et al 2020 taghipour 2018 autin and bolton 2019 optically focused rays unlike uv led regular rays can maintain relatively constant irradiance over a long distance assuming a non uv absorbing medium the general reactor design had a tubular body with two optical modules assembled over both ends of the reactor and flow distributors placed over the inlet and outlet in this design the collimated fully or partially beams and fluid flow would ideally have an aligned radiation and velocity profile 3 1 1 radiation management based on this general design strategy several collimating optical module designs were numerically studied collimation in general can be better achieved by optical lensing compared with reflectors which cannot collimate the uv rays emitted from the central areas of uv led however we chose the parabolic reflectors over the lenses as we believed they were a more economically feasible option that would deliver comparable performance for our reactor concept the design of the parabolic reflectors was optimized by altering parameters such as the number of reflectors their arrangement and their geometry mohaghegh montazeri and taghipour 2022 the final optimum design had seven parabolic reflectors placed uniformly inside the circular cross section area of the reactor one uv led was assembled over each parabolic reflector and a total of 14 uv leds were used in the final prototype 3 1 2 hydrodynamic management with regard to hydrodynamics the flow bypass and stagnant regions can significantly reduce the performance of the reactor especially near the inlet and outlet to mitigate these flow distributors were placed over the inlet and outlet of the reactor which significantly increased the hydrodynamic efficiency of the system the final flow distributors were designed by considering the pressure profile near the inlet and outlet of the reactor therefore they had smaller openings where the pressure was higher and vice versa mohaghegh montazeri 2022 we found that the use of such flow distributors was not a concern with regard to the pressure difference across the inlet and outlet as the reactor created a pressure drop of around 4 psi at 70 liters per minute lpm 3 1 3 dimensions to reduce design optimization complexity the diameter of the reactor was selected as 10 cm which is within the industry norm and results in a reactor cross section large enough to accommodate high flow rates at a reasonable length to specify the length of the reactor we analyzed both the hydrodynamic and radiation behavior of the system we found that at a constant uvt the red of the reactor increased in longer reactors due to a higher average residence time the larger volume and also higher ultimate optical efficiencies due to rays longer travel paths however a very long reactor is neither cost effective nor practical also in reactor designs based on collimated beams longer reactors are generally more sensitive to fluctuations in the uvt of water even though the collimated beam conserved the irradiance over a long distance at 100 uvt as shown in fig 4 a for example for the 50 uvt condition the collimated beam lost almost all its initial power at the first 10 cm length of the reactor however the influent of the uv water disinfection systems would be expected to be prefiltered and would have a relatively high uvt therefore we considered the 95 uvt as the common condition and specified the length of the reactor based on that in addition it would not have been reasonable to increase the size of the reactor beyond a point where the collimated beam lost the majority of its energy therefore we chose a 20 radiation cutoff point fig 4b as a reasonable design condition which was the distance in the reactor where the collimated beam lost 80 of its initial power and had only 20 left the reactor design with a 20 radiation cutoff point for the 95 uvt condition would have a 32 cm length therefore we chose a marginally higher value 35 cm as the length of the reactor 3 1 4 other design considerations cooling one important parameter that needs to be considered in the design of uv led water disinfection systems is to ensure that the uv leds operate below the temperature limit suggested by the manufacturer the uv leds employed in this study must operate under 38 c therefore the reactor was designed in a way that the continuous flow of water kept the leds below that temperature this strategy was found to be effective and during the benchtop study the uv led printed circuit board pcb was at a stable temperature of 29 2 c while the water was at 16 c protective windows the quartz windows are suitable for the uvc range as they have a high uvt in that region figure s4 it is worth mentioning that one of the concerns about using quartz windows is the high risk of fractures upon impact therefore the reactor must be designed with precautions to reduce stress over the protective windows in the final prototype epdm rubber o rings in addition to sealing were used as shock absorbers the reactor was tested at pressures of up to 17 psi and no sign of leakage or fracture was observed also the quartz windows assembled over the reactor were able to tolerate moderate impacts during shipping table 1 3 2 biodosimetry 3 2 1 red vs flow rate the biodosimetry test using bacteriophage ms2 was done for flow rates of 5 to 50 lpm as shown in figure 5the log reduction was adversely affected by the flow rate this was mainly due to the reduction in average residence time with the flow rate figure s5 the red fig 5 acquired from the biodosimetry results shows that the reactor met the class a and class b dose equivalents of the nsf 55 standard for uv water disinfection systems nsf international standard 2021 this reactor required 0 05 mw radiant power per ml min flow rate to achieve a dose of 40 mj cm2 to put this value in perspective it performed 26 times better than an earlier uv led flow through reactors presented in the literature several years ago chatterley and linden 2010 the ideal hydrodynamics fh with actual radiation and ideal dose ft ideal hydrodynamics and radiation are shown in fig 5 and the hydrodynamics ηh optical ηr and total ηt efficiencies are shown in figure s6 despite the reduction in red when the flow rate was increased the reactor efficiency seemed to increase as the gap between the experimental red and the ideal dose decreased which was likely due to the narrower uv dose distribution figure s7 and therefore closer to ideal dose at higher flow rates a total efficiency ηt of about 45 was estimated at the flow rate of 40 lpm which is significantly higher than other uv led systems reported in the literature as achieving 5 to 30 total efficiency ηt keshavarzfathy et al 2020 keshavarzfathy and taghipour 2019 decreasing the overall dose of a reactor either by reducing the uv source power or increasing the flow rate reduces the variance in the dose distribution and therefore necessarily increases the ratio of actual to ideal uv dose of the reactor the results can also be examined with respect to turbulence in the reactor the reynolds number estimation figure s8 shows that the reactor is mostly turbulent after 20 lpm and more turbulence enhances the mixing and can improve hydrodynamic efficiency as a result the disinfection performance of the system is increased the simulation was able to predict the general trend of the reactor performance with the change in the flow rate as well as the delivered uv dose at flow rates higher than 10 lpm however the simulation considerably overpredicted the red at a flow rate of 5 lpm the simulation followed the theoretical trend which we expected to be about two times higher red when the flow rate was halved from 10 to 5 lpm other than common sources of error in the experimental results ms2 biodosimetry has a limitation based mainly on the feed concentration the ms2 concentration in the feed was approximately 107 pfu ml and therefore the biodosimetry test done in this study was able to measure only around a maximum 7 log reduction the large deviation and also the higher experimental error ranges at 5 lpm were most likely the result of such limitations the slightly higher red predicted by the model compared with experiments at other flow rates could have been due to variations in the radiant power of the leds caused by operating conditions and aging to help visualize the behavior of the reactor at various flow rates the computer generated uv dose and velocity profiles are provided in fig 6 the uv dose profile shows the combined effect of radiation and velocity profiles regions with a low uv dose are the weak spots of the reactor in which microorganisms are allowed to pass through the system therefore an ideal reactor design would have a uniform uv dose profile delivered to the water at the reactor outlet in our reactor despite the identical radiation profiles uv dose was adversely affected by flow rate the uv dose was found to be more uniform in the middle of the reactor and the most non uniform region was near the inlet this shows the potential for improvement in the design of the flow distributor for the inlet the velocity profiles of the 40 and 20 lpm flow rates were visually alike however the reactor was estimated to be fully turbulent at 40 lpm the 5 lpm velocity profile was generally similar to the two other flow rates but it showed a more evident flow bypass near the reactor walls the concentration profile of the reactor is illustrated in figure s9 which indicates relatively uniform inactivation across the reactor but less inactivation near the reactor wall dark spots near the wall are likely the cause of lower inactivation in these regions in future designs this issue can be prevented by promoting mixing and turbulence near the reactor walls such that the water can be exposed to higher uv fluence rates 3 2 2 red vs uvt the increase in uvt resulted in a higher ms2 log reduction across the reactor fig 7 according to the red results the system was able to meet the nsf 55 class b dose equivalent at the uvt of 70 and more the red of this reactor design was highly sensitive to the reduction in the uvt at higher ranges as it relied on the collimated beams which traveled a relatively large distance across the reactor the main reduction in the performance of the reactor happened at higher uvts and no significant change was seen in the 70 85 uvt range the reactor behaved more similarly to an ideal reactor in lower uvts which can be seen as an indicator of a good alignment of radiation and flow profile near both ends of the reactor the simulation predicted a trend in the change in the performance of the reactor with uvt but showed deviations under lower uvt conditions the experimental results indicated a nearly ideal performance at 70 uvt which may be impossible to reach under actual operating conditions this ideal performance is likely the result of overlooked phenomena in the simulation or the ideal dose formulation inaccurate experimental results at lower uvt could also be the cause of this nearly ideal performance other than small variations between the simulation and experiment in terms of the geometry and the flow pattern the higher error at the lower uvt was suspected of being caused by the tyndall effect which meant that the vanillin solution despite being homogeneous had promoted scattering as opposed to absorption the scattering was previously reported as a significant factor affecting the transmittance of surface water samples belzile et al 2002 and was also found to be the reason behind unexpected uvt trends in other fields such as uv polymerization désilles et al 2005 assuming the same uvt a medium that scatters uv radiation would promote relatively higher fluence rate levels and a more uniform profile compared with an absorbing medium fig 8 in our reactor design scattering could result in a more uniform radiation profile near the optical modules therefore at higher concentrations of vanillin lower uvt the red of the reactor would be closer to the ideal dose it is expected that waters with the same uvt but less scattering will not show such an increase in the optical efficiency this shows the importance of considering both absorbance and scattering as opposed to solely relying on uvt measurements therefore further investigations of the definition of the ideal dose ft eq 2 may be required to cover a wide range of conditioned and a more comprehensive definition of ft may need to include the scattering characteristics of the media if the tyndall effect in the uv led reactor is proven to be a major contributor the estimation of the ideal dose ft eq 2 should be modified such that radiation scattering is accounted for which increases the ideal dose ft thus the ideal ft will deviate from the results shown in fig 7 and the actual reactor performance in lower uvts may not be as close to that of an ideal reactor to better visualize the system behavior in various uvt conditions the dose and fluence rate profiles of the reactor under three different uvt conditions are shown in fig 9 besides the significant reduction of dose and fluence rate with the uvt comparing the middle parts to the ends of the reactor the radiation distribution was less uniform under the lower uvt conditions therefore there were larger dark regions in the reactor which significantly reduced the performance of the system at an 80 uvt condition the fluence rate in the middle of the reactor was almost negligible and therefore a significant volume of the reactor made no considerable contribution to the inactivation of microorganisms therefore under low uvt conditions the reactor can be much shorter while delivering the same red the simulation did not show the effect of scattering caused by vanillin and it is expected that in low uvts for a scattering media there will be more uniform radiation and dose profiles at both ends of the reactor 3 3 combined variable model the biodosimetry data were fitted to the combined variable model and the coefficients are presented in table 2 the computer program was not able to calculate all the coefficients therefore to decrease the complexity of the problem the parameter e was manually selected using trial and error to achieve the highest r2 the model fits well with the experimental biodosimetry results and could be used to predict the performance of the reactor in various flowrates uvts and uv led radiant power conditions as shown in fig 10 the combined variable model predicted a considerable change in the reactor performance at high uvts and low flow rates this aligns with previous findings that a reactor s red is most sensitive in high uvt and low flow rate regions especially for reactors with a long radiation path making them relatively sensitive to a reduction in uvt despite their high efficiency at high uvts despite the great value of such a model for predicting the performance of the reactor in various operating conditions it cannot provide any information about the performance of conceptual reactor designs as the combined variable model does not exist without the experimental biodosimetry results of the physical reactor a detailed multiphysics model similar to the model developed in this study would be the best solution for research and development applications despite the higher complexity and computational intensity a potential application for the combined variable model could be the employment of the model as an auxiliary tool to the detailed multiphysics models to expand the range of their results the detailed model developed in this study would require several hours to generate every single data point and it would be time consuming to calculate thousands of data points for a wide range of operating conditions the combined variable approach can be fitted to a limited number of data points from the detailed computational model to instantly predict the performance of the conceptual reactor design in a variety of operating conditions which would save further time and resources in the research and development of uv led water disinfection reactors 4 conclusion in this study we developed and characterized one of the first poe uv led water disinfection reactors by including optimized optical and hydrodynamic management modules a total of 14 uv leds were assembled on multi parabolic reflectors which created collimated beams across the reactor flow distributors with multi openings were installed at the inlet and outlet which generated a relatively uniform flow distribution this reactor was able to meet the nsf 55 class a dose equivalent for flow rates of up to 50 lpm and required only 0 05 mw radiant power per ml min flow rate to achieve a dose of 40 mj cm2 at 99 uvt the performance was primarily only affected by the reduction of water uvt especially under higher uvt conditions it was also found that for uvts below 90 such collimated beam based reactors can be made much shorter while maintaining their red the results of this study showed the potential of an accurately developed computational model to predict the performance of uv led water disinfection reactors even with complex radiation and flow distribution the computational model that we developed successfully predicted the behavior of the reactor with changes in the large range of flow rates and uvt conditions for comparison the combined variable model approach was explored and found to be helpful in predicting the performance of already existing reactors under various operating conditions however it cannot be used as an alternative to detailed computational models to explore various design concepts and to design novel optimized reactors this study provided a modeling based approach for designing high flow uv led water disinfection reactors with engineered radiation and flow distribution that will result in high efficiency the overall approach demonstrated here can offer valuable information to researchers in the field to design and develop larger scale uv led water disinfection systems the multiphysics computational model presented in this study may be applied to virtual prototyping of unlimited reactor design possibilities and predict their performance in various operating conditions which would result in a significant reduction in cost and the time required in the research and development of these systems such models can generate immense amounts of detailed information about the critical parameters needed for design troubleshooting e g

15178,the qinghai tibet plateau qtp serves as a collection of unique ecosystems featured as oligotrophic and hypometabolic conditions and is particularly vulnerable to threats posed by anthropogenic and natural disturbances active fluvial processes on the qtp especially the lateral migration of rivers and channel abandonment accompanied by variations in the hydrological connectivity and changes in river geomorphology intensively modify this highland river floodplain system however little is known about how these processes alter the trophic characteristics of highland river system on earth in this study we conducted field investigations on a typical meandering river the quanji river qr located in the northeastern qtp by sampling macroinvertebrates surveying trophic sources and measuring a range of environmental conditions based on the collected data we identified four biotopes for the qr through hierarchical clustering established the representative food web for each biotope through the allometric diet breadth model and estimated the biomass storage and flux within food web for each biotope through the biomass balance model our results show that the identified biotopes differed markedly in hydrological connectivity biotopes 1 and 2 which were in the main river channel represented the condition of high connectivity biotope 3 in the open channel represented the median connectivity while biotope 4 in the semi open closed channel represented the low connectivity in contrast to the unimodal pattern commonly observed in lowland rivers indices for the highland qr including the taxa richness trophic group richness biomass flux biomass transfer efficiency and trophic stability demonstrated a single valley response pattern to the hydrological connectivity we argue that the intermediate disturbance hypothesis still works on highland river ecosystems whereas the optimal disturbance occurs in the low connectivity rather than median connectivity we attribute this skewness to the low resistance and resilience of highland macroinvertebrate community in the face of hydrodynamic disturbances brought by flood events and the biological disturbances from the predation by endemic migratory fish gymnocypris przewalskii in qr this study reveals that lateral migration and channel abandonment play important roles in highland river systems in the qtp in the context of biological and energetic perspectives and suggests that management strategies for highland rivers should be made different from those of lowland rivers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords quanji river abandoned channel macroinvertebrates hydrological connectivity food web qinghai tibet plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is known as the water tower of asia since it serves as the origin for most of the largest asian rivers the qtp river systems are unique as they feature typical oligotrophic and hypometabolic ecosystems in high altitude environment of asia xu et al 2018 liu et al 2019 due to less intensive anthropogenic inputs of nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus and more challenging environmental backgrounds e g high elevation strong radiation and low temperature primary and secondary productivities such as planktons han 2021 and macroinvertebrates xu et al 2014 in the qtp rivers are markedly lower than those in lowland rivers this trophic insufficiency causes rivers on the qtp to become especially vulnerable to ecological stresses such as weak trophic interactions maiolini and lencioni 2001 despite the increased fragility the qtp rivers are important corridors for transferring nutrients and play critical roles in biogeochemical cycling and energetic flux within the highland system ludwig et al 1996 in the faces of climate change and anthropogenic disturbances in highlands the highly dynamic qtp river systems have been rapidly transforming immerzeel et al 2010 wen et al 2013 peng et al 2018 the intensive modifications of the qtp river systems during the 21st century have begun to receive growing attentions from both national and international scientific communities the qtp river show a large degree of variations in their ecosystems due to the increased geomorphological and hydrological heterogeneities blue et al 2013 yu et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 2019a and 2022 for instance the broad valleys on the northwest of the qtp allow free development of fluvial processes forming a unique floodplain ecosystem stroeven et al 2009 river reaches across this region are largely controlled by the interaction between flow sediment dynamics and riparian vegetation successions li 2013 being the meandering and braided river systems they also feature differences in the patterns of flow wang 2008 zhou et al 2019b the most common lateral migration of channels of these river systems usually leaves behind abandoned channels as temporary remnants of the floodplain resulting in dramatic variations in the lateral hydrological connectivity with increased trophic complexity richey and swanson 1989 škarpich et al 2016 further modifying the dynamics of the qtp river systems wang 2020 trophic significance of such lateral migration in the abandoned river channels is widely reported by previous studies e g vannote et al 1980 montgomery 1999 gallardo et al 2008 obolewski 2011 wohl 2013 for instance the flood pulse concept pointed out that utilizations of lateral resources by fishes and macroinvertebrates associated with river pattern variations and flood events have contributed to much of the highest productivity regime of a river floodplain system junk et al 1989 bayley 1991 kattel 2012 the riverine productivity model predicted that the large source of energy is associated with lateral allochthonous production away from the main channel thorp and delong 1994 numerous studies have observed higher values of biomass and abundance in the lateral abandoned channel than those in the adjacent main river as well as comparable value of taxonomic richness in different river systems including amazon river junk et al 1989 yangtze river pan et al 2008 mississippi river harrison 2018 yellow river zhou et al 2019b and murray darling river kattel et al 2016 macroinvertebrate assemblages are usually found to be shifted dramatically in abandoned channels from the lotic to the lentic habitats mainly dominated by hemipteroids decapods amphipods oligochaetes and bivalves pan et al 2012 in addition biological traits associated with feeding functions such as predators and grazers and turnover rates of preys are found to have changed significantly in lateral abandoned channels merritt et al 2002 factors including lateral hydrological connectivity ecological baseline of the floodplain substrate type vegetation type and upstream or downstream ward direction of channel migration are all reported to have influenced the trophic conditions and ecological differences of abandoned channels from main rivers piégay et al 2000 merritt et al 2002 pan et al 2012 zhou et al 2019b to protect the highland ecosystem in the face of growing anthropogenic and environmental stresses rivers on the qtp are worthy of well understanding from multiple perspectives of spatial and temporal changes xu et al 2018 in particular the trophic and ecological responses of the qtp rivers to the fluvial processes e g channel lateral migration provide key clues to ascertain the patterns and characteristics of substantial and energetic dynamics of macroinvertebrates in the high altitude environments although differences in terms of the taxonomic richness biomass and morphological structure of macroinvertebrates between lateral abandoned channels and main rivers have been compared by the previous studies e g tockner et al 1999 merritt et al 2002 pan et al 2012 harrison 2018 distinctions in trophic structure and flux are merely explored this vagueness on how river trophy responds in detail to the channel migration limits our comprehensive understanding on the high altitude river floodplain system to a greater extent macroinvertebrate assemblages are not simply the collections of isolated species but also the inter connected through dispersal and abiotic and biotic interactions via a trophic network i e food web jordano et al 2003 tylianakis et al 2010 given that macroinvertebrates serve as key linkages between basal food sources e g primary productions and detritus and higher trophic levels e g fishes in the food web arrangements and strengths of these interactions play significant roles in not only shaping the composition of the assemblages but also maintaining the stability of the entire aquatic ecosystem in the qtp mccann 2012 to this end we conducted field investigations on a typical river floodplain system the quanji river qr in the northeast qtp during 2018 to 2020 and performed various ecological and food web analyses on macroinvertebrates we hypothesized that macroinvertebrates trophy in the highland river system was markedly influenced by the channel abandonment in the pattern different from that in the lowland river system by aligning with this hypothesis our objectives were to 1 identify representative biotopes and to characterize the biotopes with respect to physicochemical conditions biodiversity and morphological and functional structures of macroinvertebrates 2 establish the food web of representative trophic groups of macroinvertebrates for each biotope to estimate the biomass flux within the food web and to compare the structural and energetic differences between biotopes in the abandoned channel with those in the main river 3 compute the food web stability and to identify key trophic groups for each biotope and to compare the differences in trophic stability between biotopes in the abandoned channel with those in the main river and 4 analyze how the trophic characteristics of a biotope responds to the change of fluvial processes when the channel is abandoned 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the qinghai lake ql is one of the highest alpine lakes in the world it locates in the northeast of the qinghai tibet plateau qtp and is surrounded by mountains tributaries joining into the ql are typical alpine rivers they originate from glacial mountains and have developed varying morphological features among these rivers the quanji river qr fig 1 features a complete gradient high low of the hydrological connectivity from the main river to the abandoned channel and provides a relatively easy access to primitive reaches free from anthropogenic disturbances compared with other rivers e g the shaliu heima and haergai rivers the qr locates in the north of the ql and stretches to a 65 km long channel with a catchment area of 567 km2 the average temperature cumulative precipitation and cumulative runoff in a year of the catchment are 0 6 c 371 mm and 24 million m3 respectively along the qr channel the morphology changes from the straight upstream to the braided and or occasional meandering downstream over a longitudinal gradient the sudden shift of the qr geomorphology results in poor river continuum with relatively limited influence of heterogeneous drivers such as temperature precipitation and other factors at affecting larger spatial scales field investigations including samplings of macroinvertebrates and surveys of habitat conditions were conducted at 49 sites as illustrated in fig 1 of the qr in 2018 august 2019 october and 2020 september based on morphological conditions of the channel these sites were preliminarily classified as the main river sites 22 figures s1a b and the abandoned channel sites 27 figures s1c d 2 2 macroinvertebrate sampling and habitat survey three replicate macroinvertebrate samples were collected from each sampling site 1 m2 using a kick net mesh size 420 μm specimens were sorted and preserved in 75 ethanol in the field and identified to operational taxonomic units otus usually genus level using an optical microscope in the laboratory a total of 94 biotic indices were calculated as listed in table s1 to measure biological integrity of macroinvertebrates including indices describing biodiversity 26 indices morphological structure 43 indices functional structure 24 indices and tolerance to pollution one index the particulate organic matters poms in three replicate samples were collected from each sampling site using two traps diameter 22 cm length 60 cm with bucket at the end of trap trap 1 mesh size 10 μm collected all coarse particulate organic matters cpoms 1 mm and majorities of fine particulate organic matters fpoms 1 mm and trap 2 mesh size 1000 μm collected only cpoms collection of fpoms was estimated using the pom difference between the two traps traps were positioned downstream to the sampling site for 5 min to collect poms flowing through meanwhile substrates in the sampling site were intensively stirred so that poms on the bed would be mixed into the flow and then be collected for the cobble and boulder bed site periphytons in three replicate samples were collected through manually scrubbing all cobbles boulders within depth of 10 cm in the trap 1 for the macrophyte bed site the macrophytes in three replicate samples were uprooted and collected the ash free dry mass afdm of macroinvertebrates poms periphytons macrophytes were determined in the laboratory as the difference of dried 105 c 24 h and ashed 600 c 8 h sample weights hydrodynamic the flow velocity v and water depth h and physicochemical the water temperature t and dissolved oxygen do conditions were surveyed at each sampling site the v and h were measured using a portable acoustic doppler velocimeter flowtracker 2 sontek usa and the t and do were measured using a ysi exo water quality platform xylem usa 2 3 biotope classification based on the preliminary classification main channel sites and abandoned channel sites a hierarchical clustering r package stats function hclust r core team 2021 was applied to the 49 sites to determine the four types of biotope in the qr pairwise distances between sites were measured using macroinvertebrates dissimilarities calculated by bray curtis formula r package vegan function vegdist oksanen et al 2020 a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds r package vegan function metamds j zhang et al 2022 was then applied to the macroinvertebrates data for the sample s distribution over 2 d gradients analysis of variance anova or kruskal wallis analysis was applied to compare the differences of environmental variables biotic indices among biotopes variables indices were pre tested for normality and variance homogeneity using the shapiro method and the bartlett method r package stats functions shapiro test and bartlett test respectively for those tested to be normal and variance homogenous significance of overall difference were further detected using anova and post hoc analysis was carried out using the tukey hsd method for pairs of biotopes attributing to the overall difference r package stats functions aov and tukeyhsd as for the variables indices tested to be non normal or heterogeneous in variance overall difference was further analyzed using the kruskal wallis method and the bonferroni corrected method for post hoc analysis r package agricolae function kruskal de mendiburu 2021 besides analysis of similarities anosim was applied to compare the compositional differences of macroinvertebrates among biotopes measured by bray curtis distance with post hoc significance detected by the bonferroni corrected method r package vegan function anosim anderson and walsh 2013 2 4 food web analysis in order to characterize the trophic structure and function and to estimate the stability for biotopes in the qr food web analysis on macroinvertebrates was performed using the allometric diet breadth model adbm petchey et al 2010 and the biomass balance model moore and de ruiter 2012 the adbm predicts foraging behavior of the biological community and food web structure and thereby help provide a mechanistic structural model of food webs in the river system petchey et al 2008 to obtain the complete food web structure in the form of a predation preference matrix a total of 24 trophic groups as listed in table s2 were assigned to macroinvertebrates based on their taxonomic positions and feeding traits barbour et al 1999 herbivores and detritivores mainly fed on primary producers and poms respectively as for facultative carnivores their predation preferences for preys were thought to be largely determined by the foraging profitability which was quantified by using adbm given the food web i e the predation preference matrix the biomass flux along the web was then estimated using the biomass balance model based on the lotka volterra system the biomass balance model would yield a predation flux matrix for the food web which could be further calculated for stability estimation and key trophic group identification rooney et al 2006 specifically due to the variances in the field estimates biomasses for each particular biotope were obtained by random sampling procedure which is 1000 times on the γ distribution of the biomass of each trophic group the shape and scale of these γ distributions were quantified by the means and standard deviations of the biomass estimates from field samples bolker 2008 koltz et al 2018 to date this methodology for food web analysis has been successfully applied on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems worldwide e g african rivers power et al 1995 north american lakes petchey et al 2008 european farmlands moore and de ruiter 2012 arctic tundra koltz et al 2018 arctic streams o gorman et al 2019 2 4 1 allometric diet breadth model adbm the adbm assumes a predation matrix ordered by average body size in which groups fed wholly or largely on those lower than themselves in the ordering petchey et al 2008 foraging profitability describing a ratio of energy intake to predation effort quantifies predation preferences in the matrix and is defined as 1 p i j e i h i j where p i j is the profitability when an individual of the trophic group i is predated by the trophic group j e i is the net energy that an individual of i provides when consumed and h i j is the handling time that j spends attacking an individual of i the net energy was further defined as 2 e i ε m i where ε is the scaling exponent of mass to energy and m i is the body mass of an individual of i the handling time is further defined as 3 h i j h b m i m j where h is the normalization constant b is the critical ratio of body mass to handling time and m j is the body mass of an individual of j for each predator the diet breadth is calculated as the amounts of preys that maximizes 4 i 1 k λ i j e i 1 i 1 k λ i j h i j where k is the diet breadth of j and λ i j is rate of individuals of i encountered by individuals of j which is further defined as 5 λ i j n i a 0 m i a i m j a j where n i is the density of i a 0 is the normalization constant a i and a j are exponent of body mass to attack rate for preys and predators respectively data of average body mass and abundance for each trophic group were obtained from samples of the qr and values for other parameters such as the attack rate were sourced from meta analyses performed by the previous studies e g rall et al 2012 see table s3 for details the adbm yielded a matrix of predation preference for facultative carnivores which further formed the complete food web of a biotope after inclusions of basal food sources including primary producers and poms complexity of the food web for a biotope was estimated by the trophic group richness s i e number of groups the connectance c and the square root of their product s c connectance describes the proportion of actual interactions to the possible ones within a food web among trophic groups excluding self interactions and was calculated as 6 c 2 l s s 1 where l is the number of trophic interactions 2 4 2 biomass balance model the rate of biomass change for a primary producer is defined as 7 d b p d t r p b p i f b p b i where b p and b i are the biomasses of primary producer p and consumer i respectively t is the time r p is the net growth rate of p and f b p is the functional response of i to p characterizing how i adapts its attack rate to changes in biomass of p the rate of biomass change for a consumer is then defined as 8 d b i d t j a i p i f b j b i d i b i k f b i b k where b j is the biomass of food source j fed by i b k is the biomass of consumer k predating on i a i is the assimilation efficiency of i p i is the production efficiency of i and d i is the non predation death rate of i the rate of biomass change for poms is further defined as 9 d b d d t r d i j 1 a i f b j b i i d i b i i f b d b i where b d is the biomass of poms d detritus and r d is the allochthonous source of d including all poms that enters from outside the system the functional response is described by the michaelis menton equation i e holling type ii holling 1959 10 f b i α b i β b i where α is the maximum attack rate when the consumer is satiated and β is the biomass of i generating half the maximum attack rate in this study we assumed that the system was at steady state as suggested by previous studies e g koltz et al 2018 then the rates of biomass change for trophic groups all became 0 and the differential equations above transformed to algebraic equations the biomass flux of food web for a biotope could therefore be estimated by solving these degenerate equations as mentioned above the biomass of each trophic group in a biotope was assumed to follow the γ distribution which was determined by the mean and variance of the collected data in the qr as a result data of biomass for each trophic group was randomly generated from the γ distribution with 1000 iterations yielding an average for the biomass flux of a biotope values for other parameters were obtained from previous literatures e g moore and de ruiter 2012 see table s4 for details based on the biomass flux trophic level of a group in a biotope was further estimated as 11 l v i k l v k p k i p i 1 where l v i and l v k are trophic levels of the trophic groups i and k assuming k is predated by i respectively p i is the total feeding amount of i on its food sources and p k i is the feeding amount of i on k trophic levels of primary producers and pom were assigned with 1 the maximal trophic level in a food web is also termed as the functional food chain length and describes the complexity of the food web with respect to both structure and function of the system sabo et al 2009 2 4 3 food web stability estimation and key trophic group identification stability of the food web for a biotope was estimated by using the modulus of the most negative eigenvalue λ m i n of the jacobian matrix may 1973 the element of the jacobian matrix is defined as 12 α i j d b i d t b j where α i j describes the per capita effect of the biomass on one another under equilibrium conditions the λ m i n was derived from 1000 iterations to yield the average a larger λ m i n represents a stronger persistence of the food web in the face of minor disturbances under equilibrium conditions thus indicating a higher stability of the system the sensitivity of λ m i n to each trophic group for a biotope was further tested by setting the biomass of each trophic group proportionally varying from 0 to 200 stepped by 10 trophic groups resulting in dramatic variations in λ m i n were identified as the key trophic groups for a biotope the importance of trophic group in a biotope was measured by the modulus of λ m i n s change as the group s proportional biomass increased from 0 to 200 spearman correlation analyses were applied to explore the relationships between the trophic importance and the trophic level biomass average body size abundance of trophic groups 3 results 3 1 environmental and biotic characteristics of biotopes a total of 122 195 macroinvertebrate specimens were collected from the qr belonging to 33 families and 61 genera arthropoda was the most predominant group 54 genera followed by mollusca 3 genera annelida 3 genera and platyhelminthes 1 genus results of hierarchical clustering fig 2 a identified four types of biotopes for the qr based on the macroinvertebrate dissimilarity measured by bray curtis distance bray and curtis 1957 samples from the main channel 22 samples and abandoned channel 27 samples were clustered into two groups showing a dramatic macroinvertebrate dissimilarity up to 5 scaled by the hierarchical clustering these two groups were further clustered into four biotopes at the dissimilarity around 2 to be specific samples from the main channel were clustered into biotopes 1 b1 8 samples and 2 b2 14 samples and samples from the abandoned channel were clustered into biotopes 3 b3 15 samples and 4 b4 12 samples results of nmds fig 2b clearly discriminated the distributions of samples of the four biotopes in the 2 d gradients samples from the main channel were generally located on negative space of axis 1 while samples from b3 located on median or positive parts and b4 samples were even more positive axis 2 discriminated samples from b1 and b2 within the main channel group samples from b1 were located on negative parts of axis 2 while those from b2 were mostly on the positive parts comparisons on values of environmental variables and biotic indices among the four biotopes are listed in table 1 significant

insects relative abundance ra 82 13 especially by ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera ept taxa ra 60 24 by contrast the abandoned channel samples were occupied by both insects ra 45 32 and oligochaetes ra 25 28 and chironomids rather than ept taxa dominated in insects ra 40 32 besides hilsenhoff biotic indices for samples of the main channel 4 34 1 00 were lower than those of the abandoned channel 6 40 1 07 notably variation patterns of richness abundance and biomass among biotopes were found fairly different to be specific richness for biotopes were comparable except for a significant decrease in b3 b3 4 7 1 3 three others 8 9 2 5 abandoned channel samples 4073 4666 ind m2 were dramatically higher in abundance than main channel samples 283 257 ind m2 with b4 possessing the significantly highest abundance among all 7752 4550 ind m2 as for biomass b4 was the highest 19 836 26 963 g m2 followed by b2 and b3 comparable 1 312 2 014 g m2 while b1 was the lowest 0 192 0 130 g m2 the compositional differences of macroinvertebrates among biotopes tested by anosim also showed that the mean ranked distance among biotopes 671 3 was markedly higher than that within biotopes 335 6 indicating a significantly different composition of macroinvertebrates among the four biotopes p 0 0001 3 2 food web structure and biomass flux of biotopes predation matrices predicted by the adbm for the four biotopes are shown in fig 3 comparisons on food web structures among biotopes are listed in table 2 b4 was found with the highest trophic group richness 19 followed by b1 and b2 both were 18 and b3 16 despite of the lowest richness in entire trophic groups b3 was occupied by relatively higher proportions of predators 31 compared with the three others b1 11 b2 28 b4 21 diet breadths i e numbers of prey groups predicted by the adbm of predators in the main channel diet breadth ranges 8 10 for b1 6 8 for b2 were generally larger than those in the abandoned channel 3 5 for

are listed in table 2 the abandoned channel possessed dramatically higher biomass storage b3 119 14 g m2 b4 278 39 g m2 compared with the main channel b1 1 49 g m2 b2 2 78 g m2 however the biomass

biomass storage capacity of b2 2 78 g m2 than that of b3 119 14 g m2 the annual biomass flux of b2 15 02 g m2 turned out to be higher than that of b3 5 07 g m2 due to their differences in the biomass transfer efficiency poms generally contributed half around or less b1 30 8 b2 50 6 b3 43 8 b4 31 3 to the total basal biomass storage i e sum of biomass storages of both poms and primary productions by contrast at the primary consumption level biomass flux sourced from poms predominantly accounted for 60 9 97 9 99 9 and 97 0 of the total basal biomass flux i e sum of biomass fluxes from both poms and primary productions for the four biotopes indicating that the majority of biomass within a food web in the qr was derived from detritus 3 3 food web stability and key trophic groups of biotopes comparisons on food web stability as measured by λ m i n among biotopes are listed in table 2 sensitivity of food web to trophic groups for the four biotopes are shown in fig 5 b4 was found to have the highest stability λ m i n 90 followed by b2 5 9 while b1 4 4 10 2 and b3 1 6 10 6 tended to be the least stable in the face of disturbances results of the spearman correlation analysis as illustrated in figure s2 indicated that the importance of trophic group responded well to the trophic level change spearman correlation r 0 70 the biomass r 0 83 and the average body size r 0 92 in b2 and responded well to the biomass r 0 94 and the abundance r 0 79 in b4 by contrast correlations between trophic group importance and other indices were lower in b1 r 0 02 0 57 and particularly b2 r 0 06 0 29 in b1 gammarid was the most important trophic group followed by carnivorous caddisfly stability of food web in b1 slightly decreased λ m i n 4 4 10 2 4 0 10 2 as gammarid s biomass increased from 0 to 90 and dramatically increased λ m i n 4 0 10 2 9 5 10 2 from 90 to 200 of the biomass as for carnivorous caddisfly the food web stability gradually increased λ m i n 2 1 10 2 5 2 10 2 as its biomass increased from 0 to 200 in addition a dramatic increase of stability was observed λ m i n 1 9 10 2 4 9 10 2 as the biomass of carnivorous tipulid increased from 0 to 50 but began to decrease gradually λ m i n 4 9 10 2 3 9 10 2 afterwards in b2 two predacious trophic groups carnivorous caddisfly and carnivorous stonefly were the most important so that the stability increased λ m i n 2 9 9 3 for carnivorous caddisfly 3 2 7 6 for carnivorous stonefly along with the increase of their biomasses for gammarid similar stability variation pattern to that in b1 was observed as firstly decreased λ m i n 7 4 4 7 then increased λ m i n 4 7 7 5 and the lowest stability was reached at 10 biomass in b3 gammarid predominantly influenced the stability of food web in a negative way as stability dramatically decreased λ m i n 1 2 10 4 2 3 10 6 as gammarid s biomass increased in b4 carnivorous stinkbug and mussel were found to be the most important trophic groups and positively influenced the stability of food web λ m i n 56 7 125 0 for carnivorous stinkbug 68 5 114 0 for mussel as their biomasses increased gammarid in b4 influenced the stability in a similar pattern to that in b1 and b2 stability decreased λ m i n 135 0 78 8 as gammarid biomass increased from 0 to 40 and then increased λ m i n 78 8 122 0 afterwards 4 discussion 4 1 abiotic and biotic differences among biotopes in the quanji river the hierarchical clustering successfully distinguished the samples from the abandoned channel as well as from the main river channel indicating the consistence in the results derived from the manual classification based on river geomorphology and the statistical clustering technique we used for macroinvertebrate assemblages additionally hierarchical clustering performed more delicate classifications on biotopes beyond morphological conditions i e samples collected from the main river were further clustered into b1 and b2 and samples from abandoned channels were clustered into b3 and b4 in general b1 b2 and b3 b4 represented as the typical lotic and lentic biotopes in the qr floodplain ecosystem in the qtp figure s1 abiotic and biotic differences between lotic and lentic biotopes regardless in highland or lowland rivers that were also commonly reported by previous studies e g amoros and bornette 2002 zhou et al 2019b for instance hydrodynamic conditions represented by average flow velocity was found to be significantly different between b1 b2 0 69 0 37 m s and b3 b4 0 13 0 22 m s table 1 trophic conditions represented by biomasses of primary productions pp and particulate organic matters pom were found to be significantly lower in b1 b2 pp 1 028 0 581 g m2 pom 0 464 0 120 g m2 than those in b3 b4 pp 91 033 49 876 g m2 pom 82 292 71 998 g m2 table 1 differences in the hydrodynamic and trophic conditions between b1 b2 and b3 b4 indicate a greater contribution of the abandoned river channel to the productivity of the whole river floodplain system in the qtp tockner et al 1999 in terms of biotic characteristics b3 b4 possessed more individuals of macroinvertebrates 4073 4666 ind m2 than b1 b2 did 283 257 ind m2 possibly due to the nutrient enrichment in b3 b4 macroinvertebrates in b1 b2 were primarily composed by ept taxa ra 0 60 0 24 while those in b3 b4 were mainly non insects ra 0 54 0 31 the enrichment of pom in b3 b4 resulted in the dominance of gathering collectors relative biomass rb 0 83 0 22 compared with that of b1 b2 rb 0 56 0 31 hilsenhoff biotic indices for b3 b4 6 40 1 07 were also significantly higher than those for b1 b2 4 33 1 00 indicating that more tolerant taxa made the abandoned channel as their feeding and reproductive habitat however we did not observe obvious pollutants in the abandoned channel and thus attributed the increase of hilsenhoff biotic index associated with lentic taxa such as oligochaetes invertebrate groups such as oligochaetes are usually assigned with high tolerance values although they could also reside in qualified environment with relatively less or no inputs of pollutants extence and ferguson 1989 the water temperature plays an important role in discriminating the main river channel biotopes b1 and b2 in our study the average water temperatures t measured in b1 5 30 1 39 c were significantly lower than those in b2 12 50 4 36 c indicating the differences in the thermal conditions of the main channel by contrast the water temperature for b2 b3 and b4 were similar 12 19 3 70 c such changes may have resulted in differences in biotic indices between b1 and b2 reflecting the discriminated functioning of macroinvertebrates in the main channel of qr to be specific the macroinvertebrates biomass in b2 were around 6 times higher than in b1 with a proportionate increase in biomass of gathering collectors indicating excellent ecosystem functioning some disproportionate changes in functional groups were also observed including the biomasses of predators b1 b2 1 16 shredders b1 b2 1 21 and scrappers b1 b2 3 1 these functional attributes as also pointed out by friberg et al 2009 give complementary information about the response of river ecosystems to the temperature in the high altitude environment our results suggest that the lateral hydrological connectivity in the qr system was a prime factor to mobilize energy sources of macroinvertebrates difference in lateral hydrological connectivity of the abandoned channel from that of the main river and other adjacent channels are usually measured by the intensity of hydrodynamic conditions as well as the quantity of organic retentions larsen et al 2012 in our study higher v 0 18 0 24 m s and lower biomass of pom 49 961 24 467 g m2 were found in b3 compared with those in b4 v 0 07 0 19 m s pom 130 788 92 395 g m2 indicating that b3 possessed higher connectivity than b4 these results are consistent with our field observations that most of the b3 samples were collected from open channels with obvious connections to the main river channel while b4 samples were collected from semi open or closed channels as the lateral hydrological connectivity decreased from b2 main river channel to b3 open channel to b4 semi open closed channel biomass of primary productions increased since most alga and macrophytes may have preferred to select the habitats of reduced hydrodynamic conditions with lower velocity lower turbidity and higher nutrients retention ward et al 1999 notably the macroinvertebrate diversity as measured by taxa richness and shannon wiener index showed a single valley response pattern to the decreased connectivity line 2 in fig 6 i e the diversity reached the lowest in b3 and they were comparatively higher in both b2 and b4 although assemblage compositions were found to have dramatically shifted e g the dominating insects shifted from ept taxa in b2 to chironomids in b4 similar results of the single valley response to the hydrological connectivity were also observed in macroinvertebrate assemblages in upper reaches of the yellow river in the northeastern qtp zhou et al 2019b hou 2021 4 2 trophic distinctions among biotopes in the quanji river the patterns of trophic variations among biotopes as characterized by food web structural and functional indices were found to be mostly predictable to especially lateral hydrological connectivity to be specific the trophic group richness and the maximal trophic level representing the trophic diversity and complexity respectively responded to the connectivity in a similar way just as the biodiversity did i e they first decreased and then increased as the main river b2 transformed into an open abandoned channel b3 and finally into the closed channel b4 by contrast the connectance as another metric apart from the maximal trophic level to describe the complexity of the food web structure revealed high values in both high diversity main river and low diversity open channel situations table 2 low trophic diversity associated with the loss of rare taxa can lead to a simplification of the food web structure with more interactions per species as a result the open abandoned channel can yield greater connectance than the closed channel did start et al 2020 additionally inconsistent response patterns to the connectivity were observed between the biomass storage and flux the biomass storage of the biotope negatively responded to the connectivity because the alga and macrophypes as major primary producer components contributing to the biomass storage significantly deteriorated as the connectivity increased this result is consistent with the observations of both lowland and highland rivers that channel abandonment usually leads to an enrichment of productivity e g tockner et al 1999 hein et al 2003 wang et al 2020 as for the annual biomass flux it responded to the connectivity in a similar single valley pattern as the trophic group richness and the maximal trophic level did the inconsistency in response pattern of biomass storage and flux could be attributed to variations in trophic transfer efficiencies as represented by the flux storage ratio between the abandoned channel and the main river although the flux storage ratio also followed a single valley response pattern to the connectivity and slightly increased as the abandoned channel lost its connection to the main river b3 0 05 b4 0 27 it was still significantly lower than that in the main river b2 5 40 this result suggests that in oligotrophic highland rivers xu et al 2018 productivities will be utilized as fully as possible by primary consumers whereas in abandoned channels productivity utilization may not match with the enrichment consequently resulting in a trophic accumulation in our study the trophic stability as represented by λ m i n is shown to have a single valley response pattern to the lateral hydrological connectivity and a positive response pattern to the water temperature by contrast the squared root product of trophic group richness and connectance s c as an alternative to describe the stability recommended by gardner and ashby 1970 and may 1973 were unpredictable to either connectivity or temperature variations as we attributed this result to the variability of connectance in response to a regular disturbance start et al 2020 in addition values of λ m i n indicated the extreme trophic instability in b1 and b3 table 2 once disturbed these biotopes were likely to collapse followed by new successions rather than to recover to their original status doretto et al 2020 our results suggest that the biomass proportion and trophic level are two critical factors determining the role that a trophic group plays for the stability which is consistent with the general understanding that biomass and top down bottom up controls beget the food web stability leigh 1965 aoki and mizushima 2001 wollrab et al 2012 in the qr the gammarids were the most dominant group in b1 b3 and b4 accounting for 26 8 78 2 and 68 0 of the total biomass respectively and were fourth dominant group in b2 accounting for 17 5 of the total biomass previous studies found that the stable assemblages of macroinvertebrates were generally dominated by the most common taxa while those unstable ones were dominated by rare taxa death and zimmermann 2005 however in our study the gammarids were found to be one of the most important groups for the stabilities of all biotopes regardless of the trophic stability to be specific in b1 b2 and b4 trophic stabilities would first decrease then increase as the biomass of gammarids kept increasing while in b3 increased gammarid population led to a rapid decline in stability in addition the threshold of gammarids biomass for the lowest stability were found to be dramatically different among b1 b2 and b4 for instance the threshold biomass of gammarids in b1 91 was much higher than those in b2 and b4 16 and 38 respectively suggesting that unlike lowland river system the high altitude river system could be more fragile in the context of ecological stability similarly the negative influence of biomass increase before threshold on the trophic stability was also found relatively milder in b1 decreasing rate 0 12 than those in b2 and b4 decreasing rate 2 08 and 1 05 respectively indicating the variability in the high altitude river biotopes that may influence their fragility in stability further in addition a top down effect on the trophic stability of biotopes was observed in the qr especially in b1 b2 and b4 the trophic stability was found to be more sensitive to biomass variations of the predators high trophic level compared with the preys low trophic level with comparable biomass fig 5 to be specific the carnivorous caddisflies dramatically improved the stabilities of main river biotopes b1 and b2 as their biomass increased and their critical positions in b4 were replaced by the carnivorous stinkbugs by contrast the top down effect on b3 was not obvious since most of predators disappeared in the semi open abandoned channel the variations in the trophic interactions among different biotopes in the qr would clearly indicate their increased fragility particularly when the river system functioning is weakened by predator prey interactions kattel et al 2016 notably however there were some exceptions that trophic groups e g mussels in b4 with neither largest biomass nor highest trophic level would still control the trophic stability of the biotope and suggest increased usefulness in the conservation of certain biota such as mussels in the qr system 4 3 effects of lateral hydrological connectivity variations on highland river trophy the lateral hydrological connectivity is one of the most important factors determine the trophy of a river floodplain system amoros and bornette 2002 previous studies focusing on lowland rivers e g the amazon the rhine the danube and the yangtze rivers all reported similar results that the macroinvertebrate diversity followed a unimodal pattern in response to the connectivity variation line 1 in fig 6 i e the macroinvertebrate richness peaked in an intermediate connectivity e g tockner et al 1999 paillex et al 2007 obolewski 2011 as a result reconnection to the main river was recommended as the prior strategy to restore a lowland water body which have usually gained expected achievements e g paillex et al 2009 obolewski and glińska lewczuk 2011 kattel et al 2016 this response pattern fits well within the framework of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis connell 1978 worm and duffy 2003 generally the disturbance caused by high connectivity inhibited macroinvertebrates while at a low connectivity macroinvertebrate assemblages tended to be dominated only by a few taxa roxburgh et al 2004 both extremes high and low connectivity may result in a decline in the diversity of macroinvertebrates in contrast an intermediate connectivity provides suitable niches for most macroinvertebrates resulting in the highest diversity however an entirely opposite single valley pattern was observed in the highland rivers including the qr in this study line 2 in fig 6 as well as the upper reaches of the yellow river zhou et al 2019b hou 2021 we think the intermediate disturbance hypothesis may still work in highland rivers but in terms of macroinvertebrates in high altitudes the intermediate disturbance is likely to occur in the low connectivity semi open closed channels rather than median connectivity open channels we attribute this skewness to the effects brought by the resilience decline of macroinvertebrates the stream size variation and the endemic fish predation as elaborated below for highland rivers with greater variations in the hydrological connectivity e g the qr in this study and the bai river zhou et al 2019b macroinvertebrates are found to be increasingly vulnerable to frequent hydrodynamic disturbances conditions of low temperature and intensive radiation can cause a hypometabolism which further results in a much weaker resilience of macroinvertebrates in these highland rivers compared with those in the lowland rivers asmamaw et al 2021 therefore macroinvertebrate assemblages in these highland rivers usually tend to take a longer time to recover once they are exposed to disturbances asmamaw et al 2021 for instance macroinvertebrates in lowland rivers take about a month around to regroup their assemblages after the flood event 200 m a s l snyder and johnson 2006 while those in higher altitude rivers 1000 m a s l can take about three months or even longer to get recovered doretto et al 2020 indicating increased exposure to vulnerability related to flood and radiation effects in our study we estimated the occurrence of the average 2 5 1 4 and 0 1 flood events in august september and october which means that flood disturbances in august and september would delay macroinvertebrates recovery in the qr further exposing the assemblages till to the winter in addition unlike lowland large rivers with the order of 7 8 these highland rivers around the source of the yellow river with small number with 3 4 orders are frequently exposed to intense flood events as the flood capacity of channel increases with the increasing number of stream orders ogawa and male 1986 small sized channels are more likely to suffer from the intensity of high peak and frequent flood disturbances in the qr macroinvertebrates in both open channels b3 and semi open closed channels b4 dominated by lentic taxa would have been significantly affected by intense flood events we argue that the b3 with intermediate connectivity to the main river would have been frequently disturbed by extreme hydrodynamic conditions which consequently led to lower diversity of macroinvertebrates table 1 macroinvertebrates in the open channel of the qr are also exposed to a higher risk of being foraged by fishes in the river floodplain system fishes usually derive most of their energy from the productivity associated with the floodplain system rather than the main river channel dettmers et al 2001 indicating that the channel with high connectivity to the main river are ideal highway service area for the native migratory cyprinid g przewalskii c zhang et al 2022 during april to august as both of previous documentations and our gut content analysis showed g przewalskii collected in the qr had typical predation preference for macroinvertebrates especially gammarids and chironomids chen 2011 the absence of gravels and the limited lushness of macrophyte community in the open channel results in a loss of refuge for macroinvertebrates from predation further leading to a decrease in macroinvertebrate diversity by contrast macroinvertebrates in the closed channel are exposed to a lower risk of being foraged by g przewalskii due to the little migratory access to the fish leading to a higher diversity 5 conclusions our study on macroinvertebrates and food webs in different biotopes of the qr in the qtp has contributed significantly to our understanding of highland riverine response to variations in the hydrological connectivity we found that the individual biotopes in the qr responded differently to the hydrological connectivity the biotopes 1 and 2 in the main river channel represented the higher connectivity the biotope 3 in the open channel represented the median connectivity while the biotope 4 in the semi open closed channel represented the low connectivity one of the most intriguing results of our study is that biological and trophic indices including the taxa richness trophic group richness biomass flux transfer efficiency and trophic stability in the qr all demonstrated a single valley response pattern to the hydrological connectivity which contrasts with the unimodal pattern commonly observed in lowland rivers we conclude by arguing that this result is attributed to a skewness of intermediate disturbance from the median to low hydrological connectivity due to lower resistance and resilience of highland macroinvertebrates in the face of hydrodynamic disturbances brought by flood events and the biological disturbances such as predation by the endemic migratory fish this study not only reveals critical roles of lateral migration and channel abandonment accompanied by hydrological connectivity variation in structuring highland river ecosystems in the context of biological and energetic perspectives but also suggests that the management strategies of highland river should be different from those of lowland rivers data availability data will be made available on request the macroinvertebrate records for the 49 sampling

15178,the qinghai tibet plateau qtp serves as a collection of unique ecosystems featured as oligotrophic and hypometabolic conditions and is particularly vulnerable to threats posed by anthropogenic and natural disturbances active fluvial processes on the qtp especially the lateral migration of rivers and channel abandonment accompanied by variations in the hydrological connectivity and changes in river geomorphology intensively modify this highland river floodplain system however little is known about how these processes alter the trophic characteristics of highland river system on earth in this study we conducted field investigations on a typical meandering river the quanji river qr located in the northeastern qtp by sampling macroinvertebrates surveying trophic sources and measuring a range of environmental conditions based on the collected data we identified four biotopes for the qr through hierarchical clustering established the representative food web for each biotope through the allometric diet breadth model and estimated the biomass storage and flux within food web for each biotope through the biomass balance model our results show that the identified biotopes differed markedly in hydrological connectivity biotopes 1 and 2 which were in the main river channel represented the condition of high connectivity biotope 3 in the open channel represented the median connectivity while biotope 4 in the semi open closed channel represented the low connectivity in contrast to the unimodal pattern commonly observed in lowland rivers indices for the highland qr including the taxa richness trophic group richness biomass flux biomass transfer efficiency and trophic stability demonstrated a single valley response pattern to the hydrological connectivity we argue that the intermediate disturbance hypothesis still works on highland river ecosystems whereas the optimal disturbance occurs in the low connectivity rather than median connectivity we attribute this skewness to the low resistance and resilience of highland macroinvertebrate community in the face of hydrodynamic disturbances brought by flood events and the biological disturbances from the predation by endemic migratory fish gymnocypris przewalskii in qr this study reveals that lateral migration and channel abandonment play important roles in highland river systems in the qtp in the context of biological and energetic perspectives and suggests that management strategies for highland rivers should be made different from those of lowland rivers graphical abstract image graphical

qinghai tibet plateau qtp is known as the water tower of asia since it serves as the origin for most of the largest asian rivers the qtp river systems are unique as they feature typical oligotrophic and hypometabolic ecosystems in high altitude environment of asia xu et al 2018 liu et al 2019 due to less intensive anthropogenic inputs of nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus and more challenging environmental backgrounds e g high elevation strong radiation and low temperature primary and secondary productivities such as planktons han 2021 and macroinvertebrates xu et al 2014 in the qtp rivers are markedly lower than those in lowland rivers this trophic insufficiency causes rivers on the qtp to become especially vulnerable to ecological stresses such as weak trophic interactions maiolini and lencioni 2001 despite the increased fragility the qtp rivers are important corridors for transferring nutrients and play critical roles in biogeochemical cycling and energetic flux within the highland system ludwig et al 1996 in the faces of climate change and anthropogenic disturbances in highlands the highly dynamic qtp river systems have been rapidly transforming immerzeel et al 2010 wen et al 2013 peng et al 2018 the intensive modifications of the qtp river systems during the 21st century have begun to receive growing attentions from both national and international scientific communities the qtp river show a large degree of variations in their ecosystems due to the increased geomorphological and hydrological heterogeneities blue et al 2013 yu et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 2019a and 2022 for instance the broad valleys on the northwest of the qtp allow free development of fluvial processes forming a unique floodplain ecosystem stroeven et al 2009 river reaches across this region are largely controlled by the interaction between flow sediment dynamics and riparian vegetation successions li 2013 being the meandering and braided river systems they also feature differences in the patterns of flow wang 2008 zhou et al 2019b the most common lateral migration of channels of these river systems usually leaves behind abandoned channels as temporary remnants of the floodplain resulting in dramatic variations in the lateral hydrological connectivity with increased trophic complexity richey and swanson 1989 škarpich et al 2016 further modifying the dynamics of the qtp river systems wang 2020 trophic significance of such lateral migration in the abandoned river channels is widely reported by previous studies e g vannote et al 1980 montgomery 1999 gallardo et al 2008 obolewski 2011 wohl 2013 for instance the flood pulse concept pointed out that utilizations of lateral resources by fishes and macroinvertebrates associated with river pattern variations and flood events have contributed to much of the highest productivity regime of a river floodplain system junk et al 1989 bayley 1991 kattel 2012 the riverine productivity model predicted that the large source of energy is associated with lateral allochthonous production away from the main channel thorp and delong 1994 numerous studies have observed higher values of biomass and abundance in the lateral abandoned channel than those in the adjacent main river as well as comparable value of taxonomic richness in different river systems including amazon river junk et al 1989 yangtze river pan et al 2008 mississippi river harrison 2018 yellow river zhou et al 2019b and murray darling river kattel et al 2016 macroinvertebrate assemblages are usually found to be shifted dramatically in abandoned channels from the lotic to the lentic habitats mainly dominated by hemipteroids decapods amphipods oligochaetes and bivalves pan et al 2012 in addition biological traits associated with feeding functions such as predators and grazers and turnover rates of preys are found to have changed significantly in lateral abandoned channels merritt et al 2002 factors including lateral hydrological connectivity ecological baseline of the floodplain substrate type vegetation type and upstream or downstream ward direction of channel migration are all reported to have influenced the trophic conditions and ecological differences of abandoned channels from main rivers piégay et al 2000 merritt et al 2002 pan et al 2012 zhou et al 2019b to protect the highland ecosystem in the face of growing anthropogenic and environmental stresses rivers on the qtp are worthy of well understanding from multiple perspectives of spatial and temporal changes xu et al 2018 in particular the trophic and ecological responses of the qtp rivers to the fluvial processes e g channel lateral migration provide key clues to ascertain the patterns and characteristics of substantial and energetic dynamics of macroinvertebrates in the high altitude environments although differences in terms of the taxonomic richness biomass and morphological structure of macroinvertebrates between lateral abandoned channels and main rivers have been compared by the previous studies e g tockner et al 1999 merritt et al 2002 pan et al 2012 harrison 2018 distinctions in trophic structure and flux are merely explored this vagueness on how river trophy responds in detail to the channel migration limits our comprehensive understanding on the high altitude river floodplain system to a greater extent macroinvertebrate assemblages are not simply the collections of isolated species but also the inter connected through dispersal and abiotic and biotic interactions via a trophic network i e food web jordano et al 2003 tylianakis et al 2010 given that macroinvertebrates serve as key linkages between basal food sources e g primary productions and detritus and higher trophic levels e g fishes in the food web arrangements and strengths of these interactions play significant roles in not only shaping the composition of the assemblages but also maintaining the stability of the entire aquatic ecosystem in the qtp mccann 2012 to this end we conducted field investigations on a typical river floodplain system the quanji river qr in the northeast qtp during 2018 to 2020 and performed various ecological and food web analyses on macroinvertebrates we hypothesized that macroinvertebrates trophy in the highland river system was markedly influenced by the channel abandonment in the pattern different from that in the lowland river system by aligning with this hypothesis our objectives were to 1 identify representative biotopes and to characterize the biotopes with respect to physicochemical conditions biodiversity and morphological and functional structures of macroinvertebrates 2 establish the food web of representative trophic groups of macroinvertebrates for each biotope to estimate the biomass flux within the food web and to compare the structural and energetic differences between biotopes in the abandoned channel with those in the main river 3 compute the food web stability and to identify key trophic groups for each biotope and to compare the differences in trophic stability between biotopes in the abandoned channel with those in the main river and 4 analyze how the trophic characteristics of a biotope responds to the change of fluvial processes when the channel is abandoned 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the qinghai lake ql is one of the highest alpine lakes in the world it locates in the northeast of the qinghai tibet plateau qtp and is surrounded by mountains tributaries joining into the ql are typical alpine rivers they originate from glacial mountains and have developed varying morphological features among these rivers the quanji river qr fig 1 features a complete gradient high low of the hydrological connectivity from the main river to the abandoned channel and provides a relatively easy access to primitive reaches free from anthropogenic disturbances compared with other rivers e g the shaliu heima and haergai rivers the qr locates in the north of the ql and stretches to a 65 km long channel with a catchment area of 567 km2 the average temperature cumulative precipitation and cumulative runoff in a year of the catchment are 0 6 c 371 mm and 24 million m3 respectively along the qr channel the morphology changes from the straight upstream to the braided and or occasional meandering downstream over a longitudinal gradient the sudden shift of the qr geomorphology results in poor river continuum with relatively limited influence of heterogeneous drivers such as temperature precipitation and other factors at affecting larger spatial scales field investigations including samplings of macroinvertebrates and surveys of habitat conditions were conducted at 49 sites as illustrated in fig 1 of the qr in 2018 august 2019 october and 2020 september based on morphological conditions of the channel these sites were preliminarily classified as the main river sites 22 figures s1a b and the abandoned channel sites 27 figures s1c d 2 2 macroinvertebrate sampling and habitat survey three replicate macroinvertebrate samples were collected from each sampling site 1 m2 using a kick net mesh size 420 μm specimens were sorted and preserved in 75 ethanol in the field and identified to operational taxonomic units otus usually genus level using an optical microscope in the laboratory a total of 94 biotic indices were calculated as listed in table s1 to measure biological integrity of macroinvertebrates including indices describing biodiversity 26 indices morphological structure 43 indices functional structure 24 indices and tolerance to pollution one index the particulate organic matters poms in three replicate samples were collected from each sampling site using two traps diameter 22 cm length 60 cm with bucket at the end of trap trap 1 mesh size 10 μm collected all coarse particulate organic matters cpoms 1 mm and majorities of fine particulate organic matters fpoms 1 mm and trap 2 mesh size 1000 μm collected only cpoms collection of fpoms was estimated using the pom difference between the two traps traps were positioned downstream to the sampling site for 5 min to collect poms flowing through meanwhile substrates in the sampling site were intensively stirred so that poms on the bed would be mixed into the flow and then be collected for the cobble and boulder bed site periphytons in three replicate samples were collected through manually scrubbing all cobbles boulders within depth of 10 cm in the trap 1 for the macrophyte bed site the macrophytes in three replicate samples were uprooted and collected the ash free dry mass afdm of macroinvertebrates poms periphytons macrophytes were determined in the laboratory as the difference of dried 105 c 24 h and ashed 600 c 8 h sample weights hydrodynamic the flow velocity v and water depth h and physicochemical the water temperature t and dissolved oxygen do conditions were surveyed at each sampling site the v and h were measured using a portable acoustic doppler velocimeter flowtracker 2 sontek usa and the t and do were measured using a ysi exo water quality platform xylem usa 2 3 biotope classification based on the preliminary classification main channel sites and abandoned channel sites a hierarchical clustering r package stats function hclust r core team 2021 was applied to the 49 sites to determine the four types of biotope in the qr pairwise distances between sites were measured using macroinvertebrates dissimilarities calculated by bray curtis formula r package vegan function vegdist oksanen et al 2020 a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds r package vegan function metamds j zhang et al 2022 was then applied to the macroinvertebrates data for the sample s distribution over 2 d gradients analysis of variance anova or kruskal wallis analysis was applied to compare the differences of environmental variables biotic indices among biotopes variables indices were pre tested for normality and variance homogeneity using the shapiro method and the bartlett method r package stats functions shapiro test and bartlett test respectively for those tested to be normal and variance homogenous significance of overall difference were further detected using anova and post hoc analysis was carried out using the tukey hsd method for pairs of biotopes attributing to the overall difference r package stats functions aov and tukeyhsd as for the variables indices tested to be non normal or heterogeneous in variance overall difference was further analyzed using the kruskal wallis method and the bonferroni corrected method for post hoc analysis r package agricolae function kruskal de mendiburu 2021 besides analysis of similarities anosim was applied to compare the compositional differences of macroinvertebrates among biotopes measured by bray curtis distance with post hoc significance detected by the bonferroni corrected method r package vegan function anosim anderson and walsh 2013 2 4 food web analysis in order to characterize the trophic structure and function and to estimate the stability for biotopes in the qr food web analysis on macroinvertebrates was performed using the allometric diet breadth model adbm petchey et al 2010 and the biomass balance model moore and de ruiter 2012 the adbm predicts foraging behavior of the biological community and food web structure and thereby help provide a mechanistic structural model of food webs in the river system petchey et al 2008 to obtain the complete food web structure in the form of a predation preference matrix a total of 24 trophic groups as listed in table s2 were assigned to macroinvertebrates based on their taxonomic positions and feeding traits barbour et al 1999 herbivores and detritivores mainly fed on primary producers and poms respectively as for facultative carnivores their predation preferences for preys were thought to be largely determined by the foraging profitability which was quantified by using adbm given the food web i e the predation preference matrix the biomass flux along the web was then estimated using the biomass balance model based on the lotka volterra system the biomass balance model would yield a predation flux matrix for the food web which could be further calculated for stability estimation and key trophic group identification rooney et al 2006 specifically due to the variances in the field estimates biomasses for each particular biotope were obtained by random sampling procedure which is 1000 times on the γ distribution of the biomass of each trophic group the shape and scale of these γ distributions were quantified by the means and standard deviations of the biomass estimates from field samples bolker 2008 koltz et al 2018 to date this methodology for food web analysis has been successfully applied on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems worldwide e g african rivers power et al 1995 north american lakes petchey et al 2008 european farmlands moore and de ruiter 2012 arctic tundra koltz et al 2018 arctic streams o gorman et al 2019 2 4 1 allometric diet breadth model adbm the adbm assumes a predation matrix ordered by average body size in which groups fed wholly or largely on those lower than themselves in the ordering petchey et al 2008 foraging profitability describing a ratio of energy intake to predation effort quantifies predation preferences in the matrix and is defined as 1 p i j e i h i j where p i j is the profitability when an individual of the trophic group i is predated by the trophic group j e i is the net energy that an individual of i provides when consumed and h i j is the handling time that j spends attacking an individual of i the net energy was further defined as 2 e i ε m i where ε is the scaling exponent of mass to energy and m i is the body mass of an individual of i the handling time is further defined as 3 h i j h b m i m j where h is the normalization constant b is the critical ratio of body mass to handling time and m j is the body mass of an individual of j for each predator the diet breadth is calculated as the amounts of preys that maximizes 4 i 1 k λ i j e i 1 i 1 k λ i j h i j where k is the diet breadth of j and λ i j is rate of individuals of i encountered by individuals of j which is further defined as 5 λ i j n i a 0 m i a i m j a j where n i is the density of i a 0 is the normalization constant a i and a j are exponent of body mass to attack rate for preys and predators respectively data of average body mass and abundance for each trophic group were obtained from samples of the qr and values for other parameters such as the attack rate were sourced from meta analyses performed by the previous studies e g rall et al 2012 see table s3 for details the adbm yielded a matrix of predation preference for facultative carnivores which further formed the complete food web of a biotope after inclusions of basal food sources including primary producers and poms complexity of the food web for a biotope was estimated by the trophic group richness s i e number of groups the connectance c and the square root of their product s c connectance describes the proportion of actual interactions to the possible ones within a food web among trophic groups excluding self interactions and was calculated as 6 c 2 l s s 1 where l is the number of trophic interactions 2 4 2 biomass balance model the rate of biomass change for a primary producer is defined as 7 d b p d t r p b p i f b p b i where b p and b i are the biomasses of primary producer p and consumer i respectively t is the time r p is the net growth rate of p and f b p is the functional response of i to p characterizing how i adapts its attack rate to changes in biomass of p the rate of biomass change for a consumer is then defined as 8 d b i d t j a i p i f b j b i d i b i k f b i b k where b j is the biomass of food source j fed by i b k is the biomass of consumer k predating on i a i is the assimilation efficiency of i p i is the production efficiency of i and d i is the non predation death rate of i the rate of biomass change for poms is further defined as 9 d b d d t r d i j 1 a i f b j b i i d i b i i f b d b i where b d is the biomass of poms d detritus and r d is the allochthonous source of d including all poms that enters from outside the system the functional response is described by the michaelis menton equation i e holling type ii holling 1959 10 f b i α b i β b i where α is the maximum attack rate when the consumer is satiated and β is the biomass of i generating half the maximum attack rate in this study we assumed that the system was at steady state as suggested by previous studies e g koltz et al 2018 then the rates of biomass change for trophic groups all became 0 and the differential equations above transformed to algebraic equations the biomass flux of food web for a biotope could therefore be estimated by solving these degenerate equations as mentioned above the biomass of each trophic group in a biotope was assumed to follow the γ distribution which was determined by the mean and variance of the collected data in the qr as a result data of biomass for each trophic group was randomly generated from the γ distribution with 1000 iterations yielding an average for the biomass flux of a biotope values for other parameters were obtained from previous literatures e g moore and de ruiter 2012 see table s4 for details based on the biomass flux trophic level of a group in a biotope was further estimated as 11 l v i k l v k p k i p i 1 where l v i and l v k are trophic levels of the trophic groups i and k assuming k is predated by i respectively p i is the total feeding amount of i on its food sources and p k i is the feeding amount of i on k trophic levels of primary producers and pom were assigned with 1 the maximal trophic level in a food web is also termed as the functional food chain length and describes the complexity of the food web with respect to both structure and function of the system sabo et al 2009 2 4 3 food web stability estimation and key trophic group identification stability of the food web for a biotope was estimated by using the modulus of the most negative eigenvalue λ m i n of the jacobian matrix may 1973 the element of the jacobian matrix is defined as 12 α i j d b i d t b j where α i j describes the per capita effect of the biomass on one another under equilibrium conditions the λ m i n was derived from 1000 iterations to yield the average a larger λ m i n represents a stronger persistence of the food web in the face of minor disturbances under equilibrium conditions thus indicating a higher stability of the system the sensitivity of λ m i n to each trophic group for a biotope was further tested by setting the biomass of each trophic group proportionally varying from 0 to 200 stepped by 10 trophic groups resulting in dramatic variations in λ m i n were identified as the key trophic groups for a biotope the importance of trophic group in a biotope was measured by the modulus of λ m i n s change as the group s proportional biomass increased from 0 to 200 spearman correlation analyses were applied to explore the relationships between the trophic importance and the trophic level biomass average body size abundance of trophic groups 3 results 3 1 environmental and biotic characteristics of biotopes a total of 122 195 macroinvertebrate specimens were collected from the qr belonging to 33 families and 61 genera arthropoda was the most predominant group 54 genera followed by mollusca 3 genera annelida 3 genera and platyhelminthes 1 genus results of hierarchical clustering fig 2 a identified four types of biotopes for the qr based on the macroinvertebrate dissimilarity measured by bray curtis distance bray and curtis 1957 samples from the main channel 22 samples and abandoned channel 27 samples were clustered into two groups showing a dramatic macroinvertebrate dissimilarity up to 5 scaled by the hierarchical clustering these two groups were further clustered into four biotopes at the dissimilarity around 2 to be specific samples from the main channel were clustered into biotopes 1 b1 8 samples and 2 b2 14 samples and samples from the abandoned channel were clustered into biotopes 3 b3 15 samples and 4 b4 12 samples results of nmds fig 2b clearly discriminated the distributions of samples of the four biotopes in the 2 d gradients samples from the main channel were generally located on negative space of axis 1 while samples from b3 located on median or positive parts and b4 samples were even more positive axis 2 discriminated samples from b1 and b2 within the main channel group samples from b1 were located on negative parts of axis 2 while those from b2 were mostly on the positive parts comparisons on values of environmental variables and biotic indices among the four biotopes are listed in table 1 significant differences in environmental conditions including physicochemical and trophic conditions were detected among biotopes samples from the main channel exhibited a higher hydrodynamic condition v 0 69 0

primary production 91 033 49 876 g m2 meanwhile the do in main channel samples were generally higher 7 56 0 88 mg l compared with those in abandoned channel samples 6 94 2 02 mg l although b2 exhibited slightly lower do 7 04 0 59 mg l than b4 7 21 1 99 mg l significant lower t was found in b1 7 56 0 88 c compared with three other biotopes 14 14 7 45 c macroinvertebrate assemblage characteristics including biodiversity morphological and functional structures and tolerance were also found different among biotopes the main channel samples were overwhelmingly dominated by aquatic insects relative abundance ra 82 13 especially by ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera ept taxa ra 60 24 by contrast the abandoned channel samples were occupied by both insects ra 45 32 and oligochaetes ra 25 28 and chironomids rather than ept taxa dominated in insects ra 40 32 besides hilsenhoff biotic indices for samples of the main channel 4 34 1 00 were lower than those of the abandoned channel 6 40 1 07 notably variation patterns of richness abundance and biomass among biotopes were found fairly different to be specific richness for biotopes were comparable except for a significant decrease in b3 b3 4 7 1 3 three others 8 9 2 5 abandoned channel samples 4073 4666 ind m2 were dramatically higher in abundance than main channel samples 283 257 ind m2 with b4 possessing the significantly highest abundance among all 7752 4550 ind m2 as for biomass b4 was the highest 19 836 26 963 g m2 followed by b2 and b3 comparable 1 312 2 014 g m2 while b1 was the lowest 0 192 0 130 g m2 the compositional differences of macroinvertebrates among biotopes tested by anosim also showed that the mean ranked distance among biotopes 671 3 was markedly higher than that within biotopes 335 6 indicating a significantly different composition of macroinvertebrates among the four biotopes p 0 0001 3 2 food web structure and biomass flux of biotopes predation matrices predicted by the adbm for the four biotopes are shown in fig 3 comparisons on food web structures among biotopes are listed in table 2 b4 was found with the highest trophic group richness 19 followed by b1 and b2 both were 18 and b3 16 despite of the lowest richness in entire trophic groups b3 was occupied by relatively higher proportions of predators 31 compared with the three others b1 11 b2 28 b4 21 diet breadths i e numbers of prey groups predicted by the adbm of predators in the main channel diet breadth ranges 8 10 for b1 6 8 for b2 were generally larger than those in the abandoned channel 3 5 for b3 1 7 for b4 connectances for b2 0 35 and b3 0 33 were higher than those for b1 and b4 both were 0 25 values of s c describing combined complexities of food webs followed the same variation pattern of the connectance among biotopes biomass storages and fluxes estimated by the energetic food web calculation for the four biotopes are shown in fig 4 comparisons on food web functions among biotopes are listed in table 2 the abandoned channel possessed dramatically higher biomass storage b3 119 14 g m2 b4 278 39 g m2 compared with the main channel b1 1 49 g m2 b2 2 78 g m2 however the biomass transfer efficiency measured by the annual flux storage ratio for the abandoned channel b3 0 05 b4 0 27 was generally lower than that for the main channel b1 0 56 b2 5 40 despite of a markedly lower biomass storage capacity of b2 2 78 g m2 than that of b3 119 14 g m2 the annual biomass flux of b2 15 02 g m2 turned out to be higher than that of b3 5 07 g m2 due to their differences in the biomass transfer efficiency poms generally contributed half around or less b1 30 8 b2 50 6 b3 43 8 b4 31 3 to the total basal biomass storage i e sum of biomass storages of both poms and primary productions by contrast at the primary consumption level biomass flux sourced from poms predominantly accounted for 60 9 97 9 99 9 and 97 0 of the total basal biomass flux i e sum of biomass fluxes from both poms and primary productions for the four biotopes indicating that the majority of biomass within a food web in the qr was derived from detritus 3 3 food web stability and key trophic groups of biotopes comparisons on food web stability as measured by λ m i n among biotopes are listed in table 2 sensitivity of food web to trophic groups for the four biotopes are shown in fig 5 b4 was found to have the highest stability λ m i n 90 followed by b2 5 9 while b1 4 4 10 2 and b3 1 6 10 6 tended to be the least stable in the face of disturbances results of the spearman correlation analysis as illustrated in figure s2 indicated that the importance of trophic group responded well to the trophic level change spearman correlation r 0 70 the biomass r 0 83 and the average body size r 0 92 in b2 and responded well to the biomass r 0 94 and the abundance r 0 79 in b4 by contrast correlations between trophic group importance and other indices were lower in b1 r 0 02 0 57 and particularly b2 r 0 06 0 29 in b1 gammarid was the most important trophic group followed by carnivorous caddisfly stability of food web in b1 slightly decreased λ m i n 4 4 10 2 4 0 10 2 as gammarid s biomass increased from 0 to 90 and dramatically increased λ m i n 4 0 10 2 9 5 10 2 from 90 to 200 of the biomass as for carnivorous caddisfly the food web stability gradually increased λ m i n 2 1 10 2 5 2 10 2 as its biomass increased from 0 to 200 in addition a dramatic increase of stability was observed λ m i n 1 9 10 2 4 9 10 2 as the biomass of carnivorous tipulid increased from 0 to 50 but began to decrease gradually λ m i n 4 9 10 2 3 9 10 2 afterwards in b2 two predacious trophic groups carnivorous caddisfly and carnivorous stonefly were the most important so that the stability increased λ m i n 2 9 9 3 for carnivorous caddisfly 3 2 7 6 for carnivorous stonefly along with the increase of their biomasses for gammarid similar stability variation pattern to that in b1 was observed as firstly decreased λ m i n 7 4 4 7 then increased λ m i n 4 7 7 5 and the lowest stability was reached at 10 biomass in b3 gammarid predominantly influenced the stability of food web in a negative way as stability dramatically decreased λ m i n 1 2 10 4 2 3 10 6 as gammarid s biomass increased in b4 carnivorous stinkbug and mussel were found to be the most important trophic groups and positively influenced the stability of food web λ m i n 56 7 125 0 for carnivorous stinkbug 68 5 114 0 for mussel as their biomasses increased gammarid in b4 influenced the stability in a similar pattern to that in b1 and b2 stability decreased λ m i n 135 0 78 8 as gammarid biomass increased from 0 to 40 and then increased λ m i n 78 8 122 0 afterwards 4 discussion 4 1 abiotic and biotic differences among biotopes in the quanji river the hierarchical clustering successfully distinguished the samples from the abandoned channel as well as from the main river channel indicating the consistence in the results derived from the manual classification based on river geomorphology and the statistical clustering technique we used for macroinvertebrate assemblages additionally hierarchical clustering performed more delicate classifications on biotopes beyond morphological conditions i e samples collected from the main river were further clustered into b1 and b2 and samples from abandoned channels were clustered into b3 and b4 in general b1 b2 and b3 b4 represented as the typical lotic and lentic biotopes in the qr floodplain ecosystem in the qtp figure s1 abiotic and biotic differences between lotic and lentic biotopes regardless in highland or lowland rivers that were also commonly reported by previous studies e g amoros and bornette 2002 zhou et al 2019b for instance hydrodynamic conditions represented by average flow velocity was found to be significantly different between b1 b2 0 69 0 37 m s and b3 b4 0 13 0 22 m s table 1 trophic conditions represented by biomasses of primary productions pp and particulate organic matters pom were found to be significantly lower in b1 b2 pp 1 028 0 581 g m2 pom 0 464 0 120 g m2 than those in b3 b4 pp 91 033 49 876 g m2 pom 82 292 71 998 g m2 table 1 differences in the hydrodynamic and trophic conditions between b1 b2 and b3 b4 indicate a greater contribution of the abandoned river channel to the productivity of the whole river floodplain system in the qtp tockner et al 1999 in terms of biotic characteristics b3 b4 possessed more individuals of macroinvertebrates 4073 4666 ind m2 than b1 b2 did 283 257 ind m2 possibly due to the nutrient enrichment in b3 b4 macroinvertebrates in b1 b2 were primarily composed by ept taxa ra 0 60 0 24 while those in b3 b4 were mainly non insects ra 0 54 0 31 the enrichment of pom in b3 b4 resulted in the dominance of gathering collectors relative biomass rb 0 83 0 22 compared with that of b1 b2 rb 0 56 0 31 hilsenhoff biotic indices for b3 b4 6 40 1 07 were also significantly higher than those for b1 b2 4 33 1 00 indicating that more tolerant taxa made the abandoned channel as their feeding and reproductive habitat however we did not observe obvious pollutants in the abandoned channel and thus attributed the increase of hilsenhoff biotic index associated with lentic taxa such as oligochaetes invertebrate groups such as oligochaetes are usually assigned with high tolerance values although they could also reside in qualified environment with relatively less or no inputs of pollutants extence and ferguson 1989 the water temperature plays an important role in discriminating the main river channel biotopes b1 and b2 in our study the average water temperatures t measured in b1 5 30 1 39 c were significantly lower than those in b2 12 50 4 36 c indicating the differences in the thermal conditions of the main channel by contrast the water temperature for b2 b3 and b4 were similar 12 19 3 70 c such changes may have resulted in differences in biotic indices between b1 and b2 reflecting the discriminated functioning of macroinvertebrates in the main channel of qr to be specific the macroinvertebrates biomass in b2 were around 6 times higher than in b1 with a proportionate increase in biomass of gathering collectors indicating excellent ecosystem functioning some disproportionate changes in functional groups were also observed including the biomasses of predators b1 b2 1 16 shredders b1 b2 1 21 and scrappers b1 b2 3 1 these functional attributes as also pointed out by friberg et al 2009 give complementary information about the response of river ecosystems to the temperature in the high altitude environment our results suggest that the lateral hydrological connectivity in the qr system was a prime factor to mobilize energy sources of macroinvertebrates difference in lateral hydrological connectivity of the abandoned channel from that of the main river and other adjacent channels are usually measured by the intensity of hydrodynamic conditions as well as the quantity of organic retentions larsen et al 2012 in our study higher v 0 18 0 24 m s and lower biomass of pom 49 961 24 467 g m2 were found in b3 compared with those in b4 v 0 07 0 19 m s pom 130 788 92 395 g m2 indicating that b3 possessed higher connectivity than b4 these results are consistent with our field observations that most of the b3 samples were collected from open channels with obvious connections to the main river channel while b4 samples were collected from semi open or closed channels as the lateral hydrological connectivity decreased from b2 main river channel to b3 open channel to b4 semi open closed channel biomass of primary productions increased since most alga and macrophytes may have preferred to select the habitats of reduced hydrodynamic conditions with lower velocity lower turbidity and higher nutrients retention ward et al 1999 notably the macroinvertebrate diversity as measured by taxa richness and shannon wiener index showed a single valley response pattern to the decreased connectivity line 2 in fig 6 i e the diversity reached the lowest in b3 and they were comparatively higher in both b2 and b4 although assemblage compositions were found to have dramatically shifted e g the dominating insects shifted from ept taxa in b2 to chironomids in b4 similar results of the single valley response to the hydrological connectivity were also observed in macroinvertebrate assemblages in upper reaches of the yellow river in the northeastern qtp zhou et al 2019b hou 2021 4 2 trophic distinctions among biotopes in the quanji river the patterns of trophic variations among biotopes as characterized by food web structural and functional indices were found to be mostly predictable to especially lateral hydrological connectivity to be specific the trophic group richness and the maximal trophic level representing the trophic diversity and complexity respectively responded to the connectivity in a similar way just as the biodiversity did i e they first decreased and then increased as the main river b2 transformed into an open abandoned channel b3 and finally into the closed channel b4 by contrast the connectance as another metric apart from the maximal trophic level to describe the complexity of the food web structure revealed high values in both high diversity main river and low diversity open channel situations table 2 low trophic diversity associated with the loss of rare taxa can lead to a simplification of the food web structure with more interactions per species as a result the open abandoned channel can yield greater connectance than the closed channel did start et al 2020 additionally inconsistent response patterns to the connectivity were observed between the biomass storage and flux the biomass storage of the biotope negatively responded to the connectivity because the alga and macrophypes as major primary producer components contributing to the biomass storage significantly deteriorated as the connectivity increased this result is consistent with the observations of both lowland and highland rivers that channel abandonment usually leads to an enrichment of productivity e g tockner et al 1999 hein et al 2003 wang et al 2020 as for the annual biomass flux it responded to the connectivity in a similar single valley pattern as the trophic group richness and the maximal trophic level did the inconsistency in response pattern of biomass storage and flux could be attributed to variations in trophic transfer efficiencies as represented by the flux storage ratio between the abandoned channel and the main river although the flux storage ratio also followed a single valley response pattern to the connectivity and slightly increased as the abandoned channel lost its connection to the main river b3 0 05 b4 0 27 it was still significantly lower than that in the main river b2 5 40 this result suggests that in oligotrophic highland rivers xu et al 2018 productivities will be utilized as fully as possible by primary consumers whereas in abandoned channels productivity utilization may not match with the enrichment consequently resulting in a trophic accumulation in our study the trophic stability as represented by λ m i n is shown to have a single valley response pattern to the lateral hydrological connectivity and a positive response pattern to the water temperature by contrast the squared root product of trophic group richness and connectance s c as an alternative to describe the stability recommended by gardner and ashby 1970 and may 1973 were unpredictable to either connectivity or temperature variations as we attributed this result to the variability of connectance in response to a regular disturbance start et al 2020 in addition values of λ m i n indicated the extreme trophic instability in b1 and b3 table 2 once disturbed these biotopes were likely to collapse followed by new successions rather than to recover to their original status doretto et al 2020 our results suggest that the biomass proportion and trophic level are two critical factors determining the role that a trophic group plays for the stability which is consistent with the general understanding that biomass and top down bottom up controls beget the food web stability leigh 1965 aoki and mizushima 2001 wollrab et al 2012 in the qr the gammarids were the most dominant group in b1 b3 and b4 accounting for 26 8 78 2 and 68 0 of the total biomass respectively and were fourth dominant group in b2 accounting for 17 5 of the total biomass previous studies found that the stable assemblages of macroinvertebrates were generally dominated by the most common taxa while those unstable ones were dominated by rare taxa death and zimmermann 2005 however in our study the gammarids were found to be one of the most important groups for the stabilities of all biotopes regardless of the trophic stability to be specific in b1 b2 and b4 trophic stabilities would first decrease then increase as the biomass of gammarids kept increasing while in b3 increased gammarid population led to a rapid decline in stability in addition the threshold of gammarids biomass for the lowest stability were found to be dramatically different among b1 b2 and b4 for instance the threshold biomass of gammarids in b1 91 was much higher than those in b2 and b4 16 and 38 respectively suggesting that unlike lowland river system the high altitude river system could be more fragile in the context of ecological stability similarly the negative influence of biomass increase before threshold on the trophic stability was also found relatively milder in b1 decreasing rate 0 12 than those in b2 and b4 decreasing rate 2 08 and 1 05 respectively indicating the variability in the high altitude river biotopes that may influence their fragility in stability further in addition a top down effect on the trophic stability of biotopes was observed in the qr especially in b1 b2 and b4 the trophic stability was found to be more sensitive to biomass variations of the predators high trophic level compared with the preys low trophic level with comparable biomass fig 5 to be specific the carnivorous caddisflies dramatically improved the stabilities of main river biotopes b1 and b2 as their biomass increased and their critical positions in b4 were replaced by the carnivorous stinkbugs by contrast the top down effect on b3 was not obvious since most of predators disappeared in the semi open abandoned channel the variations in the trophic interactions among different biotopes in the qr would clearly indicate their increased fragility particularly when the river system functioning is weakened by predator prey interactions kattel et al 2016 notably however there were some exceptions that trophic groups e g mussels in b4 with neither largest biomass nor highest trophic level would still control the trophic stability of the biotope and suggest increased usefulness in the conservation of certain biota such as mussels in the qr system 4 3 effects of lateral hydrological connectivity variations on highland river trophy the lateral hydrological connectivity is one of the most important factors determine the trophy of a river floodplain system amoros and bornette 2002 previous studies focusing on lowland rivers e g the amazon the rhine the danube and the yangtze rivers all reported similar results that the macroinvertebrate diversity followed a unimodal pattern in response to the connectivity variation line 1 in fig 6 i e the macroinvertebrate richness peaked in an intermediate connectivity e g tockner et al 1999 paillex et al 2007 obolewski 2011 as a result reconnection to the main river was recommended as the prior strategy to restore a lowland water body which have usually gained expected achievements e g paillex et al 2009 obolewski and glińska lewczuk 2011 kattel et al 2016 this response pattern fits well within the framework of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis connell 1978 worm and duffy 2003 generally the disturbance caused by high connectivity inhibited macroinvertebrates while at a low connectivity macroinvertebrate assemblages tended to be dominated only by a few taxa roxburgh et al 2004 both extremes high and low connectivity may result in a decline in the diversity of macroinvertebrates in contrast an intermediate connectivity provides suitable niches for most macroinvertebrates resulting in the highest diversity however an entirely opposite single valley pattern was observed in the highland rivers including the qr in this study line 2 in fig 6 as well as the upper reaches of the yellow river zhou et al 2019b hou 2021 we think the intermediate disturbance hypothesis may still work in highland rivers but in terms of macroinvertebrates in high altitudes the intermediate disturbance is likely to occur in the low connectivity semi open closed channels rather than median connectivity open channels we attribute this skewness to the effects brought by the resilience decline of macroinvertebrates the stream size variation and the endemic fish predation as elaborated below for highland rivers with greater variations in the hydrological connectivity e g the qr in this study and the bai river zhou et al 2019b macroinvertebrates are found to be increasingly vulnerable to frequent hydrodynamic disturbances conditions of low temperature and intensive radiation can cause a hypometabolism which further results in a much weaker resilience of macroinvertebrates in these highland rivers compared with those in the lowland rivers asmamaw et al 2021 therefore macroinvertebrate assemblages in these highland rivers usually tend to take a longer time to recover once they are exposed to disturbances asmamaw et al 2021 for instance macroinvertebrates in lowland rivers take about a month around to regroup their assemblages after the flood event 200 m a s l snyder and johnson 2006 while those in higher altitude rivers 1000 m a s l can take about three months or even longer to get recovered doretto et al 2020 indicating increased exposure to vulnerability related to flood and radiation effects in our study we estimated the occurrence of the average 2 5 1 4 and 0 1 flood events in august september and october which means that flood disturbances in august and september would delay macroinvertebrates recovery in the qr further exposing the assemblages till to the winter in addition unlike lowland large rivers with the order of 7 8 these highland rivers around the source of the yellow river with small number with 3 4 orders are frequently exposed to intense flood events as the flood capacity of channel increases with the increasing number of stream orders ogawa and male 1986 small sized channels are more likely to suffer from the intensity of high peak and frequent flood disturbances in the qr macroinvertebrates in both open channels b3 and semi open closed channels b4 dominated by lentic taxa would have been significantly affected by intense flood events we argue that the b3 with intermediate connectivity to the main river would have been frequently disturbed by extreme hydrodynamic conditions which consequently led to lower diversity of macroinvertebrates table 1 macroinvertebrates in the open channel of the qr are also exposed to a higher risk of being foraged by fishes in the river floodplain system fishes usually derive most of their energy from the productivity associated with the floodplain system rather than the main river channel dettmers et al 2001 indicating that the channel with high connectivity to the main river are ideal highway service area for the native migratory cyprinid g przewalskii c zhang et al 2022 during april to august as both of previous documentations and our gut content analysis showed g przewalskii collected in the qr had typical predation preference for macroinvertebrates especially gammarids and chironomids chen 2011 the absence of gravels and the limited lushness of macrophyte community in the open channel results in a loss of refuge for macroinvertebrates from predation further leading to a decrease in macroinvertebrate diversity by contrast macroinvertebrates in the closed channel are exposed to a lower risk of being foraged by g przewalskii due to the little migratory access to the fish leading to a higher diversity 5 conclusions our study on macroinvertebrates and food webs in different biotopes of the qr in the qtp has contributed significantly to our understanding of highland riverine response to variations in the hydrological connectivity we found that the individual biotopes in the qr responded differently to the hydrological connectivity the biotopes 1 and 2 in the main river channel represented the higher connectivity the biotope 3 in the open channel represented the median connectivity while the biotope 4 in the semi open closed channel represented the low connectivity one of the most intriguing results of our study is that biological and trophic indices including the taxa richness trophic group richness biomass flux transfer efficiency and trophic stability in the qr all demonstrated a single valley response pattern to the hydrological connectivity which contrasts with the unimodal pattern commonly observed in lowland rivers we conclude by arguing that this result is attributed to a skewness of intermediate disturbance from the median to low hydrological connectivity due to lower resistance and resilience of highland macroinvertebrates in the face of hydrodynamic disturbances brought by flood events and the biological disturbances such as predation by the endemic migratory fish this study not only reveals critical roles of lateral migration and channel abandonment accompanied by hydrological connectivity variation in structuring highland river ecosystems in the context of biological and energetic perspectives but also suggests that the management strategies of highland river should be different from those of lowland rivers data availability data will be made available on request the macroinvertebrate records for the 49 sampling

15179,the reclamation of wetlands and its subsequent conversion to aquaculture may alter regional nutrient im mobilization and cycling although direct assessments of phosphorus p cycling and its budget balance following wetland conversion are currently scarce here parallel field experiments were conducted to investigate and compare the availability and mobilization mechanisms of p from natural coastal wetlands and the adjacent converted aquaculture ponds based on high resolution diffusive gradient in thin films dgt and dialysis hr peeper techniques and the dgt induced fluxes in sediments difs model the study found that the conversion of wetland to pond strongly reduced the sediment p pool by changing its forms and distribution high resolution data showed that concentrations of labile p and soluble reactive p across the sediment water profiles were markedly enhanced by the converted aquaculture pond although they exhibited large spatiotemporal heterogeneity moreover the synchronous distribution of labile p iron fe and sulfur s across profiles in coastal wetlands indicated that the dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxide phosphate complexes coupled with sulfate reduction were the main mechanisms regulating sediment p mobilization in coastal areas however the converted aquaculture pond weakened or even reversed this dependence by decoupling the fe s p reactions by changing the sediment structure and nutrient balance substantial increases in labile p fe and s fluxes in the pond suggested the conversion of wetland to aquaculture facilitated the internal release of p fe and s from sediment into water the high resupply parameter r and desorption rate k 1 combined with low response time t c in the pond as fitted by difs model indicated the strong resupply capacity and fast kinetic exchange of sediment p across the sediment water interface which is consistent with the high p diffusion fluxes recorded in the pond it was concluded that converted aquaculture ponds act as an important source of p release in coastal areas potentially exacerbating water quality degradation and eutrophication specific initiatives and actions are therefore urgently needed to alleviate the internal p loading during aquaculture graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords internal p loading resupply kinetics land use change aquaculture pond coastal wetland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus p is widely recognized as a critical regulator of eutrophication through internal and or external p loading jarvie et al 2020 as a typical sedimentary nutrient p usually exists in nature in insoluble forms through adsorption and precipitation by minerals such as iron fe and aluminum al oxides hou et al 2020 ringeval et al 2017 consequently only organic p op and iron bound p fe p are involved in the regeneration and remobilization of p through the decomposition of organic matter and the reduction of fe oxides rozan et al 2002 coastal wetlands as key environmental buffer zones between land and sea are important p sources sinks and converters morrissey et al 2014 roy et al 2017 in coastal systems huge amounts of terrestrial p are buried in sediments due to high productivity induced residue return and anthropogenic nutrient enrichment hong et al 2010 this previously sequestered and stored p tends to be remobilized from the sediment into the overlying water through reductive dissolution of feooh phosphate complexes such as vivianite 424feooh ch2o 106 nh3 16 h3po4 756h 106hco3 16nh4 424fe2 hpo4 2 636h2o furthermore high sulfate so4 2 concentrations in coastal wetlands are generally accompanied by strong so4 2 reduction and the generated sulfide promotes the decoupling of fe p through co precipitation as solid monosulfide fes and pyrite fes2 in anoxic environments h2s fe oh 2 po4 fes po4 3 h2s fe3 po4 2 fes po4 3 maynard et al 2011 rozan et al 2002 consequently the coupling decoupling process of the fe fe2 s s2 p po4 3 interactions was predominately responsible for the equilibrium of p precipitation or release in coastal areas hu et al 2021 understanding fe s p interactions and their responses to different wetland environments is important for the effective management of coastal wetlands to mitigate high p loads caused by anthropogenic and natural disturbances due to space and resource limitations more than half of the world s coastal wetlands have degraded or disappeared through conversion to intensive agricultural and aquacultural land barbier et al 2011 huang et al 2010 schuerch et al 2018 for example the aquacultural area of china the world s largest aquaculture producer has increased from 2305 km2 in 1985 to 4431 km2 in 2015 this was accompanied by a decrease in coastal wetland area from 10 262 km2 to 7296 km2 wang et al 2021 wetland reclamation and subsequent aquaculture provide sufficient protein and economic returns for human beings but they also seriously disturb the regional p cycle and balance first wetland reclamation drainage and excavation may directly alter p pools and forms by disrupting sediment structure vegetation and hydrological dynamics han et al 2014 then during high density aquaculture intensive organic material from the application of feed and fertilization is imported and precipitated in the closed ponds with the potential for promoting the accumulation and remobilization of p in the sediment and causing deterioration in water quality sarà 2007 yang et al 2021 for instance shimoda et al 2005 observed that only 11 15 of the feed input of p was taken up by shrimp bodies and the majority of the p was retained in sediment and water although p is relatively slow to move and transform through natural systems global change and human activities have greatly altered p cycling by facilitating its release from the soil sediment to ecosystems yuan et al 2018 therefore a systematic study and comparison of p release mechanisms and environmental drivers in natural wetland and converted aquaculture pond are crucial for better understanding of the role of coastal wetlands in global and regional p cycling and budget balance assessments land use and cover changes lucc such as the conversion of natural ecosystems to intensively managed agriculture are the predominant global changes driven by increasing demand for food malik et al 2018 maranguit et al 2017 numerous field measurements have demonstrated that lucc dramatically alter abiotic and biotic properties affecting p pools and stability but these studies have mainly concentrated on terrestrial ecosystems from forest to agriculture maharjan et al 2018 moghimian et al 2017 for instance in the brazilian amazon 15 years after the conversion of forest to pasture the total p of pasture reached the level of forest soil but this land use conversion reduced the contribution of different p pools to anion exchange resin p soltangheisi et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 found that the conversion of native vegetation to agriculture in subtropical australia significantly reduced soil organic p and phosphatase activities while these adverse changes could be halted through subsequent land restoration in natural coastal wetlands plant uptake and residue return play key roles in sediment p cycling hu et al 2020 ponds made in converted wetland not only remove native vegetation but also change the substrate availability and hydrologic conditions from free flowing to lentic waters yang et al 2022 which may alter sediment p accumulation and release mechanisms by modifying sediment physicochemical properties to the best of our knowledge no direct field assessment of p release mechanisms and resupply kinetics following wetland conversion has yet been carried out which increases the uncertainty in estimating the effects of aquacultural use on regional p cycling and balance with increasing population density and demand for protein rich seafood about 30 of natural coastal wetlands in the min river estuary in southeastern china have been reclaimed for aquaculture over the past few decades gao et al 2019 yang et al 2022 previous investigations have documented that aquaculture on converted coastal wetlands greatly increases methane emissions yang et al 2022 and alters nitrate dissimilatory reduction processes gao et al 2019 however little attention has been paid to p cycling and mobilization in recent years in situ passive sampling techniques such as diffusive gradient in thin films dgt and high resolution dialysis hr peeper have been well developed in combination to identify the distribution and release mechanisms of target elements in sediment water profiles norgbey et al 2020 pan et al 2020 these measurement techniques are based on fick s first law and are characterized by high spatial resolution short equilibration times and small analytical errors davison and zhang 2012 menezes blackburn et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 using high resolution in situ detection methods to study p release from sediment to water and identify underlying mechanisms and kinetic exchanges after wetland conversion to aquaculture will fill this current research gap on the impact of aquaculture activities on p cycling and mobilization and its environmental implications in this study field measurements of the availability and mobilization mechanisms of p were simultaneously taken during the growing season from the natural coastal wetlands and the adjacent converted aquaculture ponds based on high resolution dgt hr peeper techniques and the dgt induced fluxes in sediments difs model the specific objectives were to i obtain insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics and biogeochemical couplings of labile soluble p fe and s at the sediment water interface swi following wetland conversion to aquaculture ii elucidate the release mechanisms and resupply kinetics of p following wetland conversion and iii estimate the effects of such conversion on sediment p source and sink functions and their environmental implications we hypothesized that coastal wetland conversion to aquaculture would alter the release mechanisms and kinetic exchange of p at the swi by decoupling the fe s p interactions which would enhance p resupply capacity consequently aggravating p release and internal loading from sediment to water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site min river estuarine wetland 26 01 08 26 03 39 n 119 36 28 119 41 15 e located in the min river estuary in fuzhou city fujian province southeast china has a subtropical monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature mat of 19 6 c and precipitation map of 1350 mm due to the combined influence of runoff and tides natural coastal wetlands generally belong to brackish wetlands with fluctuating salinity averaging 4 2 ppt wetland plants are dominated by herbaceous phragmites australis and cyperus malaccensis with their growing season and senescence generally beginning in may and october respectively in this study field experiments were carried out in two areas of the min river estuary with eight plots covering the natural coastal c malaccensis wetlands and the adjacent converted aquaculture ponds fig s1 sediment water physicochemical parameters are presented in the supporting information fig s2 the selected aquaculture pond was filled with surrounding estuarine water to a depth of 1 1 1 7 m and no water was exchanged during the culture period from june to november the pond was used for shrimp cultivation litopenaeus vannamei with a density of about 35 50 individuals per m2 the shrimp were fed with artificial feed pellets containing 42 crude protein 16 crude ash 12 water 2 lysine and 1 total p among other materials twice per day daily feeding rates were kept at approximately 10 16 50 55 and 40 45 kg ha 1 d 1 in the early middle and late stages respectively yang et al 2022 2019 2020 the specific feed dosage is adjusted timely according to the growth and ingestion conditions of shrimp with consideration of aquaculture practices and shrimp size we artificially divided the culture period into early june to august and late september to november stages to distinguish the effects of aquaculture during the nonculture period after shrimp harvest ponds are usually drained and dredged to discharge aquaculture sewage accelerating aerobic decomposition of organic matter in surface sediments more details about min river estuarine wetland and aquaculture management practices can be found in previous studies hu et al 2022 yang et al 2022 2 2 deployment and analysis of dgt and hr peeper the field experiments were performed once a month during the culture period from mid june to mid november in 2021 this was a normal year the temperature precipitation and other environmental background are consistent with other years it was a very representative year from the climatic point of view of the studied site for example the study year had a mat of 18 7 c in the range of the annual average of the area and map was 1402 mm also in the range of mean average of the studied area flat double sided zr oxide zrochelex agi ca dgt 150 20 mm and hr peeper 200 40 mm probes were used in situ to determine the concentrations of labile p fe fe2 and s s2 the novel zr oxide zroca mixed binding gel in dgt can synchronously obtain images of oxyanions p and s and dissolved fe concentration at high spatial resolution which is helpful to visually observe fe s p coupling in sediment water profiles hr peeper based on chemical equilibration theory and consisting of 36 equally spaced chambers prefilled with 400 μl deionized water was used to investigate the variations of soluble reactive p srp measured as po4 3 and soluble fe in porewater all dgt and hr peeper probes were deoxygenated before deployment both probes were installed snugly and then deployed at both sites with 2 3 cm extending above the swi the dgt and hr peeper probes were retrieved after use for 24 h and 48 h respectively then cleaned and transferred to the laboratory for dgt samples the two dimensional 2d distributions of labile p and s concentrations were analyzed using the coloration technique combined with computer imaging densitometry briefly the probes were colored using molybdenum blue and scanned then the imagej software was used to convert the scanned images to grayscale intensity next the concentration of labile fe was determined using 1 0 m hno3 after slicing the zroca gels at 2 mm intervals ding et al 2016 for hr peeper samples the solution was extracted and then the concentrations of labile soluble p and fe were measured by the molybdenum blue and phenanthroline colorimetric methods respectively 2 3 sediment water sampling and analysis the surface sediments were sampled monthly using a cylindrical soil auger after the dgt was deployed three replicates were randomly selected and mixed as one sample in each plot in the laboratory the samples were air dried and sieved for the analysis of sediment p forms and physicochemical properties overlying water was collected simultaneously in each plot sediment ph

total fe tfe and ferrous fe fe2 were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry after electrothermal vaporization and the potassium dichromate volumetric method respectively sediment p

oxygen do concentration of the overlying water were determined using a salinometer oakton instruments springfield usa a multiparameter probe us 550a ysi detector and ion chromatography dionex sunnyvale usa respectively 2 4 data processing and statistics analysis 2 4 1 dgt concentration and apparent flux the concentrations of labile p fe and s in the dgt samples c dgt mg l 1 were estimated

differences in the sediment p forms and physicochemical parameters between the wetland and pond were examined using paired samples t tests regression analysis was conducted to examine the linear relationships between the labile p and fe s after natural log transformation all statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics 25 spss inc chicago usa unless otherwise stated 3 results 3 1 sediment phosphorus forms over the whole experimental cycle the concentration of sediment tp was slightly higher in the coastal wetland 356 3 556 0 mg kg 1 than in the aquaculture pond 348 1 464 3 mg kg 1 p 0 05 fig 1 lower ip concentrations were observed in the pond than in coastal wetland while op concentrations significantly increased following the wetland conversion to pond p 0 01 moreover both naoh p and hcl p concentrations in the wetland were significantly higher than the concentrations obtained from the pond during the experimental period p 0 001 overall the conversion of wetland to aquaculture pond strongly reduced the sediment p pool and stability by changing the p forms and distribution 3 2 2d distribution of dgt labile p and s the conversion of coastal wetland to aquaculture significantly increased labile p and s concentrations over the whole experimental cycle fig 2 more specifically the concentrations of labile p across the sediment water profiles ranged from 0 003 to 0 127 mg l 1 in both wetland and pond and increased by 700 following the conversion of wetland mean 0 010 mg l 1 to pond mean 0 083 mg l 1 p 0 01 mean labile s concentrations across the profiles markedly increased from 0 034 mg l 1 0 007 0 072 mg l 1 in wetland to 0 133 mg l 1 0 051 0 258 mg l 1 in the pond the 2d distribution of labile p and s in the sediment water profile showed great heterogeneity in general the concentrations of labile p and s in the coastal wetland were higher in sediment than in overlying water however the dynamics of labile p and s concentrations in the pond had a temporal pattern for example the p concentration in the overlying water was higher than that in the sediment from july to september fig 2h j but the opposite was true from october to november fig 2k l the monthly pattern of labile p and s concentrations increased with the advance in growing or culture period with higher concentrations occurring in the late stage than in the early stage at both sites moreover there were some hotspots of labile p and s with extremely high concentrations in the wetland which may be mainly regulated by the distribution of plant roots and redox processes 3 3 profile distributions of labile p fe and s and their relationships over the whole experimental cycle labile fe concentrations in both sites were higher in sediment than in overlying water and the conversion of wetland to pond significantly increased fe concentrations by 540 fig 3 in the coastal wetland low labile fe concentration was observed during the early stage this remained relatively stable before gradually increasing from august and fluctuating with depth for the pond labile fe concentrations increased steadily with time with the highest value in november mean 16 971 mg l 1 vertically concentrations of labile p and s fluctuated with depth in the coastal wetland accompanied by many distinct peaks or increments for example several concentrated spots of labile p appeared in the coastal wetland at 30 mm 50 mm and 65 mm depths in october which increased the mean p concentration by 100 200 fig 3e in the pond however different monthly variations of labile p and s concentrations were observed these showed an initial sharp increase from the overlying water to 30 mm and later decreased in may october and november while there was no obvious pattern in other months additionally during the whole experimental cycle labile p concentration showed a synchronous trend with labile fe and s in the coastal wetland except in august while the converted aquaculture pond weakened or even reversed this dependence fig s3 for example labile p concentration was strongly positively related to labile fe and s in the wetland in july while it was negative in the pond 3 4 srp and soluble fe by hr peeper in general srp and soluble fe concentrations from the pond were significantly higher than those from the wetland over the whole experimental cycle fig 4 in particular monthly mean srp and fe concentrations across the sediment water profiles increased from 0 069 mg l 1 0 018 0 191 mg l 1 and 0 288 mg l 1 0 056 0 666 mg l 1 in the wetland to 1 209 mg l 1 0 255 4 669 mg l 1 and 2 253 mg l 1 0 920 4 357 mg l 1 in the pond respectively srp concentrations had a monthly pattern similar to that of soluble fe across both types although both exhibited fluctuating and irregular changes for example the concentrations of srp and fe in the pond showed rapid increases from overlying water to swi in july and then fluctuated with depth fig 4h in addition srp and soluble fe concentrations showed obvious temporal dynamics for example the highest and lowest p concentrations in both sites were found in august and november respectively 3 5 diffusion fluxes of p fe and s following conversion there were clear positive diffusion fluxes of p fe and s in the pond release from sediment to water which were significantly greater than those from the wetland fig 5 specifically the mean fluxes of p fe and s across the swi increased from 0 015 0 836 and 0 249 ng cm 2 d 1 in wetland to 0 160 25 229 and 2 327 ng cm 2 d 1 in pond respectively over the whole experimental cycle monthly p fluxes decreased dramatically with time while fe and s fluxes first decreased and were then followed by high fluxes in the pond in the wetland however low p fe and s fluxes were observed and these were accompanied by an irregular pattern of monthly variation during the growing season in addition some negative p fluxes were also observed in the wetland such as in august and november when the sediments adsorbed p from the water and may have acted as a reservoir for p 3 6 resupply dynamics of p by the difs model the difs model was used to simulate the diffusion dynamics of labile p across the swi table 1 the resupply parameter r was generally higher in the pond 0 874 than in the wetland 0 295 and was higher in the late stage september to november than in the early stage june to august at both sites the response time of desorption process t c values in the pond were close to those in the wetland and were higher in the early rather than the late stage at both sites higher adsorption k 1 and desorption k 1 rates were recorded in the pond than in the wetland and were higher in the late than in the early culture period moreover the distribution rates k d varied from 82 8 to 3914 8 cm3 g 1 across all samples with the wetland mean 2525 6 cm3 g 1 recording higher values than the pond mean 515 9 cm3 g 1 the fitting curves of r values of p with deployment time in the wetland were significantly different from those in the pond fig 6 in the wetland the fitted curve increased sharply until the peak was reached at approximately 1 0 h and then it declined steadily however for the pond the r curves showed an initial sharp increase and then decreased at the early stage but remained high after peaking in the late stage the high r curves in both the wetland and pond at the late stage indicate that the sediment maintained an intermediate to fast p resupply rate within the dgt deployment time especially in the pond 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of labile p following wetland conversion aquaculture systems are generally enriched with organic substrates from intensive feeding material and nutrient loads which coupled with their relatively enclosed environment facilitates the precipitation and accumulation of p in sediments shimoda et al 2005 surprisingly however the conversion of coastal wetland to aquaculture significantly reduced sediment ip naoh p and hcl p concentrations by 54 33 and 51 respectively fig 1 correspondingly the concentrations of labile p that can be directly taken up and used by plants and microbes across the sediment water profiles increased by 700 following wetland conversion figs 2 3 these findings together indicate that the p imported into the pond is not trapped in sediment but remigrated into the system and the sediment acts as a potential source of p for the surrounding environment several circumstances could account for this trade off after wetland conversion first the ponds tend to have high salinity and so4 2 concentrations because of the lack of freshwater replenishment fig s2 this is accompanied by strong so4 2 reduction and subsequent coprecipitation with fe ii as solid sulfide fes or fesx thereby weakening the fe p bond and accelerating the remobilization of p smolders et al 2017 yuan et al 2021 second the conventional aquacultural practice of dredging during the nonculture period can effectively reduce nutrient enrichment by directly removing surface sediments this was also supported by the low soc concentrations in the pond fig s2 it is well recognized that dredging can effectively improve the oxidation environment at the swi reduce the internal loading and mobility of p and potentially induce the regeneration of labile p from hcl p and op wen et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 moreover external disturbances such as shrimp bioturbation and fishing by humans will destroy the stability of sediments and their interfaces thereby accelerating the mobilization and diffusion of p at the swi liu et al 2016 pan et al 2022 together our findings suggest that converting natural wetlands to intensive aquaculture ponds reduces the sediment inorganic p pool which is accompanied by an increase in the labile p sources potentially implying a high sediment p remobilization and the consequent risk of eutrophication in aquaculture ponds throughout the experimental period mean labile p concentrations observed in the pond 0 083 mg l 1 were generally greater than those previously reported in the hongze lake 0 02 0 06 mg l 1 yao et al 2016 tianbao reservoir 0 02 0 04 mg l 1 norgbey et al 2020 and shijiuhu lake 0 002 0 049 mg l 1 yuan et al 2021 but lower than those in the dongting lake 0 007 0 206 mg l 1 gao et al 2016 taihu lake 0 01 0 35 mg l 1 ding et al 2015 and dianchi lake 0 35 mg l 1 wu and wang 2017 of china these differences may be related to nutrient status hydrological regime conditions and anthropogenic disturbances as well as to site specific factors such as temperature salinity and water depth for example compared with our intensive small aquaculture pond tianbao reservoir is a more natural deep reservoir 10 16 m with less external pollution leading to a low concentration of labile p norgbey et al 2020 while dianchi lake as a severely eutrophic lake is accompanied by strong internal p loading wu and wang 2017 moreover greater srp concentrations were also observed in the study pond 1 209 mg l 1 which were significantly higher than those in taihu lake 0 085 mg l 1 chen et al 2019 and chaohu lake 0 32 mg l 1 yu et al 2019 this further confirms that intensive aquaculture intensifies p dissolution and mobilization especially in subtropical coastal areas with high weathering and salinity it is noteworthy that the concentrations of labile p and srp across the profile showed a consistent trend indicating a high internal p loading potential from sediment into water following aquaculture sediments from wetland and aquatic ecosystems especially those close to the swi are generally highly heterogeneous and play a key role in the storage or release of pollutants norgbey et al 2020 in the present study the concentrations of labile p and srp in both sites exhibited noticeable heterogeneity across the profiles especially in the vegetated wetland for example there are some strong dots and peaks of labile p with extremely high concentrations at depths of around 20 to 80 mm in the wetland in september and october fig 3d e which reflects the high activity and loading of labile p in the intermediate sediment layer plant root distribution and organic matter decomposition may be the main contributors to both peak concentrations and high heterogeneity on the one hand the roots of c malaccensis are mainly distributed in the subsurface layer which promotes the regeneration of p by transporting oxygen and releasing exudates yu et al 2019 on the other hand organic matter decomposes rapidly under high salinity and electron acceptors in coastal areas provide sufficient substrates for the production and mobilization of p particularly under p deficient conditions hu et al 2022 it is worth noting that in natural wetlands the load of organic matter from root litter and exudates mainly occurs along the sediment profile while in aquaculture all organic matter feed and manure accumulates at the surface and is difficult to incorporate in the profile in addition we also observed obvious temporal dynamics of labile p and srp concentrations during the experimental period with higher concentrations occurring in the late stage september to november in both sites figs 2 4 a plausible reason for this is that nutrient removal following pond drainage and dredging during the nonculture period leads to low initial concentrations whereas p concentration increased greatly with the accumulation of intensive organic materials in the sediments during the culture process similarly for natural wetlands the reduced nutrient uptake capacity of plants during the late growing season coupled with the rapid decomposition and return of plant residues promotes the regeneration and release of p 4 2 coupling and potential mobility of fe s p numerous published studies have demonstrated the coupled migration and simultaneous release of labile p fe and s through reduction and dissolution of feooh and so4 2 in aquatic ecosystems han et al 2015 norgbey et al 2020 pan et al 2020 the high so4 2 concentration and subsequent strong sulfate reduction in coastal wetlands due to the proximity of seawater may further enhance the role of so4 2 in the fe s p coupling reactions hu et al 2022 in the present study dgt labile p concentrations in coastal wetland showed a synchronous trend with labile fe and s except in august fig 3 fig s3 which further confirmed that feooh reduction is the primary mechanism of p mobilization and so4 2 reduction may strengthen this pathway in coastal wetland han et al 2015 what is striking and interesting however is that this dependency is weakened or even reversed in the converted aquaculture pond especially from july to september fig s3 several reasons may explain this shift first dredging and insolation directly altered the coupling of fe s p by disrupting the sediment hierarchy and structure and accelerating aerobic decomposition of organic matter graca et al 2004 second a large supply of organic material input from the feed remnants and feces during the culture process coupled with anoxic conditions caused by prolonged flooding altered the balance and stability of nutrients in the sediment water profile yang et al 2019 moreover a combination of increasing salinity and so4 2 concentrations fig s2 and decreasing nutrient output in the closed pond also resulted in an imbalance in the fe s p coupling taken together these observations indicate that the coupled labile fe s p reactions are sensitive and not always stable and that they may therefore be decoupled following wetland conversion to aquaculture in this study the fluxes of labile p across the swi were higher in the pond 0 160 ng cm 2 d 1 than in the wetland 0 015 ng cm 2 d 1 fig 5a highlighting that converted aquaculture ponds are important hotspots of p release on the one hand intensive feeding material and animal feces in aquaculture ponds contain greater amounts of labile p than plant residues in natural wetlands which are not trapped in sediments but released as a labile p source as confirmed by our findings of low total p inorganic p but high labile p concentrations in the pond fig 1 on the other hand as mentioned above the conversion of wetland to aquaculture alters the reductive dissolution of feooh and so4 2 by increasing salinity and so4 2 concentrations and altering fe fractions fig s2 thereby accelerating the release of p by decoupling fe s p reactions in addition other site specific factors such as the disturbance of the swi by shrimp swimming and human fishing combined with anaerobic or anoxic conditions caused by high water depth fig s2 also accelerate p release from sediment into the water it is noteworthy that negative p fluxes were recorded in august and november in the wetland indicating that they were absorbed downward from water to sediment and sediments acted as sinks of p nutrient uptake during plant growth combined with the high concentration of exogenous p carried by the tide may support this finding hu et al 2022 moreover labile fe and s diffusion fluxes were also clearly positive in the pond and were significantly greater than those from the wetland fig 5b c substantial p fe and s fluxes in the pond suggest that conversion of wetland to aquaculture facilitated the release of p fe and s from sediment into water potentially exacerbating water quality degradation and eutrophication in the pond and adjacent seas 4 3 kinetic exchange and resupply capacity of p the difs model can effectively simulate the kinetic exchange and resupply capacity of p from sediment to water harper et al 2000 according to the simulation results table 1 higher r parameters were observed in the pond than in the wetland indicating that the conversion of coastal wetland to aquaculture greatly increased p reactivity and resupply capacity exacerbating the release of p from sediment to porewater the response time of desorption process t c value of the pond was similar to that of the wetland but both of them had obvious temporal dynamics being shorter in the late stage than in the early stage over the whole experimental cycle k d values were higher in the wetland mean 2525 6 cm3 g 1 than in the pond mean 515 9 cm3 g 1 higher k d values in wetlands indicate the presence of large sediment p pools which is consistent with higher total and inorganic p concentrations in wetlands fig 1 the desorption constant k 1 reflects the desorption capacity and rate of analytes from sediment to solution and this was higher in the pond than in the wetland which suggests that pond sediments have high p desorption capacity and that p is easily released into the water overall higher r and k 1 values combined with lower t c values in the pond indicate the strong resupply and fast mobility capacity of sediment p which agrees with the high p diffusion fluxes recorded in the pond fig 5 notably clear temporal patterns were found in the pond during the experimental period showing an increase in r k d and k 1 values and a decrease in t c values with time with the advance of the culture period the accumulation of organic matter and high ionic strength accelerate the decoupling of fe s p figs 2 3 thus facilitating the supply and remobilization of p in the pond in addition the fitting curve of r value of p over time obtained by difs simulation can further visually demonstrate the differences in p resupply capacity and kinetics between the wetland and pond sediments in both sites the r curve rose rapidly with time in various months and peaked within a short period about 1 h fig 6 indicating that different types of sediments showed strong p supply capacity during the initial deployment period after reaching the peak the fitted r curve had obvious monthly dynamics which showed a sharp decline in the early stage but remained stable in the late stage especially in the pond the high r values in the pond in the late stage indicate that the sediment maintained a fast p resupply rate and great p source strength which was consistent with higher r and k 1 values observed in the pond sediments in the late stage table 1 a possible explanation for the results is that the input of organic matter from unconsumed feed and shrimp feces in the late stage increased sediment substrate availability which in combination with high salinity and so4 2 concentrations stimulated p remobilization and release as previously mentioned altogether the conversion of coastal wetlands to aquaculture greatly promoted the kinetic exchange and resupply capacity of p in sediments and this effect was further enhanced as the culture period advanced 4 4 environmental implications and uncertainties the environmental impacts of coastal aquaculture have recently attracted worldwide attention gao et al 2019 shimoda et al 2005 yang et al 2022 as far as we know this study has made the first attempt to assess the mobilization mechanisms and budget balance of p in sediment water profiles following conversion of coastal wetlands to aquaculture based on dgt hr peeper difs techniques our results suggest that while high levels of p are contained in intensive feeds and animal feces this p is not captured by sediments as shown by the relatively low total and inorganic p concentrations observed in aquaculture ponds figs 1 and 7 meaning that a large quantity of p is lost to the surrounding environment high resolution data further demonstrated that converting natural wetlands to intensive managed aquaculture ponds dramatically increased the concentrations of labile p and srp stimulating p release from sediments upward to the overlying water considering that the pond was a closed system no water was exchanged during the culture period a substantial increase in p release following aquaculture contributed greatly to the internal p loading in the pond thereby leading to the degradation of water quality in addition as a traditional aquaculture practice a huge amount of aquaculture tailwater enriched with p and other nutrients is directly discharged into the neighboring natural wetlands at the end of aquaculture without any processing this will aggravate the nutrient load of the ecosystem in the short term and become a key driver of coastal water pollution and eutrophication consequently specific initiatives and actions to reduce the pollution of aquaculture in coastal environments are urgently required for example sustainable agricultural management practices such as regular aeration and dredging as well as systematic wetland restoration would help to reduce internal p loading caused by aquaculture however some uncertainties must be taken into consideration when extending data from site to regional or global scales or considering future work first ponds are drained and desilted during the nonculture period which damages the sediment structure as well as the swi and thus the effects of wetland conversion on p mobilization and cycling were investigated only during the local culture period from june to november rather than over a whole annual cycle more field measurements are therefore urgently needed to gain insight into p cycling and budget balances during various farming stages and under different aquafarming conditions second some strong dots and peaks of labile p with extremely high concentration were recorded in vegetated wetland along the sediment profile which were presumed to be regulated by the distribution of plant roots and the decomposition of organic matter in addition to nutrient absorption plants also release nutrients through residues returned which can regulate the lability and migration of p at a fine scale thus acting as a highly active p sink or source future studies should focus on quantifying the role of plants and their resulting heterogeneity in p cycling and on determining the functional transformation of p sources and sinks under different redox states root distribution and residue decomposition the cycling and migration of p in the sediment water profile after the conversion of coastal wetlands to aquaculture are obviously uncertain because of the vegetation removal hydrological dynamics and aquacultural practices which may lead to short term or long term changes in environmental properties and further affect the kinetic exchange and budget balance of p future research should examine the impacts of these spatial temporal and anthropogenic factors on p cycling to better understand the release mechanisms and sustainable management of p in coastal areas 5 conclusions our data have clearly demonstrated that the conversion of coastal wetlands to aquaculture has driven a decrease in sediment p pools but an increase in labile p and srp concentrations across the sediment water profiles during the culture period higher p diffusion fluxes were recorded in the converted aquaculture pond by decoupling fe s p reactions as well as enhancing the resupply capacity and kinetic exchange of p at the swi these conclusions validate our initial hypothesis that coastal wetland conversion to aquaculture decoupled fe s p reactions through enhancing the reduction of fe and so4 2 which improved p resupply capacity from sediment to water by altering the release mechanisms and kinetic exchange of p at the swi ultimately stimulating p mobilization and release our results highlight that converted aquaculture pond may be acting as important sources of p release in coastal areas because exogenous p inputs feed and manure during aquaculture are not accumulated in sediments this may potentially exacerbate the internal p loading and water quality degradation in the surrounding sea because aquaculture wastewater is discharged directly without any processing a contribution that is greatly underestimated in current budget balance assessments of p in coastal systems more attention is urgently needed to gain insight into the cycling and mobilization mechanisms of p after wetland conversion so as to adopt effective agricultural management practices to mitigate p release and its adverse environmental impacts and ultimately protect the future sustainability of coastal ecosystems declaration of competing interest the authors

15179,the reclamation of wetlands and its subsequent conversion to aquaculture may alter regional nutrient im mobilization and cycling although direct assessments of phosphorus p cycling and its budget balance following wetland conversion are currently scarce here parallel field experiments were conducted to investigate and compare the availability and mobilization mechanisms of p from natural coastal wetlands and the adjacent converted aquaculture ponds based on high resolution diffusive gradient in thin films dgt and dialysis hr peeper techniques and the dgt induced fluxes in sediments difs model the study found that the conversion of wetland to pond strongly reduced the sediment p pool by changing its forms and distribution high resolution data showed that concentrations of labile p and soluble reactive p across the sediment water profiles were markedly enhanced by the converted aquaculture pond although they exhibited large spatiotemporal heterogeneity moreover the synchronous distribution of labile p iron fe and sulfur s across profiles in coastal wetlands indicated that the dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxide phosphate complexes coupled with sulfate reduction were the main mechanisms regulating sediment p mobilization in coastal areas however the converted aquaculture pond weakened or even reversed this dependence by decoupling the fe s p reactions by changing the sediment structure and nutrient balance substantial increases in labile p fe and s fluxes in the pond suggested the conversion of wetland to aquaculture facilitated the internal release of p fe and s from sediment into water the high resupply parameter r and desorption rate k 1 combined with low response time t c in the pond as fitted by difs model indicated the strong resupply capacity and fast kinetic exchange of sediment p across the sediment water interface which is consistent with the high p diffusion fluxes recorded in the pond it was concluded that converted aquaculture ponds act as an important source of p release in coastal areas potentially exacerbating water quality degradation and eutrophication specific initiatives and actions are therefore urgently needed to alleviate the internal p loading during aquaculture graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords internal p loading resupply kinetics land use change aquaculture pond coastal wetland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus p is widely recognized as a critical regulator of eutrophication through internal and or external p loading jarvie et al 2020 as a typical sedimentary nutrient p usually exists in nature in insoluble forms through adsorption and precipitation by minerals such as iron fe and aluminum al oxides hou et al 2020 ringeval et al 2017 consequently only organic p op and iron bound p fe p are involved in the regeneration and remobilization of p through the decomposition of organic matter and the reduction of fe oxides rozan et al 2002 coastal wetlands as key environmental buffer zones between land and sea are important p sources sinks and converters morrissey et al 2014 roy et al 2017 in coastal systems huge amounts of terrestrial p are buried in sediments due to high productivity induced residue return and anthropogenic nutrient enrichment hong et al 2010 this previously sequestered and stored p tends to be remobilized from the sediment into the overlying water through reductive dissolution of feooh phosphate complexes such as vivianite 424feooh ch2o 106 nh3 16 h3po4 756h 106hco3 16nh4 424fe2 hpo4 2 636h2o furthermore high sulfate so4 2 concentrations in coastal wetlands are generally accompanied by strong so4 2 reduction and the generated sulfide promotes the decoupling of fe p through co precipitation as solid monosulfide fes and pyrite fes2 in anoxic environments h2s fe oh 2 po4 fes po4 3 h2s fe3 po4 2 fes po4 3 maynard et al 2011 rozan et al 2002 consequently the coupling decoupling process of the fe fe2 s s2 p po4 3 interactions was predominately responsible for the equilibrium of p precipitation or release in coastal areas hu et al 2021 understanding fe s p interactions and their responses to different wetland environments is important for the effective management of coastal wetlands to mitigate high p loads caused by anthropogenic and natural disturbances due to space and resource limitations more than half of the world s coastal wetlands have degraded or disappeared through conversion to intensive agricultural and aquacultural land barbier et al 2011 huang et al 2010 schuerch et al 2018 for example the aquacultural area of china the world s largest aquaculture producer has increased from 2305 km2 in 1985 to 4431 km2 in 2015 this was accompanied by a decrease in coastal wetland area from 10 262 km2 to 7296 km2 wang et al 2021 wetland reclamation and subsequent aquaculture provide sufficient protein and economic returns for human beings but they also seriously disturb the regional p cycle and balance first wetland reclamation drainage and excavation may directly alter p pools and forms by disrupting sediment structure vegetation and hydrological dynamics han et al 2014 then during high density aquaculture intensive organic material from the application of feed and fertilization is imported and precipitated in the closed ponds with the potential for promoting the accumulation and remobilization of p in the sediment and causing deterioration in water quality sarà 2007 yang et al 2021 for instance shimoda et al 2005 observed that only 11 15 of the feed input of p was taken up by shrimp bodies and the majority of the p was retained in sediment and water although p is relatively slow to move and transform through natural systems global change and human activities have greatly altered p cycling by facilitating its release from the soil sediment to ecosystems yuan et al 2018 therefore a systematic study and comparison of p release mechanisms and environmental drivers in natural wetland and converted aquaculture pond are crucial for better understanding of the role of coastal wetlands in global and regional p cycling and budget balance assessments land use and cover changes lucc such as the conversion of natural ecosystems to intensively managed agriculture are the predominant global changes driven by increasing demand for food malik et al 2018 maranguit et al 2017 numerous field measurements have demonstrated that lucc dramatically alter abiotic and biotic properties affecting p pools and stability but these studies have mainly concentrated on terrestrial ecosystems from forest to agriculture maharjan et al 2018 moghimian et al 2017 for instance in the brazilian amazon 15 years after the conversion of forest to pasture the total p of pasture reached the level of forest soil but this land use conversion reduced the contribution of different p pools to anion exchange resin p soltangheisi et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 found that the conversion of native vegetation to agriculture in subtropical australia significantly reduced soil organic p and phosphatase activities while these adverse changes could be halted through subsequent land restoration in natural coastal wetlands plant uptake and residue return play key roles in sediment p cycling hu et al 2020 ponds made in converted wetland not only remove native vegetation but also change the substrate availability and hydrologic conditions from free flowing to lentic waters yang et al 2022 which may alter sediment p accumulation and release mechanisms by modifying sediment physicochemical properties to the best of our knowledge no direct field assessment of p release mechanisms and resupply kinetics following wetland conversion has yet been carried out which increases the uncertainty in estimating the effects of aquacultural use on regional p cycling and balance with increasing population density and demand for protein rich seafood about 30 of natural coastal wetlands in the min river estuary in southeastern china have been reclaimed for aquaculture over the past few decades gao et al 2019 yang et al 2022 previous investigations have documented that aquaculture on converted coastal wetlands greatly increases methane emissions yang et al 2022 and alters nitrate dissimilatory reduction processes gao et al 2019 however little attention has been paid to p cycling and mobilization in recent years in situ passive sampling techniques such as diffusive gradient in thin films dgt and high resolution dialysis hr peeper have been well developed in combination to identify the distribution and release mechanisms of target elements in sediment water profiles norgbey et al 2020 pan et al 2020 these measurement techniques are based on fick s first law and are characterized by high spatial resolution short equilibration times and small analytical errors davison and zhang 2012 menezes blackburn et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 using high resolution in situ detection methods to study p release from sediment to water and identify underlying mechanisms and kinetic exchanges after wetland conversion to aquaculture will fill this current research gap on the impact of aquaculture activities on p cycling and mobilization and its environmental implications in this study field measurements of the availability and mobilization mechanisms of p were simultaneously taken during the growing season from the natural coastal wetlands and the adjacent converted aquaculture ponds based on high resolution dgt hr peeper techniques and the dgt induced fluxes in sediments difs model the specific objectives were to i obtain insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics and biogeochemical couplings of labile soluble p fe and s at the sediment water interface swi following wetland conversion to aquaculture ii elucidate the release mechanisms and resupply kinetics of p following wetland conversion and iii estimate the effects of such conversion on sediment p source and sink functions and their environmental implications we hypothesized that coastal wetland conversion to aquaculture would alter the release mechanisms and kinetic exchange of p at the swi by decoupling the fe s p interactions which would enhance p resupply capacity consequently aggravating p release and internal loading from sediment to water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site min river estuarine wetland 26 01 08 26 03 39 n 119 36 28 119 41 15 e located in the min river estuary in fuzhou city fujian province southeast china has a subtropical monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature mat of 19 6 c and precipitation map of 1350 mm due to the combined influence of runoff and tides natural coastal wetlands generally belong to brackish wetlands with fluctuating salinity averaging 4 2 ppt wetland plants are dominated by herbaceous phragmites australis and cyperus malaccensis with their growing season and senescence generally beginning in may and october respectively in this study field experiments were carried out in two areas of the min river estuary with eight plots covering the natural coastal c malaccensis wetlands and the adjacent converted aquaculture ponds fig s1 sediment water physicochemical parameters are presented in the supporting information fig s2 the selected aquaculture pond was filled with surrounding estuarine water to a depth of 1 1 1 7 m and no water was exchanged during the culture period from june to november the pond was used for shrimp cultivation litopenaeus vannamei with a density of about 35 50 individuals per m2 the shrimp were fed with artificial feed pellets containing 42 crude protein 16 crude ash 12 water 2 lysine and 1 total p among other materials twice per day daily feeding rates were kept at approximately 10 16 50 55 and 40 45 kg ha 1 d 1 in the early middle and late stages respectively yang et al 2022 2019 2020 the specific feed dosage is adjusted timely according to the growth and ingestion conditions of shrimp with consideration of aquaculture practices and shrimp size we artificially divided the culture period into early june to august and late september to november stages to distinguish the effects of aquaculture during the nonculture period after shrimp harvest ponds are usually drained and dredged to discharge aquaculture sewage accelerating aerobic decomposition of organic matter in surface sediments more details about min river estuarine wetland and aquaculture management practices can be found in previous studies hu et al 2022 yang et al 2022 2 2 deployment and analysis of dgt and hr peeper the field experiments were performed once a month during the culture period from mid june to mid november in 2021 this was a normal year the temperature precipitation and other environmental background are consistent with other years it was a very representative year from the climatic point of view of the studied site for

obtain images of oxyanions p and s and dissolved fe concentration at high spatial resolution which is helpful to visually observe fe s p coupling in sediment water profiles hr peeper based on chemical equilibration theory and consisting of 36 equally spaced chambers prefilled with 400 μl deionized water was used to investigate the variations of soluble reactive p srp measured as po4 3 and soluble fe in porewater all dgt and hr peeper probes were deoxygenated before deployment both probes were installed snugly and then deployed at both sites with 2 3 cm extending above the swi the dgt and hr peeper probes were retrieved after use for 24 h and 48 h respectively then cleaned and transferred to the laboratory for dgt samples the two dimensional 2d distributions of labile p and s concentrations were analyzed using the coloration technique combined with computer imaging densitometry briefly the probes were colored using molybdenum blue and scanned then the imagej software was used to convert the scanned images to grayscale intensity next the concentration of labile fe was determined using 1 0 m hno3 after slicing the zroca gels at 2 mm intervals ding et al 2016 for hr peeper samples the solution was extracted and then the concentrations of labile soluble p and fe were measured by the molybdenum blue and phenanthroline colorimetric methods respectively 2 3 sediment water sampling and analysis the surface sediments were sampled monthly using a cylindrical soil auger after the dgt was deployed three replicates were randomly selected and mixed as one sample in each plot in the laboratory the samples were air dried and sieved for the analysis of sediment p forms and physicochemical properties overlying water was collected simultaneously in each plot sediment ph

differences in the sediment p forms and physicochemical parameters between the wetland and pond were examined using paired samples t tests regression analysis was conducted to examine the linear relationships between the labile p and fe s after natural log transformation all statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics 25 spss inc chicago usa unless otherwise stated 3 results 3 1 sediment phosphorus forms over the whole experimental cycle the concentration of sediment tp was slightly higher in the coastal wetland 356 3 556 0 mg kg 1 than in the aquaculture pond 348 1 464 3 mg kg 1 p 0 05 fig 1 lower ip concentrations were observed in the pond than in coastal wetland while op concentrations significantly increased following the wetland conversion to pond p 0 01 moreover both naoh p and hcl p concentrations in the wetland were significantly higher than the concentrations obtained from the pond during the experimental period p 0 001 overall the conversion of wetland to aquaculture pond strongly reduced the sediment p pool and stability by changing the p forms and distribution 3 2 2d distribution of dgt labile p and s the conversion of coastal wetland to aquaculture significantly increased labile p and s concentrations over the whole experimental cycle fig 2 more specifically the concentrations of labile p across the sediment water profiles ranged from 0 003 to 0 127 mg l 1 in both wetland and pond and increased by 700 following the conversion of wetland mean 0 010 mg l 1 to pond mean 0 083 mg l 1 p 0 01 mean labile s concentrations across the profiles markedly increased from 0 034 mg l 1 0 007 0 072 mg l 1 in wetland to 0 133 mg l 1 0 051 0 258 mg l 1 in the pond the 2d distribution of labile p and s in the sediment water profile showed great heterogeneity in general the concentrations of labile p and s in the coastal wetland were higher in sediment than in overlying water however the dynamics of labile p and s concentrations in the pond had a temporal pattern for example the p concentration in the overlying water was higher than that in the sediment from july to september fig 2h j but the opposite was true from october to november fig 2k l the monthly pattern of labile p and s concentrations increased with the advance in growing or culture period with higher concentrations occurring in the late stage than in the early stage at both sites moreover there were some hotspots of labile p and s with extremely high concentrations in the wetland which may be mainly regulated by the distribution of plant roots and redox processes 3 3 profile distributions of labile p fe and s and their relationships over the whole experimental cycle labile fe concentrations in both sites were higher in sediment than in overlying water and the conversion of wetland to pond significantly increased fe concentrations by 540 fig 3 in the coastal wetland low labile fe concentration was observed during the early stage this remained relatively stable before gradually increasing from august and fluctuating with depth for the pond labile fe concentrations increased steadily with time with the highest value in november mean 16 971 mg l 1 vertically concentrations of labile p and s fluctuated with depth in the coastal wetland accompanied by many distinct peaks or increments for example several concentrated spots of labile p appeared in the coastal wetland at 30 mm 50 mm and 65 mm depths in october which increased the mean p concentration by 100 200 fig 3e in the pond however different monthly variations of labile p and s concentrations were observed these showed an initial sharp increase from the overlying water to 30 mm and later decreased in may october and november while there was no obvious pattern in other months additionally during the whole experimental cycle labile p concentration showed a synchronous trend with labile fe and s in the coastal wetland except in august while the converted aquaculture pond weakened or even reversed this dependence fig s3 for example labile p concentration was strongly positively related to labile fe and s in the wetland in july while it was negative in the pond 3 4 srp and soluble fe by hr peeper in general srp and soluble fe concentrations from the pond were significantly higher than those from the wetland over the whole experimental cycle fig 4 in particular monthly mean srp and fe concentrations across the sediment water profiles increased from 0 069 mg l 1 0 018 0 191 mg l 1 and 0 288 mg l 1 0 056 0 666 mg l 1 in the wetland to 1 209 mg l 1 0 255 4 669 mg l 1 and 2 253 mg l 1 0 920 4 357 mg l 1 in the pond respectively srp concentrations had a monthly pattern similar to that of soluble fe across both types although both exhibited fluctuating and irregular changes for example the concentrations of srp and fe in the pond showed rapid increases from overlying water to swi in july and then fluctuated with depth fig 4h in addition srp and soluble fe concentrations showed obvious temporal dynamics for example the highest and lowest p concentrations in both sites were found in august and november respectively 3 5 diffusion fluxes of p fe and s following conversion there were clear positive diffusion fluxes of p fe and s in the pond release from sediment to water which were significantly greater than those from the wetland fig 5 specifically the mean fluxes of p fe and s across the swi increased from 0 015 0 836 and 0 249 ng cm 2 d 1 in wetland to 0 160 25 229 and 2 327 ng cm 2 d 1 in pond respectively over the whole experimental cycle monthly p fluxes decreased dramatically with time while fe and s fluxes first decreased and were then followed by high fluxes in the pond in the wetland however low p fe and s fluxes were observed and these were accompanied by an irregular pattern of monthly variation during the growing season in addition some negative p fluxes were also observed in the wetland such as in august and november when the sediments adsorbed p from the water and may have acted as a reservoir for p 3 6 resupply dynamics of p by the difs model the difs model was used to simulate the diffusion dynamics of labile p across the swi table 1 the resupply parameter r was generally higher in the pond 0 874 than in the wetland 0 295 and was higher in the late stage september to november than in the early stage june to august at both sites the response time of desorption process t c values in the pond were close to those in the wetland and were higher in the early rather than the late stage at both sites higher adsorption k 1 and desorption k 1 rates were recorded in the pond than in the wetland and were higher in the late than in the early culture period moreover the distribution rates k d varied from 82 8 to 3914 8 cm3 g 1 across all samples with the wetland mean 2525 6 cm3 g 1 recording higher values than the pond mean 515 9 cm3 g 1 the fitting curves of r values of p with deployment time in the wetland were significantly different from those in the pond fig 6 in the wetland the fitted curve increased sharply until the peak was reached at approximately 1 0 h and then it declined steadily however for the pond the r curves showed an initial sharp increase and then decreased at the early stage but remained high after peaking in the late stage the high r curves in both the wetland and pond at the late stage indicate that the sediment maintained an intermediate to fast p resupply rate within the dgt deployment time especially in the pond 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of labile p following wetland conversion aquaculture systems are generally enriched with organic substrates from intensive feeding material and nutrient loads which coupled with their relatively enclosed environment facilitates the precipitation and accumulation of p in sediments shimoda et al 2005 surprisingly however the conversion of coastal wetland to aquaculture significantly reduced sediment ip naoh p and hcl p concentrations by 54 33 and 51 respectively fig 1 correspondingly the concentrations of labile p that can be directly taken up and used by plants and microbes across the sediment water profiles increased by 700 following wetland conversion figs 2 3 these findings together indicate that the p imported into the pond is not trapped in sediment but remigrated into the system and the sediment acts as a potential source of p for the surrounding environment several circumstances could account for this trade off after wetland conversion first the ponds tend to have high salinity and so4 2 concentrations because of the lack of freshwater replenishment fig s2 this is accompanied by strong so4 2 reduction and subsequent coprecipitation with fe ii as solid sulfide fes or fesx thereby weakening the fe p bond and accelerating the remobilization of p smolders et al 2017 yuan et al 2021 second the conventional aquacultural practice of dredging during the nonculture period can effectively reduce nutrient enrichment by directly removing surface sediments this was also supported by the low soc concentrations in the pond fig s2 it is well recognized that dredging can effectively improve the oxidation environment at the swi reduce the internal loading and mobility of p and potentially induce the regeneration of labile p from hcl p and op wen et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 moreover external disturbances such as shrimp bioturbation and fishing by humans will destroy the stability of sediments and their interfaces thereby accelerating the mobilization and diffusion of p at the swi liu et al 2016 pan et al 2022 together our findings suggest that converting natural wetlands to intensive aquaculture ponds reduces the sediment inorganic p pool which is accompanied by an increase in the labile p sources potentially implying a high sediment p remobilization and the consequent risk of eutrophication in aquaculture ponds throughout the experimental period mean labile p concentrations observed in the pond 0 083 mg l 1 were generally greater than those previously reported in the hongze lake 0 02 0 06 mg l 1 yao et al 2016 tianbao reservoir 0 02 0 04 mg l 1 norgbey et al 2020 and shijiuhu lake 0 002 0 049 mg l 1 yuan et al 2021 but lower than those in the dongting lake 0 007 0 206 mg l 1 gao et al 2016 taihu lake 0 01 0 35 mg l 1 ding et al 2015 and dianchi lake 0 35 mg l 1 wu and wang 2017 of china these differences may be related to nutrient status hydrological regime conditions and anthropogenic disturbances as well as to site specific factors such as temperature salinity and water depth for example compared with our intensive small aquaculture pond tianbao reservoir is a more natural deep reservoir 10 16 m with less external pollution leading to a low concentration of labile p norgbey et al 2020 while dianchi lake as a severely eutrophic lake is accompanied by strong internal p loading wu and wang 2017 moreover greater srp concentrations were also observed in the study pond 1 209 mg l 1 which were significantly higher than those in taihu lake 0 085 mg l 1 chen et al 2019 and chaohu lake 0 32 mg l 1 yu et al 2019 this further confirms that intensive aquaculture intensifies p dissolution and mobilization especially in subtropical coastal areas with high weathering and salinity it is noteworthy that the concentrations of labile p and srp across the profile showed a consistent trend indicating a high internal p loading potential from sediment into water following aquaculture sediments from wetland and aquatic ecosystems especially those close to the swi are generally highly heterogeneous and play a key role in the storage or release of pollutants norgbey et al 2020 in the present study the concentrations of labile p and srp in both sites exhibited noticeable heterogeneity across the profiles especially in the vegetated wetland for example there are some strong dots and peaks of labile p with extremely high concentrations at depths of around 20 to 80 mm in the wetland in september and october fig 3d e which reflects the high activity and loading of labile p in the intermediate sediment layer plant root distribution and organic matter decomposition may be the main contributors to both peak concentrations and high heterogeneity on the one hand the roots of c malaccensis are mainly distributed in the subsurface layer which promotes the regeneration of p by transporting oxygen and releasing exudates yu et al 2019 on the other hand organic matter decomposes rapidly under high salinity and electron acceptors in coastal areas provide sufficient substrates for the production and mobilization of p particularly under p deficient conditions hu et al 2022 it is worth noting that in natural wetlands the load of organic matter from root litter and exudates mainly occurs along the sediment profile while in aquaculture all organic matter feed and manure accumulates at the surface and is difficult to incorporate in the profile in addition we also observed obvious temporal dynamics of labile p and srp concentrations during the experimental period with higher concentrations occurring in the late stage september to november in both sites figs 2 4 a plausible reason for this is that nutrient removal following pond drainage and dredging during the nonculture period leads to low initial concentrations whereas p concentration increased greatly with the accumulation of intensive organic materials in the sediments during the culture process similarly for natural wetlands the reduced nutrient uptake capacity of plants during the late growing season coupled with the rapid decomposition and return of plant residues promotes the regeneration and release of p 4 2 coupling and potential mobility of fe s p numerous published studies have demonstrated the coupled migration and simultaneous release of labile p fe and s through reduction and dissolution of feooh and so4 2 in aquatic ecosystems han et al 2015 norgbey et al 2020 pan et al 2020 the high so4 2 concentration and subsequent strong sulfate reduction in coastal wetlands due to the proximity of seawater may further enhance the role of so4 2 in the fe s p coupling reactions hu et al 2022 in the present study dgt labile p concentrations in coastal wetland showed a synchronous trend with labile fe and s except in august fig 3 fig s3 which further confirmed that feooh reduction is the primary mechanism of p mobilization and so4 2 reduction may strengthen this pathway in coastal wetland han et al 2015 what is striking and interesting however is that this dependency is weakened or even reversed in the converted aquaculture pond especially from july to september fig s3 several reasons may explain this shift first dredging and insolation directly altered the coupling of fe s p by disrupting the sediment hierarchy and structure and accelerating aerobic decomposition of organic matter graca et al 2004 second a large supply of organic material input from the feed remnants and feces during the culture process coupled with anoxic conditions caused by prolonged flooding altered the balance and stability of nutrients in the sediment water profile yang et al 2019 moreover a combination of increasing salinity and so4 2 concentrations fig s2 and decreasing nutrient output in the closed pond also resulted in an imbalance in the fe s p coupling taken together these observations indicate that the coupled labile fe s p reactions are sensitive and not always stable and that they may therefore be decoupled following wetland conversion to aquaculture in this study the fluxes of labile p across the swi were higher in the pond 0 160 ng cm 2 d 1 than in the wetland 0 015 ng cm 2 d 1 fig 5a highlighting that converted aquaculture ponds are important hotspots of p release on the one hand intensive feeding material and animal feces in aquaculture ponds contain greater amounts of labile p than plant residues in natural wetlands which are not trapped in sediments but released as a labile p source as confirmed by our findings of low total p inorganic p but high labile p concentrations in the pond fig 1 on the other hand as mentioned above the conversion of wetland to aquaculture alters the reductive dissolution of feooh and so4 2 by increasing salinity and so4 2 concentrations and altering fe fractions fig s2 thereby accelerating the release of p by decoupling fe s p reactions in addition other site specific factors such as the disturbance of the swi by shrimp swimming and human fishing combined with anaerobic or anoxic conditions caused by high water depth fig s2 also accelerate p release from sediment into the water it is noteworthy that negative p fluxes were recorded in august and november in the wetland indicating that they were absorbed downward from water to sediment and sediments acted as sinks of p nutrient uptake during plant growth combined with the high concentration of exogenous p carried by the tide may support this finding hu et al 2022 moreover labile fe and s diffusion fluxes were also clearly positive in the pond and were significantly greater than those from the wetland fig 5b c substantial p fe and s fluxes in the pond suggest that conversion of wetland to aquaculture facilitated the release of p fe and s from sediment into water potentially exacerbating water quality degradation and eutrophication in the pond and adjacent seas 4 3 kinetic exchange and resupply capacity of p the difs model can effectively simulate the kinetic exchange and resupply capacity of p from sediment to water harper et al 2000 according to the simulation results table 1 higher r parameters were observed in the pond than in the wetland indicating that the conversion of coastal wetland to aquaculture greatly increased p reactivity and resupply capacity exacerbating the release of p from sediment to porewater the response time of desorption process t c value of the pond was similar to that of the wetland but both of them had obvious temporal dynamics being shorter in the late stage than in the early stage over the whole experimental cycle k d values were higher in the wetland mean 2525 6 cm3 g 1 than in the pond mean 515 9 cm3 g 1 higher k d values in wetlands indicate the presence of large sediment p pools which is consistent with higher total and inorganic p concentrations in wetlands fig 1 the desorption constant k 1 reflects the desorption capacity and rate of analytes from sediment to solution and this was higher in the pond than in the wetland which suggests that pond sediments have high p desorption capacity and that p is easily released into the water overall higher r and k 1 values combined with lower t c values in the pond indicate the strong resupply and fast mobility capacity of sediment p which agrees with the high p diffusion fluxes recorded in the pond fig 5 notably clear temporal patterns were found in the pond during the experimental period showing an increase in r k d and k 1 values and a decrease in t c values with time with the advance of the culture period the accumulation of organic matter and high ionic strength accelerate the decoupling of fe s p figs 2 3 thus facilitating the supply and remobilization of p in the pond in addition the fitting curve of r value of p over time obtained by difs simulation can further visually demonstrate the differences in p resupply capacity and kinetics between the wetland and pond sediments in both sites the r curve rose rapidly with time in various months and peaked within a short period about 1 h fig 6 indicating that different types of sediments showed strong p supply capacity during the initial deployment period after reaching the peak the fitted r curve had obvious monthly dynamics which showed a sharp decline in the early stage but remained stable in the late stage especially in the pond the high r values in the pond in the late stage indicate that the sediment maintained a fast p resupply rate and great p source strength which was consistent with higher r and k 1 values observed in the pond sediments in the late stage table 1 a possible explanation for the results is that the input of organic matter from unconsumed feed and shrimp feces in the late stage increased sediment substrate availability which in combination with high salinity and so4 2 concentrations stimulated p remobilization and release as previously mentioned altogether the conversion of coastal wetlands to aquaculture greatly promoted the kinetic exchange and resupply capacity of p in sediments and this effect was further enhanced as the culture period advanced 4 4 environmental implications and uncertainties the environmental impacts of coastal aquaculture have recently attracted worldwide attention gao et al 2019 shimoda et al 2005 yang et al 2022 as far as we know this study has made the first attempt to assess the mobilization mechanisms and budget balance of p in sediment water profiles following conversion of coastal wetlands to aquaculture based on dgt hr peeper difs techniques our results suggest that while high levels of p are contained in intensive feeds and animal feces this p is not captured by sediments as shown by the relatively low total and inorganic p concentrations observed in aquaculture ponds figs 1 and 7 meaning that a large quantity of p is lost to the surrounding environment high resolution data further demonstrated that converting natural wetlands to intensive managed aquaculture ponds dramatically increased the concentrations of labile p and srp stimulating p release from sediments upward to the overlying water considering that the pond was a closed system no water was exchanged during the culture period a substantial increase in p release following aquaculture contributed greatly to the internal p loading in the pond thereby leading to the degradation of water quality in addition as a traditional aquaculture practice a huge amount of aquaculture tailwater enriched with p and other nutrients is directly discharged into the neighboring natural wetlands at the end of aquaculture without any processing this will aggravate the nutrient load of the ecosystem in the short term and become a key driver of coastal water pollution and eutrophication consequently specific initiatives and actions to reduce the pollution of aquaculture in coastal environments are urgently required for example sustainable agricultural management practices such as regular aeration and dredging as well as systematic wetland restoration would help to reduce internal p loading caused by aquaculture however some uncertainties must be taken into consideration when extending data from site to regional or global scales or considering future work first ponds are drained and desilted during the nonculture period which damages the sediment structure as well as the swi and thus the effects of wetland conversion on p mobilization and cycling were investigated only during the local culture period from june to november rather than over a whole annual cycle more field measurements are therefore urgently needed to gain insight into p cycling and budget balances during various farming stages and under different aquafarming conditions second some strong dots and peaks of labile p with extremely high concentration were recorded in vegetated wetland along the sediment profile which were presumed to be regulated by the distribution of plant roots and the decomposition of organic matter in addition to nutrient absorption plants also release nutrients through residues returned which can regulate the lability and migration of p at a fine scale thus acting as a highly active p sink or source future studies should focus on quantifying the role of plants and their resulting heterogeneity in p cycling and on determining the functional transformation of p sources and sinks under different redox states root distribution and residue decomposition the cycling and migration of p in the sediment water profile after the conversion of coastal wetlands to aquaculture are obviously uncertain because of the vegetation removal hydrological dynamics and aquacultural practices which may lead to short term or long term changes in environmental properties and further affect the kinetic exchange and budget balance of p future research should examine the impacts of these spatial temporal and anthropogenic factors on p cycling to better understand the release mechanisms and sustainable management of p in coastal areas 5 conclusions our data have clearly demonstrated that the conversion of coastal wetlands to aquaculture has driven a decrease in sediment p pools but an increase in labile p and srp concentrations across the sediment water profiles during the culture period higher p diffusion fluxes were recorded in the converted aquaculture pond by decoupling fe s p reactions as well as enhancing the resupply capacity and kinetic exchange of p at the swi these conclusions validate our initial hypothesis that coastal wetland conversion to aquaculture decoupled fe s p reactions through enhancing the reduction of fe and so4 2 which improved p resupply capacity from sediment to water by altering the release mechanisms and kinetic exchange of p at the swi ultimately stimulating p mobilization and release our results highlight that converted aquaculture pond may be acting as important sources of p release in coastal areas because exogenous p inputs feed and manure during aquaculture are not accumulated in sediments this may potentially exacerbate the internal p loading and water quality degradation in the surrounding sea because aquaculture wastewater is discharged directly without any processing a contribution that is greatly underestimated in current budget balance assessments of p in coastal systems more attention is urgently needed to gain insight into the cycling and mobilization mechanisms of p after wetland conversion so as to adopt effective agricultural management practices to mitigate p release and its adverse environmental impacts and ultimately protect the future sustainability of coastal ecosystems declaration of competing interest the authors
