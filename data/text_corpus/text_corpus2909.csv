14545,the increasingly automated industrial processes are responsible for a large part of the generation of oily effluents which present great difficulty of treatment due to the complexity of removal of fine particles of oil the application of biosurfactants and the dimensionless number of damköhler da in a prototype of dissolved air flotation daf allowed predictions of efficiency of oil removal in oily waters two different biosurfactants were used in order to confirm a first order kinetic law for the daf process in the water oil separation the kinetic behavior of the daf process was associated by analogy with a perfect blending reactor continued stirred tank reactor cstr in this way a laboratory float was used in order to allow experiments with the biosurfactants produced by the bacteria bacillus sp and pseudomonas aeruginosa a first order kinetic model was fitted to the experimental data using quasi newton numerical optimization methods the application of the dimensionless number of damköhler together with the use of the biosurfactants allowed prediction of the oil removal efficiency around 90 it has been observed that it is also possible to predict the flotation chamber volume based on a desired value of removal efficiency keywords numerical optimization reaction order water oil separation biosurfactant flotation daf 1 introduction the development of the world industry in the last hundred years including the production of noble metals phosphate for agriculture among others would not have been possible without the flotation process discovery the conventional physical processes of centrifugation and decantation are not efficient in the removal of fine particles however techniques such as dissolved air flotation daf allow the appropriate treatment of difficult to remove contaminants such as oil contaminated water besides of being clean and very efficient technologies 1 the production or generation of industrial oily waters is an important problem for many industries since many types of effluents tend to form emulsions difficult to be treated 2 daf is an important water oil separation method based on surface physico chemical mechanisms this process basically depends on the creation of an air liquid liquid interface where a part of oil binds to gas air microbubbles mainly due to the hydrophobicity of its surface 3 the hydrophobicity control in this process can occur through the use of specific chemical reagents in order to separate the particles by polar attraction 4 in relation of chemical reagents these are composed for the most part of surfactants compounds derived from petroleum 5 7 however surfactants from bacteria yeasts and filamentous fungi have been showing great potential in oily waters treatment 8 9 these alternative collectors are known by scientific community as biosurfactants these biomolecules are highly stable when subjected to ph temperature and salinity variations allowing their use as auxiliary in controlled processes daf or in oil spills as in the case of oil platforms 10 11 in practice the kinetics of the daf process is used to study several industrial processes that from experimental data can convert the measured time in laboratory in a non stationary state for continuous operations kinetic study is a very useful tool to analyze various variables involved in a process as well as assist the development of industrial projects and equipment design 12 among other benefits the kinetics knowledge of a vessel that behaves as a reaction system allows a correlation application aiming a reactor or pseudo reactor scaling in this case an daf chamber 13 for example after the identification of a kinetic law for a bench pilot or commercial scale it is possible to estimate the dimensionless number of damköhler da for one of these structures 14 in this case if the system is of the cstr type the solution for the corresponding vessel volume on a given scale can be simplified since the da for these structures are identical in the present work the kinetic characteristics were investigated in a flotation chamber where the water oil emulsified mixture was separated in a benchtop prototype in this way volume predictions were tested for a pilot plant of daf applied in a water oil separation in the presence of biosurfactants 2 material and methods 2 1 biosurfactants production 2 1 1 microorganisms the microorganisms pseudomonas aeruginosa ucp0992 and bacillus sp were obtained from the culture collection of the catholic university of pernambuco brazil and were used in the production of biosurfactants 2 1 2 seed cultures the microorganisms were maintained in nutrient agar na within 0 5 meat extract 1 peptone 0 5 nacl and 0 5 agar for inoculum growth the nutrient broth medium nb was used with the following composition 0 5 meat extract 1 5 peptone 0 5 nacl and 0 5 k2hpo4 the biosurfactants production was carried out in mineral medium formulated with 0 1 de k2hpo4 0 1 de k2hpo4 0 02 de mgso4 7h2o 0 002 de cacl2 2h2o and 0 005 fecl3 6h2o 15 for p aeruginosa 0 6 nano3 and 3 glycerol were added to the mineral medium according to silva et al 16 while for bacillus sp 3 molasses and 3 corn steep liquor were added 17 these biosurfactants were selected based on the previous results obtained by rocha e silva et al 18 2 1 3 preparation of inoculum young cultures of the bacteria obtained after 24 h in nutrient agar medium were transferred to an erlenmeyer containing 50 ml nutrient broth which was maintained under orbital shaking at 150 rpm for 24 h at 28 c to obtain na o d optical density of 0 7 corresponding to an inoculum of 107 u f c ml at 600 nm this reading was used as inoculum in the concentration of 1 v v 2 1 4 fermentations the production of biosurfactants was carried out in erlenmeyer flasks of 500 ml capacity containing 100 ml of production medium and incubated with 2 of the pre inoculum the flasks were maintained under 200 rpm in orbital shaking for 120 h for p aeruginosa and 200 rpm for 120 h for bacillus sp both at 28 c at the end of cultivation the cell free metabolic broth of the two biosurfactants were obtained after cells removal by centrifugation at 5000 g for 30 min afterwards samples were used to determine surface tension 2 1 5 determination of surface tension the surface tension was measured in the cell free metabolic broth in a ksv sigma 700 finland tensiometer using the nuoy ring the platinum ring was immersed in the metabolic fluid recording the force required to pull it through the air liquid interface presenting 29 mn m for bacillus sp and 27 4 mn m for pseudomonas aeruginosa the instrument was calibrated against mill q 4 ultrapure distilled water millipore illinois usa prior to use the platinum plate and all glassware were sequentially washed with chromic acid deionized water and acetone and flamed with a bunsen burner samples were read three times for accuracy 2 2 determination of kinetic flotation model it is known that the principle of the flotation phenomenon for effluent treatment is based on contaminant removal that is in this case oil thus the kinetic model attributed to this phenomenon by analogy with a mixing reactor cstr type must be associated to the decay of oil concentration as a function of flotation time for this the expression that represent the reaction velocity is given by 1 d c o d t k c o n where co oil concentration mg l 1 k oil removal speed constant min 1 n pseudo kinetic order of oil removal in daf process lubricating oil was selected as the contaminant oil that is commercially available for use in flex engines gasoline vng and alcohol type sae 20w 50 with synthetic guard petrobras brazil it consists of a paraffinic base lubricating oil a complex mixture of hydrocarbons and performance enhancing additives 2 3 damköhler adimensional number da the dimensionless number of damköhler da is a parameter that can give a quick estimate of the conversion to be achieved in continuous flow vessels 19 this number can be interpreted in a float as the ratio between the rate of oil removal and the convective transport velocity of this oil measured at the float input 2 d a k c o 0 v q 0 c o 0 in which c o 0 oil concentration at the float inlet mg l 1 q 0 volumetric flow at the float inlet l min v float volume l it is important to know that values from the damköhler number correspond to high and low conversion values 20 for irreversible transformations a da 0 1 value will correspond to less than 10 for the conversion a da 10 value will usually correspond to a conversion greater than 90 2 4 flotation chamber a 15l laboratory scale dissolved air float was built applying scale down laws to the prototype used by rocha e silva et al 8 with the suppression of one of the flotation chambers the dimensions of the flotation chamber are as follows 0 262 m high 0 240 m long and 0 240 m wide the reduced prototype was also constructed in acrylic in order to allow a better visualization of the air microbubbles distribution the prototype has a microbubble injector at the bottom of the chamber allowing the oily foam formed to be collected at the top and back of the chamber taking advantage of direction flow at the bottom opposite entrance of flotation chamber the treated water follows into a discharge compartment aiming at the disposal or recirculation for microbubbles production as shown in fig 1 the oily effluent used in the float was produced in a water oil mixing tank shaken for 40 min before entering daf chamber the effluent inlet was adjusted to a flow of 3 0 l min and the air inlet to microbubbles was maintained at 6 5 l min the oil concentration in the synthetic effluent was maintained at 500 ppm and monitored with the aid of a samples absorbance calibration 2 5 bench prototype tests distilled water was used to carry out the tests in the daf bench prototype initially tests were performed on the float without biosurfactants presence where five samples were collected for each sample withdrawal time 0 5 10 15 20 25 min similar assays were performed separately on the bench float after 1l addition of the biosurfactants in each set of 25 runs bacillus sp biosurfactant a and pseudomonas aeruginosa biosurfactant b with the intention of evaluate and compare the oil removal efficiencies in the three different experimental conditions then using a chloroform methanol solution 1 1 v v the samples were shaken for 5 min in a separatory funnel after complete phases separation aqueous phase was discarded and organic phase was transferred for further reading in a spectrophotometer biospectro sp 22 the results were submitted to statistical analyzes of anova and tukey s test using statistica 12 0 software statsoft inc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 oil removal efficiency without and with biosurfactant addition the analyzes of the samples of the water treated by the bench float were performed with the aid of absorbance and related as a function of time according to tables 1 3 the analysis of variance anova verified that both for the test without addition of biosurfactant and for the experiments performed with the addition of the biosurfactants there are significant differences between the means of concentrations over time with a significance level p 001 from the tukey test it was possible to verify that the treatments without and with biosurfactants have significantly different means except for the tests performed with the biosurfactants bacillus sp and p aeruginosa at 20 min in this case the averages can be considered equal with no significant difference in the oil concentration being these the treatments that presented the lowest concentrations of oil in relation to the tests without addition of biosurfactant subsequently the experimental data were illustrated with the help of the graph shown by fig 2 in this figure it is possible to observe the efficiency of separation as a function of flotation time for the three conditions used for the control tests without addition of biosurfactant in the flotation chamber and for the tests with the biosurfactants produced by bacillus sp and pseudomonas aeruginosa a simple inspection shows a similar increase in the average gain of the oil removal rate motivated by the presence of both biosurfactants the numerical results that generated the oil concentration curves as a function of time gave rise to third order polynomial models these regression models were obtained using the quasi newton numerical optimization method and are shown in table 4 with the respective variances 3 2 determination of daf kinetic models without and with biosurfactant addition again the quasi newton numerical optimization method was used to adjust the experimental data and to define the kinetic constants of the daf process with and without addition of biosurfactants eqs 3 5 represent the kinetic laws corresponding to the adjustments of the model proposed by eq 1 obtained using experimental data for runs without 3 and with the biosurfactants 4 e 5 3 d c o d t 1 02 c o 0 97 4 d c o d t

confirmed first order kinetic behavior for the three situations analyzed the polynomial mathematical models of oil concentration in the synthetic effluent obtained from eqs 3 5 allowed the generation of the graphs shown in fig 3 thus the kinetic behaviors are presented all first order for the daf experimental data on bench scale without and with the presence of biosurfactants these curves used as values the values of the oil removal velocities d c o d t deriving the said polynomials in relation to the flotation time 3 3 oil removal efficiency forecast starting from a transformation following a first order kinetics in a continuously operating vessel and containing a liquid phase medium i e of almost constant volume concentration and conversion may be related as 6 c o c o 0 1 x o where xo is

in this way 12 x o d a 1 d a table 6 shows the da values obtained from eq 12 using operational parameters and dimensions of the bench daf prototype and respective values of the oil removal efficiency as predicted by the da value convergences are observed between the expected values of oil removal efficiency in the benchtop prototype and the values obtained experimentally rocha e silva et al 8 also used a biosurfactant as coollector in a pilot scale daf process however comparing the results obtained in this work with those obtained in this small scale prototype table 6 it is important to note that the pilot scale system has two series flotation chambers an arrangement with a larger damköhler number than for one flotation chamber only eq 12 correlates essential elements to the estimation of the volume of a daf chamber based on a geometric similarity factor and previous flow knowledge initial and final concentrations of the oil constant oil removal rate and the desired removal efficiency in addition equations for predicting the required number of daf chambers in series for different types of daf kinetics are found in fogler 21 4 conclusions the daf process is effective with or without the use of biosurfactant for the treatment of oily waters the use of biosurfactants increased the efficiency of the small scale daf prototype and allowed the estimation of kinetic parameters velocity constant k and reaction order n the determined kinetic parameters confirmed a first order kinetics for dissolved air flotation without and with the use of biosurfactant with the use of a biosurfactant the prediction of oil removal efficiency and the corresponding volume of the float can be favorably predicted with aid of the dimensionless number of damköhler for first order chemical reactions or systems of similar behavior the theme of this work can be expanded to various engineering sectors that aim to optimize commercial daf systems the experimental evidence obtained that a fad chamber operates similar to a mixing reactor shows that its operational conditions can be associated with its dimensions as provided by eq 12 as this equation is characterized by the presence of only non dimensional numbers its use can lead to the prediction of systems in larger scales composed of daf cells in series in this way a minimum number of cells can be reached to obtain a maximum efficiency

organic pollutants such as pharmaceuticals has been a huge concern due to the possible effects on the human and animal health 1 pharmaceutical products such as antibiotics have been used to intercept and handle bacterial infections as well stimulating the growth of livestock 2 it is worth mentioning that due to their increasing demand they have become new environmental contaminants that are found in different environmental matrices such as soil water sediment and plants 3 in addition drugs such as antibiotics are utilized by humans and veterinary animals and are introduced into the wastewater streams by human and animal excretions pharmaceutical manufacturing plants and hospital effluents 4 23 these compounds are ordinarily not exactly targeted by wastewater treatment plants and

characterization 3 1 1 x ray diffraction spectroscopy the crystalline structure of the prepared nanocomposite was investigated by xrd and the comparison of the xrd patterns of pure zno v2o5 v2o5 zno and v2o5 zno cnf nanocomposites is presented in fig 1 it can be seen from that pure zno v2o5 v2o5 zno were characterized by high intensity and sharpness of major peaks the typical property of high crystallinity material 22 in addition as seen in fig 1 the major peaks observed in were v2o5 zno nanocomposite were due to v2o5 and zno phases these observations were similar those reported in the literature 21 22 29 the xrd pattern of v2o5 zno cnf nanocomposite has broader peaks and weaker intensities as compared to zno v2o5 and v2o5 zno after careful analysis the xrd patterns revealed that v2o5 zno was incorporated in cnf matrices 3 1 2 scanning electron microscopy fig 2 a d shows the sem images of zno v2o5 v2o5 zno and v2o5 zno cnf the sem analysis revealed that the nanoparticles polycrystalline powders exhibit assorted micro and nanostructured morphologies the sem images a c confirms that the materials were composed of an agglomeration of spherical particles in addition sem image b consist of nanorods structures with hexagonal symmetry and some irregular structured particles while in sem image d revealed the incorporation carbon nanofibers 3 1 3 energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy the eds spectrum is shown in fig 3 confirmed that all the elements were present in the prepared materials as shown in fig 3 v zn o and c elements were detected confirming the components of zno v2o5 v2o5 zno and v2o5 zno cnf nanocomposites it9d should be noted that the carbon seen in fig 3 a c is due to carbon coating used fig 3of d confirmed the incorporation v2o5 zno on the surface cnf and these results were in agreement with xrd data 3 1 4 transmission electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy was used to investigate the incorporation of nanometer sized metal oxide onto cnfs the tem micrographs of zno v2o5 v2o5 zno and v2o5 zno cnf are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the occurrence of cnfs was coated with v2o5 zno nanomaterials 3 1 5 uv vis spectrophotometry uv visible absorption spectroscopy is extensively being utilized method to investigate the optical properties of nanosized particles the absorption spectra of zno v2o5 v2o5 zno and v2o5 zno cnf are shown in fig 5 as seen in fig 5 the prepared zno v2o5 v2o5 zno and v2o5 zno cnf exhibited an absorbance peaks at about 305 nm 475 nm 425 nm and 425 nm respectively to estimate the effect of particle size on uv absorption in particulate dispersions it is important to consider the separate nature of particle absorption 3 1 6 fourier transform infrared spectrum ft ir studies were achieved to confirm the bond structure and identification of associated functional groups of as synthesized zno v2o5 v2o5 zno and v2o5 zno cnf fig 6 the ftir spectra of the synthesized materials were measured at room temperature in the range 4000 400 cm 1 as shown in fig 6 a the band positioned below 500 cm 1 attributed to the zn o stretching mode of the zno lattice the other bands can be attributed to unreacted acetate groups fig 6 b v2o5 displays the absorption bands at 538 8 833 6 and 1026 5 cm were assigned to bending vibration of v o v bridge and v o stretching modes 30 31 the bands at 2927 cm 1 in fig 6 d were assigned to stretching modes associated with the carbon backbone 32 3 2 selection of an adsorbent the selection of the ideal adsorbent to be used for the removal of antibiotics in aqueous solutions was performed the zno v2o5 v2o5 zno cnfs v2o5 zno cnf nanocomposite were evaluated at similar removal conditions used in the developed method but at different sample ph values fig 7 as seen in fig 7 preliminary studies showed that the v2o5 zno cnf nanocomposite recorded the highest removal efficiency compared to other nanoadsorbents this is because the adsorption capacity of the v2o5 zno cnf nanocomposite is significantly higher than that of pure zno v2o5 v2o5 zno and cnfs due to the highly porous structure of the nanocomposite which provided a large specific surface area 3 3 optimization of removal process the factors affecting the adsorptive removal of cipro and cino was optimized using response surface methodology rsm based on box behnken design the studied variables include sample ph mass of adsorbent ma and contact time ct the bbd was also employed to evaluate the interactions between the studied factors as well as the influence of each factor the percentage removal of the analytes was used as the analytical response and the results together with the design matrix are summarised in table 4 the significance of the studied factors and their interactions were determined using analysis of variance anova reproduced in terms of pareto chart fig 8 fig s1 it should be noted that a positive effect demonstrated that there is an increase in the analytical response at high levels of the respective factor while a negative effect showed an increase in the response at low levels of the variables attallah et al three dimensional 3d response surface plots fig 9 fig s1 for the measured responses formed from the quadratic model equation equations not shown were used to gain a better understanding of the influences of the independent variables and their interactions on the dependent variables 33 the rsm plots of percentage removal efficiency versus independent variables confirmed the interaction between the variables the combined influence of sample ph and mass of adsorbent on the cipro removal using the nanoadsorbent is shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 adsorption removal of cipro increased with increasing solution ph this is because the cipro molecules existed mainly in cationic form therefore increasing sample ph accompanied the decrease in cation form of cipro and the increase in zwitterionic form of cipro 15 therefore the reduced cationic form results in easier diffusion and higher removal efficiency the effect adsorbent dosage and contact time showed that the removal efficiency increased with adsorbent dosage this suggested that at higher mass of the adsorbent more active sites are available for removal of the analyte in addition the results showed that the removal of the antibiotics increased with increasing contact time however after 20 min a flat surface is observed this suggested that the removal process reached an equilibrium after 20 min the response surface plots for the combined effect of contact time and sample ph shows that relatively higher ph and high contact time led to better removal efficiency therefore based on the quadratic equations and response surface plots the optimum conditions for maximum removal percentage of the analytes were found to be 0 18 g amount of adsorbent 6 5 sample ph and 20 min contact time 3 4 effect of interfering ions various cations and anions often co exist in environmental matrices therefore the effect of coexisting ions such as mg ii ca ii fe ii iii zn ii cu ii na i k i chlorides acetate sulphates and nitrates on adsorptive removal of cino and cipro was investigated this was done in order to confirm the possible competition between tc and commonly cations and anions the results obtained showed that the tc adsorption was not affected when the concentration of the cations and anions was set at 500 mg l 1 however when the concentration of the interfering ions increased to 1000 mg l 1 the removal efficiency slightly decreased 3 5 adsorption isotherms the ability of v2o5 zno nfs to adsorptive remove cino and cipro from aqueous model solutions was assessed using five most common adsorption isotherm models these isotherms include langmuir freundlich temkin dubinin radushkevich and flory huggins models linear equations are given in table 2 the equilibrium adsorption data were evaluated in the aforementioned isotherms and the parameters and correlation coefficients r2 of each model are presented in table 5 the correlation coefficients were used to obtain the isotherm model with the best fit 25 it can be seen that the correlation coefficients for the langmuir isotherm for both analytes were higher than the r2 values obtained from the other isotherm models table 5 in terms of correlation coefficients the order of fitting was as langmuir dubinin radushkevich temkin flory huggins freundlich these observations implied that cino and cipro adsorption occurs on monolayer surfaces the cino and cipro adsorption capacities on the nanoadsorbent at room temperature were 71 4 mg g 1 and 87 7 mg g 1 respectively in order to evaluate the characteristics of the langmuir isotherm the data were expressed in terms of a dimensionless constant separation factor rl equation given in table 2 as it can be seen the rl values were in the range of 0 02 0 33 suggesting that the adsorption of cino and cipro onto v2o5 zno coated carbon nanofibers was favourable the parameters for temkin dubinin radushkevich and flory huggins models were used investigate other adsorption characteristics of the nanoadsorbent temkin isotherm model is normally used to predict a uniform distribution of binding energies over the population of surface binding adsorption 34 in this study the model was used determine the adsorption potentials of the adsorbent adsorbates interactions these results suggested that in adsorption processes using the nanoadsorbent sorbent antibiotics interactions were effective for all the analytes the d r isotherm model was used to determine the nature of adsorption processes whether physical or chemical 35 25 the nature of adsorption mechanism was estimated using the mean free energy of adsorption e kj mol 1 as it can be seen the adsorption mean free energy for the removal of cino and cipro was less than 8 kj mol 1 table 5 these results suggest that the mechanisms of adsorption of the antibiotics onto the nanoadsorbents were physically sorption finally the flory huggins model was used to investigate the degree of surface coverage characteristics of the cino and cipro on the adsorbent 25 26 the equilibrium constant kfh from the flory huggins model is related to the gibb s free energy by the equation 25 26 as seen in table 5 the δg0 value for cino and cipro was found to be positive suggesting a non spontaneity adsorption process and supports an endothermic nature 3 6 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics studies was carried out in order get valuable information on the adsorption rate and to evaluate the adsorption mechanism of the adsorption process 36 for this reason the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models equations given in table 6 were applied to evaluate the experimental data obtained for adsorptive removal of cino and cipro using v2o5 zno nfs nanoadsorbent the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models parameters and their respective correlation values are presented in table 6 the correlation coefficients values showed that the experimental data a better fitted pseudo second order model r2 0 9969 compared to the pseudo first order model r2 0 5472 in addition the calculated qe values 69 4 and 82 6 mg g 1 for cino and cipro were in agreement with the theoretical values therefore it was concluded that the adsorption of cino and cipro onto the surface of v2o5 zno cnfs nanoadsorbent was dominated by chemisorption process as the rate limiting mechanism through sharing or exchange of electrons between adsorbent and adsorbate these findings were in agreement with previous work reported in the literature 4 16 15 the intraparticle diffusion model was used to assess the rate controlling step as well as to understand the influence of mass transfer resistance on the binding of cino and cipro to the v2o5 zno nfs nanoadsorbent 16 the plot for intraparticle diffusion model fig s showed two linear sections revealing two adsorption stages which describe external mass transfer at initial period followed by intraparticle diffusion 37 38 39 in addition the first linear portion is attributed to a macropore diffusion process and the second portion can be ascribed to a micropore diffusion process 37 the numerical values of the model parameters are shown in table 6 it can be from table 4 that the external mass transfer was faster than intraparticle diffusion this suggested that the intraparticle diffusion stage is a gradual process 38 in addition it can be seen that the plots did not go through the origin this implied that the intraparticle diffusion was not the rate limiting step 39 38 furthermore the high intercept values demonstrated that the external mass transfer of cino and cipro molecules onto the v2o5 zno nfs pores is significant in the initial stage of the adsorption process 3 7 comparison of adsorption capacities obtained using langmuir isotherm for various adsorbents different adsorbents have been used for adsorptive removal of cipro and some of these adsorbents are in table 7 as seen in the table it can be said that the adsorption capacity of v2o5 zno cnf nanocomposite is comparable or better other materials 41 42 however the adsorption capacity obtained in this study were lower compared to those obtained by other researchers 40 43 4 conclusion this study reported the application of v2o5 zno cnf nanocomposite for fast sensitive and efficient adsorptive removal of cino and copro in aqueous and wastewater samples the effects of most influential experimental parameters on the adsorptive removal process were performed using rsm based on box behnken design the results revealed that cino and cipro could be simultaneously removed under the same conditions the equilibrium data was evaluated using five isotherms langmuir freundlich flory huggins dubinin radushkevich d r and temkin and kinetic models the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion the equilibrium data were best described by the langmuir model and flory huggins model indicated that the adsorption process was non spontaneous and endothermic in addition the kinetics studies of indicated that the adsorption cino and cipro onto the surface of v2o5 zno nf nanocomposite followed the pseudo second order the results showed that v2o5 zno nf nanocomposite was efficient and promising adsorbent to remove quinolones based antibiotics real water matrices acknowledgements the authors are grateful to the university of johannesburg

10 ml of 100 mg l 1 cino and cipro and the contact time ranged from 0 to 60 min the adsorption of the analytes was carried out as described in section 2 4 1 the adsorbed amount of cino and cipro at

characterization 3 1 1 x ray diffraction spectroscopy the crystalline structure of the prepared nanocomposite was investigated by xrd and the comparison of the xrd patterns of pure zno v2o5 v2o5 zno and v2o5 zno cnf nanocomposites is presented in fig 1 it can be seen from that pure zno v2o5 v2o5 zno were characterized by high intensity and sharpness of major peaks the typical property of high crystallinity material 22 in addition as seen in fig 1 the major peaks observed in were v2o5 zno nanocomposite were due to v2o5 and zno phases these observations were similar those reported in the literature 21 22 29 the xrd pattern of v2o5 zno cnf nanocomposite has broader peaks and weaker intensities as compared to zno v2o5 and v2o5 zno after careful analysis the xrd patterns revealed that v2o5 zno was incorporated in cnf matrices 3 1 2 scanning electron microscopy fig 2 a d shows the sem images of zno v2o5 v2o5 zno and v2o5 zno cnf the sem analysis revealed that the nanoparticles polycrystalline powders exhibit assorted micro and nanostructured morphologies the sem images a c confirms that the materials were composed of an agglomeration of spherical particles in addition sem image b consist of nanorods structures with hexagonal symmetry and some irregular structured particles while in sem image d revealed the incorporation carbon nanofibers 3 1 3 energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy the eds spectrum is shown in fig 3 confirmed that all the elements were present in the prepared materials as shown in fig 3 v zn o and c elements were detected confirming the components of zno v2o5 v2o5 zno and v2o5 zno cnf nanocomposites it9d should be noted that the carbon seen in fig 3 a c is due to carbon coating used fig 3of d confirmed the incorporation v2o5 zno on the surface cnf and these results were in agreement with xrd data 3 1 4 transmission electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy was used to investigate the incorporation of nanometer sized metal oxide onto cnfs the tem micrographs of zno v2o5 v2o5 zno and v2o5 zno cnf are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the occurrence of cnfs was coated with v2o5 zno nanomaterials 3 1 5 uv vis spectrophotometry uv visible absorption spectroscopy is extensively being utilized method to investigate the optical properties of nanosized particles the absorption spectra of zno v2o5 v2o5 zno and v2o5 zno cnf are shown in fig 5 as seen in fig 5 the prepared zno v2o5 v2o5 zno and v2o5 zno cnf exhibited an absorbance peaks at about 305 nm 475 nm 425 nm and 425 nm respectively to estimate the effect of particle size on uv absorption in particulate dispersions it is important to consider the separate nature of particle absorption 3 1 6 fourier transform infrared spectrum ft ir studies were achieved to confirm the bond structure and identification of associated functional groups of as synthesized zno v2o5 v2o5 zno and v2o5 zno cnf fig 6 the ftir spectra of the synthesized materials were measured at room temperature in the range 4000 400 cm 1 as shown in fig 6 a the band positioned below 500 cm 1 attributed to the zn o stretching mode of the zno lattice the other bands can be attributed to unreacted acetate groups fig 6 b v2o5 displays the absorption bands at 538 8 833 6 and 1026 5 cm were assigned to bending vibration of v o v bridge and v o stretching modes 30 31 the bands at 2927 cm 1 in fig 6 d were assigned to stretching modes associated with the carbon backbone 32 3 2 selection of an adsorbent the selection of the ideal adsorbent to be used for the removal of antibiotics in aqueous solutions was performed the zno v2o5 v2o5 zno cnfs v2o5 zno cnf nanocomposite were evaluated at similar removal conditions used in the developed method but at different sample ph values fig 7 as seen in fig 7 preliminary studies showed that the v2o5 zno cnf nanocomposite recorded the highest removal efficiency compared to other nanoadsorbents this is because the adsorption capacity of the v2o5 zno cnf nanocomposite is significantly higher than that of pure zno v2o5 v2o5 zno and cnfs due to the highly porous structure of the nanocomposite which provided a large specific surface area 3 3 optimization of removal process the factors affecting the adsorptive removal of cipro and cino was optimized using response surface methodology rsm based on box behnken design the studied variables include sample ph mass of adsorbent ma and contact time ct the bbd was also employed to evaluate the interactions between the studied factors as well as the influence of each factor the percentage removal of the analytes was used as the analytical response and the results together with the design matrix are summarised in table 4 the significance of the studied factors and their interactions were determined using analysis of variance anova reproduced in terms of pareto chart fig 8 fig s1 it should be noted that a positive effect demonstrated that there is an increase in the analytical response at high levels of the respective factor while a negative effect showed an increase in the response at low levels of the variables attallah et al three dimensional 3d response surface plots fig 9 fig s1 for the measured responses formed from the quadratic model equation equations not shown were used to gain a better understanding of the influences of the independent variables and their interactions on the dependent variables 33 the rsm plots of percentage removal efficiency versus independent variables confirmed the interaction between the variables the combined influence of sample ph and mass of adsorbent on the cipro removal using the nanoadsorbent is shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 adsorption removal of cipro increased with increasing solution ph this is because the cipro molecules existed mainly in cationic form therefore increasing sample ph accompanied the decrease in cation form of cipro and the increase in zwitterionic form of cipro 15 therefore the reduced cationic form results in easier diffusion and higher removal efficiency the effect adsorbent dosage and contact time showed that the removal efficiency increased with adsorbent dosage this suggested that at higher mass of the adsorbent more active sites are available for removal of the analyte in addition the results showed that the removal of the antibiotics increased with increasing contact time however after 20 min a flat surface is observed this suggested that the removal process reached an equilibrium after 20 min the response surface plots for the combined effect of contact time and sample ph shows that relatively higher ph and high contact time led to better removal efficiency therefore based on the quadratic equations and response surface plots the optimum conditions for maximum removal percentage of the analytes were found to be 0 18 g amount of adsorbent 6 5 sample ph and 20 min contact time 3 4 effect of interfering ions various cations and anions often co exist in environmental matrices therefore the effect of coexisting ions such as mg ii ca ii fe ii iii zn ii cu ii na i k i chlorides acetate sulphates and nitrates on adsorptive removal of cino and cipro was investigated this was done in order to confirm the possible competition between tc and commonly cations and anions the results obtained showed that the tc adsorption was not affected when the concentration of the cations and anions was set at 500 mg l 1 however when the concentration of the interfering ions increased to 1000 mg l 1 the removal efficiency slightly decreased 3 5 adsorption isotherms the ability of v2o5 zno nfs to adsorptive remove cino and cipro from aqueous model solutions was assessed using five most common adsorption isotherm models these isotherms include langmuir freundlich temkin dubinin radushkevich and flory huggins models linear equations are given in table 2 the equilibrium adsorption data were evaluated in the aforementioned isotherms and the parameters and correlation coefficients r2 of each model are presented in table 5 the correlation coefficients were used to obtain the isotherm model with the best fit 25 it can be seen that the correlation coefficients for the langmuir isotherm for both analytes were higher than the r2 values obtained from the other isotherm models table 5 in terms of correlation coefficients the order of fitting was as langmuir dubinin radushkevich temkin flory huggins freundlich these observations implied that cino and cipro adsorption occurs on monolayer surfaces the cino and cipro adsorption capacities on the nanoadsorbent at room temperature were 71 4 mg g 1 and 87 7 mg g 1 respectively in order to evaluate the characteristics of the langmuir isotherm the data were expressed in terms of a dimensionless constant separation factor rl equation given in table 2 as it can be seen the rl values were in the range of 0 02 0 33 suggesting that the adsorption of cino and cipro onto v2o5 zno coated carbon nanofibers was favourable the parameters for temkin dubinin radushkevich and flory huggins models were used investigate other adsorption characteristics of the nanoadsorbent temkin isotherm model is normally used to predict a uniform distribution of binding energies over the population of surface binding adsorption 34 in this study the model was used determine the adsorption potentials of the adsorbent adsorbates interactions these results suggested that in adsorption processes using the nanoadsorbent sorbent antibiotics interactions were effective for all the analytes the d r isotherm model was used to determine the nature of adsorption processes whether physical or chemical 35 25 the nature of adsorption mechanism was estimated using the mean free energy of adsorption e kj mol 1 as it can be seen the adsorption mean free energy for the removal of cino and cipro was less than 8 kj mol 1 table 5 these results suggest that the mechanisms of adsorption of the antibiotics onto the nanoadsorbents were physically sorption finally the flory huggins model was used to investigate the degree of surface coverage characteristics of the cino and cipro on the adsorbent 25 26 the equilibrium constant kfh from the flory huggins model is related to the gibb s free energy by the equation 25 26 as seen in table 5 the δg0 value for cino and cipro was found to be positive suggesting a non spontaneity adsorption process and supports an endothermic nature 3 6 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics studies was carried out in order get valuable information on the adsorption rate and to evaluate the adsorption mechanism of the adsorption process 36 for this reason the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models equations given in table 6 were applied to evaluate the experimental data obtained for adsorptive removal of cino and cipro using v2o5 zno nfs nanoadsorbent the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models parameters and their respective correlation values are presented in table 6 the correlation coefficients values showed that the experimental data a better fitted pseudo second order model r2 0 9969 compared to the pseudo first order model r2 0 5472 in addition the calculated qe values 69 4 and 82 6 mg g 1 for cino and cipro were in agreement with the theoretical values therefore it was concluded that the adsorption of cino and cipro onto the surface of v2o5 zno cnfs nanoadsorbent was dominated by chemisorption process as the rate limiting mechanism through sharing or exchange of electrons between adsorbent and adsorbate these findings were in agreement with previous work reported in the literature 4 16 15 the intraparticle diffusion model was used to assess the rate controlling step as well as to understand the influence of mass transfer resistance on the binding of cino and cipro to the v2o5 zno nfs nanoadsorbent 16 the plot for intraparticle diffusion model fig s showed two linear sections revealing two adsorption stages which describe external mass transfer at initial period followed by intraparticle diffusion 37 38 39 in addition the first linear portion is attributed to a macropore diffusion process and the second portion can be ascribed to a micropore diffusion process 37 the numerical values of the model parameters are shown in table 6 it can be from table 4 that the external mass transfer was faster than intraparticle diffusion this suggested that the intraparticle diffusion stage is a gradual process 38 in addition it can be seen that the plots did not go through the origin this implied that the intraparticle diffusion was not the rate limiting step 39 38 furthermore the high intercept values demonstrated that the external mass transfer of cino and cipro molecules onto the v2o5 zno nfs pores is significant in the initial stage of the adsorption process 3 7 comparison of adsorption capacities obtained using langmuir isotherm for various adsorbents different adsorbents have been used for adsorptive removal of cipro and some of these adsorbents are in table 7 as seen in the table it can be said that the adsorption capacity of v2o5 zno cnf nanocomposite is comparable or better other materials 41 42 however the adsorption capacity obtained in this study were lower compared to those obtained by other researchers 40 43 4 conclusion this study reported the application of v2o5 zno cnf nanocomposite for fast sensitive and efficient adsorptive removal of cino and copro in aqueous and wastewater samples the effects of most influential experimental parameters on the adsorptive removal process were performed using rsm based on box behnken design the results revealed that cino and cipro could be simultaneously removed under the same conditions the equilibrium data was evaluated using five isotherms langmuir freundlich flory huggins dubinin radushkevich d r and temkin and kinetic models the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion the equilibrium data were best described by the langmuir model and flory huggins model indicated that the adsorption process was non spontaneous and endothermic in addition the kinetics studies of indicated that the adsorption cino and cipro onto the surface of v2o5 zno nf nanocomposite followed the pseudo second order the results showed that v2o5 zno nf nanocomposite was efficient and promising adsorbent to remove quinolones based antibiotics real water matrices acknowledgements the authors are grateful to the university of johannesburg

14547,recent progress on aerobic inverse fluidized bed biofilm reactors aifbbrs used for treatment of various industrial wastewaters is discussed in this article for the effective operation of aifbbrs knowledge of phase holdup pressure gradient phase flow rates minimum fluidization velocity friction factor bubble size and rise velocity mass heat transfer coefficients residence time distribution and settled bed to bioreactor volume ratio are essential in this regard different aspects of aifbbrs such as static bed height and shape size density type of carrier particles have been analyzed knowledge of the reaction conditions time temperature and ph type of microorganisms and nutrients concentration of pollutants and thickness of biomass growth on carrier particles are also essential various literatures reveal that aifbbrs have better operational stability and have higher organic matter removal capacity future research aspects of aifbbrs are also discussed in this article keywords industrial wastewater inverse fluidization aerobic treatment biofilm reactor 1 introduction although 71 of the earth s surface is covered with water 1 a mere 0 4 of all water on earth is considered to be freshwater 2 as the demand for the freshwater increases its shortages also increase the declining of freshwater is further aggravated due to the discharge of untreated and or inadequately treated industrial wastewaters into waterbodies which creates a risk of conflict reduces food production hinders industrial expansion and increases environmental as well as human health hazards 2 due to these adverse effects it is essential to treat industrial wastewaters with respect to different aspects such as oil and grease organic content biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod or total organic carbon toc ph temperature specific metals suspended solids nitrogen phosphorus or indicator microorganisms 2 methods adopted for treating industrial wastewaters are broadly classified into preliminary primary secondary and tertiary categories 3 which comprise of various physical unit operations and chemical biological unit processes 4 among these methods the secondary treatment methods have drawn much attention primarily because of their potential to remove suspended solids fine particulates and soluble colloidal organics by using bacteria and microorganisms the secondary treatment systems include stabilization ponds land disposal systems anaerobic reactors activated sludge systems and aerobic biofilm reactors 4 amongst different types of secondary treatment systems the aerobic biofilm reactor is the most recent system such reactors are compact 5 resistant to temperature changes to toxicity loads 6 and can treat wastewaters with low concentration of organic pollutants these reactors have higher degradation rates higher three times or more organic load uptake capacity less expensive to construct and conceptually simpler than any other secondary treatment systems 7 8 based on the state of biomass fixation the aerobic biofilm reactors are grouped into reactors with suspended biomass mixed reactors and reactors with fixed attached biomass 9 among the several types of aerobic biofilm reactors the fixed attached biomass reactors with moving beds particularly the two and three phase aerobic inverse fluidized bed biofilm reactors aifbbrs have gained much attention in recent years in which the solid carrier particles are made to move continuously by hydraulic means 8 in the three phase solid liquid gas conventional fluidization systems when the density of the solid particles is less than the density of the continuous liquid phase the fluidization of solid particles can be achieved either by the upward flow of both the gas and liquid or by a combination of the upward flow of the gas along with the downward flow of liquid 10 in these two cases fluidization of solid particles occurs in the downward direction which is termed as inverse fluidization 11 the main advantage of aifbbrs over fixed bed reactors is that the filter medium is not getting clogged these reactors offer high energy performance low pressure drop high gas holdup and high heat mass transfer rates 11 higher oxygen concentration in the reacting liquid effective control of the biofilm thickness and higher mass transfer from liquid to biofilm are observed in these reactors 12 some more advantages of aifbbrs are high volumetric efficiency long term stability and applicability to treat low concentration pollutants 13 due to vigorous motion of particles clogging channelling of the bed is not observed and a near constant biofilm thickness is maintained due to the particle particle wall collisions 10 in such type of reactors solids attrition is less as the movement of particles is facilitated in liquid medium carryover of coated microorganisms is also found to be minimum and refluidization in case of power failure is not a problem at all 14 as low fluid velocities are required to fluidize the lighter solid particles power consumption is low 15 simplicity in operation and handling low processing cost and low energy consumption 16 are some more attractive features of aifbbrs also these reactors offer low mass transfer resistance better contact among phases larger specific surface area of solid particles faster biofilm formation and greater biodegradation effect 17 18 for these above mentioned features aifbbrs are now a days being used for the treatment of industrial wastewaters for the removal control of pollutants like ferrous iron 12 19 aniline 20 phenol 17 18 21 29 and sulphate 30 treatment of wastewaters generated from industries like brewery 10 starch 15 31 34 textile 35 sugar 36 dairy 37 steel 16 etc have already been carried out by different researchers using aifbbrs in the present work literatures published on the use of aifbbrs for industrial wastewater treatment are reviewed 1 1 industrial wastewater characteristics industrial wastewaters are the wastewaters generated from raw material processing manufacturing and agro industries in which domestic wastewater may be present depending on the type of industries and its raw materials the wastewaters have varied compositions some of these can be easily biodegradable organically very strong or largely inorganic which result in large values of bod5 5 day bod cod and total suspended solids tss 2 for this reason the industrial wastewaters are generally deficient in nutrients the ph values are generally between 6 and 9 dissolved metal salts may be present in higher concentrations the discharge of industrial wastewaters may vary with the shift nature of the operations within a factory number of working days per week working hours per day operating procedures followed raw materials processed type and size of the industry level of recycling etc 2 the majority of pollutants found in industrial wastewaters can be grouped into conventional nonconventional and priority pollutants 38 bod5 tss oil grease oil animal vegetable mineral and ph belong to conventional pollutants category while the nonconventional pollutants include ammonia hexavalent chromium cod fluoride manganese organic nitrogen phenols toc etc 38 as many as 129 number of priority pollutants are found in the literature reported by keith and telliard 39 further the industrial wastewaters can be categorized into physical chemical biological and radiological types 38 40 the important physical characteristics are total solids content floating settleable colloidal and matter in solution turbidity odour colour and temperature 41 the chemical characteristics are broadly classified as organic and inorganic types organic components include a combination of carbon hydrogen and oxygen along with nitrogen in some cases for example carbohydrates fats oil greases phenols and proteins small quantities of surfactants organic priority pollutants volatile organic compounds agricultural pesticides sulfur phosphorus and iron may also be present the important inorganic components of industrial wastewaters are ph alkalinity chloride nitrogen sulphate sulphides h2s and heavy metals biological characteristics include various microorganisms some of which may be pathogenic in nature all microorganisms are not harmful some of these decompose the organic matter by aerobic or anaerobic means and reduce the cost of wastewater treatment 42 radiological characteristics include the radioactive materials generated from the nuclear power plant and from the mining of radioactive materials some of the reported characteristic values of industrial wastewaters are listed in table 1 1 2 transport mechanisms in aerobic biofilm systems a biofilm as per iupac international union of pure and applied chemistry definition is the collection of microorganisms in which cells are attached to each other and to a solid surface by a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances secreted by microorganisms 43 as the microorganisms are attached to a solid surface these can be retained in the reactor for a longer duration which is an essential feature for wastewater treatment systems the attachment of microorganisms depends on the factors like cell to cell interactions presence of polymer molecules on the solid surface composition of the medium 44 electrostatic charge on the surface of microorganisms ph of the solution degree of hydrophilicity of solid surfaces surface roughness and flow velocities past film surfaces 45 in the aerobic biofilm reactors with fixed attached biomass the biological conversions occur at first within the biofilm with the oxygen organic matter and nutrients getting adsorbed on the solid surfaces these are then diffused to the interior of the biofilm through the liquid film and then through the biofilm where the metabolic reactions occur by the microorganisms organic matters present in the wastewater in the form of colloids or suspensions do not diffuse into the biofilm directly until they are hydrolysed to low molecular weight organic matters oxygen either present in the liquid or externally fed to the reactors in bubble forms is consumed in the biofilm till the anaerobic conditions are attained this implies that the biofilm consists of two regions external aerobic region and internal anaerobic region reduction of nitrate sulphate and formation of organic acids occur in the anaerobic region the metabolic products thus formed are transported in the opposite direction back to the continuous liquid phase through the biofilm 45 the substrate donor and electron acceptor are also required to be diffused to the biofilm for the progress of biochemical reactions 8 the transportation steps are illustrated in fig 1 as oxygen is mainly required for the metabolic reactions in the aerobic region of the biofilm its transfer from liquid phase or from the rising bubbles to the interior of the biofilms is important but its transfer faces a series of mass transfer resistances from gas bubbles to the gas liquid interface through the gas liquid interface through the liquid film at the exterior of the gas liquid interface in the liquid medium through the liquid film at the exterior of the liquid cell interface in the liquid cell interface and at the reaction sites these are illustrated in fig 2 all these resistances depend on factors like hydrodynamics of air bubbles system temperature solubility of oxygen cellular activity solution composition and interfacial phenomenon 46 the growth of the biofilm on the solid surface consists of three stages when the film is thin all the microorganisms grow under the same logarithmic rate while the growth rates are constant when the film thickness is intermediate but if the organic matter supply rate falls below the minimum required rate for metabolic maintenance activity then the biofilm thickness decreases and when the film thickness is significant parts of the biofilm are detached from the solid surfaces 45 2 studies on aifbbrs knowledge on optimized operating conditions in terms of phase holdup pressure gradient phase flow rates minimum fluidization velocity friction factor bubble size and rise velocity settled bed to bioreactor volume ratio mass heat transfer coefficients and residence time distribution rtd are essential for the effective operation of aifbbrs for industrial wastewater treatment it is also necessary to understand the bed dynamics at first with respect to the effects of static bed height and shape size density type of carrier particles knowledge on the type of microorganisms nutrients and thickness of biomass growth on carrier particles along with the nature and concentration of pollutants are also necessary other than these knowledge on the nature and type of impurities present in the system and the reaction conditions time temperature and ph are also required to be analyzed 2 1 hydrodynamic characteristics the hydrodynamic characteristics of two and three phase inverse fluidization systems were first reported by fan et al 11 using lighter density solid particles recent progresses in hydrodynamics and process aspects of aifbbrs were well reviewed by arun et al 47 sur and mukhopadhyay 48 respectively several research articles on hydrodynamics of aifbbrs were published and some of these studies are briefed in table 2 renganathan and krishnaiah 49 developed generalized equations for predicting minimum fluidization velocities in 2 and 3 phase inverse fluidized beds which covered a wide range of variables using lighter dense particles 250 917 kg m3 in a size range of 0 08 12 9 mm and these equations satisfactorily reduced to limiting conditions of no gas and no liquid flow predicting the experimental data kim et al 50 studied the axial dispersion in a 3 phase aifbbr the axial dispersion coefficient dz was found to increase with the increase in the superficial gas or liquid velocities ug or ul but decrease with the increase in liquid viscosity μl the liquid phase contacting pattern in terms of liquid mixing is an important factor in design and operation of aifbbrs which can be understood by rtd studies the liquid phase rtd residence time peclet number and dispersion coefficient in a 2 phase ifb were studied by renganathan and krishnaiah 14 using a pulse tracer technique and deconvolution method of analysis it was found that the dz increases as both ul archimedes number ar increases and is independent of static bed height hs the stochastic method of monte carlo simulation was satisfactorily used by renganathan and krishnaiah 51 to study the hydrodynamic characteristics pressure drop bed voidage and minimum fluidization velocity of 2 phase ifb under steady and unsteady state conditions sivasubramanian and velan 52 used dimensionless correlation and a modified gas perturbed liquid model gplm to predict the experimental minimum liquid fluidization velocity ulmf in a 3 phase aifbbr it was found that both the models predicted the experimental ulmf data well for both newtonian and non newtonian systems while sivasubramanian and velan 53 used the modified gplm to satisfactorily predict the ulmf for 2 phase aifbbr for both newtonian and non newtonian liquids renganathan and krishnaiah 54 studied the quality of fluidization from the root mean square rms voidage fluctuation the rms results showed a maximum value with respect to average bed void fraction which is independent of hs and increased with increase in ar number sánchez et al 55 observed that the rtd were constant at different solid phase holdup ϵs in a 3 phase inverse turbulent bed itb indicating that the liquid mixing in the reactor was not affected by the concentration of solids and the reactor behaved like a 2 phase reactor howley and glasser 56 studied the stability of inverse fluidized bed ifb by the growth rate of one dimensional traveling waves 1d tw which was found to be in the direction of fluidization froude number fr and fluid to solid density ratio were observed to affect the stability bruce et al 57 have developed a model for the prediction of hydrodynamic variables such as phase holdups bed expansion and pressure drop but the major drawback of this model is that it did not include the free open area of the supporting grid as a variable renganathan and krishnaiah 58 studied the unsteady void fraction characteristics of aifbbr using particle bed model and a good agreement was found between the experimental and model predicted results based on a mellin transform montastruc et al 59 modelled the gas and liquid rtd in an aifbbr it was observed that the increase in the gas flow rate leads to higher mixing intensity of the gas phase while for a decrease in the gas velocity the ifb was observed to perform as a plug flow reactor pfr the liquid phase closely performed to disperse plug flow campos díaz et al 60 developed a new mathematical model to estimate bed porosity ϵ as a function of reynolds re and ar numbers in an aifbbr by which a standard deviation of 1 between experimental and calculated ϵ values was obtained some other advantages of this developed model were negligible wall effects better results for spherical particles with or without biofilm and applicability to nonspherical particles das et al 61 determined the minimum inverse elutriation velocity using single and binary systems of different polymeric materials and different non newtonian fluids the minimum elutriation velocity was found to be increasing with the increase in bed height but remained practically constant with varying liquid viscosity wang et al 62 simulated the flow behavior of particles in an ifb by means of two fluid model combined with kinetic theory of granular flow axial velocities of particles and the expanded bed height were found to be increased with an increase of liquid velocity temperature was observed to be independent of the flow of particles using immobilized enzyme nanosilica particles narayanan et al 63 designed an ifbbr which provided high fractional conversion at high substrate flow rates the resistance to substrate transfer into the nano support particles was found to be negligible das et al 64 developed empirical correlations to determine the bed expansion characteristics of ifb using non newtonian liquids as a function of physical and dynamic variables of the system an ann model was also developed by them for the prediction of bed height 2 2 mass transfer characteristics the effective operation of aifbbrs requires the knowledge of mass transfer characteristics gas liquid and liquid solid which can be evaluated in terms of mass transfer coefficients k oxygen transfer rate otr and liquid solid mass transfer resistance φ 18 the mass transfer coefficient k from the liquid to solid phase in an aifbbr was first studied by nikov and karamanev 65 as a function of ul for different types of liquid and solid phases the effect of ul on k was found to be negligible but with the increase in μl and particle density ρs the k values were found to decrease nikolov et al 66 observed that the ul has a negligible effect on the volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient kla but found the values of kla to be increasing with the increase of ug kim et al 50 studied the gas liquid g l mass transfer in 3 phase ifb and it was observed that the values of kla to be increasing with an increase in ug but decreased with an increase in liquid viscosity dolas et al 67 developed an ann model to predict the k values of 3 phase aifbbr using 10 mm polyethylene pe hollow spheres coated with benzoic acid ba and observed that the developed ann model has an accuracy of more than 90 in a 3 phase itb sánchez et al 55 observed that the kla values to be independent of both solid holdup and superficial liquid velocity kim and kang 68 studied the hydrodynamics and heat mass transfer characteristics of the inverse and circulating 3 phase fbrs in the ifbrs it was found that the kla values increased as ug increased but with increasing ul the kla values increased initially but later approached an asymptotic value with a further increase in ul it was also observed that the kla values for higher density particles were higher than lower density particles using aqueous ethanol solution and polypropylene pp particles in a 3 phase ifb hamdad et al 69 observed the kla values to be increasing with increasing ug the kla values in aqueous ethanol solution were found to be greater than those in water when particles were present again the kla values were found to be smaller for the case without particles liu et al 70 used a modified internal airlift loop reactor and found the kla values to be increasing with increasing ug and ul while it decreased slightly with increasing solid loading using various newtonian and non newtonian fluids sivasubramanian 71 observed the kla values to be increasing with increase in particle diameter decreasing with increase in solid loading and decreasing with the addition of organic additives fahim et al 72 used bacillus subtilis to produce biosurfactant in a 3 phase aifbbr which reduced the surface tension as a result the kla values decreased oxygen transfer was found to increase upto 175 and upto 24 with the increase of ug and ul respectively it was also observed that the oxygen transfer obtained kla upto 0 015 s was higher than any other bioreactors used for biosurfactant production a correlation was also developed based on dimensional analysis which could help in scale up of biosurfactant production haribabu and sivasubramanian 73 using a non newtonian xanthan gum fluid observed similar effect of ul ug solid loading and concentration of xanthan gum on the kla values as previously observed by sivasubramanian 71 for aqueous carboxy methyl cellulose cmc solutions using polystyrene ps beads in an aifbbr begum radha 18 28 observed the kla values to be increasing with particle size dp and then decreasing with the increase of ug both kla and otr were found to increase initially then decrease for a short while then again increase and reached a constant value higher ug produced bubbles of higher size db which dominated over the gas phase holdup ϵg values thereby decreasing the values of kla and otr mass transfer resistance is expressed in terms of effectiveness factor η and substrate diffusivity de due to dense and stable biofilm on smaller sized particles substrate diffusion into the biofilm was difficult thus de and η values were low and hence mass transfer resistance was high while for larger particles with less dense and loosely packed biofilm de and η values were high and hence mass transfer resistance was low for smaller sized particles the degradation was mainly due to intraparticular diffusion due to low η values while for larger particles as η values were high the degradation was mainly controlled by chemical reactions also with the increase in biofilm thickness the η values were found to increase further η values were found to decrease with the increase in biofilm dry density higher biofilm dry density provided higher mass transfer resistance and hence low values of η 18 using nanosilica particles in an aifbbr narayanan et al 63 observed negligible resistance to substrate transfer into the nano support particles this was due to very large specific surface of nano sized particles for which the η values for different kinetic equations and for wide range of substrate concentrations were unity 2 3 heat transfer characteristics because the liquid viscosity is highly temperature dependent the knowledge of heat transfer is a crucial factor for the industrial applications of aifbbrs the heat transfer characteristics of aifbbrs were first studied by cho et al 74 in 2 and 3 phase fluidized beds using pe and pp beads it was observed that the heat transfer coefficient h for higher density particles was higher than that of lower density particles the h values were found to increase with ug it exhibited a maximum value with increasing ul or ϵ the ul at which h was found to be maximum decreased with increasing ρs or ug kim and kang 68 found the h values to be increasing with ug in the aifbbrs which is due to more vigorous bubbling caused by higher ϵg and turbulence and a similar phenomenon was also observed by myre and macchi 76 the h values exhibited a maximum with increasing ul which is due to decrease in ϵs at higher ul heavier particles were found to be more effective for the heat transfer than the lower density particles which are due to their bubble breaking capability and frequent contacting with heater surfaces using pe and pp spheres and plates in pure water and aqueous solutions of cmc in 3 phase ifb son et al 75 observed the h values to be increasing with increasing ug or ρs but it decreased with increasing μl whereas it was maximum with the variation of ul or ϵ and the same had been observed by cho et al 74 further myre and macchi 76 observed that the h values were reduced with the addition of surfactant which was due to the decrease of the amount and size of larger bubbles at low ϵs the h values were found to be higher compared to h values at higher ϵs 2 4 biofilm and biomass characteristics the evaluation of biofilm and biomass characteristics are based on biofilm thickness and dry density suspended and attached biomass concentration cod substrate removal efficiency particle density 25 29 and superficial gas velocity 27 28 larger biofilm thicknesses on the particle surfaces do not enhance the degradation of wastewater rather limit the transfer of substrate and oxygen to the interior of the biofilm which causes the detachment of the biofilm pieces leading to improper bioreactor performance therefore the biofilm thickness should be maintained at such a value that the diffusional limitations are minimum karamanev and nikolov 13 observed the optimal biofilm thickness to be 100 μm the biofilm thickness and particle density were found to decrease while the biofilm dry density and suspended biomass concentration were found to increase with increasing ug all these are related to the cod removal efficiencies which increased till a critical ug is reached however above critical ug the reverse happened 27 28 biofilm thickness gets affected by particle size which increased as particle size decreased for smaller particle sizes the thinner biofilms were advantageous in aifbbrs contributing to higher cod removal efficiencies as they were more stable and dense 27 campos díaz et al 60 observed that the attachment of biofilm on particle surface was due to clusters of microorganism agglomerates suspended biomass concentration in the bulk continuous liquid phase was found to be increasing during the initial period of degradation due to the attrition of biofilm and then it was decreasing steadily due to the reattachment of biomass on solid particles and substrate inhibition effect 26 29 this concentration was found to decrease with the increase in solid particle sizes having thicker biofilms and vice versa 27 as the suspended biomass concentration decreased over the degradation period the cod values were found to decrease proportionately with decreasing substrate concentration this was due to the high tolerance of biofilms to higher substrate concentrations and constant biofilm thickness 26 27 due to the formation of less dense biofilm on the solid particles the attached biomass concentration was found to decrease initially as the degradation proceeds the attached biomass concentration was found to increase due to stable and dense biofilm for smaller sized solid particles the attached biomass concentration was found to be higher due to thin stable and dense biofilm and vice versa 27 the cod removal efficiencies were found to be proportionately dependent on the attached biomass concentration 28 2 5 degradation kinetics the substrate degradation behavior can well be understood from i cell growth and substrate degradation kinetics ii substrate inhibition kinetics for suspended biomass and iii kinetic model for attached biomass biofilm systems 26 29 the specific cell growth rate for batch systems μ is defined as 1 μ 1 x d x d t where x is the cell concentration dry while the specific substrate degradation rate for batch systems qs is defined as 2 q s 1 x d s d t where s is the residual substrate concentration of the solution for some enzymatic reactions the substrate may inhibit the cell growth and its own utilization under higher substrate concentrations various substrate inhibition kinetic models such as haldane aiba teissier webb and yano and koga are available to test with the experimental data 25 for phenolic substrate begum radha 26 29 observed the haldane equation to be fitted well both for μ and qs on the basis of highest correlation coefficient r2 and the lowest root mean square error rmse values the haldane model equations are defined as 3 μ μ m a x s k s s s 2 k i and 4 q s q s m a x s k s s s 2 k i where μmax is the maximum specific cell growth rate qsmax is the maximum specific substrate degradation rate ks is the substrate affinity constant and ki is the substrate inhibition constant when compared with other models the haldane model kinetic parameters such as ki was found to be highest and ks was found to be lowest for suspended biomass culture with respect to μ and qs 26 29 for the attached biomass biofilm systems as the microorganisms were made to adapt well with higher substrate concentrations both μ and qs were found to increase with initial substrate concentrations therefore the non inhibitory monod model equations were used which are defined as 5 μ f μ f m a x s k s s and 6 q s f q s f m a x s k s s where μfmax and qsfmax are the maximum specific cell growth rate and the maximum specific substrate degradation rate for the biofilm systems respectively the r2 values with respect to μ and qs for monod model were found to be higher than haldane model indicating that the non inhibitory monod model fitted well with the experimental data also it was found that the monod model kinetic parameter ks was lower than that for haldane model indicating that the microorganisms had a greater affinity towards phenolic substrate 26 29 3 treatment of industrial synthetic wastewater using aifbbrs the application of aifbbrs in treatment of industrial wastewaters by biological means over traditional methods has already gained much popularity in recent years to treat a variety of toxic pollutants and industrial effluents which have been studied by many researchers reactors having varied geometry have been used under different operational conditions some of the reported operational conditions and performance of aifbbrs for industrial wastewater treatment are briefed in table 3 for future operational strategies and for a sustainable system 3 1 glucose solution synthetic aqueous solutions of glucose 0 4 12 g glucose l were treated by nikolov and karamanev 12 in a draft tube type of aifbbr by a mixed bacterial culture of aerobic heterophobic microorganisms using pe granules as biomass support particles under the experimental conditions of 60 l h as gas flow rate 3 2 18 2 h as dilution rates and at 28 29 c the reaction rate at 90 conversion was found to be 80 mg glucose consumed per liter of reactor volume per hour the maximum rate achieved was 1000 mg l h when these results were compared with those obtained from basic draft tube airlift reactor without pe granules it was found that the aifbbr was 3 6 times more effective at a glucose conversion of 90 and the ratio between the maximal glucose uptake was 14 8 times higher as only a few hydrodynamic studies were reported prior to this work the glucose uptake capacity could be higher if the optimized hydrodynamic conditions would be considered for the present aifbbr karamanev and nikolov 13 treated an aqueous solution of glucose and found that at over 80 substrate conversion aifbbr was 25 times more efficient than a chemostat and this increased to 100 as the substrate conversion decreased to 20 this indicated that the aifbbrs would be more efficient if operated in series 3 2 ferrous iron solution the ferrous iron solution in wastewater is generally contributed by the wastewater generated during the leaching of metals in hydrometallurgy industries nikolov karamanev 12 karamanev nikolov 19 and nikolov karamanev 77 took thiobacillus ferrooxidans to treat wastewaters containing ferrous iron using expanded polystyrene eps spheres in a reactor having a volume of 1 7 l and diameter of 6 5 cm with 3 4 g fe2 l 60 l h gas flow rate and 3 2 18 2 h dilution rate nikolov and karamanev 12 observed the oxidation rate to be 0 7 g fe2 l h with a maximum value of 2 1 g fe2 l h at 70 conversion karamanev and nikolov 19 carried out the degradation studies at a substrate dilution rate of 1 08 h for ferrous iron concentration of 3 5 4 0 g l at 27 c the dissolved oxygen do concentration was observed to decrease with an increase in reactor height for a fixed volume of support particles but as the fixed volume of support particles increased decrease in do concentration was found to be higher with the same increase in reactor height outlet fe3 concentration was observed to inhibit the process at inlet fe2 concentration of above 6 g l the conversion of substrate was not affected much by temperature in the range of 13 38 c ph between 1 3 2 2 ferric iron concentration upto 14 g l or ferrous iron concentration from 4 to 13 g l it was also observed that in the low ph range higher fixed volume of support particles favored higher conversion nikolov and karamanev 77 observed the biofilm formation rate in aifbbr to be 1 3 2 times faster than biodisk fixed bed and conventional 3 phase fluidized bed bioreactors they also observed the temperature ph and the product and substrate concentrations in a wide range did not affect the process rate much 3 3 dairy wastewater rusten et al 37 studied the degradation of dairy industry wastewater in an aerobic moving bed biofilm reactor using short plastic hollow cylinders having a cross in the middle forming four channels the pilot plant showed 85 and 60 cod removal at volumetric organic loading rates of 500 and 900 g cod m3 h respectively this type of reactor can suitably be used for treatment of effluents generated from food industries mainly due to the absence of clogging and channelling of the filter media and the ease of cleaning of biofilm media 3 4 aniline aniline and many other aromatic amines are the pollutants generated from several industrial and agricultural activities nikov et al 20 treated aniline in a turbulent aifbbr using eps beads pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as bacterial species surface of eps particles treated with powdered activated carbon pac 15 wt mesh 160 as adsorbent chloroform alcohol 1 5 as solvent and polymethylmethacrylate pmma 2 5 wt as glue was found to have excellent environment for growth of pseudomonas putida aniline biodegradation studies showed an almost two times higher degradation activity of pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa in fixed condition in comparison with free suspended cells along with pac several other low cost adsorbents can be tried apart from using these two pseudomonas species a mixed culture can also be tried 3 5 brewery wastewater sokół 10 studied the treatment of local brewery industry wastewater using kmtr kaldnes miljotechnologi as particles made of polypropylene the wastewater was enriched in mineral salts as per the recommendations of sokół 78 and sokół and migiro 79 cod removal was found to be dependent on mean residence time t settled bed volume vb to bioreactor volume vr ratio and ug for a set of t and vb vr initially the cod removal was found to increase monotonically but later found to decrease with an increase in ug this is due to the increase of the amount of oxygen transfer for the growth of microorganisms caused by the increase in ug while for a set of t and ug the cod removal was found to increase initially but later found to decrease with an increase of vb vr ratio an increase in cod removal was also observed upto an optimal vb vr ratio mainly due to the increasing growth of microorganisms on the solid kmtr particles beyond the optimal vb vr ratio the cod removal was found to decrease as a large portion of the reactor volume was occupied with solid particles causing aeration to be difficult 3 6 phenolic wastewater using different bacterial species such as microbial consortium obtained from a contaminated site soil sample 21 pseudomonas putida 22 24 pseudomonas fluorescence 17 25 29 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 16 several researchers have used aifbbrs to treat phenolic wastewaters discharged from a wide variety of industries they have used either ps beads eps beads or pp spherical balls as biomass support particles the phenol degradation was dependent on initial phenol concentrations liquid air flow rates dilution rates solids loading vb vr ratio temperature and ph of the system loh and liu 22 observed that for higher phenol concentrations the total degradation time decreased with the increase in gas velocity which indicated that degradation was oxygen limited aye and loh 23 observed longer phase lag for higher recycle rates and the system was able to absorb the shock well upto 5000 mg l for synthetic phenolic effluents begum and radha 25 found that the suspended biomass concentration increased gradually with increasing time while phenol was completely degraded at the end of nearly 5 days of treatment the average specific density of bio particles increased indicating the growth of biomass on solid particles 26 begum and radha 17 observed an increasing trend of cod removal efficiency till a certain particle aspect ratio loh and ranganath 24 integrated a fluidized bed of granular activated carbon gac to the reactor already developed by loh and liu 22 for cometabolic biotransformation of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp in the presence of phenol as a growth substrate pseudomonas putida was used for the degradation studies a sharp drop in substrate concentration was observed at the beginning due to adsorption onto gac the co metabolism was found to be oxygen limited at the higher phenol and 4 cp concentrations for higher concentration ratios the time for complete degradation was observed to be decreased with the increase in gas velocity in treating refinery generated phenolic wastewaters using activated sludge obtained from refinery operated biological treatment unit researchers such as sokół 80 sokół and korpal 81 sokół and korpal 82 sokół and korpal 83 sokół et al 84 and sokół and woldeyes 85 have observed the dependency of the cod removal on t vb vr ratio and ug they have also observed that the cod removal initially increased monotonically for a set of t and vb vr ratio and then decreased with an increase in ug the cod removal was also observed to be initially increased for a set of t and ug and then decreased with an increase in vb vr ratio similar behavior was also observed by sokół 10 while treating brewery industry wastewater 3 7 starch industry wastewater while treating starch industry wastewater in an aifbbr using a mixed culture obtained from the effluent treatment plant and irregular shaped pp particles rajasimman and karthikeyan 31 observed the ratio of bod to cod was 0 67 indicating that the starch industry wastewater was biologically degradable the cod reduction was found to decrease as the initial substrate concentration increased and at low concentration the degradation occurred at a faster rate than at higher concentrations it was also observed that as the flow rate increased the cod reduction increased and then decreased after the flow rate reached a critical velocity cod reduction was found to increase with increase in hydraulic retention time hrt for all initial substrate concentrations rajasimman and karthikeyan 32 followed the same procedure as those of rajasimman and karthikeyan 31 and observed the data obtained to be best fitted to first order model with a r2 value of greater than 0 9 for the treatment of starch industry wastewater in an aifbbr rajasimman et al 33 used a radial basis function neural network for modeling and found that neural network based model has very low root mean square error rmse values which implies that it is useful in predicting the system parameters with desired accuracy rajasimman and karthikeyan 15 studied the performance of an aifbbr at various organic loading rates olr and observed the cod removal efficiency to be high at low olr it was also observed that the reactor has an ability to withstand sudden organic loading while rajasimman and karthikeyan 34 observed the cod reduction to be dependent on the time bed height and air flow rates it was also observed that for a given time and air flow rate cod reduction increased initially and later found to decrease with an increase in bed height similarly for a particular bed height cod reduction was observed to be increased initially and then decreased with an increase in air flow rates 3 8 domestic wastewater domestic wastewater might be present in industrial wastewater hence its treatment is essential haribabu sivasubramanian 86 and haribabu sivasubramanian 87 have treated domestic wastewater in an aifbbr using pp particles as biocarriers and sludge taken from the domestic wastewater pit for inoculum preparation the domestic wastewater was characterized by cod only having concentrations in the range of 910 7500 mg l it was observed that of cod reduction increased with the increase in superficial gas velocity and hrt while it was found to decrease with the initial concentration of wastewater 4 critical analysis through the literature review it is evident that the characteristics of aifbbrs in terms of rtd dispersion coefficient voidage fluctuation elutriation velocity friction factor collision frequency liquid circulation velocity fluctuating frequency bubble rise velocity and heat mass transfer coefficients are dependent on the experimental conditions therefore it cannot be generalized however the parameters like bed porosity phase holdups pressure drop superficial velocities and minimum fluidization velocities can easily be correlated to have a preliminary idea on the performance of aifbbrs for three phase aifbbrs it can be concluded that as superficial gas velocity increases the bed dynamics such as the pressure drop bed porosity and gas holdup increase while solid and liquid holdups decrease critical gas velocity is found to depend on the type of particles initial liquid height column id while it is independent of ratio of static bed height to column height hc it is also seen that the pressure gradient increases with superficial liquid velocity till minimum fluidization velocity is reached and then decreases bubble size increases with superficial velocities and decreases with liquid viscosity it is observed that different microbes degrade different industrial wastewaters although some researchers have mentioned the specific microbial species for particular type of wastewater these results are not full proof several possibilities are there for this one of the many important reasons is that many polluting harmful compounds remain in the industrial wastewaters along with the main pollutant for example steel industry wastewater contains ammonia cyanide and many other compounds along with phenol the presence of other compounds in the system may affect the treatment process in the aifbbrs again many factors contribute to inhibit the treatment process being carried out by the useful microbes operating conditions such as temperature pressure ph and impurities other than the main component present in the wastewater may inhibit the growth of microorganisms thereby affecting the treatment process during the treatment process some of the side products are generated which may be harmful to the growth of microbes leading to the product inhibition further if the system gets saturated with the product the microbes do not get sufficient feed to grow as a result the process is affected if more microbes are taken then they do not get sufficient feed to grow as a result they start dying because of reactant inhibition dilution rate temperature ph and hydraulic retention time play major roles in the microbial degradation of wastewaters in aifbbrs parameters like initial concentration vb vr ratio liquid and gas flow rates size and shape of carrier particles and bed height determine the degree of treatment of the wastewater therefore a thorough research work is essential on the operating condition amount of microbes polluted wastewater in addition to the identification of pollutants in wastewater there is also a lot of scope for the kinetic study for continuous culture involving dilution rate in aifbbrs 5 future perspectives literatures reveal that wastewater of many more industries still need to be analyzed thoroughly by using inverse fluidization technology in aifbbrs there is a good scope for the use of irregular shaped polymeric particles as well as for naturally occurring substances which are lighter and hydrophobic in nature further use of innovative accessories for aifbbrs to speed up the treatment process is the topic of research which needs careful analysis for an economical and sustainable reason scope of using enriched microorganisms under optimum operating conditions for treatment of different industrial wastewaters can be studied to make the process further simpler acknowledgements one of the authors anup kumar swain is thankful to indira gandhi institute of

14547,recent progress on aerobic inverse fluidized bed biofilm reactors aifbbrs used for treatment of various industrial wastewaters is discussed in this article for the effective operation of aifbbrs knowledge of phase holdup pressure gradient phase flow rates minimum fluidization velocity friction factor bubble size and rise velocity mass heat transfer coefficients residence time distribution and settled bed to bioreactor volume ratio are essential in this regard different aspects of aifbbrs such as static bed height and shape size density type of carrier particles have been analyzed knowledge of the reaction conditions time temperature and ph type of microorganisms and nutrients concentration of pollutants and thickness of biomass growth on carrier particles are also essential various literatures reveal that aifbbrs have better operational stability and have higher organic matter removal capacity future research aspects of aifbbrs are also discussed in this article keywords industrial wastewater inverse fluidization aerobic treatment biofilm reactor 1 introduction although 71 of the earth s surface is covered with water 1 a mere 0 4 of all water on earth is considered to be freshwater 2 as the demand for the freshwater increases its shortages also increase the declining of freshwater is further aggravated due to the discharge of untreated and or inadequately treated industrial wastewaters into waterbodies which creates a risk of conflict reduces food production hinders industrial expansion and increases environmental as well as human health hazards 2 due to these adverse effects it is essential to treat industrial wastewaters with respect to different aspects such as oil and grease organic content biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod or total organic carbon toc ph temperature specific metals suspended solids nitrogen phosphorus or indicator microorganisms 2 methods adopted for treating industrial wastewaters are broadly classified into preliminary primary secondary and tertiary categories 3 which comprise of various physical unit operations and chemical biological unit processes 4 among these methods the secondary treatment methods have drawn much attention primarily because of their potential to remove suspended solids fine particulates and soluble colloidal organics by using bacteria and microorganisms the secondary treatment systems include stabilization ponds land disposal systems anaerobic reactors activated sludge systems and aerobic biofilm reactors 4 amongst different types of secondary treatment systems the aerobic biofilm reactor is the most recent system such reactors are compact 5 resistant to temperature changes to toxicity loads 6 and can treat wastewaters with low concentration of organic pollutants these reactors have higher degradation rates higher three times or more organic load uptake capacity less expensive to construct and conceptually simpler than any other secondary treatment systems 7 8 based on the state of biomass fixation the aerobic biofilm reactors are grouped into reactors with suspended biomass mixed reactors and reactors with fixed attached biomass 9 among the several types of aerobic biofilm reactors the fixed attached biomass reactors with moving beds particularly the two and three phase aerobic inverse fluidized bed biofilm reactors aifbbrs have gained much attention in recent years in which the solid carrier particles are made to move continuously by hydraulic means 8 in the three phase solid liquid gas conventional fluidization systems when the density of the solid particles is less than the density of the continuous liquid phase the fluidization of solid particles can be achieved either by the upward flow of both the gas and liquid or by a combination of the upward flow of the gas along with the downward flow of liquid 10 in these two cases fluidization of solid particles occurs in the downward direction which is termed as inverse fluidization 11 the main advantage of aifbbrs over fixed bed reactors is that the filter medium is not getting clogged these reactors offer high energy performance low pressure drop high gas holdup and high heat mass transfer rates 11 higher oxygen concentration in the reacting liquid effective control of the biofilm thickness and higher mass transfer from liquid to biofilm are observed in these reactors 12 some more advantages of aifbbrs are high volumetric efficiency long term stability and applicability to treat low concentration pollutants 13 due to vigorous motion of particles clogging channelling of the bed is not observed and a near constant biofilm thickness is maintained due to the particle particle wall collisions 10 in such type of reactors solids attrition is less as the movement of particles is facilitated in liquid medium carryover of coated microorganisms is also found to be minimum and refluidization in case of power failure is not a problem at all 14 as low fluid velocities are required to fluidize the lighter solid particles power consumption is low 15 simplicity in operation and handling low processing cost and low energy consumption 16 are some more attractive features of aifbbrs also these reactors offer low mass transfer resistance better contact among phases larger specific surface area of solid particles faster biofilm formation and greater biodegradation effect 17 18 for these above mentioned features aifbbrs are now a days being used for the treatment of industrial wastewaters for the removal control of pollutants like ferrous iron 12 19 aniline 20 phenol 17 18 21 29 and sulphate 30 treatment of wastewaters generated from industries like brewery 10 starch 15 31 34 textile 35 sugar 36 dairy 37 steel 16 etc have already been carried out by different researchers using aifbbrs in the present work literatures published on the use of aifbbrs for industrial wastewater treatment are reviewed 1 1 industrial wastewater characteristics industrial wastewaters are the wastewaters generated from raw material processing manufacturing and agro industries in which domestic wastewater may be present depending on the type of industries and its raw materials the wastewaters have varied compositions some of these can be easily biodegradable organically very strong or largely inorganic which result in large values of bod5 5 day bod cod and total suspended solids tss 2 for this reason the industrial wastewaters are generally deficient in nutrients the ph values are generally between 6 and 9 dissolved metal salts may be present in higher concentrations the discharge of industrial wastewaters may vary with the shift nature of the operations within a factory number of working days per week working hours per day operating procedures followed raw materials processed type and size of the industry level of recycling etc 2 the majority of pollutants found in industrial wastewaters can be grouped into conventional nonconventional and priority pollutants 38 bod5 tss oil grease oil animal vegetable mineral and ph belong to conventional pollutants category while the nonconventional pollutants include ammonia hexavalent chromium cod fluoride manganese organic nitrogen phenols toc etc 38 as many as 129 number of priority pollutants are found in the literature reported by keith and telliard 39 further the industrial wastewaters can be categorized into physical chemical biological and radiological types 38 40 the important physical characteristics are total solids content floating settleable colloidal and matter in solution turbidity odour colour and temperature 41 the chemical characteristics are broadly classified as organic and inorganic types organic components include a combination of carbon hydrogen and oxygen along with nitrogen in some cases for example carbohydrates fats oil greases phenols and proteins small quantities of surfactants organic priority pollutants volatile organic compounds agricultural pesticides sulfur phosphorus and iron may also be present the important inorganic components of industrial wastewaters are ph alkalinity chloride nitrogen sulphate sulphides h2s and heavy metals biological characteristics include various microorganisms some of which may be pathogenic in nature all microorganisms are not harmful some of these decompose the organic matter by aerobic or anaerobic means and reduce the cost of wastewater treatment 42 radiological characteristics include the radioactive materials generated from the nuclear power plant and from the mining of radioactive materials some of the reported characteristic values of industrial wastewaters are listed in table 1 1 2 transport mechanisms in aerobic biofilm systems a biofilm as per iupac international union of pure and applied chemistry definition is the collection of microorganisms in which cells are attached to each other and to a solid surface by a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances secreted by microorganisms 43 as the microorganisms are attached to a solid surface these can be retained in the reactor for a longer duration which is an essential feature for wastewater treatment systems the attachment of microorganisms depends on the factors like cell to cell interactions presence of polymer molecules on the solid surface composition of the medium 44 electrostatic charge on the surface of microorganisms ph of the solution degree of hydrophilicity of solid surfaces surface roughness and flow velocities past film surfaces 45 in the aerobic biofilm reactors with fixed attached biomass the biological conversions occur at first within the biofilm with the oxygen organic matter and nutrients getting adsorbed on the solid surfaces these are then diffused to the interior of the biofilm through the liquid film and then through the biofilm where the metabolic reactions occur by the microorganisms organic matters present in the wastewater in the form of colloids or suspensions do not diffuse into the biofilm directly until they are hydrolysed to low molecular weight organic matters oxygen either present in the liquid or externally fed to the reactors in bubble forms is consumed in the biofilm till the anaerobic conditions are attained this implies that the biofilm consists of two regions external aerobic region and internal anaerobic region reduction of nitrate sulphate and formation of organic acids occur in the anaerobic region the metabolic products thus formed are transported in the opposite direction back to the continuous liquid phase through the biofilm 45 the substrate donor and electron acceptor are also required to be diffused to the biofilm for the progress of biochemical reactions 8 the transportation steps are illustrated in fig 1 as oxygen is mainly required for the metabolic reactions in the aerobic region of the biofilm its transfer from liquid phase or from the rising bubbles to the interior of the biofilms is important but its transfer faces a series of mass transfer resistances from gas bubbles to the gas liquid interface through the gas liquid interface through the liquid film at the exterior of the gas liquid interface in the liquid medium through the liquid film at the exterior of the liquid cell interface in the liquid cell interface and at the reaction sites these are illustrated in fig 2 all these resistances depend on factors like hydrodynamics of air bubbles system temperature solubility of oxygen cellular activity solution composition and interfacial phenomenon 46 the growth of the biofilm on the solid surface consists of three stages when the film is thin all the microorganisms grow under the same logarithmic rate while the growth rates are constant when the film thickness is intermediate but if the organic matter supply rate falls below the minimum required rate for metabolic maintenance activity then the biofilm thickness decreases and when the film thickness is significant parts of the biofilm are detached from the solid surfaces 45 2 studies on aifbbrs knowledge on optimized operating conditions in terms of phase holdup pressure gradient phase flow rates minimum fluidization velocity friction factor bubble size and rise velocity settled bed to bioreactor volume ratio mass heat transfer coefficients and residence time distribution rtd are essential for the effective operation of aifbbrs for industrial wastewater treatment it is also necessary to understand the bed dynamics at first with respect to the effects of static bed height and shape size density type of carrier particles knowledge on the type of microorganisms nutrients and thickness of biomass growth on carrier particles along with the nature and concentration of pollutants are also necessary other than these knowledge on the nature and type of impurities present in the system and the reaction conditions time temperature and ph are also required to be analyzed 2 1 hydrodynamic characteristics the hydrodynamic characteristics of two and three phase inverse fluidization systems were first reported by fan et al 11 using lighter density solid particles recent progresses in hydrodynamics and process aspects of aifbbrs were well reviewed by arun et al 47 sur and mukhopadhyay 48 respectively several research articles on hydrodynamics of aifbbrs were published and some of these studies are briefed in table 2 renganathan and krishnaiah 49 developed generalized equations for predicting minimum fluidization velocities in 2 and 3 phase inverse fluidized beds which covered a wide range of variables using lighter dense particles 250 917 kg m3 in a size range of 0 08 12 9 mm and these equations satisfactorily reduced to limiting conditions of no gas and no liquid flow predicting the experimental data kim et al 50 studied the axial dispersion in a 3 phase aifbbr the axial dispersion coefficient dz was found to increase with the increase in the superficial gas or liquid velocities ug or ul but decrease with the increase in liquid viscosity μl the liquid phase contacting pattern in terms of liquid mixing is an important factor in design and operation of aifbbrs which can be understood by rtd studies the liquid phase rtd residence time peclet number and dispersion coefficient in a 2 phase ifb were studied by renganathan and krishnaiah 14 using a pulse tracer technique and deconvolution method of analysis it was found that the dz increases as both ul archimedes number ar increases and is independent of static bed height hs the stochastic method of monte carlo simulation was satisfactorily used by renganathan and krishnaiah 51 to study the hydrodynamic characteristics pressure drop bed voidage and minimum fluidization velocity of 2 phase ifb under steady and unsteady state conditions sivasubramanian and velan 52 used dimensionless correlation and a modified gas perturbed liquid model gplm to predict the experimental minimum liquid fluidization velocity ulmf in a 3 phase aifbbr it was found that both the models predicted the experimental ulmf data well for both newtonian and non newtonian systems while sivasubramanian and velan 53 used the modified gplm to satisfactorily predict the ulmf for 2 phase aifbbr for both newtonian and non newtonian liquids renganathan and krishnaiah 54 studied the quality of fluidization from the root mean square rms voidage fluctuation the rms results showed a maximum value with respect to average bed void fraction which is independent of hs and increased with increase in ar number sánchez et al 55 observed that the rtd were constant at different solid phase holdup ϵs in a 3 phase inverse turbulent bed itb indicating that the liquid mixing in the reactor was not affected by the concentration of solids and the reactor behaved like a 2 phase reactor howley and glasser 56 studied the stability of inverse fluidized bed ifb by the growth rate of one dimensional traveling waves 1d tw which was found to be in the direction of fluidization froude number fr and fluid to solid density ratio were observed to affect the stability bruce et al 57 have developed a model for the prediction of hydrodynamic variables such as phase holdups bed expansion and pressure drop but the major drawback of this model is that it did not include the free open area of the supporting grid as a variable renganathan and krishnaiah 58 studied the unsteady void fraction characteristics of aifbbr using particle bed model and a good agreement was found between the experimental and model predicted results based on a mellin transform montastruc et al 59 modelled the gas and liquid rtd in an aifbbr it was observed that the increase in the gas flow rate leads to higher mixing intensity of the gas phase while for a decrease in the gas velocity the ifb was observed to perform as a plug flow reactor pfr the liquid phase closely performed to disperse plug flow campos díaz et al 60 developed a new mathematical model to estimate bed porosity ϵ as a function of reynolds re and ar numbers in an aifbbr by which a standard deviation of 1 between experimental and calculated ϵ values was obtained some other advantages of this developed model were negligible wall effects better results for spherical particles with or without biofilm and applicability to nonspherical particles das et al 61 determined the minimum inverse elutriation velocity using single and binary systems of different polymeric materials and different non newtonian fluids the minimum elutriation velocity was found to be increasing with the increase in bed height but remained practically constant with varying liquid viscosity wang et al 62 simulated the flow behavior of particles in an ifb by means of two fluid model combined with kinetic theory of granular flow axial velocities of particles and the expanded bed height were found to be increased with an increase of liquid velocity temperature was observed to be independent of the flow of particles using immobilized enzyme nanosilica particles narayanan et al 63 designed an ifbbr which provided high fractional conversion at high substrate flow rates the resistance to substrate transfer into the nano support particles was found to be negligible das et al 64 developed empirical correlations to determine the bed expansion characteristics of ifb using non newtonian liquids as a function of physical and dynamic variables of the system an ann model was also developed by them for the prediction of bed height 2 2 mass transfer characteristics the effective operation of aifbbrs requires the knowledge of mass transfer characteristics gas liquid and liquid solid which can be evaluated in terms of mass transfer coefficients k oxygen transfer rate otr and liquid solid mass transfer resistance φ 18 the mass transfer coefficient k from the liquid to solid phase in an aifbbr was first studied by nikov and karamanev 65 as a function of ul for different types of liquid and solid phases the effect of ul on k was found to be negligible but with the increase in μl and particle density ρs the k values were found to decrease nikolov et al 66 observed that the ul has a negligible effect on the volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient kla but found the values of kla to be increasing with the increase of ug kim et al 50 studied the gas liquid g l mass transfer in 3 phase ifb and it was observed that the values of kla to be increasing with an increase in ug but decreased with an increase in liquid viscosity dolas et al 67 developed an ann model to predict the k values of 3 phase aifbbr using 10 mm polyethylene pe hollow spheres coated with benzoic acid ba and observed that the developed ann model has an accuracy of more than 90 in a 3 phase itb sánchez et al 55 observed that the kla values to be independent of both solid holdup and superficial liquid velocity kim and kang 68 studied the hydrodynamics and heat mass transfer characteristics of the inverse and circulating 3 phase fbrs in the ifbrs it was found that the kla values increased as ug increased but with increasing ul the kla values increased initially but later approached an asymptotic value with a further increase in ul it was also observed that the kla values for higher density particles were higher than lower density particles using aqueous ethanol solution and polypropylene pp particles in a 3 phase ifb hamdad et al 69 observed the kla values to be increasing with increasing ug the kla values in aqueous ethanol solution were found to be greater than those in water when particles were present again the kla values were found to be smaller for the case without particles liu et al 70 used a modified internal airlift loop reactor and found the kla values to be increasing with increasing ug and ul while it decreased slightly with increasing solid loading using various newtonian and non newtonian fluids sivasubramanian 71 observed the kla values to be increasing with increase in particle diameter decreasing with increase in solid loading and decreasing with the addition of organic additives fahim et al 72 used bacillus subtilis to produce biosurfactant in a 3 phase aifbbr which reduced the surface tension as a result the kla values decreased oxygen transfer was found to increase upto 175 and upto 24 with the increase of ug and ul respectively it was also observed that the oxygen transfer obtained kla upto 0 015 s was higher than any other bioreactors used for biosurfactant production a correlation was also developed based on dimensional analysis which could help in scale up of biosurfactant production haribabu and sivasubramanian 73 using a non newtonian xanthan gum fluid observed similar effect of ul ug solid loading and concentration of xanthan gum on the kla values as previously observed by sivasubramanian 71 for aqueous carboxy methyl cellulose cmc solutions using polystyrene ps beads in an aifbbr begum radha 18 28 observed the kla values to be increasing with particle size dp and then decreasing with the increase of ug both kla and otr were found to increase initially then decrease for a short while then again increase and reached a constant value higher ug produced bubbles of higher size db which dominated over the gas phase holdup ϵg values thereby decreasing the values of kla and otr mass transfer resistance is expressed in terms of effectiveness factor η and substrate diffusivity de due to dense and stable biofilm on smaller sized particles substrate diffusion into the biofilm was difficult thus de and η values were low and hence mass transfer resistance was high while for larger particles with less dense and loosely packed biofilm de and η values were high and hence mass transfer resistance was low for smaller sized particles the degradation was mainly due to intraparticular diffusion due to low η values while for larger particles as η values were high the degradation was mainly controlled by chemical reactions also with the increase in biofilm thickness the η values were found to increase further η values were found to decrease with the increase in biofilm dry density higher biofilm dry density provided higher mass transfer resistance and hence low values of η 18 using nanosilica particles in an aifbbr narayanan et al 63 observed negligible resistance to substrate transfer into the nano support particles this was due to very large specific surface of nano sized particles for which the η values for different kinetic equations and for wide range of substrate concentrations were unity 2 3 heat transfer characteristics because the liquid viscosity is highly temperature dependent the knowledge of heat transfer is a crucial factor for the industrial applications of aifbbrs the heat transfer characteristics of aifbbrs were first studied by cho et al 74 in 2 and 3 phase fluidized beds using pe and pp beads it was observed that the heat transfer coefficient h for higher density particles was higher than that of lower density particles the h values were found to increase with ug it exhibited a maximum value with increasing ul or ϵ the ul at which h was found to be maximum decreased with increasing ρs or ug kim and kang 68 found the h values to be increasing with ug in the aifbbrs which is due to more vigorous bubbling caused by higher ϵg and turbulence and a similar phenomenon was also observed by myre and macchi 76 the h values exhibited a maximum with increasing ul which is due to decrease in ϵs at higher ul heavier particles were found to be more effective for the heat transfer than the lower density particles which are due to their bubble breaking capability and frequent contacting with heater surfaces using pe and pp spheres and plates in pure water and aqueous solutions of cmc in 3 phase ifb son et al 75 observed the h values to be increasing with increasing ug or ρs but it decreased with increasing μl whereas it was maximum with the variation of ul or ϵ and the same had been observed by cho et al 74 further myre and macchi 76 observed that the h values were reduced with the addition of surfactant which was due to the decrease of the amount and size of larger bubbles at low ϵs the h values were found to be higher compared to h values at higher ϵs 2 4 biofilm and biomass characteristics the evaluation of biofilm and biomass characteristics are based on biofilm thickness and dry density suspended and attached biomass concentration cod substrate removal efficiency particle density 25 29 and superficial gas velocity 27 28 larger biofilm thicknesses on the particle surfaces do not enhance the degradation of wastewater rather limit the transfer of substrate and oxygen to the interior of the biofilm which causes the detachment of the biofilm pieces leading to improper bioreactor performance therefore the biofilm thickness should be maintained at such a value that the diffusional limitations are minimum karamanev and nikolov 13 observed the optimal biofilm thickness to be 100 μm the biofilm thickness and particle density were found to decrease while the biofilm dry density and suspended biomass concentration were found to increase with increasing ug all these are related to the cod removal efficiencies which increased till a critical ug is reached however above critical ug the reverse happened 27 28 biofilm thickness gets affected by particle size which increased as particle size decreased for smaller particle sizes the thinner biofilms were advantageous in aifbbrs contributing to higher cod removal efficiencies as they were more stable and dense 27 campos díaz et al 60 observed that the attachment of biofilm on particle surface was due to clusters of microorganism agglomerates suspended biomass concentration in the bulk continuous liquid phase was found to be increasing during the initial period of degradation due to the attrition of biofilm and then it was decreasing steadily due to the reattachment of biomass on solid particles and substrate inhibition effect 26 29 this concentration was found to decrease with the increase in solid particle sizes having thicker biofilms and vice versa 27 as the suspended biomass concentration decreased over the degradation period the cod values were found to decrease proportionately with decreasing substrate concentration this was due to the high tolerance of biofilms to higher substrate concentrations and constant biofilm thickness 26 27 due to the formation of less dense biofilm on the solid particles the attached biomass concentration was found to decrease initially as the degradation proceeds the attached biomass concentration was found to increase due to stable and dense biofilm for smaller sized solid particles the attached biomass concentration was found to be higher due to thin stable and dense biofilm and vice versa 27 the cod removal efficiencies were found to be proportionately dependent on the attached biomass concentration 28 2 5 degradation kinetics the substrate degradation behavior can well be understood from i cell growth and substrate degradation kinetics ii substrate inhibition kinetics for suspended biomass and iii kinetic model for attached biomass biofilm systems 26 29 the specific cell growth rate for batch systems μ is defined as 1 μ 1 x d x d t where x is the cell concentration dry while the specific substrate degradation rate for batch systems qs is defined as 2 q s 1 x d s d t where s is the residual substrate concentration of the solution for some enzymatic reactions the substrate may inhibit the cell growth and its own utilization under higher substrate concentrations various substrate inhibition kinetic models such as haldane aiba teissier webb and yano and koga are available to test with the experimental data 25 for phenolic substrate begum radha 26 29 observed the haldane equation to be fitted well both for μ and qs on the basis of highest correlation coefficient r2 and the lowest root mean square error rmse values the haldane model equations are defined as 3 μ μ m a x s k s s s 2 k i and 4 q s q s m a x s k s s s 2 k i where μmax is the maximum specific cell growth rate qsmax is the maximum specific substrate degradation rate ks is the substrate affinity constant and ki is the substrate inhibition constant when compared with other models the haldane model kinetic parameters such as ki was found to be highest and ks was found to be lowest for suspended biomass culture with respect to μ and qs 26 29 for the attached biomass biofilm systems as the microorganisms were made to adapt well with higher substrate concentrations both μ and qs were found to increase with initial substrate concentrations therefore the non inhibitory monod model equations were used which are defined as 5 μ f μ f m a x s k s s and 6 q s f q s f m a x s k s s where μfmax and qsfmax are the maximum specific cell growth rate and the maximum specific substrate degradation rate for the biofilm systems respectively the r2 values with respect to μ and qs for monod model were found to be higher than haldane model indicating that the non inhibitory monod model fitted well with the experimental data also it was found that the monod model kinetic parameter ks was lower than that for haldane model indicating that the microorganisms had a greater affinity towards phenolic substrate 26 29 3 treatment of industrial synthetic wastewater using aifbbrs the application of aifbbrs in treatment of industrial wastewaters by biological means over traditional methods has already gained much popularity in recent years to treat a variety of toxic pollutants and industrial effluents which have been studied by many researchers reactors having varied geometry have been used under different operational conditions some of the reported operational conditions and performance of aifbbrs for industrial wastewater treatment are briefed in table 3 for future operational strategies and for a sustainable system 3 1 glucose solution synthetic aqueous solutions of glucose 0 4 12 g glucose l were treated by nikolov and karamanev 12 in a draft tube type of aifbbr by a mixed bacterial culture of aerobic heterophobic microorganisms using pe granules as biomass support particles under the experimental conditions of 60 l h as gas flow rate 3 2 18 2 h as dilution rates and at 28 29 c the reaction rate at 90 conversion was found to be 80 mg glucose consumed per liter of reactor volume per hour the maximum rate achieved was 1000 mg l h when these results were compared with those obtained from basic draft tube airlift reactor without pe granules it was found that the aifbbr was 3 6 times more effective at a glucose conversion of 90 and the ratio between the maximal glucose uptake was 14 8 times higher as only a few hydrodynamic studies were reported prior to this work the glucose uptake capacity could be higher if the optimized hydrodynamic conditions would be considered for the present aifbbr karamanev and nikolov 13 treated an aqueous solution of glucose and found that at over 80 substrate conversion aifbbr was 25 times more efficient than a chemostat and this increased to 100 as the substrate conversion decreased to 20 this indicated that the aifbbrs would be more efficient if operated in series 3 2 ferrous iron solution the ferrous iron solution in wastewater is generally contributed by the wastewater generated during the leaching of metals in hydrometallurgy industries nikolov karamanev 12 karamanev nikolov 19 and nikolov karamanev 77 took thiobacillus ferrooxidans to treat wastewaters containing ferrous iron using expanded polystyrene eps spheres in a reactor having a volume of 1 7 l and diameter of 6 5 cm with 3 4 g fe2 l 60 l h gas flow rate and 3 2 18 2 h dilution rate nikolov and karamanev 12 observed the oxidation rate to be 0 7 g fe2 l h with a maximum value of 2 1 g fe2 l h at 70 conversion karamanev and nikolov 19 carried out the degradation studies at a substrate dilution rate of 1 08 h for ferrous iron concentration of 3 5 4 0 g l at 27 c the dissolved oxygen do concentration was observed to decrease with an increase in reactor height for a fixed volume of support particles but as the fixed volume of support particles increased decrease in do concentration was found to be higher with the same increase in reactor height outlet fe3 concentration was observed to inhibit the process at inlet fe2 concentration of above 6 g l the conversion of substrate was not affected much by temperature in the range of 13 38 c ph between 1 3 2 2 ferric iron concentration upto 14 g l or ferrous iron concentration from 4 to 13 g l it was also observed that in the low ph range higher fixed volume of support particles favored higher conversion nikolov and karamanev 77 observed the biofilm formation rate in aifbbr to be 1 3 2 times faster than biodisk fixed bed and conventional 3 phase fluidized bed bioreactors they also observed the temperature ph and the product and substrate concentrations in a wide range did not affect the process rate much 3 3 dairy wastewater rusten et al 37 studied the degradation of dairy industry wastewater in an aerobic moving bed biofilm reactor using short plastic hollow cylinders having a cross in the middle forming four channels the pilot plant showed 85 and 60 cod removal at volumetric organic loading rates of 500 and 900 g cod m3 h respectively this type of reactor can suitably be used for treatment of effluents generated from food industries mainly due to the absence of clogging and channelling of the filter media and the ease of cleaning of biofilm media 3 4 aniline aniline and many other aromatic amines are the pollutants generated from several industrial and agricultural activities nikov et al 20 treated aniline in a turbulent aifbbr using eps beads pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as bacterial species surface of eps particles treated with powdered activated carbon pac 15 wt mesh 160 as adsorbent chloroform alcohol 1 5 as solvent and polymethylmethacrylate pmma 2 5 wt as glue was found to have excellent environment for growth of pseudomonas putida aniline biodegradation studies showed an almost two times higher degradation activity of pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas aeruginosa in fixed condition in comparison with free suspended cells along with pac several other low cost adsorbents can be tried apart from using these two pseudomonas species a mixed culture can also be tried 3 5 brewery wastewater sokół 10 studied the treatment of local brewery industry wastewater using kmtr kaldnes miljotechnologi as particles made of polypropylene the wastewater was enriched in mineral salts as per the recommendations of sokół 78 and sokół and migiro 79 cod removal was found to be dependent on mean residence time t settled bed volume vb to bioreactor volume vr ratio and ug for a set of t and vb vr initially the cod removal was found to increase monotonically but later found to decrease with an increase in ug this is due to the increase of the amount of oxygen transfer for the growth of microorganisms caused by the increase in ug while for a set of t and ug the cod removal was found to increase initially but later found to decrease with an increase of vb vr ratio an increase in cod removal was also observed upto an optimal vb vr ratio mainly due to the increasing growth of microorganisms on the solid kmtr particles beyond the optimal vb vr ratio the cod removal was found to decrease as a large portion of the reactor volume was occupied with solid particles causing aeration to be difficult 3 6 phenolic wastewater using different bacterial species such as microbial consortium obtained from a contaminated site soil sample 21 pseudomonas putida 22 24 pseudomonas fluorescence 17 25 29 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 16 several researchers have used aifbbrs to treat phenolic wastewaters discharged from a wide variety of industries they have used either ps beads eps beads or pp spherical balls as biomass support particles the phenol degradation was dependent on initial phenol concentrations liquid air flow rates dilution rates solids loading vb vr ratio temperature and ph of the system loh and liu 22 observed that for higher phenol concentrations the total degradation time decreased with the increase in gas velocity which indicated that degradation was oxygen limited aye and loh 23 observed longer phase lag for higher recycle rates and the system was able to absorb the shock well upto 5000 mg l for synthetic phenolic effluents begum and radha 25 found that the suspended biomass concentration increased gradually with increasing time while phenol was completely degraded at the end of nearly 5 days of treatment the average specific density of bio particles increased indicating the growth of biomass on solid particles 26 begum and radha 17 observed an increasing trend of cod removal efficiency till a certain particle aspect ratio loh and ranganath 24 integrated a fluidized bed of granular activated carbon gac to the reactor already developed by loh and liu 22 for cometabolic biotransformation of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp in the presence of phenol as a growth substrate pseudomonas putida was used for the degradation studies a sharp drop in substrate concentration was observed at the beginning due to adsorption onto gac the co metabolism was found to be oxygen limited at the higher phenol and 4 cp concentrations for higher concentration ratios the time for complete degradation was observed to be decreased with the increase in gas velocity in treating refinery generated phenolic wastewaters using activated sludge obtained from refinery operated biological treatment unit researchers such as sokół 80 sokół and korpal 81 sokół and korpal 82 sokół and korpal 83 sokół et al 84 and sokół and woldeyes 85 have observed the dependency of the cod removal on t vb vr ratio and ug they have also observed that the cod removal initially increased monotonically for a set of t and vb vr ratio and then decreased with an increase in ug the cod removal was also observed to be initially increased for a set of t and ug and then decreased with an increase in vb vr ratio similar behavior was also observed by sokół 10 while treating brewery industry wastewater 3 7 starch industry wastewater while treating starch industry wastewater in an aifbbr using a mixed culture obtained from the effluent treatment plant and irregular shaped pp particles rajasimman and karthikeyan 31 observed the ratio of bod to cod was 0 67 indicating that the starch industry wastewater was biologically degradable the cod reduction was found to decrease as the initial substrate concentration increased and at low concentration the degradation occurred at a faster rate than at higher concentrations it was also observed that as the flow rate increased the cod reduction increased and then decreased after the flow rate reached a critical velocity cod reduction was found to increase with increase in hydraulic retention time hrt for all initial substrate concentrations rajasimman and karthikeyan 32 followed the same procedure as those of rajasimman and karthikeyan 31 and observed the data obtained to be best fitted to first order model with a r2 value of greater than 0 9 for the treatment of starch industry wastewater in an aifbbr rajasimman et al 33 used a radial basis function neural network for modeling and found that neural network based model has very low root mean square error rmse values which implies that it is useful in predicting the system parameters with desired accuracy rajasimman and karthikeyan 15 studied the performance of an aifbbr at various organic loading rates olr and observed the cod removal efficiency to be high at low olr it was also observed that the reactor has an ability to withstand sudden organic loading while rajasimman and karthikeyan 34 observed the cod reduction to be dependent on the time bed height and air flow rates it was also observed that for a given time and air flow rate cod reduction increased initially and later found to decrease with an increase in bed height similarly for a particular bed height cod reduction was observed to be increased initially and then decreased with an increase in air flow rates 3 8 domestic wastewater domestic wastewater might be present in industrial wastewater hence its treatment is essential haribabu sivasubramanian 86 and haribabu sivasubramanian 87 have treated domestic wastewater in an aifbbr using pp particles as biocarriers and sludge taken from the domestic wastewater pit for inoculum preparation the domestic wastewater was characterized by cod only having concentrations in the range of 910 7500 mg l it was observed that of cod reduction increased with the increase in superficial gas velocity and hrt while it was found to decrease with the initial concentration of wastewater 4 critical analysis through the literature review it is evident that the characteristics of aifbbrs in terms of rtd dispersion coefficient voidage fluctuation elutriation velocity friction factor collision frequency liquid circulation velocity fluctuating frequency bubble rise velocity and heat mass transfer coefficients are dependent on the experimental conditions therefore it cannot be generalized however the parameters like bed porosity phase holdups pressure drop superficial velocities and minimum fluidization velocities can easily be correlated to have a preliminary idea on the performance of aifbbrs for three phase aifbbrs it can be concluded that as superficial gas velocity increases the bed dynamics such as the pressure drop bed porosity and gas holdup increase while solid and liquid holdups decrease critical gas velocity is found to depend on the type of particles initial liquid height column id while it is independent of ratio of static bed height to column height hc it is also seen that the pressure gradient increases with superficial liquid velocity till minimum fluidization velocity is reached and then decreases bubble size increases with superficial velocities and decreases with liquid viscosity it is observed that different microbes degrade different industrial wastewaters although some researchers have mentioned the specific microbial species for particular type of wastewater these results are not full proof several possibilities are there for this one of the many important reasons is that many polluting harmful compounds remain in the industrial wastewaters along with the main pollutant for example steel industry wastewater contains ammonia cyanide and many other compounds along with phenol the presence of other compounds in the system may affect the treatment process in the aifbbrs again many factors contribute to inhibit the treatment process being carried out by the useful microbes operating conditions such as temperature pressure ph and impurities other than the main component present in the wastewater may inhibit the growth of microorganisms thereby affecting the treatment process during the treatment process some of the side products are generated which may be harmful to the growth of microbes leading to the product inhibition further if the system gets saturated with the product the microbes do not get sufficient feed to grow as a result the process is affected if more microbes are taken then they do not get sufficient feed to grow as a result they start dying because of reactant inhibition dilution rate temperature ph and hydraulic retention time play major roles in the microbial degradation of wastewaters in aifbbrs parameters like initial concentration vb vr ratio liquid and gas flow rates size and shape of carrier particles and bed height determine the degree of treatment of the wastewater therefore a thorough research work is essential on the operating condition amount of microbes polluted wastewater in addition to the identification of pollutants in wastewater there is also a lot of scope for the kinetic study for continuous culture involving dilution rate in aifbbrs 5 future perspectives literatures reveal that wastewater of many more industries still need to be analyzed thoroughly by using inverse fluidization technology in aifbbrs there is a good scope for the use of irregular shaped polymeric particles as well as for naturally occurring substances which are lighter and hydrophobic in nature further use of innovative accessories for aifbbrs to speed up the treatment process is the topic of research which needs careful analysis for an economical and sustainable reason scope of using enriched microorganisms under optimum operating conditions for treatment of different industrial wastewaters can be studied to make the process further simpler acknowledgements one of the authors anup kumar swain is thankful to indira gandhi institute of

14548,membrane biofouling defined as the attachment and growth of microorganisms on a membrane surface has been a major problem of membrane bioreactor mbr technology the anti biofouling properties like the inhibition of bacterial adhesion of a membrane are quite significant for a long term mbr operation surface modification is thought to be one of the most common approaches to improve this property in this study polymeric microfiltration membranes were modified by adsorption bisbal which is a synthesized chelate using bismuth and have a high anti bacterial effect on various microorganisms on the membrane surface using dip coating dc spin coating sc and low pressure treated coating lptc the purpose was to increase the surface hydrophilicity change the surface charge and gain the surface an anti bacterial characteristic it was found that the higher adsorption time lower feed flow rate and higher spinning velocity and pressure application increased the efficiency of the process during dc sc and lptc respectively furthermore improved strategies allow the adsorption of bisbal on the membrane surface and modified membranes has strong resistance to biofouling since modification resulted in a decrease in pore fouling and irreversible fouling for all type of membranes these membranes can be novel alternatives for energy saving mbr operation abbreviations as

organic carbon keywords membrane manufacturing bismuth anti bacterial spin coating dip coating 1 introduction membrane technology has been one of the proper treatment alternatives used for advanced water and wastewater treatment the number of these alternatives are limited because of strict standards for the drinking water supply and treated wastewater discharge to a receiving environment 1 2 membranes are semipermeable barriers and a technology that has a wide range of the products with different properties and a broad usage area membranes are separated into four groups according to their molecular weight cut off s as follows microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis 3 one of the most common advanced wastewater treatment technology based on the membrane technology has been the membrane bioreactor mbr systems which combines activated sludge process and membrane filtration using microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes 4 researchers had mentioned that mbr has an important commercial importance with its widespread application in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment judd 2008 it was also indicated that the market value of this technology was around us 217 million in 2005 and has an annual growth rate of 11 6 12 7 5 6 mbrs have important advantages with its high mixed liquor suspended solids mlss values and fewer area needs 7 9 however this highly concentrated microorganism community caused a biofilm formation on the filtration membrane via their tendencies on the adsorption of a surface and vacuum pressure through the membrane resulted from the suction of the permeate flow 10 the covering of a membrane with biofilm layers in this way is called as biofouling and it can be said that biofouling is the achilles heel of the mbr technology 11 13 there have been various commercial membranes that were put on the market by the manufacturers to meet the demand of the users researchers have carried out studies on the treatability of different wastewaters using the commercial membranes purchased from the manufacturers 14 17 besides a prominent research topic in recent years has been the manufacturing of novel membranes in the laboratory and researchers have tried to manufacture membranes with some additions for the creation of special properties to solve present problems in the market the most important property that is tried to be gained to a membrane is the resistance against the biofouling for a long and economic lifetime within this aim some metal ions and their compounds of which anti bio adhesive property are known and used in other industries like silver iron titanium aluminum bismuth etc 18 21 are also preferred for the membrane manufacturing while silver ions and silver nanoparticles nag have been used for various water filtration membranes made from cellulose acetate 22 polyimide 23 24 polyamide 25 one of the polymeric membranes manufactured with iron metal is nafion 26 27 besides titanium and aluminum addition had been mostly studied using polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes 28 32 the anti biofouling agents can be used while the membranes are manufactured or for the modification of the already manufactured membranes to change the surface characteristics in accordance with a purpose 33 by coating using inorganic additives 28 34 40 since membrane fouling is the accumulation of substances on the membrane surface and or within the membrane pores and adhesive interactions between the bacteria and the membrane surface structure are the main cause of early biofilm development 41 43 surface modification to change the properties of the membranes like roughness porosity etc can be a more effective way to prevent the biofouling when compared to changing the polymer blend solution which can be described as pre modification 44 45 various post modification methods have been investigated by the researchers for this aim including grafting 42 50 and coating techniques in the coating method the membrane surface is generally contacted with a modification solution or dispersion including anti biofouling agent as an additive and a layer of coating on the membrane surface is formed after evaporation following the contact 2 in addition it can be said that the coating method is usually easy to apply compared to the grafting method in this study researchers who had previously worked on the anti biofouling properties of a microfiltration membrane prepared with bisbal chelate added blend solution 51 had studied the modification of microfiltration membranes using a modification solution including bisbal three flat sheet microfiltration membranes which include a pes membrane manufactured in the laboratory and two commercial pes and pvdf membranes were modified with three coating methods which are common membrane surface modification method 2 for the physical sorption with dip coating spin coating and low pressure treated coating the anti biofouling properties of the modified membranes were determined with surface characterizations and activated sludge filtration performances in the light of the results it can be said that the novelty of this research that originated from being the first study on the surface modification using bisbal can make an important contribution to the literature and may result in an inspiration for the researchers who aim to modify their commercial membranes 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials polyethersulphone pes dimethylacetamide dmac and polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp used for membrane manufacturing were supplied from sigma aldrich germany bisbal a bismuth chelate was synthesized by mixing bismuth nitrate pentahydrate bi no3 5h2o sigma aldrich germany propylene glycol c3h8o2 sigma aldrich germany and 2 3 dimercapto 1 propanol sigma aldrich germany as described in ovez et al 51 all chemicals in this study were used without any further purification reactive orange 16 dye content 70 was also supplied from sigma aldrich germany with its powder form 2 2 fabrication of polymeric membranes three different polymeric membranes were used for further modification while two of them were commercial polymeric pes and pvdf microfiltration membranes purchased from microdyn nadir usa one is pes microfiltration membrane manufacturing in the laboratory using the phase inversion method the flux and pore size information is given in table 1 mp l005 membrane was manufactured using a dope solution including 100 ml dmac pvp 8 and pes polymer beads 16 this mixture was mixed at 200 rpm for 24 h duration at a 65 c temperature to obtain a homogeneous solution at the end of the 24th hour the solution was ultrasonicated to remove possible bubbles the polymer solution prepared for mp l005 membrane was poured on the surface of a lab scale membrane casting machine and membranes were cast on the support layers which have 200 μm thickness fixated glass plates by means of a casting knife the speed of the casting knife 50 mm s after the casting flat sheet polymer films were dipped in the water coagulation bath for 10 s with the glass plates to carry the phase inversion and obtain a solid film structure all manufactured membranes were stored in distilled water at 4 c temperature commercial membranes were stored according to the manufacturer s suggestions the pore size distribution graph was given in figure a1 in the appendix 2 3 modification of polymeric membranes membranes were modified using three different modification methods based on the physical adsorption of bisbal on the membrane surface and these methods are dip coating dc spin coating sc and low pressure treated coating lptc the schematic diagram of the modification methods and the illustration of the physisorption of bisbal on the membrane surface are given in figs 1 and 2 respectively as seen in fig 2 the sorption types of the bisbal molecules were tried to be described based on the application methods it is expected that bisbal molecules can be randomly adsorbed on the membrane surface layer by layer since there is not any control on the process in this method the relationship between the bisbal molecules and membrane substrata and between a bisbal molecule and another bisbal molecule an access of the bisbal molecule is not assumed into the membrane pores besides spin coating results in a single layer adsorption of bisbal molecules with a centrifugal force a certain amount of the bisbal molecules can be adsorbed on the membrane surface as required by the surface chemistry of the different polymeric substrata finally it may be said that the application of pressure in a filtration cell results in a vertical multi layer bisbal sorption and lets the bisbal molecules to reach into the pores the modification solution was prepared using synthesized bisbal chelate 51 for dc modification the membrane was immersed in the modification solution which is a 1 l solution of bisbal in water having 0 91 ppm bismuth concentration using a plastic coating container the parameter optimized for this method was the adsorption time the concentrations of residual bismuth in the samples taken from the coating bath at 6th 12th and 24th hours were measured to select the optimum adsorption time a spin coating machine was used for the modification with sc the optimization of this method was carried out with 25 mg l reactive orange 16 dye to select the optimum solution volume per time the solution flow rate and spinning velocity the dye for the optimization and the modification solution for the modification was poured using a syringe the initial bi concentration in the modification solution prepared for sc application was 9 1 ppm lastly a dead end filtration system amicon usa was used for the lptc method the optimization of lptc method was realized with 25 mg l reactive 16 orange dye and modification solution including 0 91 ppm bismuth metal to select the optimum stirring rate and adsorption time and see the effect of the pressure the areas of the membranes which were used in the optimization and modification studies were 146 cm2 14 6 cm2 and 14 6 cm2 for dc sc and lptc applications respectively the volume of the applied modification solutions for modification studies was 1000 ml 10 ml and 100 ml for dc sc and lptc applications respectively in order to get an initial bismuth amount of 0 0062 g bi m2 membrane bismuth concentrations in the samples taken for the optimizations were determined with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 3000 dv perkin elmer usa instrument 2 4 membrane characterization techniques scanning electron microscopy sem fei quanta feg 250 usa was preferred to observe the membrane surfaces before and after the modification the surfaces of the membranes were coated with 3 4 nm gold palladium pd au using a sputter coater quorum sc7620 uk the elemental composition of the membrane surfaces was analyzed using energy dispersive spectroscopy eds fei quanta feg 250 usa the contact angle measurements were carried out using a ksv attension theta instrument usa to determine the hydrophilicity of the bare and modified membranes the measurements were carried out three times for each membrane fourier transform infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance ftir atr instrument was used to see the bonds on the membrane surfaces perkin elmer usa lastly the modified membranes were subjected to a 1 h duration distilled water filtration to see the bismuth release and bismuth concentrations in the permeate were determined with an icp oes 3000 dv perkin elmer usa instrument 2 5 filtration tests and membrane fouling analysis water and activated sludge as permeability of bare and modified microfiltration membranes were determined using a dead end filtration unit sterlitech corporation usa pressurize by nitrogen gas the bare and modified membranes were subjected to a compaction with deionized di water for 1 h at 2 bar after the compaction water permeability of the membranes were determined using di water 10 min long di water filtrations were carried out at 0 5 1 and 1 5 bar pressures for water permeability the water flux of the membrane and relative flux reduction resulted from the modification were calculated using equations given below 1 j v a t 2 r r d w 1 j o j w i x 100 where j is the permeate flux l m2 h a is the effective membrane m2 t is the filtration time h v is the permeate volume l rrdw is the relative reduction in the flux of distilled water resulted from the modification jwi is the water flux before the modification and jo is the water flux after the modification a real as was also used for the determination of the anti biofouling properties of the membranes as was supplied from the aeration tank of an advanced biological wastewater treatment plant located in istanbul turkey as was subjected to an acclimation term using synthetic domestic wastewater chemical oxygen demand cod concentration 600 mg l for 1 month in a lab scale aeration tank before the filtration studies glucose nh4 2so4 and kh2po4 were used as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus sources respectively alkalinity source was nahco3 the properties of activated sludge can be found in table 2 the activated sludge filtrations were conducted at 0 6 bar and 1 h using a dead end stirred filtration cell at the end of this one hour the membrane was taken out and the surface of the membrane was rinsed using di water for the re determination of di water flux of the membrane to measure the adsorptive fouling between the biological materials in activated sludge and membrane surface the total resistances of bare and modified membranes in as filtration were calculated using the equation below 3 r t δ p μ j t where rt is the total resistance m 1 jt is the permeate flux at the as filtration m3 m2 s δp is the transmembrane pressure pa and μ is the viscosity

the biofouling and j2 is the distilled water flux of the membrane measured again after the cake removed m3 m2 h water and as filtrations were carried out in triplicate the flux profiles over time were monitored online gravimetrically 2 6 analytical methods total organic carbon toc concentrations in feed and permeate solutions obtained from xg and as filtration studies were determined by using a combustion infrared method on shimadzu v cpn toc analyzer japan to see the organic matter removal capacities of the bare and modified membranes bismuth concentration in the samples obtained from the optimization study of the modification methods and characterization study were quantified using a perkin elmer optima 3000 dv icp oes usa all measurements were carried out in the axial mode at 306 772 nm a 999 0 2 μg ml standard solution from inorganic ventures usa including bismuth water and 5 hno3 v v was used as an internal standard for calibration as recommended by the icp manufacturer and correlation coefficient was 0 9997 the detection limit of bismuth for the icp was 0 007 mg l mlss and cod concentrations were determined using standard methods apha 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of the modification methods the parameter of dc methods which should be optimized is the adsorption time after the modification solution was added into the dc bath liquid samples from the modification solution and 1 cm x 1 cm membrane piece samples from the membrane were taken at 0th 6th 12th and 24th hours the total bismuth concentration in the modification solution and the bismuth amount on the membrane surface were quantified using icp oes and eds measurements respectively the concentration and the amount changing in time are given in fig 3 as seen in the figure while the bismuth concentration in the modification solution had decreased in time the bismuth amount on the membrane surface had increased in time the initial concentration and the final concentration of bismuth metal ions in the modification solution were 0 91 ppm and 0 78 ppm respectively besides the amount of the bismuth metal ions on the membrane surface had increased from 0 22 to 0 43 in the last 18 h an increase of 95 5 in the adsorbed ions it can be said that the increase in the adsorption time during a dc application can cause a higher adsorption of the metal on the membrane surface and a 24 h duration could result in a sufficient bismuth adsorption in this study the sem images of the membrane pieces taken routinely during the dc application can be seen in fig 4 the increasing amount of the adsorbed bismuth metal ions on the membrane surface and into the membrane pores in time which can be seen visually when fig 4a c were especially observed also supported the qualification results the physisorbed bisbal molecules resulted in lighter and brighter areas because these molecules include bismuth ions the ions can be more clearly seen in fig 4d f the sc method was optimized using a reactive orange 16 dye the optimization parameters were the solution flow rate 10 ml min and 20 ml min and the spinning velocity 300 rpm and 3000 rpm by looking to the homogeneity of the dye on the membrane surface the optimum conditions for the sc applications was determined as 10 ml min solution flow rate which is given using a syringe to the system and a 3000 rpm spinning velocity high feed flow rate and slow spinning rates resulted in problems about the spreading of the feed solution on the membrane surface figure a2 the optimization of the lptc method was carried out using both reactive orange 16 dye and modification solution including bismuth metal ions the optimization parameters were the stirring rate 100 200 and 300 rpm and adsorption time 1 3 and 5 min in addition to this the effect of the low pressure 1 bar application on the efficiency of the adsorption was also studied firstly the homogeneity of dye on the membrane surface was observed at the end of the applications with different stirring rates and adsorption times figure a3 according to the visual observation of the dye layers on the membrane surfaces it can be said that a homogeneous spreading of the dye could not totally be achieved in all applications after 1 bar pressure was additionally applied a more homogenous dye spreading was observed if the decreases in the total bismuth concentration in the modification solution were examined fig 5 it can be easily seen that the increase of the stirring rate and the adsorption time resulted in a higher bismuth metal ion adsorption and an additional pressure could help to increase the adsorption capacity at the end of the optimization study the optimum contact time for dc application was determined as 24 h and modified membranes mp l005 dc mp005 dc and mv020 dc were prepared with a 24 h duration dip coating besides the selected flow rate and spinning rate for the optimum sc application were 10 ml min and 3000 rpm respectively modified membranes mp l005 sc mp005 sc and mv020 sc were prepared with spin coating lastly modified membranes with lptc method mp l005 lptc mp005 lptc and mv020 lptc were obtained using a pressurized filtration with a 1 bar pressure these modified membranes were subjected to characterization and anti biofouling studies using activated sludge 3 2 membrane characterization the water fluxes of the membranes before and after the modification were determined and the relative reductions rrdw in the flux resulted from the modification can be seen in fig 6 as seen in the figure modification carried out on the membrane surface resulted in a flux decrease 11 5 32 7 for all membrane types it is a well known fact that addition to the membrane surface can result in the reduction of water permeability because the additions create a blocking to water transport 52 the highest relative reduction in flux was observed after lptc application for commercial pes membrane mp005 lptc the lowest relative reductions in flux were obtained with all membrane types when the modification was realized with a spin coating the relative reductions in flux were higher in dc applications compared to the lptc applications for manufactured pes membrane mp l005 and commercial pvdf membrane mv020 this order of magnitude was different for the mp005 membrane the highest relative reduction in flux was at lptc application the relative reduction in flux is a representative result of the pore blocking by the accessed molecules of the modification solution bismuth chelate bisbal can be slightly ionized in di water after the physisorption and bismuth ion can also block the pores of microfiltration membrane the bisbal molecules can be located on the membrane surface and in the pores of the membrane the extra possible physical chemical bindings between the functional groups of the polymeric membrane substrata and bismuth ions and or bisbal molecules in the modification solution resulted in a decrease in water permeability of the membranes the average of relative reductions for three different membranes was approximately 21 4 while this kind of reduction in water permeability resulted from an addition is higher than the reduction observed after the bisbal addition into the dope solution 51 it can be said that it is quite lower than other anti biofouling membrane studies 18 the reason for the high reduction in flux for lptc application on the mp005 membrane can be evaluated as the high molecule adsorption on the walls of the pores resulted from applied pressure pes membrane manufactured in the laboratory was found as more applicable when compared to pes membrane manufactured commercially it can be said that the commercial membranes have more complex surface structure these results are similar to the experimental results obtained in the previous studies carried out on the membrane modification the researchers mentioned that membrane modifications with coating can result in the pore size narrowing on the membrane surface in some cases and reduced water flux was observed due to either surface hydrophobicity or lower molecular weight cut off mwco of modified membranes 53 55 in addition to water permeability contact angles of the bare and modified membranes were also measured and given in fig 7 as seen in fig 7 surface modification has a decreasing effect on the contact angle for all membrane types while the lowest contact angles were obtained after lptc application for pes membrane 70 0 and 50 0 for mp l005 and mp005 respectively the lowest value 41 was obtained after dc application for pvdf membrane the contact angle is a parameter that shows the hydrophilicity level of a membrane and the decreasing contact angle for a membrane after surface modification means that modified membrane surfaces tend to easily soak and let water to pass through the membrane pores after a combined evaluation of the results from rrdw determinations and contact angle measurements these modifications affected both the surface and the pores of both membrane types while the surface modification could help to increase the hydrophilicity there is some pore reducing effect when modification solution reached into the membrane pores moreover surfaces of the bare and modified membranes were observed using sem within the scope of the characterization sem images of bare and manufactured membranes can be seen in the first column of figure a4 when clean membranes in the first column of the figure are examined it can be seen that adsorbed bisbal chemical created an additional layer on the membrane surfaces the intense of this coating layer was the highest for lptc application and lowest for dc application for all type of mf membranes although membrane modification resulted in lower water permeability the higher activated filtration flux and higher flux recovery after the fouling can be compensated for these drawbacks lastly bismuth concentrations in permeate were measured to check a potential bismuth loss from the modified membranes table 3 the values showed that the loss of bi from modified membranes high in the dc application for pes membranes and in sc application for pvdf membranes it can be said that the bismuth loss from the surface of membranes is not directly related to the membrane pore size it is more related to the physical bonding with the material of membrane active surface group and bisbal chelate in addition the concentrations of bi in permeate samples was very low compared with bisbal amounts in dope solutions 3 3 biofouling study of bare and modified membranes the biofouling studies of the bare and modified membrane were carried out using a real activated sludge obtained from the aeration tank of an advanced biological domestic wastewater treatment plant in istanbul turkey the activated sludge performances of bare and modified membranes were monitored as flux profiles during filtration and resistance analysis the activated sludge filtration profiles for 12 different membranes can be seen in fig 8 as seen in the figure there are three groups of the membrane as follows manufactured pes membranes a commercial pes membranes b and commercial pvdf membranes c because it was seen in the characterization studies that the effect of the modification on a membrane can depend on the raw material of the membrane and pore size the permeate volume profiles were grouped by the membrane types mp l005 dc and mp l005 sc membranes had presented the highest fluxes and the bare mp l005 membrane had the lowest flux after 1 h filtration fig 8a mp l005 lptc membranes followed the mp l005 dc and mp l005 sc respectively by looking to the results of the first group it can be said that modification of the manufactured pes membrane using a bismuth chelated helped to increase the activated sludge filtration capacity of the membranes and the most successful application was dip coating for this membrane type in the second group the lowest permeate volume was obtained with the bare pes membrane at the end of the 1 h duration activated sludge filtration fig 8b it can be mentioned that the modification could also enhance the anti biofouling properties of this commercial pes membrane the highest permeate volume was seen during the filtration carried out with mp005 sc membrane in this group if the results obtained from the third part of the as filtration study are examined it can be seen that the lowest permeate flux was observed with the usage of mv020 sc membrane pvdf membranes had higher permeate volumes when compared to pes membranes the reason of that can be evaluated with their bigger pore sizes and higher hydrophilicity the different raw material also affected the anti biofouling behavior of these group the highest permeate fluxes could be obtained after an lptc application for a surface modification in order to explain in detail the fouling situation of modified membranes the filtration resistances rm rp rc and rt were calculated and graphically represented in fig 9 while the membrane resistances rm were close to each other for manufactured pes membranes mp l005 after the modification rm values of modified membranes were slightly higher than the bare membrane for commercial membranes mp005 and mv020 in addition to this it may be said that rm values increased when lptc was applied membrane resistance is directly related to the membrane characteristics like hydrophilicity and pore size the increasing rm values for commercial membranes substantially fit the hydrophilicity of membranes see the contact angles results the decrease in the contact angle of mp005 membrane after the spin coating application can also be seen in rm trend of mp005 membrane group the reason for the lower rm values of mv020 membranes when compared to the rm values of mp005 is the bigger pore sizes of mv020 membranes because membrane resistances are in an inverse relationship with the membrane pore size if the pore resistances rp were examined it can be seen that there is a decrease in rp for all modified mp l005 membranes this may be considered as the lower pore fouling tendency for all modified membranes bisbal could act as a preventer barrier for membrane pores while the lowest decrease in rp was seen in dip coating application the highest rp decrease was obtained in lptc application this can be evaluated with the difficulty in the reaching into the pores completely without pressure for the modification solution the decreasing effect of the modification on the rp can be also seen in the results of the mp005 membranes interestingly the modification with lptc resulted in an increase in the pore resistance of pvdf membranes besides the other two modifications could decrease the pore resistances in a similar way with the modification of pes membranes after a general view to all cake resistances rc results it can be mentioned that there is a decrease in rc while rp has an increasing trend the activated sludge had created a gel layer formation on the bare and modified membranes during the filtration the structure of cake layer on the membrane surface creates the development of membrane biofouling as given in table 2 the protein content in eps and smp of activated sludge was high when compared to its carbohydrate content in literature it was generally mentioned that the sludge with this characteristic had high adhesiveness and thus results in the formation of cake formation 56 because the rejection of the including of the as like smp and eps was higher for modified membranes of which rp s were higher and pores were protected against the adsorption of biological substances the amounts of the biological substances on the membrane surfaces were also higher for the modified membranes this phenomenon can be also explained with the higher hydrophilicity of the modified membranes via their lower contact angles the higher tendency to filtrate the water can cause thicker cake layer in addition to these frdw s of bare and modified membranes were calculated by looking their irreversible fouling situations after a hydraulic washing all modified membrane had lower frdw values when compared to their own bare membranes while the highest frdw s were 52 and 61 for dip coated mp l005 and mv020 membranes respectively the highest frdw 33 was seen in the spin coated mp005 membrane the lowest frdw s are 4 4 5 5 and 2 6 for mp l005 lptc mp005 dc and mv020 sc respectively it can be said that these values are significantly low and the modification with different methods could help polymeric membranes to enhance their cleaning capacity after an as filtration the structure differences of the gel layers onto the membrane surfaces for bare and modified membranes were also observed with sem analysis figure a4 the differences between the gel layers after the hydraulic washing followed by as filtration can also be seen in the second and third column of figure a4 the biocake layers on the hydraulic washed membranes are a sign irreversible fouling that could not be removed with physical cleaning and lower amount of biocake on the membranes means higher potentials of membranes for cleaning via their properties resulted from the modification the fouling was lower for all modified membranes when compared to the bare membranes for mp l005 membranes the fouling on the modified membranes after the washing was less than the fouling on the bare membrane the most effective modification for mp l005 membrane used for as filtration was lptc and all foulants could be removed with hydraulic washing when the sem images of mp l005 and mp005 membranes after the hydraulic washing are compared it can be seen that the modification of commercial membrane was more effective than the modification of lab scale manufactured membranes the foulants on the membrane surface mp l005 left after the hydraulic washing was more than the foulants on the modified commercial membrane although the raw materials and the pore sizes of these two membranes were the same by looking to the sem images of clean and fouled mv020 membranes it can be said that the foulant layer has a loose structure the reason for these differences between the foulant structures after the hydraulic washing could be resulted by the differences in the resistances of these membranes considering the results obtained in the study optimum modification combinations in terms of permeability and bismuth release are presented in table 4 the best efficiencies were obtained with different combinations according to the target 4 conclusion three different membranes were tasked to determine the results of different surface modification techniques including dip coating spin coating and low pressure treated coating the aim of this study was to find the optimum modification method for the membranes manufactured in the laboratory or commercially supplied the optimum combination which can be applied by the potential future users within the scope of a specific vision after making a selection in various alternatives final remarks that could be obtained within the scope of this study can be listed as follows dip coating spin coating and low pressure treated coating were found as feasible to modify the lab scale manufactured and commercial membranes for adsorbing anti bacterial chemicals higher adsorption time lower feed flow rate and higher spinning velocity and pressure application instead of vacuum helped to increase the efficiency of the modification during the dc sc and lptc respectively an average water flux decrease with a percentage of 21 4 was seen as a result of the pore blocking of the membranes via surface modification on the other hand modification helped to increase the flux during activated sludge filtration by means of the anti biofouling property since the time of the process and bismuth release are important for a real scale application of membrane modification it may be said that lptc is the most efficient method in addition to this the most efficient modification method for an mf membrane can depend on the pore size and material of the membrane or objective of the user because modification resulted in a decrease in pore fouling and irreversible fouling for all type of membranes these modified membranes can be novel alternatives for energy saving mbr operation conflict of interest the authors have declared no conflict of interest acknowledgement this study has been supported by tubitak the

14548,membrane biofouling defined as the attachment and growth of microorganisms on a membrane surface has been a major problem of membrane bioreactor mbr technology the anti biofouling properties like the inhibition of bacterial adhesion of a membrane are quite significant for a long term mbr operation surface modification is thought to be one of the most common approaches to improve this property in this study polymeric microfiltration membranes were modified by adsorption bisbal which is a synthesized chelate using bismuth and have a high anti bacterial effect on various microorganisms on the membrane surface using dip coating dc spin coating sc and low pressure treated coating lptc the purpose was to increase the surface hydrophilicity change the surface charge and gain the surface an anti bacterial characteristic it was found that the higher adsorption time lower feed flow rate and higher spinning velocity and pressure application increased the efficiency of the process during dc sc and lptc respectively furthermore improved strategies allow the adsorption of bisbal on the membrane surface and modified membranes has strong resistance to biofouling since modification resulted in a decrease in pore fouling and irreversible fouling for all type of membranes these membranes can be novel alternatives for energy saving mbr operation abbreviations as

water and wastewater treatment the number of these alternatives are limited because of strict standards for the drinking water supply and treated wastewater discharge to a receiving environment 1 2 membranes are semipermeable barriers and a technology that has a wide range of the products with different properties and a broad usage area membranes are separated into four groups according to their molecular weight cut off s as follows microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis 3 one of the most common advanced wastewater treatment technology based on the membrane technology has been the membrane bioreactor mbr systems which combines activated sludge process and membrane filtration using microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes 4 researchers had mentioned that mbr has an important commercial importance with its widespread application in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment judd 2008 it was also indicated that the market value of this technology was around us 217 million in 2005 and has an annual growth rate of 11 6 12 7 5 6 mbrs have important advantages with its high mixed liquor suspended solids mlss values and fewer area needs 7 9 however this highly concentrated microorganism community caused a biofilm formation on the filtration membrane via their tendencies on the adsorption of a surface and vacuum pressure through the membrane resulted from the suction of the permeate flow 10 the covering of a membrane with biofilm layers in this way is called as biofouling and it can be said that biofouling is the achilles heel of the mbr technology 11 13 there have been various commercial membranes that were put on the market by the manufacturers to meet the demand of the users researchers have carried out studies on the treatability of different wastewaters using the commercial membranes purchased from the manufacturers 14 17 besides a prominent research topic in recent years has been the manufacturing of novel membranes in the laboratory and researchers have tried to manufacture membranes with some additions for the creation of special properties to solve present problems in the market the most important property that is tried to be gained to a membrane is the resistance against the biofouling for a long and economic lifetime within this aim some metal ions and their compounds of which anti bio adhesive property are known and used in other industries like silver iron titanium aluminum bismuth etc 18 21 are also preferred for the membrane manufacturing while silver ions and silver nanoparticles nag have been used for various water filtration membranes made from cellulose acetate 22 polyimide 23 24 polyamide 25 one of the polymeric membranes manufactured with iron metal is nafion 26 27 besides titanium and aluminum addition had been mostly studied using polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes 28 32 the anti biofouling agents can be used while the membranes are manufactured or for the modification of the already manufactured membranes to change the surface characteristics in accordance with a purpose 33 by coating using inorganic additives 28 34 40 since membrane fouling is the accumulation of substances on the membrane surface and or within the membrane pores and adhesive interactions between the bacteria and the membrane surface structure are the main cause of early biofilm development 41 43 surface modification to change the properties of the membranes like roughness porosity etc can be a more effective way to prevent the biofouling when compared to changing the polymer blend solution which can be described as pre modification 44 45 various post modification methods have been investigated by the researchers for this aim including grafting 42 50 and coating techniques in the coating method the membrane surface is generally contacted with a modification solution or dispersion including anti biofouling agent as an additive and a layer of coating on the membrane surface is formed after evaporation following the contact 2 in addition it can be said that the coating method is usually easy to apply compared to the grafting method in this study researchers who had previously worked on the anti biofouling properties of a microfiltration membrane prepared with bisbal chelate added blend solution 51 had studied the modification of microfiltration membranes using a modification solution including bisbal three flat sheet microfiltration membranes which include a pes membrane manufactured in the laboratory and two commercial pes and pvdf membranes were modified with three coating methods which are common membrane surface modification method 2 for the physical sorption with dip coating spin coating and low pressure treated coating the anti biofouling properties of the modified membranes were determined with surface characterizations and activated sludge filtration performances in the light of the results it can be said that the novelty of this research that originated from being the first study on the surface modification using bisbal can make an important contribution to the literature and may result in an inspiration for the researchers who aim to modify their commercial membranes 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials polyethersulphone pes dimethylacetamide dmac and polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp used for membrane manufacturing were supplied from sigma aldrich germany bisbal a bismuth chelate was synthesized by mixing bismuth nitrate pentahydrate bi no3 5h2o sigma aldrich germany propylene glycol c3h8o2 sigma aldrich germany and 2 3 dimercapto 1 propanol sigma aldrich germany as described in ovez et al 51 all chemicals in this study were used without any further purification reactive orange 16 dye content 70 was also supplied from sigma aldrich germany with its powder form 2 2 fabrication of polymeric membranes three different polymeric membranes were used for further modification while two of them were commercial polymeric pes and pvdf microfiltration membranes purchased from microdyn nadir usa one is pes microfiltration membrane manufacturing in the laboratory using the phase inversion method the flux and pore size information is given in table 1 mp l005 membrane was manufactured using a dope solution including 100 ml dmac pvp 8 and pes polymer beads 16 this mixture was mixed at 200 rpm for 24 h duration at a 65 c temperature to obtain a homogeneous solution at the end of the 24th hour the solution was ultrasonicated to remove possible bubbles the polymer solution prepared for mp l005 membrane was poured on the surface of a lab scale membrane casting machine and membranes were cast on the support layers which have 200 μm thickness fixated glass plates by means of a casting knife the speed of the casting knife 50 mm s after the casting flat sheet polymer films were dipped in the water coagulation bath for 10 s with the glass plates to carry the phase inversion and obtain a solid film structure all manufactured membranes were stored in distilled water at 4 c temperature commercial membranes were stored according to the manufacturer s suggestions the pore size distribution graph was given in figure a1 in the appendix 2 3 modification of polymeric membranes membranes were modified using three different modification methods based on the physical adsorption of bisbal on the membrane surface and these methods are dip coating dc spin coating sc and low pressure treated coating lptc the schematic diagram of the modification methods and the illustration of the physisorption of bisbal on the membrane surface are given in figs 1 and 2 respectively as seen in fig 2 the sorption types of the bisbal molecules were tried to be described based on the application methods it is expected that bisbal molecules can be randomly adsorbed on the membrane surface layer by layer since there is not any control on the process in this method the relationship between the bisbal molecules and membrane substrata and between a bisbal molecule and another bisbal molecule an access of the bisbal molecule is not assumed into the membrane pores besides spin coating results in a single layer adsorption of bisbal molecules with a centrifugal force a certain amount of the bisbal molecules can be adsorbed on the membrane surface as required by the surface chemistry of the different polymeric substrata finally it may be said that the application of pressure in a filtration cell results in a vertical multi layer bisbal sorption and lets the bisbal molecules to reach into the pores the modification solution was prepared using synthesized bisbal chelate 51 for dc modification the membrane was immersed in the modification solution which is a 1 l solution of bisbal in water having 0 91 ppm bismuth concentration using a plastic coating container the parameter optimized for this method was the adsorption time the concentrations of residual bismuth in the samples taken from the coating bath at 6th 12th and 24th hours were measured to select the optimum adsorption time a spin coating machine was used for the modification with sc the optimization of this method was carried out with 25 mg l reactive orange 16 dye to select the optimum solution volume per time the solution flow rate and spinning velocity the dye for the optimization and the modification solution for the modification was poured using a syringe the initial bi concentration in the modification solution prepared for sc application was 9 1 ppm lastly a dead end filtration system amicon usa was used for the lptc method the optimization of lptc method was realized with 25 mg l reactive 16 orange dye and modification solution including 0 91 ppm bismuth metal to select the optimum stirring rate and adsorption time and see the effect of the pressure the areas of the membranes which were used in the optimization and modification studies were 146 cm2 14 6 cm2 and 14 6 cm2 for dc sc and lptc applications respectively the volume of the applied modification solutions for modification studies was 1000 ml 10 ml and 100 ml for dc sc and lptc applications respectively in order to get an initial bismuth amount of 0 0062 g bi m2 membrane bismuth concentrations in the samples taken for the optimizations were determined with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 3000 dv perkin elmer usa instrument 2 4 membrane characterization techniques scanning electron microscopy sem fei quanta feg 250 usa was preferred to observe the membrane surfaces before and after the modification the surfaces of the membranes were coated with 3 4 nm gold palladium pd au using a sputter coater quorum sc7620 uk the elemental composition of the membrane surfaces was analyzed using energy dispersive spectroscopy eds fei quanta feg 250 usa the contact angle measurements were carried out using a ksv attension theta instrument usa to determine the hydrophilicity of the bare and modified membranes the measurements were carried out three times for each membrane fourier transform infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance ftir atr instrument was used to see the bonds on the membrane surfaces perkin elmer usa lastly the modified membranes were subjected to a 1 h duration distilled water filtration to see the bismuth release and bismuth concentrations in the permeate were determined with an icp oes 3000 dv perkin elmer usa instrument 2 5 filtration tests and membrane fouling analysis water and activated sludge as permeability of bare and modified microfiltration membranes were determined using a dead end filtration unit sterlitech corporation usa pressurize by nitrogen gas the bare and modified membranes were subjected to a compaction with deionized di water for 1 h at 2 bar after the compaction water permeability of the membranes were determined using di water 10 min long di water filtrations were carried out at 0 5 1 and 1 5 bar pressures for water permeability the water flux of the membrane and relative flux reduction resulted from the modification were calculated using equations given below 1 j v a t 2 r r d w 1 j o j w i x 100 where j is the permeate flux l m2 h a is the effective membrane m2 t is the filtration time h v is the permeate volume l rrdw is the relative reduction in the flux of distilled water resulted from the modification jwi is the water flux before the modification and jo is the water flux after the modification a real as was also used for the determination of the anti biofouling properties of the membranes as was supplied from the aeration tank of an advanced biological wastewater treatment plant located in istanbul turkey as was subjected to an acclimation term using synthetic domestic wastewater chemical oxygen demand cod concentration 600 mg l for 1 month in a lab scale aeration tank before the filtration studies glucose nh4 2so4 and kh2po4 were used as carbon nitrogen and phosphorus sources respectively alkalinity source was nahco3 the properties of activated sludge can be found in table 2 the activated sludge filtrations were conducted at 0 6 bar and 1 h using a dead end stirred filtration cell at the end of this one hour the membrane was taken out and the surface of the membrane was rinsed using di water for the re determination of di water flux of the membrane to measure the adsorptive fouling between the biological materials in activated sludge and membrane surface the total resistances of bare and modified membranes in as filtration were calculated using the equation below 3 r t δ p μ j t where rt is the total resistance m 1 jt is the permeate flux at the as filtration m3 m2 s δp is the transmembrane pressure pa and μ is the viscosity pa s because total resistance is the sum of the membrane resistance the pore blocking resistance and the cake resistance the various resistances can be calculated as follows 4 r m δ p μ j o 5 r p δ p μ j 1 r m 6 r c r t r p r m where rm is the membrane resistance rp is the pore resistance rc is the cake resistance and j1 is the steady state flux of distilled water after removing the cake layer m3 m2 h finally the relative flux reduction of di water resulted from the biofouling was calculated using the equation below f r d w 1 j 2 j o x 100 where frdw is the relative flux reduction caused by the biofouling and j2 is the distilled water flux of the membrane measured again after the cake removed m3 m2 h water and as filtrations were carried out in triplicate the flux profiles over time were monitored online gravimetrically 2 6 analytical methods total organic carbon toc concentrations in feed and permeate solutions obtained from xg and as filtration studies were determined by using a combustion infrared method on shimadzu v cpn toc analyzer japan to see the organic matter removal capacities of the bare and modified membranes bismuth concentration in the samples obtained from the optimization study of the modification methods and characterization study were quantified using a perkin elmer optima 3000 dv icp oes usa all measurements were carried out in the axial mode at 306 772 nm a 999 0 2 μg ml standard solution from inorganic ventures usa including bismuth water and 5 hno3 v v was used as an internal standard for calibration as recommended by the icp manufacturer and correlation coefficient was 0 9997 the detection limit of bismuth for the icp was 0 007 mg l mlss and cod concentrations were determined using standard methods apha 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of the modification methods the parameter of dc methods which should be optimized is the adsorption time after the modification solution was added into the dc bath liquid samples from the modification solution and 1 cm x 1 cm membrane piece samples from the membrane were taken at 0th 6th 12th and 24th hours the total bismuth concentration in the modification solution and the bismuth amount on the membrane surface were quantified using icp oes and eds measurements respectively the concentration and the amount changing in time are given in fig 3 as seen in the figure while the bismuth concentration in the modification solution had decreased in time the bismuth amount on the membrane surface had increased in time the initial concentration and the final concentration of bismuth metal ions in the modification solution were 0 91 ppm and 0 78 ppm respectively besides the amount of the bismuth metal ions on the membrane surface had increased from 0 22 to 0 43 in the last 18 h an increase of 95 5 in the adsorbed ions it can be said that the increase in the adsorption time during a dc application can cause a higher adsorption of the metal on the membrane surface and a 24 h duration could result in a sufficient bismuth adsorption in this study the sem images of the membrane pieces taken routinely during the dc application can be seen in fig 4 the increasing amount of the adsorbed bismuth metal ions on the membrane surface and into the membrane pores in time which can be seen visually when fig 4a c were especially observed also supported the qualification results the physisorbed bisbal molecules resulted in lighter and brighter areas because these molecules include bismuth ions the ions can be more clearly seen in fig 4d f the sc method was optimized using a reactive orange 16 dye the optimization parameters were the solution flow rate 10 ml min and 20 ml min and the spinning velocity 300 rpm and 3000 rpm by looking to the homogeneity of the dye on the membrane surface the optimum conditions for the sc applications was determined as 10 ml min solution flow rate which is given using a syringe to the system and a 3000 rpm spinning velocity high feed flow rate and slow spinning rates resulted in problems about the spreading of the feed solution on the membrane surface figure a2 the optimization of the lptc method was carried out using both reactive orange 16 dye and modification solution including bismuth metal ions the optimization parameters were the stirring rate 100 200 and 300 rpm and adsorption time 1 3 and 5 min in addition to this the effect of the low pressure 1 bar application on the efficiency of the adsorption was also studied firstly the homogeneity of dye on the membrane surface was observed at the end of the applications with different stirring rates and adsorption times figure a3 according to the visual observation of the dye layers on the membrane surfaces it can be said that a homogeneous spreading of the dye could not totally be achieved in all applications after 1 bar pressure was additionally applied a more homogenous dye spreading was observed if the decreases in the total bismuth concentration in the modification solution were examined fig 5 it can be easily seen that the increase of the stirring rate and the adsorption time resulted in a higher bismuth metal ion adsorption and an additional pressure could help to increase the adsorption capacity at the end of the optimization study the optimum contact time for dc application was determined as 24 h and modified membranes mp l005 dc mp005 dc and mv020 dc were prepared with a 24 h duration dip coating besides the selected flow rate and spinning rate for the optimum sc application were 10 ml min and 3000 rpm respectively modified membranes mp l005 sc mp005 sc and mv020 sc were prepared with spin coating lastly modified membranes with lptc method mp l005 lptc mp005 lptc and mv020 lptc were obtained using a pressurized filtration with a 1 bar pressure these modified membranes were subjected to characterization and anti biofouling studies using activated sludge 3 2 membrane characterization the water fluxes of the membranes before and after the modification were determined and the relative reductions rrdw in the flux resulted from the modification can be seen in fig 6 as seen in the figure modification carried out on the membrane surface resulted in a flux decrease 11 5 32 7 for all membrane types it is a well known fact that addition to the membrane surface can result in the reduction of water permeability because the additions create a blocking to water transport 52 the highest relative reduction in flux was observed after lptc application for commercial pes membrane mp005 lptc the lowest relative reductions in flux were obtained with all membrane types when the modification was realized with a spin coating the relative reductions in flux were higher in dc applications compared to the lptc applications for manufactured pes membrane mp l005 and commercial pvdf membrane mv020 this order of magnitude was different for the mp005 membrane the highest relative reduction in flux was at lptc application the relative reduction in flux is a representative result of the pore blocking by the accessed molecules of the modification solution bismuth chelate bisbal can be slightly ionized in di water after the physisorption and bismuth ion can also block the pores of microfiltration membrane the bisbal molecules can be located on the membrane surface and in the pores of the membrane the extra possible physical chemical bindings between the functional groups of the polymeric membrane substrata and bismuth ions and or bisbal molecules in the modification solution resulted in a decrease in water permeability of the membranes the average of relative reductions for three different membranes was approximately 21 4 while this kind of reduction in water permeability resulted from an addition is higher than the reduction observed after the bisbal addition into the dope solution 51 it can be said that it is quite lower than other anti biofouling membrane studies 18 the reason for the high reduction in flux for lptc application on the mp005 membrane can be evaluated as the high molecule adsorption on the walls of the pores resulted from applied pressure pes membrane manufactured in the laboratory was found as more applicable when compared to pes membrane manufactured commercially it can be said that the commercial membranes have more complex surface structure these results are similar to the experimental results obtained in the previous studies carried out on the membrane modification the researchers mentioned that membrane modifications with coating can result in the pore size narrowing on the membrane surface in some cases and reduced water flux was observed due to either surface hydrophobicity or lower molecular weight cut off mwco of modified membranes 53 55 in addition to water permeability contact angles of the bare and modified membranes were also measured and given in fig 7 as seen in fig 7 surface modification has a decreasing effect on the contact angle for all membrane types while the lowest contact angles were obtained after lptc application for pes membrane 70 0 and 50 0 for mp l005 and mp005 respectively the lowest value 41 was obtained after dc application for pvdf membrane the contact angle is a parameter that shows the hydrophilicity level of a membrane and the decreasing contact angle for a membrane after surface modification means that modified membrane surfaces tend to easily soak and let water to pass through the membrane pores after a combined evaluation of the results from rrdw determinations and contact angle measurements these modifications affected both the surface and the pores of both membrane types while the surface modification could help to increase the hydrophilicity there is some pore reducing effect when modification solution reached into the membrane pores moreover surfaces of the bare and modified membranes were observed using sem within the scope of the characterization sem images of bare and manufactured membranes can be seen in the first column of figure a4 when clean membranes in the first column of the figure are examined it can be seen that adsorbed bisbal chemical created an additional layer on the membrane surfaces the intense of this coating layer was the highest for lptc application and lowest for dc application for all type of mf membranes although membrane modification resulted in lower water permeability the higher activated filtration flux and higher flux recovery after the fouling can be compensated for these drawbacks lastly bismuth concentrations in permeate were measured to check a potential bismuth loss from the modified membranes table 3 the values showed that the loss of bi from modified membranes high in the dc application for pes membranes and in sc application for pvdf membranes it can be said that the bismuth loss from the surface of membranes is not directly related to the membrane pore size it is more related to the physical bonding with the material of membrane active surface group and bisbal chelate in addition the concentrations of bi in permeate samples was very low compared with bisbal amounts in dope solutions 3 3 biofouling study of bare and modified membranes the biofouling studies of the bare and modified membrane were carried out using a real activated sludge obtained from the aeration tank of an advanced biological domestic wastewater treatment plant in istanbul turkey the activated sludge performances of bare and modified membranes were monitored as flux profiles during filtration and resistance analysis the activated sludge filtration profiles for 12 different membranes can be seen in fig 8 as seen in the figure there are three groups of the membrane as follows manufactured pes membranes a commercial pes membranes b and commercial pvdf membranes c because it was seen in the characterization studies that the effect of the modification on a membrane can depend on the raw material of the membrane and pore size the permeate volume profiles were grouped by the membrane types mp l005 dc and mp l005 sc membranes had presented the highest fluxes and the bare mp l005 membrane had the lowest flux after 1 h filtration fig 8a mp l005 lptc membranes followed the mp l005 dc and mp l005 sc respectively by looking to the results of the first group it can be said that modification of the manufactured pes membrane using a bismuth chelated helped to increase the activated sludge filtration capacity of the membranes and the most successful application was dip coating for this membrane type in the second group the lowest permeate volume was obtained with the bare pes membrane at the end of the 1 h duration activated sludge filtration fig 8b it can be mentioned that the modification could also enhance the anti biofouling properties of this commercial pes membrane the highest permeate volume was seen during the filtration carried out with mp005 sc membrane in this group if the results obtained from the third part of the as filtration study are examined it can be seen that the lowest permeate flux was observed with the usage of mv020 sc membrane pvdf membranes had higher permeate volumes when compared to pes membranes the reason of that can be evaluated with their bigger pore sizes and higher hydrophilicity the different raw material also affected the anti biofouling behavior of these group the highest permeate fluxes could be obtained after an lptc application for a surface modification in order to explain in detail the fouling situation of modified membranes the filtration resistances rm rp rc and rt were calculated and graphically represented in fig 9 while the membrane resistances rm were close to each other for manufactured pes membranes mp l005 after the modification rm values of modified membranes were slightly higher than the bare membrane for commercial membranes mp005 and mv020 in addition to this it may be said that rm values increased when lptc was applied membrane resistance is directly related to the membrane characteristics like hydrophilicity and pore size the increasing rm values for commercial membranes substantially fit the hydrophilicity of membranes see the contact angles results the decrease in the contact angle of mp005 membrane after the spin coating application can also be seen in rm trend of mp005 membrane group the reason for the lower rm values of mv020 membranes when compared to the rm values of mp005 is the bigger pore sizes of mv020 membranes because membrane resistances are in an inverse relationship with the membrane pore size if the pore resistances rp were examined it can be seen that there is a decrease in rp for all modified mp l005 membranes this may be considered as the lower pore fouling tendency for all modified membranes bisbal could act as a preventer barrier for membrane pores while the lowest decrease in rp was seen in dip coating application the highest rp decrease was obtained in lptc application this can be evaluated with the difficulty in the reaching into the pores completely without pressure for the modification solution the decreasing effect of the modification on the rp can be also seen in the results of the mp005 membranes interestingly the modification with lptc resulted in an increase in the pore resistance of pvdf membranes besides the other two modifications could decrease the pore resistances in a similar way with the modification of pes membranes after a general view to all cake resistances rc results it can be mentioned that there is a decrease in rc while rp has an increasing trend the activated sludge had created a gel layer formation on the bare and modified membranes during the filtration the structure of cake layer on the membrane surface creates the development of membrane biofouling as given in table 2 the protein content in eps and smp of activated sludge was high when compared to its carbohydrate content in literature it was generally mentioned that the sludge with this characteristic had high adhesiveness and thus results in the formation of cake formation 56 because the rejection of the including of the as like smp and eps was higher for modified membranes of which rp s were higher and pores were protected against the adsorption of biological substances the amounts of the biological substances on the membrane surfaces were also higher for the modified membranes this phenomenon can be also explained with the higher hydrophilicity of the modified membranes via their lower contact angles the higher tendency to filtrate the water can cause thicker cake layer in addition to these frdw s of bare and modified membranes were calculated by looking their irreversible fouling situations after a hydraulic washing all modified membrane had lower frdw values when compared to their own bare membranes while the highest frdw s were 52 and 61 for dip coated mp l005 and mv020 membranes respectively the highest frdw 33 was seen in the spin coated mp005 membrane the lowest frdw s are 4 4 5 5 and 2 6 for mp l005 lptc mp005 dc and mv020 sc respectively it can be said that these values are significantly low and the modification with different methods could help polymeric membranes to enhance their cleaning capacity after an as filtration the structure differences of the gel layers onto the membrane surfaces for bare and modified membranes were also observed with sem analysis figure a4 the differences between the gel layers after the hydraulic washing followed by as filtration can also be seen in the second and third column of figure a4 the biocake layers on the hydraulic washed membranes are a sign irreversible fouling that could not be removed with physical cleaning and lower amount of biocake on the membranes means higher potentials of membranes for cleaning via their properties resulted from the modification the fouling was lower for all modified membranes when compared to the bare membranes for mp l005 membranes the fouling on the modified membranes after the washing was less than the fouling on the bare membrane the most effective modification for mp l005 membrane used for as filtration was lptc and all foulants could be removed with hydraulic washing when the sem images of mp l005 and mp005 membranes after the hydraulic washing are compared it can be seen that the modification of commercial membrane was more effective than the modification of lab scale manufactured membranes the foulants on the membrane surface mp l005 left after the hydraulic washing was more than the foulants on the modified commercial membrane although the raw materials and the pore sizes of these two membranes were the same by looking to the sem images of clean and fouled mv020 membranes it can be said that the foulant layer has a loose structure the reason for these differences between the foulant structures after the hydraulic washing could be resulted by the differences in the resistances of these membranes considering the results obtained in the study optimum modification combinations in terms of permeability and bismuth release are presented in table 4 the best efficiencies were obtained with different combinations according to the target 4 conclusion three different membranes were tasked to determine the results of different surface modification techniques including dip coating spin coating and low pressure treated coating the aim of this study was to find the optimum modification method for the membranes manufactured in the laboratory or commercially supplied the optimum combination which can be applied by the potential future users within the scope of a specific vision after making a selection in various alternatives final remarks that could be obtained within the scope of this study can be listed as follows dip coating spin coating and low pressure treated coating were found as feasible to modify the lab scale manufactured and commercial membranes for adsorbing anti bacterial chemicals higher adsorption time lower feed flow rate and higher spinning velocity and pressure application instead of vacuum helped to increase the efficiency of the modification during the dc sc and lptc respectively an average water flux decrease with a percentage of 21 4 was seen as a result of the pore blocking of the membranes via surface modification on the other hand modification helped to increase the flux during activated sludge filtration by means of the anti biofouling property since the time of the process and bismuth release are important for a real scale application of membrane modification it may be said that lptc is the most efficient method in addition to this the most efficient modification method for an mf membrane can depend on the pore size and material of the membrane or objective of the user because modification resulted in a decrease in pore fouling and irreversible fouling for all type of membranes these modified membranes can be novel alternatives for energy saving mbr operation conflict of interest the authors have declared no conflict of interest acknowledgement this study has been supported by tubitak the

14549,wastewater streams generated during the leaching process of precious metals recovery e g gold silver contain high concentrations of toxic compounds being free cyanide cn one of the most important among them free cyanide is a toxic compound that affects cellular respiration and causes irreversible environment problems thus effective wastewater treatment processes should be applied to reduce cn without producing other contaminants this study evaluated the effect of rotational speed and carbon source on the biological removal of cn present on gold mine wastewater using a rotating biological contactor rbc a factorial design 23 was developed by triplicate n 24 to evaluate carbon source concentration commercial sugar cane 99 sucrose free cyanide concentration cn and rotational

rotational speed ω affected significantly p 0 05 during the biological removal of cn furthermore the highest biological removal percentage 96 89 was achieved when the rbc worked under the following conditions cn i 300 mg l fc i 3 8 g l and ω 5 rpm even though dissolved oxygen reached levels below 2 mg l thus biological removal increased when free cyanide and carbon source concentrations were at their highest level 300 mg l and 3 8 g l respectively however rotational speed 10 rpm diminished the bioprocess keywords biological removal dissolved oxygen free cyanide rotating biological contactor sucrose 1 introduction cyanide has been widely used among different industries such as plastic chemistry photography and mining 1 3 the mining industry uses alkaline solutions containing sodium cyanide nacn 100 500 mg l as a method to recover precious metals e g gold silver through cyanidation or leaching process 1 4 7 however wastewater generated from this process contains different forms of cyanide for example free cyanide hcn o cn weak acid dissociable wad strong cyanide complexes etc which as a whole are known as total cyanide 0 5 1000 mg l 8 13 free cyanide is known by its high toxicity it inhibits cellular respiration and causes irreversible environmental issues such as water pollution e g rivers and groundwater land and aquatic sediments contamination 7 9 10 14 16 in consequence it has been suggested that mining industries should reduce free cyanide concentrations present on wastewater to 0 1 mg l before its discharge 17 16 in order to reduce the environmental impact nowadays physico chemical processes e g inco process hydrogen peroxide process catalyzed by copper caro s acid chlorination iron precipitation and natural attenuation have been used to remove free cyanide present on gold mine wastewater 1 2 15 however these processes present several disadvantages including high costs maintenance difficulty and production of toxic compounds biological treatments however have become an alternative because of their effectiveness cheaper operating costs and less environmental impact 8 1 18 during free cyanide biodegradation microorganisms convert it to less toxic compounds e g nh4 y co3 2 2 6 9 19 21 through different pathways such as oxidative hydrolytic reductive and substitution transfer which enables them to tolerate and degrade the compound 22 21 studies have reported different genus of microorganisms able to degrade free cyanide for example pseudomonas e g p fluorescens p pútida p aeruginosa bacillus e g b pulimus c1 acinetobacter and burkholderia 23 24 11 15 because free cyanide as a carbon source represents a highly toxic compound e g growth inhibition 23 20 25 26 its biological removal is enhanced by the presence of an additional carbon source e g glucose acetate starch dextrose in the culture media which are mostly added as pure reactant 27 29 23 13 25 the most common bioreactors types used to remove free cyanide are fluidized bed reactor discontinued reactor packed bed reactor and rotating biological contactor rbc 30 33 the rbc system is widely used in the biological treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater because it consumes less energy and its operating conditions are cheaper than physicochemical processes moreover rotational speed enhances the correct function of a rbc system because it affects the mass transfer of dissolved oxygen substrate and nutrients from the liquid to the biofilm and helps to maintain the biofilm thickness as well 34 35 studies regarding to cyanide biodegradation evaluate one parameter at the time for example cyanide concentration 15 20 26 27 36 39 carbon source 26 27 38 hydraulic retention time 36 microorganism 27 ph 37 25 15 and temperature 15 which means that all the factors are independent of each other furthermore this method require large set of experiments is time consuming and its results could not be accurate due to these limitations factorial design 2n is commonly used to evaluate the effect of independent factors and its interactions over the response variable within an established set of experiments 40 here we used a factorial design 23 to evaluate the effect of free cyanide concentration rotational speed and carbon source concentration commercial sugar cane 99 sucrose on the biological removal of free cyanide present on gold mine wastewater using a rotating biological contactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater samples the gold mine wastewater samples were collected from orenas s a located at la lopez camilo ponce enriquez azuay ecuador utm 17 642505 e y 9 658117 n the first sample was from the cyanidation tanks 675 mg cn l and the second after the inco process so2 gas from the precipitation pool 10 mg cn

real gold mine wastewater containing free cyanide in the study developed by jumbo and nieto 42 after that 16s rna gen was amplified from the microbial consortium with 1492r primer and sequenced at macrogen finally the sequence was compared with ncbi database and bacillus sp was obtained as the most similar 43 unpublished 2 3 rotating biological contactor rbc the rotating biological contactor fig 1 a used in this study was built in stainless steel and with an electrical power engine the rbc has 5 compartments connected by small channels on its bottom compartments 1 2 and 3 had 6 wood discs for each compartment which were located on a horizontal axis and submerged 40 in the wastewater during the experiments and compartments 4 and 5 received the treated wastewater the rotational speed was adjusted manually and controlled automatically 2 4 biological removal of free cyanide 2 4 1 biofilm growth a batch culture was developed during 40 days to allow the biofilm growth over the discs the total working volume was 4 2 l compartments 1 2 and 3 and was composed by 83 of gold mine wastewater 300 mg cn l was diluted in distilled water 2 of liquid culture media table 2 15 of the microbial

transferred from each compartment to a test tube and centrifuged at 120 rpm during 15 min then 1 ml was poured into another test tube with the subsequent addition of 1 ml of dns the sample was transferred to a water bath 100 c during 15 min then cooled on ice during 5 min finally 8 ml of distilled water were added to the test tube and the absorbance 545 nm of the sample was measured with the thermo scientific helios épsilon spectrophotometer 2 5 4 ph the ph was measured on each compartment every 0 5 h with the hanna instruments hi 8424 ph meter 2 5 5 data analysis factorial design

linear regression model from the anova test table 4 the individual factors evaluated free cyanide concentration a carbon source concentration b rotational speed ω as well as the interactions a b and a b c affected significantly p 0 05 on the biological removal of free cyanide moreover r squared shows the power of the model table 4 the normal probability plot fig 2 indicates the real effect of each factor and its interactions tasted the points located closer to the fitted line were not significant e g a c and b c whereas the ones located far away from the line were significant e g a a b c a b c and b also a a b c a b c had a positive effect on the biological removal of free cyanide because there are located to the right of the line however b had a negative effect it is located to the left of the line fig 3 represents the average effect of factors a b and c between its high and low level evaluated respectively for example when the slope is negative factor b fig 3 a decrement in the mean biological removal of free cyanide occurs for the high level of factor b but when the slope is positive factors a and c an increment in the mean biological removal of free cyanide takes place at the highest level each factor respectively fig 3 thus biological removal of free cyanide increased when free cyanide and carbon source concentrations both were at its highest level 300 mg l and 3 8 g sucrose l respectively however when rotational speed was at its highest level 10 rpm biological removal decreased fig 3 therefore biological removal of free cyanide was favored when the rotating biological contactor worked under the following conditions cn i 300 mg l ω 5 rpm and fc i 3 8 g sucrose l biological removal of free cyanide reached 96 89 after 10 h fig 4 when the rotating biological contactor worked at 5 rpm 3 8 g sucrose l and 300 mg cn l and are concordant with their main effects fig 3 furthermore from fig 4 the highest biological removal took place during the first hour then a moderate biodegradation occurred from the 2 h until the end of the experiment although when the bioreactor worked at 5 rpm and 300 mg cn l without carbon source the biological removal of free cyanide was 83 89 fig 4 it could be notice that the absence of an additional carbon source decreased the main biological removal of free cyanide fig 3 also the maximum biological removal happened during the first hour and gradually decreased until the end of the experiment a previous work by jumbo and nieto 33 reached an 85 63 0 14 biological removal efficiency of free cyanide using the same rbc system and microbial consortium under the following conditions gold mine wastewater plus liquid culture media cn 280 mg l and sodium acetate as carbon source ph 10 0 5 hrt 10 13 h and rotational speed of 16 rpm furthermore sirianuntapiboon and chuamkaew 36 obtained an 95 2 0 2 removal of cyanide using a packed cage rbc system synthetic wastewater containing 400 mg l glucose as carbon source and 40 mg l cyanide highest concentration evaluated ph 6 8 0 6 hrt of 16 h and rotational speed of 3 rpm also when hrt was decreased at 8 h and the rest conditions were kept constant cyanide removal decreased to 93 6 0 1 as well from fig 5 when rbc working conditions were 10 mg cn l at 5 rpm and 3 8 g sucrose l a high biodegradation took place during the first hour then gradually increased and became constant after 10 h resulting in 93 02 biological removal thus mean biological removal of free cyanide decreased when free cyanide concentration was at its lowest level fig 3 despite of that at 10 mg cn l and 5 rpm without carbon source biological removal of free cyanide during the first hour was the same as from the second hour to the end of the experiment resulting in a total biological removal of 59 57 the lowest of all the experiments ran fig 5 consequently when free cyanide and carbon source concentration where at its lowest level mean biological removal of free cyanide decreased fig 3 jumbo and nieto 33 reported a 66 23 0 33 biological removal efficiency of free cyanide using the same rbc system and microbial consortium under the following conditions gold mine wastewater plus liquid culture media cn 10 mg l and sodium acetate as carbon source ph 10 0 5 hrt 10 13 h and rotational speed of 16 rpm in contrast sirianuntapiboon and chuamkaew 36 reached a 96 4 0 4 removal of cyanide using a packed cage rbc system synthetic wastewater containing 400 mg l glucose as carbon source and 10 mg l cyanide ph 6 8 0 6 hrt of 8 h and rotational speed of 3 rpm investigations developed by mathure and patwardhan 46 34 kadu and rao 47 have stablished a rotational speed range 0 1 10 rpm for the biological treatment of wastewater using a rotating biological contactor here we present for the first time and confirm that low rotational speed of 5 rpm was adequate for the biological removal of free cyanide present on real gold mine wastewater furthermore according to israni et al 48 and cortez et al 34 low rotational speed increases the contact time between wastewater and the biofilm increasing biological removal of free cyanide as well in addition low rotational speed benefits the mass transfer of

14549,wastewater streams generated during the leaching process of precious metals recovery e g gold silver contain high concentrations of toxic compounds being free cyanide cn one of the most important among them free cyanide is a toxic compound that affects cellular respiration and causes irreversible environment problems thus effective wastewater treatment processes should be applied to reduce cn without producing other contaminants this study evaluated the effect of rotational speed and carbon source on the biological removal of cn present on gold mine wastewater using a rotating biological contactor rbc a factorial design 23 was developed by triplicate n 24 to evaluate carbon source concentration commercial sugar cane 99 sucrose free cyanide concentration cn and rotational

conditions cn i 300 mg l fc i 3 8 g l and ω 5 rpm even though dissolved oxygen reached levels below 2 mg l thus biological removal increased when free cyanide and carbon source concentrations were at their highest level 300 mg l and 3 8 g l respectively however rotational speed 10 rpm diminished the bioprocess keywords biological removal dissolved oxygen free cyanide rotating biological contactor sucrose 1 introduction cyanide has been widely used among different industries such as plastic chemistry photography and mining 1 3 the mining industry uses alkaline solutions containing sodium cyanide nacn 100 500 mg l as a method to recover precious metals e g gold silver through cyanidation or leaching process 1 4 7 however wastewater generated from this process contains different forms of cyanide for example free cyanide hcn o cn weak acid dissociable wad strong cyanide complexes etc which as a whole are known as total cyanide 0 5 1000 mg l 8 13 free cyanide is known by its high toxicity it inhibits cellular respiration and causes irreversible environmental issues such as water pollution e g rivers and groundwater land and aquatic sediments contamination 7 9 10 14 16 in consequence it has been suggested that mining industries should reduce free cyanide concentrations present on wastewater to 0 1 mg l before its discharge 17 16 in order to reduce the environmental impact nowadays physico chemical processes e g inco process hydrogen peroxide process catalyzed by copper caro s acid chlorination iron precipitation and natural attenuation have been used to remove free cyanide present on gold mine wastewater 1 2 15 however these processes present several disadvantages including high costs maintenance difficulty and production of toxic compounds biological treatments however have become an alternative because of their effectiveness cheaper operating costs and less environmental impact 8 1 18 during free cyanide biodegradation microorganisms convert it to less toxic compounds e g nh4 y co3 2 2 6 9 19 21 through different pathways such as oxidative hydrolytic reductive and substitution transfer which enables them to tolerate and degrade the compound 22 21 studies have reported different genus of microorganisms able to degrade free cyanide for example pseudomonas e g p fluorescens p pútida p aeruginosa bacillus e g b pulimus c1 acinetobacter and burkholderia 23 24 11 15 because free cyanide as a carbon source represents a highly toxic compound e g growth inhibition 23 20 25 26 its biological removal is enhanced by the presence of an additional carbon source e g glucose acetate starch dextrose in the culture media which are mostly added as pure reactant 27 29 23 13 25 the most common bioreactors types used to remove free cyanide are fluidized bed reactor discontinued reactor packed bed reactor and rotating biological contactor rbc 30 33 the rbc system is widely used in the biological treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater because it consumes less energy and its operating conditions are cheaper than physicochemical processes moreover rotational speed enhances the correct function of a rbc system because it affects the mass transfer of dissolved oxygen substrate and nutrients from the liquid to the biofilm and helps to maintain the biofilm thickness as well 34 35 studies regarding to cyanide biodegradation evaluate one parameter at the time for example cyanide concentration 15 20 26 27 36 39 carbon source 26 27 38 hydraulic retention time 36 microorganism 27 ph 37 25 15 and temperature 15 which means that all the factors are independent of each other furthermore this method require large set of experiments is time consuming and its results could not be accurate due to these limitations factorial design 2n is commonly used to evaluate the effect of independent factors and its interactions over the response variable within an established set of experiments 40 here we used a factorial design 23 to evaluate the effect of free cyanide concentration rotational speed and carbon source concentration commercial sugar cane 99 sucrose on the biological removal of free cyanide present on gold mine wastewater using a rotating biological contactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater samples the gold mine wastewater samples were collected from orenas s a located at la lopez camilo ponce enriquez azuay ecuador utm 17 642505 e y 9 658117 n the first sample was from the cyanidation tanks 675 mg cn l and the second after the inco process so2 gas from the precipitation pool 10 mg cn

real gold mine wastewater containing free cyanide in the study developed by jumbo and nieto 42 after that 16s rna gen was amplified from the microbial consortium with 1492r primer and sequenced at macrogen finally the sequence was compared with ncbi database and bacillus sp was obtained as the most similar 43 unpublished 2 3 rotating biological contactor rbc the rotating biological contactor fig 1 a used in this study was built in stainless steel and with an electrical power engine the rbc has 5 compartments connected by small channels on its bottom compartments 1 2 and 3 had 6 wood discs for each compartment which were located on a horizontal axis and submerged 40 in the wastewater during the experiments and compartments 4 and 5 received the treated wastewater the rotational speed was adjusted manually and controlled automatically 2 4 biological removal of free cyanide 2 4 1 biofilm growth a batch culture was developed during 40 days to allow the biofilm growth over the discs the total working volume was 4 2 l compartments 1 2 and 3 and was composed by 83 of gold mine wastewater 300 mg cn l was diluted in distilled water 2 of liquid culture media table 2 15 of the microbial consortium 2 50e 07 cells ml and ph was kept constant at 10 5 0 5 8 m naoh the rotational speed was 5 rpm and the temperature was 20 5 c 2 4 2 experiments a factorial design 23 by triplicate was developed with the minitab 17 1 0 software table 3 the factors evaluated were rotational speed ω carbon source concentration commercial sugar cane 99 sucrose fc i and free cyanide concentration cn i over the response biological removal b r a total of 24 experiments and 8 controls were ran in a continuous system under the following conditions hydraulic retention time hrt of 10 h working volume of 4 2 l compartments 1 3 influent flux of 0 42 l h ph was kept constant at 10 5 0 5 and laboratory temperature of 20 5 c a cole parmer peristaltic pump was used to transfer the influent at 0 42 l h gold mine wastewater at 10 or 300 mgcn l liquid culture media with or without carbon source ph 10 5 0 5 from the reservoir pool to the rbc the flux entered by the compartment 1 passed through small channels to compartments 2 and 3 where the biological removal took place to finally exit in compartments 4 and 5 control experiments without biofilm were performed using gold mine wastewater 10 or 300 mg cn l and liquid culture media without carbon source ph 10 5 0 5 fig 1b 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 free cyanide free cyanide concentration was quantified every hour at each compartment by two methods for concentrations 10 mg cn l an ion selective cyanide electrode thermo scientific orion 9606 bnwp was used for concentrations 10 mg cn l titration with silver nitrate agno 3 was used with potassium iodide ki 5 as indicator 8 2 5 2 dissolved oxygen a 30 ml sample was taken from each compartment every hour then do was measured using a hanna instruments dissolved oxygen bod meter hi 98186 019 44 2 5 3 carbon source quantification carbon source biodegradation was quantified every two hours with dns method 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid as reported by gil et al 45 a 10 ml sample was transferred from each compartment to a test tube and centrifuged at 120 rpm during 15 min then 1 ml was poured into another test tube with the subsequent addition of 1 ml of dns the sample was transferred to a water bath 100 c during 15 min then cooled on ice during 5 min finally 8 ml of distilled water were added to the test tube and the absorbance 545 nm of the sample was measured with the thermo scientific helios épsilon spectrophotometer 2 5 4 ph the ph was measured on each compartment every 0 5 h with the hanna instruments hi 8424 ph meter 2 5 5 data analysis factorial design analysis was developed with minitab software 17 1 0 and the data analysis performed in microsoft excel software 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological removal of free cyanide according to the linear regression model from the anova test table 4 the individual factors evaluated free cyanide concentration a carbon source concentration b rotational speed ω as well as the interactions a b and a b c affected significantly p 0 05 on the biological removal of free cyanide moreover r squared shows the power of the model table 4 the normal probability plot fig 2 indicates the real effect of each factor and its interactions tasted the points located closer to the fitted line were not significant e g a c and b c whereas the ones located far away from the line were significant e g a a b c a b c and b also a a b c a b c had a positive effect on the biological removal of free cyanide because there are located to the right of the line however b had a negative effect it is located to the left of the line fig 3 represents the average effect of factors a b and c between its high and low level evaluated respectively for example when the slope is negative factor b fig 3 a decrement in the mean biological removal of free cyanide occurs for the high level of factor b but when the slope is positive factors a and c an increment in the mean biological removal of free cyanide takes place at the highest level each factor respectively fig 3 thus biological removal of free cyanide increased when free cyanide and carbon source concentrations both were at its highest level 300 mg l and 3 8 g sucrose l respectively however when rotational speed was at its highest level 10 rpm biological removal decreased fig 3 therefore biological removal of free cyanide was favored when the rotating biological contactor worked under the following conditions cn i 300 mg l ω 5 rpm and fc i 3 8 g sucrose l biological removal of free cyanide reached 96 89 after 10 h fig 4 when the rotating biological contactor worked at 5 rpm 3 8 g sucrose l and 300 mg cn l and are concordant with their main effects fig 3 furthermore from fig 4 the highest biological removal took place during the first hour then a moderate biodegradation occurred from the 2 h until the end of the experiment although when the bioreactor worked at 5 rpm and 300 mg cn l without carbon source the biological removal of free cyanide was 83 89 fig 4 it could be notice that the absence of an additional carbon source decreased the main biological removal of free cyanide fig 3 also the maximum biological removal happened during the first hour and gradually decreased until the end of the experiment a previous work by jumbo and nieto 33 reached an 85 63 0 14 biological removal efficiency of free cyanide using the same rbc system and microbial consortium under the following conditions gold mine wastewater plus liquid culture media cn 280 mg l and sodium acetate as carbon source ph 10 0 5 hrt 10 13 h and rotational speed of 16 rpm furthermore sirianuntapiboon and chuamkaew 36 obtained an 95 2 0 2 removal of cyanide using a packed cage rbc system synthetic wastewater containing 400 mg l glucose as carbon source and 40 mg l cyanide highest concentration evaluated ph 6 8 0 6 hrt of 16 h and rotational speed of 3 rpm also when hrt was decreased at 8 h and the rest conditions were kept constant cyanide removal decreased to 93 6 0 1 as well from fig 5 when rbc working conditions were 10 mg cn l at 5 rpm and 3 8 g sucrose l a high biodegradation took place during the first hour then gradually increased and became constant after 10 h resulting in 93 02 biological removal thus mean biological removal of free cyanide decreased when free cyanide concentration was at its lowest level fig 3 despite of that at 10 mg cn l and 5 rpm without carbon source biological removal of free cyanide during the first hour was the same as from the second hour to the end of the experiment resulting in a total biological removal of 59 57 the lowest of all the experiments ran fig 5 consequently when free cyanide and carbon source concentration where at its lowest level mean biological removal of free cyanide decreased fig 3 jumbo and nieto 33 reported a 66 23 0 33 biological removal efficiency of free cyanide using the same rbc system and microbial consortium under the following conditions gold mine wastewater plus liquid culture media cn 10 mg l and sodium acetate as carbon source ph 10 0 5 hrt 10 13 h and rotational speed of 16 rpm in contrast sirianuntapiboon and chuamkaew 36 reached a 96 4 0 4 removal of cyanide using a packed cage rbc system synthetic wastewater containing 400 mg l glucose as carbon source and 10 mg l cyanide ph 6 8 0 6 hrt of 8 h and rotational speed of 3 rpm investigations developed by mathure and patwardhan 46 34 kadu and rao 47 have stablished a rotational speed range 0 1 10 rpm for the biological treatment of wastewater using a rotating biological contactor here we present for the first time and confirm that low rotational speed of 5 rpm was adequate for the biological removal of free cyanide present on real gold mine wastewater furthermore according to israni et al 48 and cortez et al 34 low rotational speed increases the contact time between wastewater and the biofilm increasing biological removal of free cyanide as well in addition low rotational speed benefits the mass transfer of nutrients e g carbon source free cyanide oxygen etc between the liquid and the biofilm 47 49 50 34 regarding to the dissolved oxygen fig 6 a shows that free cyanide biodegradation without carbon
