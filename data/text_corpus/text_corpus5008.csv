25040,the bilberry vs cowberry fine scale dynamics has been modelled by a discrete markov chain of transitions among the four observable statuses of permanent sample plots bilberry vaccinium myrtillus alone cowberry v vitis idaea alone both species and species free logofet and maslov 2019 six successive examinations of spp presence absence on 20 20 cm quadrats located along permanent transects in a scots pine boreal forest were initiated in 1980 26 years after a forest fire in 1954 and repeated in every 5 years thus scoping the 25 years of post fire succession maslov 1989 those data have provided the exact calibration of 5 one step transition matrices forming a nonautonomous markov chain model its basic prediction forward forecast has been obtained as the limiting distribution of states generated by the geometric average of transition matrices featured increase in the share species coexistence presented in this paper the alternate modes of prediction are the validation forecast and the backward prediction the former is implemented as the geometric average of the first 4 one step matrices and its dominant eigenvector as the limiting distribution of quadrate states it appears to hit a 5 vicinity of the distribution observed in 2005 thus certifying a success of model validation as regards the backward prediction i propose a technique that realizes the idea of backward prediction by means of reversing the time dimension in the observation data the ensuing formula for the average backward transition matrix looks somewhat different from that for the forward one but enables calculating the matrix as reliable as the forward formula does although the 1955 distribution back predicted from the observed 1980 one cannot be quantitatively interpreted as a

post fire succession markov chain matrix average validation forecast reversal of data backward prediction 1 introduction in the first part of this publication logofet and maslov 2019 we reported on a case study of the fine scale dynamics of two competing species bilberry vaccinium myrtillus and cowberry v vitis idaea at the later stages of post fire succession in a scots pine boreal forest the observation project was initiated in 26 years after the fire of 1954 maslov 1989 1990 2001 and the data we dealt with in modelling efforts had been collected by 6 consecutive examinations of bilberry or and cowberry rooted presence absence in 20 20 cm quadrats located along permanent transects in a scots pine boreal forest those data featured a great sample size 2000 quadrats 6 examinations and a 5 year interval for each pair of examination re examination and the data have enabled us to construct a markov chain model for the fine scale dynamics of these dominant species logofet and maslov 2019 the discrete time nonautonomous model consists of the five time dependent one step transition matrices that describe changes occurring in the quadrat status for the 5 years in the following 4 terms species free quadrat bilberry alone cowberry alone both species the average matrix calculated as the 5 th power matrix root from the product of the five one step transition matrices in the chronological order has been treated again as a transition matrix and it has provided for the spatial and temporal characteristics of the observed dynamics summarizing the whole observation period the main outcome of this markov chain model has been the global directionality of the fine scale dynamics the distribution of quadrate types tends to the one where 37 of quadrats are occupied by the bilberry alone 11 by cowberry alone 38 by the both species and 14 be species free ibidem it has been shown for the first time that the share of cowberry alone quadrats decreases notably in the course of succession whereas the share of species coexistence quadrats increases ibidem this is apparently a forward prediction however when submitted for publication the manuscript was criticized for not implementing any backward calculation from the distribution observed at the first examination in 1980 to what might be 25 years ago according to the model this might confirm or refute the directionality revealed in the forward calculation in response the authors argued that the backward calculation is not a routine matter in this case unlike in ode models and it deserves special consideration to be presented as another publication that publication might also respond to another point of criticism namely the lack of any validation forecast i e the use of a major part of data to calibrate the model and to validate the calibrated model by comparing its forward prediction with the rest of data i do so in the present paper as regards the backward prediction it might concern a theme of reverse markov chains that entered the textbook more than 60 years ago kemeny and snelll 1960 5 3 however quite a special class only of markov chains turned out reversible characterized by a special kind of symmetry in the transition matrix theorem 5 3 3 cited from kemeny and snelll 1976 and this is why the routine method fails in a discrete markov chain model without any symmetry next section presents the former markov chain model in the formal and quantitative terms section 3 reports on the validation forecast in section 4 i explain why the formal reversal of the basic model equation cannot be treated as a backward prediction nevertheless the idea of time reversal can still be realised in the markov chain model and i describe in section 5 how with what purpose and with what result it can be done in any finite markov chain such as the chain from our former case study 2 markov chain model of bilberry vs cowberry fine scale dynamics the study area and data collected are characterized briefly in the introduction and have been described in the former publication logofet and maslov 2019 in greater detail so that i cite here just the material needed to see the alternate modes of prediction fig 1 presents the directed graph of possible transitions among the four statuses of quadrates for the time interval 5 years between two successive examinations it is

the divisor being equal to the sum along the proper column table 2 if p t denotes the transition matrix of the chain then we have 1 p t t t diag n t 1 t 1980 1985 2000 where diag n t is the diagonal matrix with the components of n t forming its main diagonal this formula provides for the generic property of transition matrices namely its being row or column stochastic a given nonnegative matrix is called row or column stochastic if each of its row or column respectively totals to 1 gantmacher 1967 horn and johnson 1990 formula 1 gives the stochasticity in columns and i use this formalism everywhere further let x t denote the same distribution of quadrate states as n t but in relative numbers or percentages it obeys the main equation of the markov chain kemeny snell 1976 logofet 2010 2 x t δt p t x t t 1980 1985 2000 δt 5 since matrix p t depends on t we are dealing with a time inhomogeneous markov chain or nonautonomous model in the general sense inferred from observation data each of five matrices p t characterizes indirectly the habitat conditions during its own 5 year interval and has its own formal characteristics in particular the limiting vector x table 2 as the stochastic eigenvector corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue λ 1 1 gantmacher 1967 horn johnson 1990 it represents the steady state distribution of quadrate statuses in the case that the transition matrix remained constant in time note that the share of species coexistence status vw varies among the matrices between 18 and 56 to characterize the whole observation period we need to somehow average all the 5 transition matrices and to consider the characteristics of the average matrix the logic of averaging ensues from the observations and it is the following since the final sample was formed in such a way that the total number of quadrats remained unchanged in each observation eq 2 implies that 3 x 2005 p 2000 p 1995 p 1990 p 1985 p 1980 x 1980 it means that the product of five matrices transforms the distribution observed in 1980 to that observed in 2005 and this is exactly what the average matrix g should do what raised to the 5th power therefore we have logofet and maslov 2019 eq 6 4 g 5 p 2000 p 1995 p 1990 p 1985 p 1980 hence 5 g p 2000 p 1995 p 1990 p 1985 p 1980 1 5 thus the true sense of averaging is to be geometric the product of positive matrices is positive too and appendix a illustrates how to extract a matrix root from a given positive matrix and to calculate its limiting vector x g both are shown in table 3 together with the observed distributions x 1980 and x 2005 for the purpose of comparison this forward prediction illustrates the main conclusion from the nonautonomous markov chain model ibidem the fine scale dynamics of species has certain direction under the habitat conditions that realised during 25 years of observation namely it features the increasing share of species coexistence quadrates tending to reach the maximal value 38 comparable with that of bilberry alone share 37 3 validation forecast will the main conclusion remain the same if we confine calibration to only 20 years i e to the four one step transition matrices p t t 1980 1985 1990 1995 the validation should first of all reveal whether the one step forecast inferred from the part of observations 1980 2000 turn out close to the next observation itself x 2005 as regards the measure of closeness half a century ago nathan keyfitz 1968 proposed a measure of distance between stochastic vectors which is nowadays called keyfitz s δ caswell 2001 or keyfitz s index of dissimilarity endress et al 2004 christensen and gorchov 2010 and calculated as 6 δ x y ½ j 1 n x j y j where n is the dimension of stochastic vectors x and y should the vectors be expressed in relative units or percentage ranging from 0 to 1 or 100 respectively the same units appear in δ the formulas to recalculate back and forth being evident the same technique of averaging as in the previous section yet applied to the four matrices results in matrix g 4 shown in table 4 together with its limiting vector y g 4 and various keyfitz s distances the validation forecast y 2005 g 4 x 2000 appears to be within the 5 vicinity of the observed distribution x 2005 and the main conclusion about the bilberry vs cowberry dynamics does remain the same both in qualitative and quantitative terms 4 backward prediction the failure of routines in general backward prediction means using the subsequent values to predict the previous ones it is a routine issue in ode models and almost a routine one in processing time series with censused data courtier et al 1993 however in markov chain models the idea faces certain obstacles first of all any time homogeneous markov chain obeying the one step equation 7 x t 1 p x t t 0 1 2 with a constant transition matrix p features the global convergence of all trajectories in their forward dynamics to the normalized dominant eigenvector x of p corresponding its dominant eigenvalue λ 1 p 1 gantmacher 1967 kemeny snell 1976 it means that any long term backward prediction is theoretically incorrect as far as the trajectories that are close in a small vicinity of x may be quite distant at their initial time moments this deprives the backward prediction of practical meaning the current states that are close enough may diverge greatly in the reversed time furthermore in spite of the one step reversal of eq 7 being algebraically correct x t 1 p 1 x t t 1 2 its further prolongation is impossible as the inverse matrix is no longer stochastic in practical cases hence it cannot transform any other stochastic vector x t 1 to a stochastic x t 2 all these failures have a deep foundation in the theory of markov chains john g kemeny and j laurie snell 1976 developed the following characterization i e a criterion that can really be verified for a given matrix of reversible markov chains theorem ibidem point 5 3 3 a markov chain is reversible if and only if diag x p is a symmetric matrix notations adopted in the present article thus reversible markov chains represent quite a narrow class restricted to a special kind of symmetry in their transition matrices and there is no reason to hope for this symmetry to hold in a positive matrix calibrated on real data table 2 just illustrates numerically this evident point nevertheless the very idea of backward prediction can still be realized in markov chain models 5 backward prediction the reversal of observations since we cannot reverse correctly the time direction in the basic eq 7 let us reverse it in the data suppose we observe what we have really observed but in the back order from the year of 2005 to 1980 and calibrate the backward markov chain model on these observations the question is how the tables t t of observed transitions among quadrate statuses table 1 should be changed to reconstruct the reversed situation theoretically there is no obstacle to do so as far as each forward transition documented in the data has its known specific origin hence it can be reversed without any loss of information practically it means that the tables t t δt of backward transitions are the transposes of the forward tables 8 t t δt t t t t 2000 1995 1980 δt 5 to get the frequencies of transition events in the ensuing column stochastic transition matrix b t δt we have to divide each element of t t δt by the number of quadrates having the proper outgoing status i e by the corresponding component of vector n t δt table 1 thus we have 9 b t δt t t t diag n t δt 1 or to exclude the transition table 10 b t δt diag n t p t t diag n t δt 1 appendix b illustrates the derivation of formulae 8 10 in a simpler hypothetical case of a two state markov chain the essence of backward transitions is expressed in the following set of equalities 11 b t δt n t δt n t t 2000 1995 1980 δt 5 no need to say that it represents an immediate consequence of eq 10 inferred by the rules of matrix calculations which certifies the construction 8 10 being correct let g denote the geometric average of the 5 backward transition matrices the averaging technique section 2 suggests calculating their product in the reversed chronological order from the right to the left and formula b7 appendix b expands to 12 g 5 b 1985 b 1990 b 1995 b 2000 b 2005 diag n 1980 p 2000 p 1995 p 1990 p 1985 p 1980 t diag n 2005 1 formula 12 means that the backward prediction based on the average backward transition matrix g does not require the matrices themselves to be averaged and it can be implemented via the product of the original transition matrices table 2 implemented so the backward prediction is presented in table 5 we see that the observed distribution x 1980 turns out unfortunately close to the back limiting one z g as well as the distribution z 1955 back predicted from it 13 z 1955 g 5 x 1980 therefore the back dynamics of the species coexistence share varies within tenth fractions yet the direction of changes is qualitatively certain the percentage of vw does decrease thus confirming the directionality revealed in the forward dynamics table 3 where it increases 6 discussion and conclusion markov chain models have long been known for their immanent phenomenological nature jeffers 1978 ch 5 normally lacking any cause effect mechanisms the markov chain models of plant succession are also known for their extreme commitment to observation data at the level of either community relay knyazkov et al 1992 rego et al 1993 vinogradov and shitov 1994 logofet et al 1997 logofet and lesnaya 2000 reviews in balzter 2000 and logofet 2010 chuang et al 2011 logofet et al 2016 or the tree by tree replacement horn 1975 acevedo 1981 a review in acevedo et al 1995 or at the fine scale hobbs 1984 samoylov and tarkhova 1985 wootton 2001 hill et al 2004 baasch et al 2010 therefore markov chain models provide for the most objective picture of what is going on in reality and of what follows from this picture for the future unless drastic changes in the environment exclude the chance of reliable predictions long enough time series of data suggest constructing a nonautonomous model or a time inhomogeneous markov chain and the need to average the time dependent one step transition matrices the logic of averaging ensues from that of observations which is expressed in certain matrix equations such as eqs 3 4 which in turn prescribes the geometric nature of averaging this logic prescribes also the pattern allocation of zeros non zeros of the average matrix g to be the same as that of the matrices to be averaged and this leads logically to the concept of pattern geometric average for nonnegative matrices logofet 2018 if the pattern is nontrivial unlike that of positive matrices p t table 2 corresponding to the complete digraph in fig 1 then the equation of averaging has no exact solution and we have to be content with an approximate one ibidem logofet et al 2017 logofet et al 2018a b in the lucky particular case of positive stochastic matrices table 2 the pattern geometric average has reduced to just geometric average hence to the extraction of matrix root appendix a this has enabled us to avoid the non formalizable choice of optimality criterion in the approximate solution to eq 4 but reduced the problem to extracting the root from the positive spectrum a1 note however that the product of positive stochastic matrices which is always positive and stochastic too may generally not have a positive spectrum thus complicating the root extraction the same is true for the backward transition matrices 10 whose product leads to the backward prediction according to eq 13 there are all statuses of quadrates forming the distribution z 1955 table 5 in significant proportions and such a distribution could hardly be observed in the forest just one year after the fire thus the backward prediction turns out biologically unrealistic and a deep reason for that is inherent in the forward data started in 1980 i e in 26 years after the fire the observations reflect rather a mature than an earlier stage of post fire succession and the dynamics did not contain any drastic changes typical for the early to late stage reorganization of the community no reorganization in the forward data hence nothing similar in its reverse too however the backward prediction was never aimed at revealing any reorganization the aim was rather to see what would proceed in the opposite direction of time what we have seen namely the decrease in the share of bilberry with cowberry quadrates table 5 though negligible one still does confirm or does not contradict at least the directionality revealed by the forward prediction should the forward data document any reorganization a correct backward prediction would reveal it too from the modelling point of view a technique to confirm an important biological conclusion does deserve certain efforts acknowledgements i am grateful to the anonymous reviewer whose competent critique inspired me addressing the issue of backward prediction the present text was improved thanks to valuable comments and suggestions by the anonymous reviewer too appendix a solution to the averaging problem searching for the geometric mean of the five given matrices p t according to eq 4 is mathematically equivalent to extracting the 5th power root from their matrix product general approach to defining a function of the matrix argument gantmacher 1966 v 1 2 suggests the matrix root of degree p a 1 p of matrix a to be defined on the spectrum of a hence it reduces to extracting the root from the matrix eigenvalues ibidem viii 6 in the general case this problem is far from trivial even for nonnegative matrices see appendix b in logofet maslov 2019 for greater detail the product prodp of the 5 stochastic matrices p t given in the rational form table 2 can be calculated in the rational form too in symbolic matlab which excludes any loss of accuracy due to round off errors the product is inevitably positive and stochastic too a standard routine called eig and applied to its numeric form reveals its spectrum to be positive a1 λ prodp λ 0 1708 0 1443 0 1430 0 1150 0 3719 0 3904 0 3522 0 3589 0 1289 0 1053 0 1264 0 1049 0 3284 0 3599 0 3784 0 4212 1 0 0751 0 0016 0 0320 the jordan normal form jnf of g 5 prodp is thereby trivially diagonal so that we obtain the spectrum of matrix g by element wise extracting the 5th root from the right hand side of a1 a2 λ g 1 0 5958 0 2785 0 5025 exactly the same matrix v that provides the representation of g 5 via its jnf a3 g 5 v diag λ g 5 v 1 leads to the desired result via the spectrum a2 a4 g v d i a g λ g v 1 0 5251 0 1172 0 1470 0 0133 0 2531 0 6683 0 1293 0 1952 0 1734 0 0234 0 4631 0 0710 0 0483 0 1911 0 2606 0 7205 the first column of matrix v normalized to 1 or 100 represents the limiting vector x g table 3 testing matrix a4 for eq 4 reveals the maximal difference over all 16 matrix elements to have the 10 16 order of magnitude though distinct from zero because of computer round off errors but too small to affect any conclusion note that calculating carelessly the matrix root just by raising matrix g 5 to the 1 5 th power which should theoretically yield the required matrix g returns practically the same result as a4 in a recent version of matlab r2018b yet it was quite a different wrong result in an earlier version matrix g 5 1 5 was even not stochastic ibidem appendix b appendix b calculating the backward transition matrices and their products consider a hypothetical markov chain of two states with a digraph of transitions shown in fig 2 a the corresponding table of transitions t 0 is shown in the left part of table 6 with the initial distribution of states given by vector n 0 t 3 7 therefore the transition matrix p 0 of the corresponding frequencies is calculated as b1 p 0 t 0 d i a g n 0 1 1 3 3 7 2 3 4 7 and we logically have b2 4 6 n 1 p 0 n 0 1 3 3 7 2 3 4 7 3 7 4 6 as the basic markov chain equation leading to the true equality to reverse the transitions from t 1 to t 0 we have just to redirect all the arrows in the opposite way retaining the numbers unchanged fig 2 b the ensuing transition table t 1 is shown in the right part of table 6 with the initial distribution of states given by vector n 1 t 4 6 as compared with the forward table t 0 the diagonal elements of t 1 remain the same while the off diagonal ones are transposed we should however resist an appeal to get the backward transition matrix b 1 as just the transpose of the forward one p 0 t because transposition does not conserve the column sums what should really be transposed is the forward transition table table 6 so that we have b3 t 1 t 0 t b 1 t 0 t diag n 1 1 nevertheless we can still exclude the transition tables from the formulae by transposing both sides of b1 whereby we have b4 p 0 t diag n 0 1 t 0 t and t 0 t diag n 0 p 0 t now eqs b3 and b4 result in b5 b 1 diag n 0 p 0 t diag n 1 1 which indicates how specifically we should use the transpose of the original transition matrix at the second reversed step we have similarly b6 b 2 diag n 1 p 1 t diag n 2 1 for the backward transitions from t 2 hence for the two step backward transitions from t 2 to t 0 we have b7 b 1 b 2 diag n 0 p 0 t p 1 t diag n 2 1 diag n 0 p 1 p 0 t diag n 2 1 formula b7 can be easily expanded for any finite number of backward steps for which the forward ones are available in the data

that of bilberry alone share 37 3 validation forecast will the main conclusion remain the same if we confine calibration to only 20 years i e to the four one step transition matrices p t t 1980 1985 1990 1995 the validation should first of all reveal whether the one step forecast inferred from the part of observations 1980 2000 turn out close to the next observation itself x 2005 as regards the measure of closeness half a century ago nathan keyfitz 1968 proposed a measure of distance between stochastic vectors which is nowadays called keyfitz s δ caswell 2001 or keyfitz s index of dissimilarity endress et al 2004 christensen and gorchov 2010 and calculated as 6 δ x y ½ j 1 n x j y j where n is the dimension of stochastic vectors x and y should the vectors be expressed in relative units or percentage ranging from 0 to 1 or 100 respectively the same units appear in δ the formulas to recalculate back and forth being evident the same technique of averaging as in the previous section yet applied to the four matrices results in matrix g 4 shown in table 4 together with its limiting vector y g 4 and various keyfitz s distances the validation forecast y 2005 g 4 x 2000 appears to be within the 5 vicinity of the observed distribution x 2005 and the main conclusion about the bilberry vs cowberry dynamics does remain the same both in qualitative and quantitative terms 4 backward prediction the failure of routines in general backward prediction means using the subsequent values to predict the previous ones it is a routine issue in ode models and almost a routine one in processing time series with censused data courtier et al 1993 however in markov chain models the idea faces certain obstacles first of all any time homogeneous markov chain obeying the one step equation 7 x t 1 p x t t 0 1 2 with a constant transition matrix p features the global convergence of all trajectories in their forward dynamics to the normalized dominant eigenvector x of p corresponding its dominant eigenvalue λ 1 p 1 gantmacher 1967 kemeny snell 1976 it means that any long term backward prediction is theoretically incorrect as far as the trajectories that are close in a small vicinity of x may be quite distant at their initial time moments this deprives the backward prediction of practical meaning the current states that are close enough may diverge greatly in the reversed time furthermore in spite of the one step reversal of eq 7 being algebraically correct x t 1 p 1 x t t 1 2 its further prolongation is impossible as the inverse matrix is no longer stochastic in practical cases hence it cannot transform any other stochastic vector x t 1 to a stochastic x t 2 all these failures have a deep foundation in the theory of markov chains john g kemeny and j laurie snell 1976 developed the following characterization i e a criterion that can really be verified for a given matrix of reversible markov chains theorem ibidem point 5 3 3 a markov chain is reversible if and only if diag x p is a symmetric matrix notations adopted in the present article thus reversible markov chains represent quite a narrow class restricted to a special kind of symmetry in their transition matrices and there is no reason to hope for this symmetry to hold in a positive matrix calibrated on real data table 2 just illustrates numerically this evident point nevertheless the very idea of backward prediction can still be realized in markov chain models 5 backward prediction the reversal of observations since we cannot reverse correctly the time direction in the basic eq 7 let us reverse it in the data suppose we observe what we have really observed but in the back order from the year of 2005 to 1980 and calibrate the backward markov chain model on these observations the question is how the tables t t of observed transitions among quadrate statuses table 1 should be changed to reconstruct the reversed situation theoretically there is no obstacle to do so as far as each forward transition documented in the data has its known specific origin hence it can be reversed without any loss of information practically it means that the tables t t δt of backward transitions are the transposes of the forward tables 8 t t δt t t t t 2000 1995 1980 δt 5 to get the frequencies of transition events in the ensuing column stochastic transition matrix b t δt we have to divide each element of t t δt by the number of quadrates having the proper outgoing status i e by the corresponding component of vector n t δt table 1 thus we have 9 b t δt t t t diag n t δt 1 or to exclude the transition table 10 b t δt diag n t p t t diag n t δt 1 appendix b illustrates the derivation of formulae 8 10 in a simpler hypothetical case of a two state markov chain the essence of backward transitions is expressed in the following set of equalities 11 b t δt n t δt n t t 2000 1995 1980 δt 5 no need to say that it represents an immediate consequence of eq 10 inferred by the rules of matrix calculations which certifies the construction 8 10 being correct let g denote the geometric average of the 5 backward transition matrices the averaging technique section 2 suggests calculating their product in the reversed chronological order from the right to the left and formula b7 appendix b expands to 12 g 5 b 1985 b 1990 b 1995 b 2000 b 2005 diag n 1980 p 2000 p 1995 p 1990 p 1985 p 1980 t diag n 2005 1 formula 12 means that the backward prediction based on the average backward transition matrix g does not require the matrices themselves to be averaged and it can be implemented via the product of the original transition matrices table 2 implemented so the backward prediction is presented in table 5 we see that the observed distribution x 1980 turns out unfortunately close to the back limiting one z g as well as the distribution z 1955 back predicted from it 13 z 1955 g 5 x 1980 therefore the back dynamics of the species coexistence share varies within tenth fractions yet the direction of changes is qualitatively certain the percentage of vw does decrease thus confirming the directionality revealed in the forward dynamics table 3 where it increases 6 discussion and conclusion markov chain models have long been known for their immanent phenomenological nature jeffers 1978 ch 5 normally lacking any cause effect mechanisms the markov chain models of plant succession are also known for their extreme commitment to observation data at the level of either community relay knyazkov et al 1992 rego et al 1993 vinogradov and shitov 1994 logofet et al 1997 logofet and lesnaya 2000 reviews in balzter 2000 and logofet 2010 chuang et al 2011 logofet et al 2016 or the tree by tree replacement horn 1975 acevedo 1981 a review in acevedo et al 1995 or at the fine scale hobbs 1984 samoylov and tarkhova 1985 wootton 2001 hill et al 2004 baasch et al 2010 therefore markov chain models provide for the most objective picture of what is going on in reality and of what follows from this picture for the future unless drastic changes in the environment exclude the chance of reliable predictions long enough time series of data suggest constructing a nonautonomous model or a time inhomogeneous markov chain and the need to average the time dependent one step transition matrices the logic of averaging ensues from that of observations which is expressed in certain matrix equations such as eqs 3 4 which in turn prescribes the geometric nature of averaging this logic prescribes also the pattern allocation of zeros non zeros of the average matrix g to be the same as that of the matrices to be averaged and this leads logically to the concept of pattern geometric average for nonnegative matrices logofet 2018 if the pattern is nontrivial unlike that of positive matrices p t table 2 corresponding to the complete digraph in fig 1 then the equation of averaging has no exact solution and we have to be content with an approximate one ibidem logofet et al 2017 logofet et al 2018a b in the lucky particular case of positive stochastic matrices table 2 the pattern geometric average has reduced to just geometric average hence to the extraction of matrix root appendix a this has enabled us to avoid the non formalizable choice of optimality criterion in the approximate solution to eq 4 but reduced the problem to extracting the root from the positive spectrum a1 note however that the product of positive stochastic matrices which is always positive and stochastic too may generally not have a positive spectrum thus complicating the root extraction the same is true for the backward transition matrices 10 whose product leads to the backward prediction according to eq 13 there are all statuses of quadrates forming the distribution z 1955 table 5 in significant proportions and such a distribution could hardly be observed in the forest just one year after the fire thus the backward prediction turns out biologically unrealistic and a deep reason for that is inherent in the forward data started in 1980 i e in 26 years after the fire the observations reflect rather a mature than an earlier stage of post fire succession and the dynamics did not contain any drastic changes typical for the early to late stage reorganization of the community no reorganization in the forward data hence nothing similar in its reverse too however the backward prediction was never aimed at revealing any reorganization the aim was rather to see what would proceed in the opposite direction of time what we have seen namely the decrease in the share of bilberry with cowberry quadrates table 5 though negligible one still does confirm or does not contradict at least the directionality revealed by the forward prediction should the forward data document any reorganization a correct backward prediction would reveal it too from the modelling point of view a technique to confirm an important biological conclusion does deserve certain efforts acknowledgements i am grateful to the anonymous reviewer whose competent critique inspired me addressing the issue of backward prediction the present text was improved thanks to valuable comments and suggestions by the anonymous reviewer too appendix a solution to the averaging problem searching for the geometric mean of the five given matrices p t according to eq 4 is mathematically equivalent to extracting the 5th power root from their matrix product general approach to defining a function of the matrix argument gantmacher 1966 v 1 2 suggests the matrix root of degree p a 1 p of matrix a to be defined on the spectrum of a hence it reduces to extracting the root from the matrix eigenvalues ibidem viii 6 in the general case this problem is far from trivial even for nonnegative matrices see appendix b in logofet maslov 2019 for greater detail the product prodp of the 5 stochastic matrices p t given in the rational form table 2 can be calculated in the rational form too in symbolic matlab which excludes any loss of accuracy due to round off errors the product is inevitably positive and stochastic too a standard routine called eig and applied to its numeric form reveals its spectrum to be positive a1 λ prodp λ 0 1708 0 1443 0 1430 0 1150 0 3719 0 3904 0 3522 0 3589 0 1289 0 1053 0 1264 0 1049 0 3284 0 3599 0 3784 0 4212 1 0 0751 0 0016 0 0320 the jordan normal form jnf of g 5 prodp is thereby trivially diagonal so that we obtain the spectrum of matrix g by element wise extracting the 5th root from the right hand side of a1 a2 λ g 1 0 5958 0 2785 0 5025 exactly the same matrix v that provides the representation of g 5 via its jnf a3 g 5 v diag λ g 5 v 1 leads to the desired result via the spectrum a2 a4 g v d i a g λ

x g table 3 testing matrix a4 for eq 4 reveals the maximal difference over all 16 matrix elements to have the 10 16 order of magnitude though distinct from zero because of computer round off errors but too small to affect any conclusion note that calculating carelessly the matrix root just by raising matrix g 5 to the 1 5 th power which should theoretically yield the required matrix g returns practically the same result as a4 in a recent version of matlab r2018b yet it was quite a different wrong result in an earlier version matrix g 5 1 5 was even not stochastic ibidem appendix b appendix b calculating the backward transition matrices and their products consider a hypothetical markov chain of two states with a digraph of transitions shown in fig 2 a the corresponding table of transitions t 0 is shown in the left part of table 6 with the initial distribution of states given by vector n 0 t 3 7 therefore the transition matrix p 0 of the corresponding frequencies is calculated as b1 p 0 t 0 d i a g n 0 1 1 3 3 7 2 3 4 7 and we logically have b2 4 6 n 1 p 0 n 0 1 3 3 7 2 3 4 7 3 7 4 6 as the basic markov chain equation leading to the true equality to reverse the transitions from t 1 to t 0 we have just to redirect all the arrows in the opposite way retaining the numbers unchanged fig 2 b the ensuing transition table t 1 is shown in the right part of table 6 with the initial distribution of states given by vector n 1 t 4 6 as compared with the forward table t 0 the diagonal elements of t 1 remain the same while the off diagonal ones are transposed we should however resist an appeal to get the backward transition matrix b 1 as just the transpose of the forward one p 0 t because transposition does not conserve the column sums what should really be transposed is the forward transition table table 6 so that we have b3 t 1 t 0 t b 1 t 0 t diag n 1 1 nevertheless we can still exclude the transition tables from the formulae by transposing both sides of b1 whereby we have b4 p 0 t diag n 0 1 t 0 t and t 0 t diag n 0 p 0 t now eqs b3 and b4 result in b5 b 1 diag n 0 p 0 t diag n 1 1 which indicates how specifically we should use the transpose of the original transition matrix at the second reversed step we have similarly b6 b 2 diag n 1 p 1 t diag n 2 1 for the backward transitions from t 2 hence for the two step backward transitions from t 2 to t 0 we have b7 b 1 b 2 diag n 0 p 0 t p 1 t diag n 2 1 diag n 0 p 1 p 0 t diag n 2 1 formula b7 can be easily expanded for any finite number of backward steps for which the forward ones are available in the data 
25041,the end to end osmose gol model parameterized calibrated and evaluated for the gulf of lions ecosystem northwestern mediterranean sea has been used to investigate the effects of introducing two ways coupling between the dynamics of low and high trophic level groups the use of a fully dynamic two ways coupling between the models of low and high trophic levels organisms provided some insights in the functioning of the food web in the gulf of lions on the whole microphytoplankton and mesozooplankton were found to be preyed upon by high trophic levels planktivorous groups at rates lower than 20 and 30 of their respective natural mortality rates but these relatively low rates involved some important alterations in the infra seasonal and annual cycles of both high and low trophic levels groups they induced significant changes in biomass fisheries landings and food web interactions by cascading effects spatial differential impacts of high trophic levels predation on plankton are less clear except in areas in which primary productivity is high higher predation rates on plankton groups were encountered within the area of the rhone river s influence and in areas associated to the presence of mesoscale eddies in the northwestern part of the gulf of lions especially generally the pressure of the high trophic levels predation was the highest in areas of highest biomass whatever the plankton group considered the two ways coupling between low and high trophic levels models revealed both bottom up and top down controls in the ecosystem with effects on planktivorous species

trophic level htl species as a result 20 of the french fishing fleet operates in the gol and 90 of the french mediterranean landings take place in this area demaneche et al 2009 many fish species of commercial interest have been intensively exploited on the gol continental shelf over the past decades by french and spanish fleets using multi specific artisanal gears farrugio et al 1993 sacchi 2008 in this area a study based on the ecopath mass balance model suggested that some fish species may be overfished with respect to the amount of biomass necessary for the functioning of the food web bönaru et al 2013 forage species such as european pilchard and european anchovy representing usually more than 50 of the total catches in this area are one of the most important prey groups being a major trophic link between plankton and top predators as some fish species seabirds and mammals bănaru et al 2013 however over the last ten years and despite the decrease in fishing pressure the mean size and body condition of european pilchard and european anchovy have declined van beveren et al 2014 saraux et al 2018 recent studies on their diet le bourg et al 2015 showed that they probably consume smaller prey than in the past and that they maybe in competition with the european sprat a non commercial planktivorous fish which has strongly increased in biomass during recent years in this area some interesting questions arise from these observations such as why there has been a higher rate of consumption of smaller prey by planktivorous fishes over the past few years in this area have these small planktonic prey species been more abundant in recent years and if so is environmental forcing winds hydrodynamics and its variability at different frequencies responsible for this alteration of the plankton community in this context the trophic and especially size based trophic interactions within the food web and the impact of the environmental conditions on these interactions are of crucial importance in order to understand the functioning and recent evolution of the gol ecosystem models that integrate the representation of the whole ecosystem from the dynamics of the physical environment to that of the highest trophic levels the so called end to end e2e models see rose 2012 for an accurate definition are useful tools to address the aforementioned ecological questions in the present study the e2e model chosen to explore these questions is the individual and size based model osmose shin and cury 2004 with a configuration dedicated to the gol named osmose gol that has been recently parameterized calibrated and confronted to observations see details in the companion paper bănaru et al 2019 one of the strengths of this configuration is to account for a fully dynamic two ways coupling between the models of low trophic level ltl organisms usually biogeochemical models and htl organisms in this configuration of coupling outputs of plankton groups provided by the ltl model serve as prey fields for the htl organisms which return an additional predation mortality in the plankton groups the implementation of e2e models has rarely been undertaken in a dynamic two ways coupling between ltl and htl models but rather in a one way forcing mode with outputs from biogeochemical models being used as forage fields for htl organisms without any feedback on the ltl biomass and distributions as a result the effects of the type of models coupling with or without feedbacks from htl to ltl organisms on ecosystem dynamics have only been documented for the marine ecosystem of the benguela current travers trolet et al 2009 2014 to the best of our knowledge the aims of the present study are therefore the following i to assess the impact of the two ways coupling between the ltl and htl sub models on the outputs of the e2e model this evaluation will be undertaken through the analysis of changes in the temporal dynamics of the biomass and landings of living resources in predation pressure on plankton groups and in the resulting trophic cascade effects ii to evaluate the order of magnitude and potential impacts of the two ways coupling and hydrodynamic processes meso scale eddies region of freshwater influence by rhone river on the spatial distribution of plankton and nutrients iii to propose hypotheses to enlighten the environmental causes of the observed fluctuating stocks of certain fish species e g european anchovy european pilchard and european sprat the e2e model was run over a four year period characterized by contrasted environmental conditions involving a high interannual variability of the biomass of certain plankton groups the analysis of this run may enable to disentangle the respective roles of bottom up and top down processes on the seasonal and interannual dynamics of htl organisms this type of analysis is crucial to raise our capacity in moving towards ecosystem based management of the fisheries in the gol marine area 2 methods the osmose gol model that has been previously described parametrised calibrated and evaluated in the companion paper bănaru et al 2019 is used in this study to achieve the aforementioned aims this e2e model is composed of two sub models the first is the eco3m s symphonie model campbell et al 2013 that represents the dynamics of ltl organisms influenced by hydrodynamics and meteorological processes the second is the individual based model osmose shin and cury 2004 grüss et al 2015 that simulates the dynamics of htl organisms the design of the numerical experiment is detailed in the companion paper bănaru et al 2019 but its main points are reminded in the following for sake of clarity the osmose gol is firstly calibrated using an optimization technique relying on an evolutionary algorithm and a likelihood based objective function oliveros ramos and shin 2016 the calibrated model is then run in the one way forcing configuration and feed in loop on the numerical fields of ltl biomass for year 2001 until a realistic equilibrium is reached in the levels of htl outputs bănaru et al 2019 this equilibrium is reached after a period of 35 years that is considered as a spin up period following this spin up period the osmose gol model is run first in the one way mode during years 36 to 39 and then in the two ways coupling mode by receiving the numerical fields of ltl biomass from years 2001 to 2004 corresponding to years referred to as 40 to 43 hereafter a set of 50 simulations was launched to account for the stochasticity of the osmose model the one way forcing period years 36 to 39 as well as the period of two ways coupling mode years 40 to 43 have been considered for analysis in the following sections mean median and associated percentiles values are used to synthetically present and analyze the outputs of the model 3 results 3 1 temporal dynamics of plankton biomass the annual cycles of microphytoplankton fig 1 a show the highest levels of biomass along winter period and at the onset of spring in the one way forcing mode the summer season is characterized by the lowest biomasses and weakest variations autumn is characterized by an increase in biomass that is of lower intensity than that of the spring a more pronounced interannual variability of seasonal dynamics can be noted under the two ways coupling mode the intensity and duration of winter peak are very variable depending on the year the sharp decrease in biomass occurring later during spring is always present autumnal peak can be present on some years e g 40 42 while absent on the other ones the microphytoplankton biomass yearly eaten table 1 is on average ca 24 6 103 tons s d 180 tons in the one way forcing mode which represents from 3 to 16 of the available stock over year 40 the biomass eaten increases to nearly 27 103 tons that is 18 of the available stock the microphytoplankton biomass annually consumed by predators significantly falls down to 19 103 tons during the following two years 41 and 42 and drastically decline again to 16 7 103 tons during year 43 whatever the coupling mode the main predators of microphytoplankton are the two largest classes 3 cm of european pilchard and northern krill however in year 43 the intermediate size class of european anchovy 3 8 cm appears to be the second most important predator at the expense of the largest european pilchard 12 5 cm the annual cycle of microzooplankton biomass fig 1b in the one way forcing mode shows sharp variations of biomass throughout the years while in the two ways coupling mode the variability is less marked in the one way forcing mode biomass is at its minimum at the beginning of winter then sharply rises up to 7 5 105 tons the rest of the year is characterized by a decreasing trend of biomass until the end of autumn punctuated by large and rapid variations such as a recurrent summer peak of biomass the last three years of simulation in the two ways coupling mode have the common point of showing a minimum biomass moved forward during autumn and a delayed peak occurring at the end of winter years 41 and 42 or even during spring year 43 the amount of microzooplankton yearly eaten is slightly higher than 29 103 tons on average in the one way forcing mode table 1 and decreases gradually throughout the simulated years in the two ways coupling mode down to ca 20 103 tons year 43 then representing ca 10 of the autumnal minimum the largest size classes of european pilchard 3 cm and european anchovy 8 cm are on average the main predators of microzooplankton in the two coupling modes however it can be noted that there is a certain decrease in the predator size e g european anchovy since the intermediate size class appears to be one of the three main predators at the expense of the largest size class from year 42 as for microzooplankton the annual cycle of the mesozooplankton biomass fig 1c in the one way configuration strongly differs from those occurring in the two ways mode in the one way configuration minima levels of biomass are found during winter followed by a sharp increase from spring to summer peaking at the end of summer then biomass quickly falls by ca 40 before a slower decrease during autumn then a sharper fall at the onset of the following winter the seasonal cycles in the two ways configuration are marked by a strong interannual variability while the minimum biomass in winter increases over the years the seasonal peaks of biomass are reached in spring summer autumn of years 42 41 43 respectively the amount of mesozooplankton eaten yearly is 4714 tons on average in the one way configuration table 1 ranging between 5 and 15 of the available stock in contrast to the dynamics of predation on all other planktonic prey there is no clear trend in the quantity of mesozooplankton eaten over the years in the two ways configuration it is worth noting that the amount of eaten biomass is the highest one 5572 tons during year 43 in line with the sharp increase in available biomass during the second part of that year fig 1c the european anchovy exclusively 8 cm and european pilchard all size classes are the main predators of mesozooplankton the northern krill can occasionally be the second most important predator as in years 42 and 43 and in the one way configuration it is interesting to note that while the amount of eaten biomass increases by ca 20 from year 42 to 43 the ranking of the main predators does not change the seasonal cycle of the nanophytoplankton biomass fig a1 shows a minimum at the end of winter followed by an increase from spring to the end of autumn the year to year variability of the biomass cycle is marked over the period of the two ways coupling mode the amount of nanophytoplankton consumed compared to the available stock fig a1 remains extremely low 0 004 whatever the coupling mode considered table 1 however this amount increases by 40 in the two ways coupling mode the smallest size classes of european anchovy european pilchard as well as northern krill are the main predators of nanophytoplankton whatever the linking mode considered the annual cycles of nanozooplankton in the one way forcing mode fig a2 show an abrupt increase at the onset of winter followed by a sharp drop to very low levels along the rest of the year years 41 43 are characterized by a strong erosion of the winter peaks the nanozooplankton biomass yearly eaten table 1 is very low ca 0 13 tons on average in the one way forcing mode and even lower when two ways coupling is implemented representing a tiny proportion of the planktonic food 0 005 as expected the smallest sizes 3 cm of european sprat and european anchovy as well as northern krill are the main predators of nanozooplankton 3 2 temporal dynamics of htl species biomass the seasonal dynamics of htl species resulting from the one way forcing mode have been already depicted in detail by bănaru et al 2019 and only the seasonal cycles produced under the two ways coupling mode are hereafter described years 40 to 43 in fig 2 most of the modeled biomass of htl species shows interannual changes in median values within the ranges of biomass estimates from field observations except that of european hake which is slightly overestimated the median biomass of northern krill fig 2a shows wide variations with the highest and lowest values occurring in winter and the end of spring respectively interannual variability of the seasonal cycle can be noted for example the autumnal plateau does not exist during year 42 and show a continuous increase up to a peak of biomass reached during the next winter this year 43 winter maximum is 30 higher than those of previous years at the onset of the two ways coupling the biomass of southern shortfin squid fig 2b decreases from 2 5 104 tons down to 2 104 tons the following two years show on the contrary a continuous and strong increase in biomass with only slight seasonal variations the temporal dynamics of european pilchard fig 2c show regular seasonal variations with maxima reached at the onset of spring and minima at the entrance of winter the yearly range of extreme values is wide with variations of 30 40 of the biomass during year 40 the spring maximum of biomass reaches 2 6 105 tons while the minimum is around 1 80 105 tons the following years then show a global decrease in the biomass levels with lower and lower spring maxima 1 25 105 tons in year 43 during year 40 the median biomass of european anchovy fig 2d shows a seasonal cycle characterized by highest biomass from mid winter to the end of spring and lowest biomass during autumn this seasonal dynamic almost entirely disappears the following years with spring peaks barely detectable e g years 41 and 43 the seasonal variations in the biomass of european sprat fig 2e are weak however the range of variations is more marked under the two ways configuration highest biomass occurs at the end of spring while the lowest is found at the beginning of winter the highest median biomass reaches 2 104 tons during year 43 and is almost twice the maximum of year 40 the dynamic of atlantic horse mackerel fig 2f has common points with that of european sprat seasonal variations in biomass are weak but they perceptibly increase under the two ways configuration furthermore the biomass peaks regularly increase reaching up to ca 2 5 104 tons at the autumn end of year 43 that is 35 more than the maximum reached during year 40 in parallel there is a larger spread of the percentiles range especially towards the high values of biomass a very weak seasonal signal can be observed in the simulated biomass of atlantic mackerel fig 2g the amplitude of variations between maxima from end of winter to mid spring and minima from mid summer to mid autumn does not exceed 12 however year 41 is characterized by the absence of biomass peak at the end of winter the last two years show a significant increase in biomass levels by 20 compared to previous years the biomass of blue whiting fig 2h does not show any clear seasonal pattern median biomass fluctuates around 4 104 tons during year 40 and the three last years are characterized by an increase in the biomass up to 6 5 104 tons the biomass of european hake fig 2i does not show any significant seasonal signals the level of biomass remains almost constant 1 4 104 tons during years 40 and 41 but a slight decrease 10 occurs over the last two years the median biomass of atlantic bluefin tuna fig 2j shows a marked seasonal cycle a minimum biomass during winter 5000 5500 tons is followed by a rapid increase up to a first peak at the onset of spring 5600 6200 tons another minimum biomass occurs at the entrance of summer and then the annual peak 7000 tons occurs during every autumn a slight increase in biomass 10 is noted especially during the first three years under two ways configuration 3 3 temporal dynamics of htl species landings the temporal dynamics of htl species landings results from the input parameters of the model and particularly fishing mortality and seasonality that remain constant over the whole modeled period bănaru et al 2019 and of the dynamics of the exploited stocks and the food web interactions as in the one way configuration bănaru et al 2019 the modeled landings of most of the htl species except southern shortfin squid and atlantic mackerel stand within the ranges of observed data fig 3 catches of northern krill and european sprat results not shown are not computed by the model as they are not landed by fishermen the temporal dynamics of htl species with planktivorous dominant diet such as southern shortfin squid fig 3a european pilchard fig 3b and european anchovy fig 3c have in common to show significant changes between year 40 and the following three years for the latter two species the seasonality of the landings remains similar but a significant decline occurs over years 41 43 for the southern shortfin squid fig 3a both the seasonal cycle and the level of landings change radically the landings are almost stable during the first part of year 40 and then sharply fall of more than 50 until the middle of year 41 the years 42 and 43 show an increase up to ca 700 tons without a clear seasonal cycle the temporal dynamics of atlantic horse mackerel fig 3d shows a seasonal cycle composed of two maxima spring and autumn and two minima winter and summer the spring maximum is considerably higher than that of autumn except in year 42 year 40 shows the highest spring peak with landings exceeding 30 tons in parallel the winter minimum 8 tons is generally lower than that of summer except for year 42 the last two years are characterized by a larger spread of the percentiles range especially with regard to the high values of landings during spring landings of atlantic mackerel fig 3e increase during autumn and peak at the onset of winter they then decline slowly down to minimum levels at the end of summer the seasonal cycle is generally weakly marked year 43 shows an overall increase in landings by 15 the seasonality of landings of blue whiting fig 3f is almost unchanged in two ways configuration landings are close to zero during autumn and sharply increase during winter up to their maximum levels this peak is transient and landings drastically fall in two phases a small decline first occurs at the onset of summer followed by a short stabilization then landings quickly drop to zero during the second part of summer maximum landings of european hake fig 3g oscillate from mid winter to the end of summer between 90 and 100 tons during years 40 and 41 and between 80 and 90 tons during years 42 and 43 autumn is characterized by a sharp decline down to a minimum of 10 tons and the onset of winter shows a sharp increase up to the seasonal maximum the pattern of annual dynamics of landings for atlantic bluefin tuna fig 3h shows marked seasonal variations and a regular cycle during years 40 to 43 modeled landings are close to zero from mid autumn to the beginning of winter which corresponds to the period when bluefin tuna migrates out of this area a first increase peaking at 280 tons follows in spring a second much higher peak 500 tons then occurs during autumn 3 4 temporal dynamics of the htl predation pressure on the plankton groups the level of htl pressure is defined as the ratio between the actual htl induced mortality rates and their potential maximum value table 2 for each group of planktonic prey the median levels of htl predation pressure on the microphytoplankton group fig 4 a oscillate between 25 and 50 the second part of the year is generally marked by the highest pressure with a peak during summer the minimum pressure generally occurs during winter or even spring as in year 43 there are however some significant differences in the annual cycle between years the seasonal pattern of year 40 shows rather wide and rapid variations with a minimum occurring at the beginning of winter followed by an overall increase until reaching two successive peaks of around 47 in summer and autumn the years 41 43 show i lesser variability and ii a decreasing trend of predation characterized for example by lower and lower peaks and minima the htl predation pressure on the microzooplankton group fig 4b oscillates between 25 and 55 the seasonal pattern mirrors that of microphytoplankton a predation minimum occurs at the end of winter and is followed by an overall increase from spring to mid autumn year 40 differs from the last three years by wide variations and a marked winter peak interannual variability can be also noticed with a pressure minimum moved forward mid winter i e year 42 or delayed mid spring i e years 41 43 overall predation pressure tends to decrease over the simulated four years the levels of htl predation pressure on the mesozooplankton group fig 4c are ca 50 for most of the simulation period except at the beginning of year 40 for which ratios exceed 60 the seasonal pattern generally shows two periods of high pressure the first one happens in winter and lasts until the onset of spring i e year 43 and the second one extends from mid summer to the end of autumn the spring period is then rather characterized by a minimum from years 41 to 43 the winter maximum appears to be strongly reduced while the autumn maximum becomes dominant as previously noted for the microplankton groups there is globally a slow decrease in the predation pressure over the simulated period the pressure of predation on the nanoplankton groups figs a3 a4 remains very low 0 005 0 006 under the two ways configuration the highest pressures of predation generally happen from the onset of the spring to that of autumn e g year 43 3 5 spatial effects of two ways coupling on plankton and nutrients three snapshots over the simulation period are hereafter shown to illustrate how the two ways coupling can affect the spatial fields of plankton and even those of nutrients indirectly horizontal figs 5 8 fields from february 2002 august 2003 and march 2004 are examined in details because these periods correspond to occurrences of high predation pressure by htl fig 4 which can involve a direct consumption of plankton prey but also some trophic cascading effects within the ltl only the distributions of prey i e microphytoplankton mesozooplankton and microzooplankton for which the htl predation pressure was the highest predation ratio 20 fig 4 over the simulation period are shown as well as those of phosphate contents a nutrient potentially controlling the level of primary productivity in the gol e g diaz et al 2001 to check the spatial effects of the two ways coupling on plankton and nutrient we compared numerical fields from the osmose gol model upper panels of figs 5 8 to those without considering any coupling with osmose model i e only resulting from the ltl eco3m s symphonie model campbell et al 2013 easier comparisons are made by considering fields of differences concentrations with htl predation in two ways configuration minus those without any htl predation for plankton and phosphate lower panels of figs 5 8 the first snapshot to be analyzed happens during the beginning of autumn 2002 and two remarkable hydrodynamic structures under the form of anticyclonic eddies ae1 and ae2 plots a and b of figs 5 8 are present at this period in the gol ae1 is of rather small size with an elliptical shape large semi axis ca 60 km small semi axis ca 40 km and is entirely located in the southwestern part of the osmose gol domain while ae2 is much larger large semi axis ca 140 km small semi axis ca 70 km and only partly located in the osmose gol domain these two eddies as well as the region of freshwater influence rofi of the rhone river diaz et al 2008 mostly shape the distributions of plankton groups and to a lesser degree that of phosphate on the whole the edges of the eddies show difference in biomass or concentrations compared to their center or even their surrounding water masses depending on the plankton groups considered these ae ae2 especially show at their edges either higher biomass in microphytoplankton microzooplankton figs 6a 7 a or lower stocks in mesozooplankton fig 5a than those around the rofi of the rhone river is clearly identified by the area of phosphate high concentrations 0 15 mmol m 3 on fig 8a the rofi is characterized by either high microphytoplankton and microzooplankton biomass on its western edge especially or low mesozooplankton biomass upper panels and first column of figs 5a 6 a 7 a several intriguing features appear from the examination of the difference maps lower panels of figs 5 8 when the whole modeled domain is considered there is generally lower biomass in mesozooplankton and microphytoplankton fig 5b 7 b and slightly higher microzooplankton and phosphate stocks fig 6b and 8 b in the two ways coupling mode the orders of magnitude of differences show strong variations from one plankton group to another and for phosphate up to a few percent of the available stock for microzooplankton and microphytoplankton but much lower than 1 for phosphate and mesozooplankton spatial gradients on the difference maps are marked for plankton especially in the vicinity of ae2 and the rofi of the rhone river for example implementing the two ways coupling had a lower impact on mesozooplankton patterns both in the center and on the edges of ae2 than that modeled on the western part of the gol shelf fig 5b by contrast the impact of considering two ways coupling on microzooplankton and microphytoplankton patterns was especially high on the edges of ae2 fig 6b 7 b within the rofi of the rhone river the account for the two ways coupling provokes less changes on the two zooplankton groups than those modeled at the edges of ae the rofi is also the only zone in this snapshot to show positive differences in microphytoplankton biomass fig 7b indicating a stronger presence of this prey when the two ways coupling is explicitly accounted for differences in phosphate concentrations are hardly detectable at the edges of ae2 on the whole the spatial structuration of nutrients and plankton near the small sized ae1 does not show marked alterations whether the two ways coupling is activated or not only except for microzooplankton the second snapshot to be analyzed happens during the mid summer 2003 when two remarkable hydrodynamic structures anticyclonic eddy ae3 and cyclonic eddy ce1 fig 5c are present in the osmose gol domain ae3 is of medium size with an elliptical shape large semi axis ca 65 km small semi axis ca 50 km on the southwestern side of the gol ce1 is a smaller structure of almost circular shape radius ca 40 km ce1 clearly interacts at the time of the snapshot with the rofi of the rhone river that can be finely located by the surface distribution of phosphate concentrations fig 8c the distributions of plankton groups and phosphate on the northeastern and southwestern sides were mainly constrained by ce1 and ae3 respectively high mesozooplankton biomass 0 25 mmol m 3 fig 5c is modeled in the central part of the gol shelf while a sharply decreasing biomass gradient occurred in the northeastern part of the shelf owing to the presence of ce1 in the southwestern part of the gol mesozooplankton biomass was slightly lower at the edges of ae3 than in surrounding areas surface structuration of microzooplankton biomass is almost the opposite of that of mesozooplankton biomass high microzooplankton biomass was modeled in the northeastern part of the gol shelf and near the rhone river mouth and the flow of ce1 tended to advect these high biomass southwestwards fig 6c similar spatial patterns could be observed for modeled phosphate concentrations fig 8c depletion in modeled microphytoplankton was found in the central part of the shelf while the surrounding water masses near eddies showed higher biomass fig 7c the resulting flow of these two eddies involved an export in microphytoplankton from the coastal area to the offshore zone in this second snapshot the two ways coupling generally provoked the highest losses of plankton in areas of highest biomass whatever the group considered for example the northeastern area near ce1 and the rhone river mouth showed the highest biomass of microphytoplankton and microzooplankton figs 6c 7 c and also the highest losses in biomass when two ways coupling is accounted for figs 6d 7 d in parallel areas for which losses of biomass are the highest ones e g ce1 rhone river mouth show a net gain in phosphate at the surface when two ways coupling is accounted for fig 8d as noted for the first snapshot analyzed the orders of magnitude in the differences of biomass strongly vary depending on the prey considered gains or losses do not exceed 1 of the available stock for microphytoplankton and mesozooplankton while they can reach a few percent of the biomass of microzooplankton the third snapshot at the beginning of spring 2004 shows the presence of two remarkable hydrodynamic structures cyclonic eddy ce2 and anticyclonic eddy ae4 figs 5e 6 e 7 e 8 e ae4 is of small size with a circular shape radius ca 40 km in the north central part of the gol ce2 is a medium sized structure of elliptical shape large semi axis ca 75 km small semi axis ca 30 km that is located in the southwestern part of the gol shelf during this snapshot the rofi of the rhone river is shaped by the phosphate surface distribution fig 8e which appeared to be spatially reduced near the mouth over the osmose gol domain mesozooplankton biomass is higher along the coastline fig 5e the cyclonic and anticyclonic flows of the two eddies tend to spread mesozooplankton on the shelf eastward and southward respectively the spatial distribution of microzooplankton biomass is patchy in this snapshot fig 6e it shows complex spatial patterns characterized by either high biomass as in the central part of the shelf between the two eddies and off the camargue coast or low biomass along the shoreline of the gol two main strips of high microphytoplankton biomass are modeled fig 7e the first one is located along the western coast of the gol near cap d adge and the second has a similar location to that of microzooplankton off the camargue coast with a marked southward spreading between these two strips a large area on the central part of the shelf is rather depleted in microphytoplankton suggesting that the flows of eddies act as a physical barrier limiting connections between the coastal and offshore areas except for the vicinity of the rhone river mouth characterized by very high phosphate contents 0 4 mmol m 3 fig 8e the gol shelf shows moderate concentrations around 0 2 mmol m 3 mainly in its eastern part from the examination of difference maps the configuration of two ways coupling systematically involves lower biomass of mesozooplankton fig 5f than those without considering any coupling the effects induced by the two ways coupling decrease from the western to the eastern edge of ce2 but at the opposite there are no particular impacts associated with ae4 as for the two previous snapshots strongest effects of two ways coupling generally match regions of highest mesozooplankton biomass but overall the biomass losses remain very low less than 0 5 of the available stock fig 5f by contrast most of the zones with high microzooplankton biomass e g central shelf camargue coast are rather characterized by gains in biomass when considering the two ways coupling fig 6f the losses in biomass can reach 1 2 of the available stock on the shelf break area while gains do not exceed more than 0 5 off the camargue coast for example in contrast to other plankton groups the impacts of two ways coupling on the microphytoplankton distributions are not clearly correlated with the levels of its available biomass for example the region of high biomass located off the camargue coast is both characterized by gains at its eastern edge and losses at its southwestern edge fig 7f the changes due to the two ways coupling are relatively important during this snapshot since the fraction of gain or loss is never lower than 1 and can reach several percent of the available stock the two ways coupling do not induce particular changes in phosphate concentrations in relation with the presence of eddies fig 8f on the whole there are only minor gains in phosphate near the rhone river mouth when htl and ltl models are coupled 3 6 effects of considering two ways coupling on the food web functioning a similar food web organization is found between the one way forcing and the two ways coupling periods bănaru et al 2019 i e there are no differences concerning the main prey of the htl species fig 9 trophic levels do not change between the two configurations for all the species bănaru et al 2019 some small differences less than 5 can be noticed with lower flows of consumption between microzooplankton and juveniles of european anchovy and between juveniles of european pilchard and adults of atlantic horse mackerel results not shown however some small differences in diet generally less than 5 values are not indicated are noted for the two ways coupling mode compared to the one way forcing mode that are detailed hereafter european anchovy prey more on microzooplankton and less on nano and microphytoplankton during winter juveniles of european sprat prey more on microzooplankton during winter while adults consume more mesozooplankton and less teleost larvae predators generally consume smaller prey southern shortfin squid adults of atlantic horse mackerel juveniles of european hake consume more mesozooplankton and less teleosts in the two ways coupling mode only atlantic bluefin tuna increase their percentage of teleost consumption juveniles and adults of european sprat and blue whiting and juveniles of european hake higher differences appear for larvae of european pilchard adults of european sprat juveniles of atlantic horse mackerel juveniles of atlantic mackerel juveniles of blue whiting with an increase in their consumption of mesozooplankton ca 20 15 13 12 and 19 respectively while their consumption of teleost larvae decrease and that of microzooplankton decrease for larvae of european pilchard juveniles of atlantic horse mackerel and juveniles of atlantic mackerel for example juvenile atlantic mackerel s consumption of juvenile european pilchard decreases by 9 the size distribution of the prey of adult atlantic mackerel changes as well with a decreasing consumption of juvenile and adult european pilchard by 7 5 and 3 respectively but an increasing consumption of the larvae stages by 5 in the two ways coupling mode the species composition of the prey is less even in the diet of the majority of predators than those in the one way forcing mode northern krill southern shortfin squid larvae and juveniles of european pilchard juveniles and adults of european sprat juveniles of atlantic horse mackerel juveniles of blue whiting only juveniles of atlantic mackerel increase the evenness in their prey composition in the two ways coupling mode the seasonal variability in the prey composition is reduced compared to that of the one way forcing mode for northern krill southern shortfin squid european pilchard european anchovy juveniles of european sprat and juveniles of atlantic mackerel only atlantic mackerel and adults of european hake show a higher seasonal variability in the two ways coupling mode for all the osmose htl groups the interannual variability in prey composition is higher in the two ways coupling mode than that in the one way forcing mode even if small changes in flows and diets are noted between the one way forcing and the two ways coupling modes some changes in biomass by trophic level are found between these two periods fig 9 phytoplankton biomass decreases by 14 mainly related to microphytoplankton zooplankton biomass globally decreases by 7 which may be related to the decrease in microzooplankton biomass while mesozooplankton biomass slightly increases planktivorous teleosts and northern krill biomass decrease by 8 mainly related to the decreasing biomass in european pilchard and northern krill while the biomasses of european anchovy and european sprat slightly increase globally high trophic level predatory teleosts and southern shortfin squid increase their biomass by 38 all of them showing an increasing biomass trend despite the assumption of a constant fishing mortality during the two periods of coupling modes bănaru et al 2019 4 discussion 4 1 interannual variability of hydrodynamics winter spring conditions in the north western mediterranean sea over the period 2001 2004 a strong interannual variability of the intensity of deep convection and dense water dw formation has been observed for a long time e g medoc group 1970 gascard 1978 and it is now known on the basis of modelling studies e g herrmann et al 2008 somot et al 2018 that the main modes of variability are related to the variability of atmospheric conditions during winter according to the recent study of somot et al 2018 that was based on empirical and model based indicators i e mixed layer depth yearly maximum extension of the convective zone of the intensity of dw formation in the study area the period 2001 2004 was characterized by a succession of winter convective phases which were strongly variable in intensity the 2001 winter period defined from january to march showed a weak convective episode followed by a slightly weaker convective episode in winter 2002 in contrast the 2003 winter period was characterized by an episode of strong convection the 2004 winter period showed a convective phase of moderate intensity much lower than in 2003 but higher than in 2001 and 2002 for at least three decades it has been observed that the intensity of spring blooms especially surface extension export fluxes in the nw mediterranean sea depended on the intensity of the convection process during the preceding winter on the basis of in situ data e g san feliu and munoz 1971 rigual hernandez et al 2013 severin et al 2014 and satellite remote sensing data e g volpe et al 2012 mayot et al 2016 results and analyses with regional 3d coupled models e g herrmann et al 2013 auger et al 2014 ulses et al 2016 corroborate these set of observations in particular these latter modelling studies and a recent study related to observation data mayot et al 2017 showed that the size structure of the plankton community during the spring bloom and of the yearly primary productivity was closely related to the intensity of the winter convection events i e the higher the intensity of the convective sequence the more the plankton size spectrum moves towards larger cells this is a major result that may have some crucial consequences on the structure of the htl community the present study aimed to analyze these potential consequences over the 2001 to 2004 time period that was characterized by a marked interannual variability of deep convection somot et al 2018 the ability of the symphonie hydrodynamics model to correctly reproduce the shelf dw formation in the gol dufau julliand et al 2004 ulses et al 2008 as well as the offshore dw formation by deep convection in the northwestern mediterranean sea herrmann et al 2008 herrmann and somot 2008 auger et al 2014 has been recurrently shown the version of the eco3m s symphonie model implemented here is very close to that of auger et al 2014 which produced a similar sequence of interannual variability for the convection process to that modeled by somot et al 2018 4 2 seasonal and interannual bottom up and top down effects between the ltl and htl communities most of the five plankton groups considered in this study show seasonal dynamics that is partly influenced by the winter conditions of the dw formation figs 1 a1 a2 the mesozooplankton and nanoplankton biomass is generally decreasing during winter time but with differential rates for example the more convective the winter is the sharper is the decline in nanophytoplankton biomass but the lower is the decrease in the biomass of nano and mesozooplankton for nanoplankton the rest of the seasonal dynamics was shaped by the winter evolution of their biomass with the most convective winters e g 2003 2004 generally leading to lower biomass ensuing microphyto and microzooplankton are the groups showing an increase in their biomass during the convective winter period the pattern of seasonal dynamics of microphytoplankton biomass was more sensitive to the interannual variability of the convection process than that of microzooplankton indeed the spring to autumn biomass of microphytoplankton is higher in the case of moderate 2004 to high 2003 convective winters the relationship between the winter peak and the intensity of dw formation was less clear since the year 2001 2002 respectively showed higher winter maxima than in 2003 2004 respectively this set of model outputs on the seasonal dynamics of plankton vs interannual variability of winter convection intensity is very informative because it shows certain deviations relative to the usual pattern observed in recent datasets mayot et al 2017 and from hydrodynamics ltl models auger et al 2014 highly convective winters such as 2003 and to a lesser extent 2004 do not systematically have a positive negative respectively impact on the microphytoplankton and mesozooplankton biomass microzooplankton respectively as usually assumed in our e2e modelling study these deviations may be attributable to the htl predation on the different plankton groups indeed the groups showing the widest divergences with regard to the usual assumed pattern i e microplankton mesozooplankton are those under the highest pressure of predation by htl organisms fig 4 a negative impact of moderate to high convective winters on the seasonal cycles of nanoplankton biomass was found figs a1 a2 similarly to the aforementioned previous studies but occasional deviations could be noted from spring to summer when htl predation pressure reaches the highest levels especially for nanophytoplankton this feature is interesting because while the direct predation due to htl on nanophytoplankton remains overall very far from its maximum 0 01 this process might be able to shape the seasonal cycle of this size class of phytoplankton during spring and summer stable isotope studies showed that nanophytoplankton represents the main organic matter source for the entire food web in the gol bănaru 2015 this group is dominant in terms of biomass in the nw mediterranean sea for most of the year marty et al 2002 siokou frangou et al 2010 estrada and vaqué 2014 mayot et al 2017 and according to our results it is likely to play an important role for fueling the htl productivity even though the htl predation rate appears to be low the effects of htl predation on plankton combined with the variable intensity of the convection process offer some new insights on the controls on plankton biomass at certain crucial periods of the seasonal cycle for example the recent study of auger et al 2014 based on ltl modeling i e without top down control by htl showed that the higher the intensity of convection during winter the lower the stocks of mesozooplankton are mainly due to the dispersal of predators and prey with increasing mixing our study showed contrasting results when two ways coupling between ltl and htl models was performed the winter stocks of mesozooplankton were the lowest during the winters of 2001 and 2002 that are however the least convective winters of the simulation period these two sets of results are not fundamentally in opposition a less convective winter may involve more mesozooplankton and in turn higher predation by htl on this plankton group reducing its stock in fine while a more convective winter would induce higher stocks by lower predation by htl due to dispersal of their prey this scheme of functioning would consecutively result in winter mesozooplankton stocks that are higher during convective winters and lower during less convective winters this top down control on mesozooplankton winter biomass is confirmed by the maintenance of high levels of htl predation pressure fig 4 during the least convective winters e g 2001 2002 of the simulated period the maximum minimum respectively of htl predation pressure is delayed to autumn middle of spring respectively for microplankton as the winter convection decreases in intensity this may explain why their biomass is the lowest at the end of autumn in 2001 and 2002 but their winter spring dynamics are harder to decipher because in addition to the impact of winter convection and top down control by htl microplankton is also a usual prey for mesozooplankton then ecological process of trophic cascading has to be also considered as a further driver of seasonal dynamics for example if the positive impact of convection on the microphytoplankton stock is only considered the 2003 winter peak of microphytoplankton should be the highest one of the simulated period whereas the highest peak was modeled for winter 2001 strong top down controls by both htl throughout autumn 2002 fig 4 and mesozooplankton at the beginning of winter 2003 fig 1 may explain the difference in the peaks of microphytoplankton biomass between winter of 2001 and 2003 this example illustrates that the seasonal dynamics of plankton biomass especially from winter to spring may result from an intricate combination of top down controls and convection intensity bottom up in the study area in the same way this combination of drivers may also influence the duration of winter to spring peaks for microzooplankton it is interesting to analyze whether the interannual variability of the winter convection could have some impacts on the seasonal dynamics of the modeled htl groups through the spatio temporal dynamics of their prey especially the answer to this question can be found in the analysis of the who eats what and when table 1 northern krill tended to become a major predator of some plankton groups such as microphytoplankton and mesozooplankton during moderate to high convective winters 2003 and 2004 european pilchard was also a main consumer of the largest size classes of plankton but this size based predation pattern changed in relation with the convection intensity european pilchards of intermediate and large size were generally the first predators of microplankton in years with low to very low convective winters but consumed much less of these prey in years with more convective winters when the main predators were the intermediate size classes of northern krill and european anchovy european anchovies especially those of large size are one of the three main predators of micro and mesozooplankton when winter convection tends to be low to very low whereas they exert very low predation on these plankton groups when winters are more convective on the whole the size based predation pattern appeared to change towards smaller individuals eating smaller zooplankton and microphytoplankton when the intensity of convection increases this pattern is in line with recent observations showing that european pilchard and european anchovy were consuming smaller prey than in previous studies le bourg et al 2015 and is probably one of the main factors explaining the decrease in their body condition and the current small pelagic fisheries crisis brosset et al 2016 saraux et al 2018 most of the seasonal dynamics of htl landings and biomass showed a stronger interannual variability in the two ways coupling mode but this variability could not be clearly related to changes in the intensity of winter convection however modeled variations in the seasonality of ltl groups influenced by winter convection may disrupt the process of predator prey match cushing 1996 that may impact the recruitment and biomass of the htl groups while the seasonal dynamics of ltl groups have been shown to be partly shaped by the intensity of winter convection there were no clear relationships with the interannual variability of htl groups along the simulated time sequence it is suggested here that the length of the simulation period was probably too short to detect a bottom up control of the htl dynamics by the hydrodynamics of the region palomera et al 2007 have shown a positive correlation between european pilchard and european anchovy biomass and the intensity of winter mixing in the catalan sea nw mediterranean sea from a 15 y time series another field study suggested a year and a half time lag between sardine catches and wind mixing in this area lloret et al 2004 the detectability of the response of small pelagic fishes to bottom up controls might also depend on the recurrence of winters with similar convective intensities as the small pelagic population dynamics emerge from those of several cohorts and age classes a succession of at least two or three low or high convective winters might be required to observe a clear response of the small pelagic community this hypothesis should be tested in future works with the present model but also putting more focus on the recruitment level each year a recent study by brosset et al 2017 found that global environmental indices such as nao mediterranean indices could not explain the observed changes in fish landings and the general decline in the condition of small pelagic fish populations in the mediterranean sea according to this study the observed changes might be rather due to a combination of more local environmental processes and or combined with anthropogenic factors such as fishing or pollution 4 3 spatial structuration of ltl and htl communities and associated trophic effects in relation with mesoscale hydrodynamics the present study enabled investigation of the effects of mesoscale hydrodynamics and htl predation on the distributions of plankton groups and nutrients in the gol and indirectly understanding of the spatial structuration of some htl groups of interest such as small pelagic planktivorous fishes i e european pilchard european anchovy and european sprat saraux et al 2014 highlighted a strong overlap of the latter three species distribution presence absence within the gol but they also showed a differential density of biomass at local scale due to either potential interspecific avoidance or different sensitivities to local environmental characteristics moreover le bourg et al 2015 and brosset et al 2016 showed overlaps in the diet and stable isotope ratios of these three planktivorous species in the gol probably related to their spatial distribution and prey availability in parallel some recent studies based on either coupled biogeochemical hydrodynamics modelling e g campbell et al 2013 or field observations marrec et al 2018 revealed an intricate spatial structuration of the plankton community in connection with the presence of mesoscale to sub mesoscale eddies physical processes down to sub mesoscale can temporarily favor the access to nutrients and light by local alterations of the density gradient involving changes in the ecological niches of plankton species down to minute spatial scale cotti rausch et al 2016 overall the model results showed that mesoscale eddies were areas of the strongest gradients in plankton concentrations and of the more significant gains or losses of plankton biomass when the two ways coupling is considered in such a configuration of coupling these gradients could be caused by a combination of processes acting together and whose it is rather difficult to decipher their respective roles as aforementioned hydrodynamic processes associated to the eddy could act on spatial distributions either mechanically by increasing dispersal or aggregation of plankton through advection and diffusion or and by locally modifying environmental conditions favoring furtive bloom or at the opposite accelerating senescence of plankton community secondly aggregation of plankton in the vicinity of eddies could have also attracted planktivorous pelagic fish and krill hence enhancing htl predation around eddies this predation would then have been able to furthermore shape spatial gradients by a differential consumption of plankton groups according to the size structure of htl organisms attracted and finally this differential predation could in turn reshape the plankton community in term of abundances or and size structure by provoking cascading trophic processes within the community itself on the one hand the edges of ae detected in the southwestern and central parts of the gol showed the most important impacts of two ways coupling whatever the plankton group considered this result is in coherence with the uplift of nutrients and the subsequent increase in primary productivity on the edges of anticyclonic eddies campbell et al 2013 review of mcgillicuddy 2016 on the other hand the two ways coupling only involved minor changes in the plankton distributions around cyclonic eddies in the gol this result could be explained by the shorter lifetimes of cyclonic structures generally observed in this area flexas et al 2002 hu 2011 the short life span of these eddies might not enable to reach a significant local increase in plankton biomass to attract htl in particular even though in osmose fish do not track food gradients but local fish movements follow a random walk equivalent to the diffusion term in a population advection diffusion model and their mean spatial distributions are driven by observed data their opportunistic feeding behavior may increase predation in cells with higher prey density however the structuring role of cyclonic eddies on spatial gradients may also depend on their locations in the gol the case of ce1 was particularly intriguing due to its location near the rhone mouth figs 5c 6 c 7 c 8 c there is a close interaction between the rhone plume enriched in microplankton and the northeastern edge of ce1 that shapes by transport the distributions of plankton biomass and in turn probably htl predation in this area of the gol the process of biomass aggregation resulting from the presence of an eddy potentially involved strong pressure of htl predation on microplankton groups data set showed that there could be an attractor effect of plankton spatial distribution with higher biomass in the rhone river plume for juveniles of different fish species morfin et al 2012 saraux et al 2014 our study shows that mesoscale structures and rhone river inputs may thus play an important role in fish recruitment in the gol and may be related to recent changes observed in small pelagic fish stocks this seems to corroborate the hypothesis of a bottom up control of their stocks le bourg et al 2015 saraux et al 2018 when examining the surface distributions of phosphate contents the differences in concentrations involved by the two ways coupling are in the order of the nanomolar up to 10 nm near the rhone mouth this order of magnitude is within the range of concentrations measured in the gol diaz et al 2008 phosphate exerts a control on primary productivity during part of the year in this area diaz et al 2001 and probably shapes the structure of the picoplankton community moutin et al 2002 in this study the two ways coupling may impact phosphate distributions indirectly through the htl activity of plankton predators or grazers but their metabolism also releases inorganic nutrients and organic matter in the environment libralato and solidoro 2009 and may in turn influence more directly the spatial distributions of nutrients the roles of htl activity on nutrient fields is hence accounted for a minima in the present work this type of processes within the htl community should be taken into account in e2e modelling developments as despite the low numbers of eddies our results highlighted the intricate interactions between mesoscale hydrodynamics and the structuration of nutrients ltl and htl communities 4 4 effects of two ways coupling on food web functioning and controls even if a small portion of the ltl stocks is consumed by htl species our results showed that this may however induce large seasonal and interannual variations for most of the model groups the changes of biomass by trophic level fig 9 induced by the two ways coupling could be interpreted in the light of two alternative hypotheses i the hypothesis of a dominant bottom up effect with a decreasing microphytoplankton biomass due to increased convection and reduced stratification see section 4 1 this may induce a decrease in the biomass of microzooplankton and in turn that of some planktivorous species such as northern krill and european pilchard this would partially release predation on mesozooplankton that increased in biomass while competitors of the european pilchard such as european anchovy and european sprat had also slightly increased in biomass mesozooplankton increase may have favoured the recruitment of higher predator species 4th trophic level which are also planktivorous at juvenile stages and globally increased their biomass ii the combined bottom up and top down effect hypothesis the large increase in the high predator species biomass by 38 may finally induce a top down feedback on planktivorous species this second hypothesis seems more plausible whether if only bottom up processes were controlling the food web functioning we could expect a decrease in the biomass of top predators and not an increase adults of atlantic horse mackerel atlantic mackerel blue whiting and southern shortfin squid may contribute by predation to the decreasing biomass of some planktivorous species the atlantic bluefin tuna may also be a potential predator for these forage species even if van beveren et al 2017 indicated that recent changes in mediterranean small pelagic teleosts are probably not due to increased tuna predation our results in accordance with coll et al 2018 showed that the hypothesis of top down control by other predators should not be neglected planktivorous species are probably concomitantly impacted by top down predation and bottom up effects decreasing plankton prey size and quantity synergic effects of climate and fishing have been shown in the southern benguela travers trolet et al 2014 but to our knowledge this is the first study using and end to end model that analyses the temporal and spatial effects of model coupling on both ltl and htl groups and on food web controls 5 conclusion the impacts of climate variability and fishing on food web complex interactions can be explored comprehensively with e2e models such as osmose gol in the gol wind regimes and hydrodynamics processes have a crucial role in the variability of ltl spatial distributions seasonal and interannual cycles according to our model results this variability at different scales in time and space may impact htl groups recruitment biomass and landings the hypothesis of a bottom up control could not explain alone the decline in biomass and size of small pelagic fish found in our model results and that look strikingly similar to recent concerns about fish and fisheries status in the gol our model results suggest that top down control by top predators and feedbacks on plankton dynamics should not be neglected the use of a fully dynamic two ways coupling between the models of ltl and htl organisms revealed interesting results on the whole even though small proportions of plankton global stocks were preyed upon by htl species some important consequences for the infra seasonal and annual cycles of both htl and plankton groups could be observed in the two ways coupling mode involving significant changes in biomass landings and food web interactions by cascading effects spatial effects especially the impacts of htl predation on the plankton fields were less clear except in areas in which primary productivity was high e g rofi or in the vicinity of mesoscale hydrodynamics structures e g eddies however these results remain preliminary as the only considered interaction between the ltl and htl models is made through predation while the vertical integration sensu shin et al 2010 between the two models could be made through other processes such as natural mortality and egestion by htl producing detritus and ensuing remineralization by heterotrophic plankton or such as excretion of dissolved inorganic organic nutrients in turn made available for the whole plankton community predation on htl larvae by carnivorous zooplankton especially by gelatinous organisms not included in this model may also have to be taken into account horizontal biodiversity integration sensu shin et al 2010 could also be improved to represent other major functional groups in the gol ecosystem such as benthic organisms or invasive species ecosystem based fisheries management and biodiversity conservation need to rely on the development of more holistic modelling approaches of the ecosystem to account for complex species multidimensional dynamics spatial temporal multispecies and their interactions this goes in pair with improvements in data acquisitions high frequency automated observations in the field on a variety of components and processes from the physical environment to the biogeochemistry up to the biomass and life histories of higher trophic level species this would help increasing the degree of realism and confidence in the parameterization of models and reduce uncertainty in their projections

25041,the end to end osmose gol model parameterized calibrated and evaluated for the gulf of lions ecosystem northwestern mediterranean sea has been used to investigate the effects of introducing two ways coupling between the dynamics of low and high trophic level groups the use of a fully dynamic two ways coupling between the models of low and high trophic levels organisms provided some insights in the functioning of the food web in the gulf of lions on the whole microphytoplankton and mesozooplankton were found to be preyed upon by high trophic levels planktivorous groups at rates lower than 20 and 30 of their respective natural mortality rates but these relatively low rates involved some important alterations in the infra seasonal and annual cycles of both high and low trophic levels groups they induced significant changes in biomass fisheries landings and food web interactions by cascading effects spatial differential impacts of high trophic levels predation on plankton are less clear except in areas in which primary productivity is high higher predation rates on plankton groups were encountered within the area of the rhone river s influence and in areas associated to the presence of mesoscale eddies in the northwestern part of the gulf of lions especially generally the pressure of the high trophic levels predation was the highest in areas of highest biomass whatever the plankton group considered the two ways coupling between low and high trophic levels models revealed both bottom up and top down controls in the ecosystem with effects on planktivorous species similar to those observed in the field the use of the end to end model enabled to propose a set of potential mechanisms that may explain the observed decrease in small pelagic catches by the french mediterranean artisanal fisheries over the last decade keywords end to end model two ways coupling plankton fisheries food web functioning 1 introduction human activities interacting with climatic

coll et al 2010 2012 lötze et al 2011 in the northwestern mediterranean sea the gulf of lions gol is characterized by a wide and shallow shelf this area is one of the most productive zones of the mediterranean sea e g bosc et al 2004 owing to heavy year round nutrient inputs mainly from the rhone river lefèvre et al 1997 it is thus an important feeding area for many resident and migratory high trophic level htl species as a result 20 of the french fishing fleet operates in the gol and 90 of the french mediterranean landings take place in this area demaneche et al 2009 many fish species of commercial interest have been intensively exploited on the gol continental shelf over the past decades by french and spanish fleets using multi specific artisanal gears farrugio et al 1993 sacchi 2008 in this area a study based on the ecopath mass balance model suggested that some fish species may be overfished with respect to the amount of biomass necessary for the functioning of the food web bönaru et al 2013 forage species such as european pilchard and european anchovy representing usually more than 50 of the total catches in this area are one of the most important prey groups being a major trophic link between plankton and top predators as some fish species seabirds and mammals bănaru et al 2013 however over the last ten years and despite the decrease in fishing pressure the mean size and body condition of european pilchard and european anchovy have declined van beveren et al 2014 saraux et al 2018 recent studies on their diet le bourg et al 2015 showed that they probably consume smaller prey than in the past and that they maybe in competition with the european sprat a non commercial planktivorous fish which has strongly increased in biomass during recent years in this area some interesting questions arise from these observations such as why there has been a higher rate of consumption of smaller prey by planktivorous fishes over the past few years in this area have these small planktonic prey species been more abundant in recent years and if so is environmental forcing winds hydrodynamics and its variability at different frequencies responsible for this alteration of the plankton community in this context the trophic and especially size based trophic interactions within the food web and the impact of the environmental conditions on these interactions are of crucial importance in order to understand the functioning and recent evolution of the gol ecosystem models that integrate the representation of the whole ecosystem from the dynamics of the physical environment to that of the highest trophic levels the so called end to end e2e models see rose 2012 for an accurate definition are useful tools to address the aforementioned ecological questions in the present study the e2e model chosen to explore these questions is the individual and size based model osmose shin and cury 2004 with a configuration dedicated to the gol named osmose gol that has been recently parameterized calibrated and confronted to observations see details in the companion paper bănaru et al 2019 one of the strengths of this configuration is to account for a fully dynamic two ways coupling between the models of low trophic level ltl organisms usually biogeochemical models and htl organisms in this configuration of coupling outputs of plankton groups provided by the ltl model serve as prey fields for the htl organisms which return an additional predation mortality in the plankton groups the implementation of e2e models has rarely been undertaken in a dynamic two ways coupling between ltl and htl models but rather in a one way forcing mode with outputs from biogeochemical models being used as forage fields for htl organisms without any feedback on the ltl biomass and distributions as a result the effects of the type of models coupling with or without feedbacks from htl to ltl organisms on ecosystem dynamics have only been documented for the marine ecosystem of the benguela current travers trolet et al 2009 2014 to the best of our knowledge the aims of the present study are therefore the following i to assess the impact of the two ways coupling between the ltl and htl sub models on the outputs of the e2e model this evaluation will be undertaken through the analysis of changes in the temporal dynamics of the biomass and landings of living resources in predation pressure on plankton groups and in the resulting trophic cascade effects ii to evaluate the order of magnitude and potential impacts of the two ways coupling and hydrodynamic processes meso scale eddies region of freshwater influence by rhone river on the spatial distribution of plankton and nutrients iii to propose hypotheses to enlighten the environmental causes of the observed fluctuating stocks of certain fish species e g european anchovy european pilchard and european sprat the e2e model was run over a four year period characterized by contrasted environmental conditions involving a high interannual variability of the biomass of certain plankton groups the analysis of this run may enable to disentangle the respective roles of bottom up and top down processes on the seasonal and interannual dynamics of htl organisms this type of analysis is crucial to raise our capacity in moving towards ecosystem based management of the fisheries in the gol marine area 2 methods the osmose gol model that has been previously described parametrised calibrated and evaluated in the companion paper bănaru et al 2019 is used in this study to achieve the aforementioned aims this e2e model is composed of two sub models the first is the eco3m s symphonie model campbell et al 2013 that represents the dynamics of ltl organisms influenced by hydrodynamics and meteorological processes the second is the individual based model osmose shin and cury 2004 grüss et al 2015 that simulates the dynamics of htl organisms the design of the numerical experiment is detailed in the companion paper bănaru et al 2019 but its main points are reminded in the following for sake of clarity the osmose gol is firstly calibrated using an optimization technique relying on an evolutionary algorithm and a likelihood based objective function oliveros ramos and shin 2016 the calibrated model is then run in the one way forcing configuration and feed in loop on the numerical fields of ltl biomass for year 2001 until a realistic equilibrium is reached in the levels of htl outputs bănaru et al 2019 this equilibrium is reached after a period of 35 years that is considered as a spin up period following this spin up period the osmose gol model is run first in the one way mode during years 36 to 39 and then in the two ways coupling mode by receiving the numerical fields of ltl biomass from years 2001 to 2004 corresponding to years referred to as 40 to 43 hereafter a set of 50 simulations was launched to account for the stochasticity of the osmose model the one way forcing period years 36 to 39 as well as the period of two ways coupling mode years 40 to 43 have been considered for analysis in the following sections mean median and associated percentiles values are used to synthetically present and analyze the outputs of the model 3 results 3 1 temporal dynamics of plankton biomass the annual cycles of microphytoplankton fig 1 a show the highest levels of biomass along winter period and at the onset of spring in the one way forcing mode the summer season is characterized by the lowest biomasses and weakest variations autumn is characterized by an increase in biomass that is of lower intensity than that of the spring a more pronounced interannual variability of seasonal dynamics can be noted under the two ways coupling mode the intensity and duration of winter peak are very variable depending on the year the sharp decrease in biomass occurring later during spring is always present autumnal peak can be present on some years e g 40 42 while absent on the other ones the microphytoplankton biomass yearly eaten table 1 is on average ca 24 6 103 tons s d 180 tons in the one way forcing mode which represents from 3 to 16 of the available stock over year 40 the biomass eaten increases to nearly 27 103 tons that is 18 of the available stock the microphytoplankton biomass annually consumed by predators significantly falls down to 19 103 tons during the following two years 41 and 42 and drastically decline again to 16 7 103 tons during year 43 whatever the coupling mode the main predators of microphytoplankton are the two largest classes 3 cm of european pilchard and northern krill however in year 43 the intermediate size class of european anchovy 3 8 cm appears to be the second most important predator at the expense of the largest european pilchard 12 5 cm the annual cycle of microzooplankton biomass fig 1b in the one way forcing mode shows sharp variations of biomass throughout the years while in the two ways coupling mode the variability is less marked in the one way forcing mode biomass is at its minimum at the beginning of winter then sharply rises up to 7 5 105 tons the rest of the year is characterized by a decreasing trend of biomass until the end of autumn punctuated by large and rapid variations such as a recurrent summer peak of biomass the last three years of simulation in the two ways coupling mode have the common point of showing a minimum biomass moved forward during autumn and a delayed peak occurring at the end of winter years 41 and 42 or even during spring year 43 the amount of microzooplankton yearly eaten is slightly higher than 29 103 tons on average in the one way forcing mode table 1 and decreases gradually throughout the simulated years in the two ways coupling mode down to ca 20 103 tons year 43 then representing ca 10 of the autumnal minimum the largest size classes of european pilchard 3 cm and european anchovy 8 cm are on average the main predators of microzooplankton in the two coupling modes however it can be noted that there is a certain decrease in the predator size e g european anchovy since the intermediate size class appears to be one of the three main predators at the expense of the largest size class from year 42 as for microzooplankton the annual cycle of the mesozooplankton biomass fig 1c in the one way configuration strongly differs from those occurring in the two ways mode in the one way configuration minima levels of biomass are found during winter followed by a sharp increase from spring to summer peaking at the end of summer then biomass quickly falls by ca 40 before a slower decrease during autumn then a sharper fall at the onset of the following winter the seasonal cycles in the two ways configuration are marked by a strong interannual variability while the minimum biomass in winter increases over the years the seasonal peaks of biomass are reached in spring summer autumn of years 42 41 43 respectively the amount of mesozooplankton eaten yearly is 4714 tons on average in the one way configuration table 1 ranging between 5 and 15 of the available stock in contrast to the dynamics of predation on all other planktonic prey there is no clear trend in the quantity of mesozooplankton eaten over the years in the two ways configuration it is worth noting that the amount of eaten biomass is the highest one 5572 tons during year 43 in line with the sharp increase in available biomass during the second part of that year fig 1c the european anchovy exclusively 8 cm and european pilchard all size classes are the main predators of mesozooplankton the northern krill can occasionally be the second most important predator as in years 42 and 43 and in the one way configuration it is interesting to note that while the amount of eaten biomass increases by ca 20 from year 42 to 43 the ranking of the main predators does not change the seasonal cycle of the nanophytoplankton biomass fig a1 shows a minimum at the end of winter followed by an increase from spring to the end of autumn the year to year variability of the biomass cycle is marked over the period of the two ways coupling mode the amount of nanophytoplankton consumed compared to the available stock fig a1 remains extremely low 0 004 whatever the coupling mode considered table 1 however this amount increases by 40 in the two ways coupling mode the smallest size classes of european anchovy european pilchard as well as northern krill are the main predators of nanophytoplankton whatever the linking mode considered the annual cycles of nanozooplankton in the one way forcing mode fig a2 show an abrupt increase at the onset of winter followed by a sharp drop to very low levels along the rest of the year years 41 43 are characterized by a strong erosion of the winter peaks the nanozooplankton biomass yearly eaten table 1 is very low ca 0 13 tons on average in the one way forcing mode and even lower when two ways coupling is implemented representing a tiny proportion of the planktonic food 0 005 as expected the smallest sizes 3 cm of european sprat and european anchovy as well as northern krill are the main predators of nanozooplankton 3 2 temporal dynamics of htl species biomass the seasonal dynamics of htl species resulting from the one way forcing mode have been already depicted in detail by bănaru et al 2019 and only the seasonal cycles produced under the two ways coupling mode are hereafter described years 40 to 43 in fig 2 most of the modeled biomass of htl species shows interannual changes in median values within the ranges of biomass estimates from field observations except that of european hake which is slightly overestimated the median biomass of northern krill fig 2a shows wide variations with the highest and lowest values occurring in winter and the end of spring respectively interannual variability of the seasonal cycle can be noted for example the autumnal plateau does not exist during year 42 and show a continuous increase up to a peak of biomass reached during the next winter this year 43 winter maximum is 30 higher than those of previous years at the onset of the two ways coupling the biomass of southern shortfin squid fig 2b decreases from 2 5 104 tons down to 2 104 tons the following two years show on the contrary a continuous and strong increase in biomass with only slight seasonal variations the temporal dynamics of european pilchard fig 2c show regular seasonal variations with maxima reached at the onset of spring and minima at the entrance of winter the yearly range of extreme values is wide with variations of 30 40 of the biomass during year 40 the spring maximum of biomass reaches 2 6 105 tons while the minimum is around 1 80 105 tons the following years then show a global decrease in the biomass levels with lower and lower spring maxima 1 25 105 tons in year 43 during year 40 the median biomass of european anchovy fig 2d shows a seasonal cycle characterized by highest biomass from mid winter to the end of spring and lowest biomass during autumn this seasonal dynamic almost entirely disappears the following years with spring peaks barely detectable e g years 41 and 43 the seasonal variations in the biomass of european sprat fig 2e are weak however the range of variations is more marked under the two ways configuration highest biomass occurs at the end of spring while the lowest is found at the beginning of winter the highest median biomass reaches 2 104 tons during year 43 and is almost twice the maximum of year 40 the dynamic of atlantic horse mackerel fig 2f has common points with that of european sprat seasonal variations in biomass are weak but they perceptibly increase under the two ways configuration furthermore the biomass peaks regularly increase reaching up to ca 2 5 104 tons at the autumn end of year 43 that is 35 more than the maximum reached during year 40 in parallel there is a larger spread of the percentiles range especially towards the high values of biomass a very weak seasonal signal can be observed in the simulated biomass of atlantic mackerel fig 2g the amplitude of variations between maxima from end of winter to mid spring and minima from mid summer to mid autumn does not exceed 12 however year 41 is characterized by the absence of biomass peak at the end of winter the last two years show a significant increase in biomass levels by 20 compared to previous years the biomass of blue whiting fig 2h does not show any clear seasonal pattern median biomass fluctuates around 4 104 tons during year 40 and the three last years are characterized by an increase in the biomass up to 6 5 104 tons the biomass of european hake fig 2i does not show any significant seasonal signals the level of biomass remains almost constant 1 4 104 tons during years 40 and 41 but a slight decrease 10 occurs over the last two years the median biomass of atlantic bluefin tuna fig 2j shows a marked seasonal cycle a minimum biomass during winter 5000 5500 tons is followed by a rapid increase up to a first peak at the onset of spring 5600 6200 tons another minimum biomass occurs at the entrance of summer and then the annual peak 7000 tons occurs during every autumn a slight increase in biomass 10 is noted especially during the first three years under two ways configuration 3 3 temporal dynamics of htl species landings the temporal dynamics of htl species landings results from the input parameters of the model and particularly fishing mortality and seasonality that remain constant over the whole modeled period bănaru et al 2019 and of the dynamics of the exploited stocks and the food web interactions as in the one way configuration bănaru et al 2019 the modeled landings of most of the htl species except southern shortfin squid and atlantic mackerel stand within the ranges of observed data fig 3 catches of northern krill and european sprat results not shown are not computed by the model as they are not landed by fishermen the temporal dynamics of htl species with planktivorous dominant diet such as southern shortfin squid fig 3a european pilchard fig 3b and european anchovy fig 3c have in common to show significant changes between year 40 and the following three years for the latter two species the seasonality of the landings remains similar but a significant decline occurs over years 41 43 for the southern shortfin squid fig 3a both the seasonal cycle and the level of landings change radically the landings are almost stable during the first part of year 40 and then sharply fall of more than 50 until the middle of year 41 the years 42 and 43 show an increase up to ca 700 tons without a clear seasonal cycle the temporal dynamics of atlantic horse mackerel fig 3d shows a seasonal cycle composed of two maxima spring and autumn and two minima winter and summer the spring maximum is considerably higher than that of autumn except in year 42 year 40 shows the highest spring peak with landings exceeding 30 tons in parallel the winter minimum 8 tons is generally lower than that of summer except for year 42 the last two years are characterized by a larger spread of the percentiles range especially with regard to the high values of landings during spring landings of atlantic mackerel fig 3e increase during autumn and peak at the onset of winter they then decline slowly down to minimum levels at the end of summer the seasonal cycle is generally weakly marked year 43 shows an overall increase in landings by 15 the seasonality of landings of blue whiting fig 3f is almost unchanged in two ways configuration landings are close to zero during autumn and sharply increase during winter up to their maximum levels this peak is transient and landings drastically fall in two phases a small decline first occurs at the onset of summer followed by a short stabilization then landings quickly drop to zero during the second part of summer maximum landings of european hake fig 3g oscillate from mid winter to the end of summer between 90 and 100 tons during years 40 and 41 and between 80 and 90 tons during years 42 and 43 autumn is characterized by a sharp decline down to a minimum of 10 tons and the onset of winter shows a sharp increase up to the seasonal maximum the pattern of annual dynamics of landings for atlantic bluefin tuna fig 3h shows marked seasonal variations and a regular cycle during years 40 to 43 modeled landings are close to zero from mid autumn to the beginning of winter which corresponds to the period when bluefin tuna migrates out of this area a first increase peaking at 280 tons follows in spring a second much higher peak 500 tons then occurs during autumn 3 4 temporal dynamics of the htl predation pressure on the plankton groups the level of htl pressure is defined as the ratio between the actual htl induced mortality rates and their potential maximum value table 2 for each group of planktonic prey the median levels of htl predation pressure on the microphytoplankton group fig 4 a oscillate between 25 and 50 the second part of the year is generally marked by the highest pressure with a peak during summer the minimum pressure generally occurs during winter or even spring as in year 43 there are however some significant differences in the annual cycle between years the seasonal pattern of year 40 shows rather wide and rapid variations with a minimum occurring at the beginning of winter followed by an overall increase until reaching two successive peaks of around 47 in summer and autumn the years 41 43 show i lesser variability and ii a decreasing trend of predation characterized for example by lower and lower peaks and minima the htl predation pressure on the microzooplankton group fig 4b oscillates between 25 and 55 the seasonal pattern mirrors that of microphytoplankton a predation minimum occurs at the end of winter and is followed by an overall increase from spring to mid autumn year 40 differs from the last three years by wide variations and a marked winter peak interannual variability can be also noticed with a pressure minimum moved forward mid winter i e year 42 or delayed mid spring i e years 41 43 overall predation pressure tends to decrease over the simulated four years the levels of htl predation pressure on the mesozooplankton group fig 4c are ca 50 for most of the simulation period except at the beginning of year 40 for which ratios exceed 60 the seasonal pattern generally shows two periods of high pressure the first one happens in winter and lasts until the onset of spring i e year 43 and the second one extends from mid summer to the end of autumn the spring period is then rather characterized by a minimum from years 41 to 43 the winter maximum appears to be strongly reduced while the autumn maximum becomes dominant as previously noted for the microplankton groups there is globally a slow decrease in the predation pressure over the simulated period the pressure of predation on the nanoplankton groups figs a3 a4 remains very low 0 005 0 006 under the two ways configuration the highest pressures of predation generally happen from the onset of the spring to that of autumn e g year 43 3 5 spatial effects of two ways coupling on plankton and nutrients three snapshots over the simulation period are hereafter shown to illustrate how the two ways coupling can affect the spatial fields of plankton and even those of nutrients indirectly horizontal figs 5 8 fields from february 2002 august 2003 and march 2004 are examined in details because these periods correspond to occurrences of high predation pressure by htl fig 4 which can involve a direct consumption of plankton prey but also some trophic cascading effects within the ltl only the distributions of prey i e microphytoplankton mesozooplankton and microzooplankton for which the htl predation pressure was the highest predation ratio 20 fig 4 over the simulation period are shown as well as those of phosphate contents a nutrient potentially controlling the level of primary productivity in the gol e g diaz et al 2001 to check the spatial effects of the two ways coupling on plankton and nutrient we compared numerical fields from the osmose gol model upper panels of figs 5 8 to those without considering any coupling with osmose model i e only resulting from the ltl eco3m s symphonie model campbell et al 2013 easier comparisons are made by considering fields of differences concentrations with htl predation in two ways configuration minus those without any htl predation for plankton and phosphate lower panels of figs 5 8 the first snapshot to be analyzed happens during the beginning of autumn 2002 and two remarkable hydrodynamic structures under the form of anticyclonic eddies ae1 and ae2 plots a and b of figs 5 8 are present at this period in the gol ae1 is of rather small size with an elliptical shape large semi axis ca 60 km small semi axis ca 40 km and is entirely located in the southwestern part of the osmose gol domain while ae2 is much larger large semi axis ca 140 km small semi axis ca 70 km and only partly located in the osmose gol domain these two eddies as well as the region of freshwater influence rofi of the rhone river diaz et al 2008 mostly shape the distributions of plankton groups and to a lesser degree that of phosphate on the whole the edges of the eddies show difference in biomass or concentrations compared to their center or even their surrounding water masses depending on the plankton groups considered these ae ae2 especially show at their edges either higher biomass in microphytoplankton microzooplankton figs 6a 7 a or lower stocks in mesozooplankton fig 5a than those around the rofi of the rhone river is clearly identified by the area of phosphate high concentrations 0 15 mmol m 3 on fig 8a the rofi is characterized by either high microphytoplankton and microzooplankton biomass on its western edge especially or low mesozooplankton biomass upper panels and first column of figs 5a 6 a 7 a several intriguing features appear from the examination of the difference maps lower panels of figs 5 8 when the whole modeled domain is considered there is generally lower biomass in mesozooplankton and microphytoplankton fig 5b 7 b and slightly higher microzooplankton and phosphate stocks fig 6b and 8 b in the two ways coupling mode the orders of magnitude of differences show strong variations from one plankton group to another and for phosphate up to a few percent of the available stock for microzooplankton and microphytoplankton but much lower than 1 for phosphate and mesozooplankton spatial gradients on the difference maps are marked for plankton especially in the vicinity of ae2 and the rofi of the rhone river for example implementing the two ways coupling had a lower impact on mesozooplankton patterns both in the center and on the edges of ae2 than that modeled on the western part of the gol shelf fig 5b by contrast the impact of considering two ways coupling on microzooplankton and microphytoplankton patterns was especially high on the edges of ae2 fig 6b 7 b within the rofi of the rhone river the account for the two ways coupling provokes less changes on the two zooplankton groups than those modeled at the edges of ae the rofi is also the only zone in this snapshot to show positive differences in microphytoplankton biomass fig 7b indicating a stronger presence of this prey when the two ways coupling is explicitly accounted for differences in phosphate concentrations are hardly detectable at the edges of ae2 on the whole the spatial structuration of nutrients and plankton near the small sized ae1 does not show marked alterations whether the two ways coupling is activated or not only except for microzooplankton the second snapshot to be analyzed happens during the mid summer 2003 when two remarkable hydrodynamic structures anticyclonic eddy ae3 and cyclonic eddy ce1 fig 5c are present in the osmose gol domain ae3 is of medium size with an elliptical shape large semi axis ca 65 km small semi axis ca 50 km on the southwestern side of the gol ce1 is a smaller structure of almost circular shape radius ca 40 km ce1 clearly interacts at the time of the snapshot with the rofi of the rhone river that can be finely located by the surface distribution of phosphate concentrations fig 8c the distributions of plankton groups and phosphate on the northeastern and southwestern sides were mainly constrained by ce1 and ae3 respectively high mesozooplankton biomass 0 25 mmol m 3 fig 5c is modeled in the central part of the gol shelf while a sharply decreasing biomass gradient occurred in the northeastern part of the shelf owing to the presence of ce1 in the southwestern part of the gol mesozooplankton biomass was slightly lower at the edges of ae3 than in surrounding areas surface structuration of microzooplankton biomass is almost the opposite of that of mesozooplankton biomass high microzooplankton biomass was modeled in the northeastern part of the gol shelf and near the rhone river mouth and the flow of ce1 tended to advect these high biomass southwestwards fig 6c similar spatial patterns could be observed for modeled phosphate concentrations fig 8c depletion in modeled microphytoplankton was found in the central part of the shelf while the surrounding water masses near eddies showed higher biomass fig 7c the resulting flow of these two eddies involved an export in microphytoplankton from the coastal area to the offshore zone in this second snapshot the two ways coupling generally provoked the highest losses of plankton in areas of highest biomass whatever the group considered for example the northeastern area near ce1 and the rhone river mouth showed the highest biomass of microphytoplankton and microzooplankton figs 6c 7 c and also the highest losses in biomass when two ways coupling is accounted for figs 6d 7 d in parallel areas for which losses of biomass are the highest ones e g ce1 rhone river mouth show a net gain in phosphate at the surface when two ways coupling is accounted for fig 8d as noted for the first snapshot analyzed the orders of magnitude in the differences of biomass strongly vary depending on the prey considered gains or losses do not exceed 1 of the available stock for microphytoplankton and mesozooplankton while they can reach a few percent of the biomass of microzooplankton the third snapshot at the beginning of spring 2004 shows the presence of two remarkable hydrodynamic structures cyclonic eddy ce2 and anticyclonic eddy ae4 figs 5e 6 e 7 e 8 e ae4 is of small size with a circular shape radius ca 40 km in the north central part of the gol ce2 is a medium sized structure of elliptical shape large semi axis ca 75 km small semi axis ca 30 km that is located in the southwestern part of the gol shelf during this snapshot the rofi of the rhone river is shaped by the phosphate surface distribution fig 8e which appeared to be spatially reduced near the mouth over the osmose gol domain mesozooplankton biomass is higher along the coastline fig 5e the cyclonic and anticyclonic flows of the two eddies tend to spread mesozooplankton on the shelf eastward and southward respectively the spatial distribution of microzooplankton biomass is patchy in this snapshot fig 6e it shows complex spatial patterns characterized by either high biomass as in the central part of the shelf between the two eddies and off the camargue coast or low biomass along the shoreline of the gol two main strips of high microphytoplankton biomass are modeled fig 7e the first one is located along the western coast of the gol near cap d adge and the second has a similar location to that of microzooplankton off the camargue coast with a marked southward spreading between these two strips a large area on the central part of the shelf is rather depleted in microphytoplankton suggesting that the flows of eddies act as a physical barrier limiting connections between the coastal and offshore areas except for the vicinity of the rhone river mouth characterized by very high phosphate contents 0 4 mmol m 3 fig 8e the gol shelf shows moderate concentrations around 0 2 mmol m 3 mainly in its eastern part from the examination of difference maps the configuration of two ways coupling systematically involves lower biomass of mesozooplankton fig 5f than those without considering any coupling the effects induced by the two ways coupling decrease from the western to the eastern edge of ce2 but at the opposite there are no particular impacts associated with ae4 as for the two previous snapshots strongest effects of two ways coupling generally match regions of highest mesozooplankton biomass but overall the biomass losses remain very low less than 0 5 of the available stock fig 5f by contrast most of the zones with high microzooplankton biomass e g central shelf camargue coast are rather characterized by gains in biomass when considering the two ways coupling fig 6f the losses in biomass can reach 1 2 of the available stock on the shelf break area while gains do not exceed more than 0 5 off the camargue coast for example in contrast to other plankton groups the impacts of two ways coupling on the microphytoplankton distributions are not clearly correlated with the levels of its available biomass for example the region of high biomass located off the camargue coast is both characterized by gains at its eastern edge and losses at its southwestern edge fig 7f the changes due to the two ways coupling are relatively important during this snapshot since the fraction of gain or loss is never lower than 1 and can reach several percent of the available stock the two ways coupling do not induce particular changes in phosphate concentrations in relation with the presence of eddies fig 8f on the whole there are only minor gains in phosphate near the rhone river mouth when htl and ltl models are coupled 3 6 effects of considering two ways coupling on the food web functioning a similar food web organization is found between the one way forcing and the two ways coupling periods bănaru et al 2019 i e there are no differences concerning the main prey of the htl species fig 9 trophic levels do not change between the two configurations for all the species bănaru et al 2019 some small differences less than 5 can be noticed with lower flows of consumption between microzooplankton and juveniles of european anchovy and between juveniles of european pilchard and adults of atlantic horse mackerel results not shown however some small differences in diet generally less than 5 values are not indicated are noted for the two ways coupling mode compared to the one way forcing mode that are detailed hereafter european anchovy prey more on microzooplankton and less on nano and microphytoplankton during winter juveniles of european sprat prey more on microzooplankton during winter while adults consume more mesozooplankton and less teleost larvae predators generally consume smaller prey southern shortfin squid adults of atlantic horse mackerel juveniles of european hake consume more mesozooplankton and less teleosts in the two ways coupling mode only atlantic bluefin tuna increase their percentage of teleost consumption juveniles and adults of european sprat and blue whiting and juveniles of european hake higher differences appear for larvae of european pilchard adults of european sprat juveniles of atlantic horse mackerel juveniles of atlantic mackerel juveniles of blue whiting with an increase in their consumption of mesozooplankton ca 20 15 13 12 and 19 respectively while their consumption of teleost larvae decrease and that of microzooplankton decrease for larvae of european pilchard juveniles of atlantic horse mackerel and juveniles of atlantic mackerel for example juvenile atlantic mackerel s consumption of juvenile european pilchard decreases by 9 the size distribution of the prey of adult atlantic mackerel changes as well with a decreasing consumption of juvenile and adult european pilchard by 7 5 and 3 respectively but an increasing consumption of the larvae stages by 5 in the two ways coupling mode the species composition of the prey is less even in the diet of the majority of predators than those in the one way forcing mode northern krill southern shortfin squid larvae and juveniles of european pilchard juveniles and adults of european sprat juveniles of atlantic horse mackerel juveniles of blue whiting only juveniles of atlantic mackerel increase the evenness in their prey composition in the two ways coupling mode the seasonal variability in the prey composition is reduced compared to that of the one way forcing mode for northern krill southern shortfin squid european pilchard european anchovy juveniles of european sprat and juveniles of atlantic mackerel only atlantic mackerel and adults of european hake show a higher seasonal variability in the two ways coupling mode for all the osmose htl groups the interannual variability in prey composition is higher in the two ways coupling mode than that in the one way forcing mode even if small changes in flows and diets are noted between the one way forcing and the two ways coupling modes some changes in biomass by trophic level are found between these two periods fig 9 phytoplankton biomass decreases by 14 mainly related to microphytoplankton zooplankton biomass globally decreases by 7 which may be related to the decrease in microzooplankton biomass while mesozooplankton biomass slightly increases planktivorous teleosts and northern krill biomass decrease by 8 mainly related to the decreasing biomass in european pilchard and northern krill while the biomasses of european anchovy and european sprat slightly increase globally high trophic level predatory teleosts and southern shortfin squid increase their biomass by 38 all of them showing an increasing biomass trend despite the assumption of a constant fishing mortality during the two periods of coupling modes bănaru et al 2019 4 discussion 4 1 interannual variability of hydrodynamics winter spring conditions in the north western mediterranean sea over the period 2001 2004 a strong interannual variability of the intensity of deep convection and dense water dw formation has been observed for a long time e g medoc group 1970 gascard 1978 and it is now known on the basis of modelling studies e g herrmann et al 2008 somot et al 2018 that the main modes of variability are related to the variability of atmospheric conditions during winter according to the recent study of somot et al 2018 that was based on empirical and model based indicators i e mixed layer depth yearly maximum extension of the convective zone of the intensity of dw formation in the study area the period 2001 2004 was characterized by a succession of winter convective phases which were strongly variable in intensity the 2001 winter period defined from january to march showed a weak convective episode followed by a slightly weaker convective episode in winter 2002 in contrast the 2003 winter period was characterized by an episode of strong convection the 2004 winter period showed a convective phase of moderate intensity much lower than in 2003 but higher than in 2001 and 2002 for at least three decades it has been observed that the intensity of spring blooms especially surface extension export fluxes in the nw mediterranean sea depended on the intensity of the convection process during the preceding winter on the basis of in situ data e g san feliu and munoz 1971 rigual hernandez et al 2013 severin et al 2014 and satellite remote sensing data e g volpe et al 2012 mayot et al 2016 results and analyses with regional 3d coupled models e g herrmann et al 2013 auger et al 2014 ulses et al 2016 corroborate these set of observations in particular these latter modelling studies and a recent study related to observation data mayot et al 2017 showed that the size structure of the plankton community during the spring bloom and of the yearly primary productivity was closely related to the intensity of the winter convection events i e the higher the intensity of the convective sequence the more the plankton size spectrum moves towards larger cells this is a major result that may have some crucial consequences on the structure of the htl community the present study aimed to analyze these potential consequences over the 2001 to 2004 time period that was characterized by a marked interannual variability of deep convection somot et al 2018 the ability of the symphonie hydrodynamics model to correctly reproduce the shelf dw formation in the gol dufau julliand et al 2004 ulses et al 2008 as well as the offshore dw formation by deep convection in the northwestern mediterranean sea herrmann et al 2008 herrmann and somot 2008 auger et al 2014 has been recurrently shown the version of the eco3m s symphonie model implemented here is very close to that of auger et al 2014 which produced a similar sequence of interannual variability for the convection process to that modeled by somot et al 2018 4 2 seasonal and interannual bottom up and top down effects between the ltl and htl communities most of the five plankton groups considered in this study show seasonal dynamics that is partly influenced by the winter conditions of the dw formation figs 1 a1 a2 the mesozooplankton and nanoplankton biomass is generally decreasing during winter time but with differential rates for example the more convective the winter is the sharper is the decline in nanophytoplankton biomass but the lower is the decrease in the biomass of nano and mesozooplankton for nanoplankton the rest of the seasonal dynamics was shaped by the winter evolution of their biomass with the most convective winters e g 2003 2004 generally leading to lower biomass ensuing microphyto and microzooplankton are the groups showing an increase in their biomass during the convective winter period the pattern of seasonal dynamics of microphytoplankton biomass was more sensitive to the interannual variability of the convection process than that of microzooplankton indeed the spring to autumn biomass of microphytoplankton is higher in the case of moderate 2004 to high 2003 convective winters the relationship between the winter peak and the intensity of dw formation was less clear since the year 2001 2002 respectively showed higher winter maxima than in 2003 2004 respectively this set of model outputs on the seasonal dynamics of plankton vs interannual variability of winter convection intensity is very informative because it shows certain deviations relative to the usual pattern observed in recent datasets mayot et al 2017 and from hydrodynamics ltl models auger et al 2014 highly convective winters such as 2003 and to a lesser extent 2004 do not systematically have a positive negative respectively impact on the microphytoplankton and mesozooplankton biomass microzooplankton respectively as usually assumed in our e2e modelling study these deviations may be attributable to the htl predation on the different plankton groups indeed the groups showing the widest divergences with regard to the usual assumed pattern i e microplankton mesozooplankton are those under the highest pressure of predation by htl organisms fig 4 a negative impact of moderate to high convective winters on the seasonal cycles of nanoplankton biomass was found figs a1 a2 similarly to the aforementioned previous studies but occasional deviations could be noted from spring to summer when htl predation pressure reaches the highest levels especially for nanophytoplankton this feature is interesting because while the direct predation due to htl on nanophytoplankton remains overall very far from its maximum 0 01 this process might be able to shape the seasonal cycle of this size class of phytoplankton during spring and summer stable isotope studies showed that nanophytoplankton represents the main organic matter source for the entire food web in the gol bănaru 2015 this group is dominant in terms of biomass in the nw mediterranean sea for most of the year marty et al 2002 siokou frangou et al 2010 estrada and vaqué 2014 mayot et al 2017 and according to our results it is likely to play an important role for fueling the htl productivity even though the htl predation rate appears to be low the effects of htl predation on plankton combined with the variable intensity of the convection process offer some new insights on the controls on plankton biomass at certain crucial periods of the seasonal cycle for example the recent study of auger et al 2014 based on ltl modeling i e without top down control by htl showed that the higher the intensity of convection during winter the lower the stocks of mesozooplankton are mainly due to the dispersal of predators and prey with increasing mixing our study showed contrasting results when two ways coupling between ltl and htl models was performed the winter stocks of mesozooplankton were the lowest during the winters of 2001 and 2002 that are however the least convective winters of the simulation period these two sets of results are not fundamentally in opposition a less convective winter may involve more mesozooplankton and in turn higher predation by htl on this plankton group reducing its stock in fine while a more convective winter would induce higher stocks by lower predation by htl due to dispersal of their prey this scheme of functioning would consecutively result in winter mesozooplankton stocks that are higher during convective winters and lower during less convective winters this top down control on mesozooplankton winter biomass is confirmed by the maintenance of high levels of htl predation pressure fig 4 during the least convective winters e g 2001 2002 of the simulated period the maximum minimum respectively of htl predation pressure is delayed to autumn middle of spring respectively for microplankton as the winter convection decreases in intensity this may explain why their biomass is the lowest at the end of autumn in 2001 and 2002 but their winter spring dynamics are harder to decipher because in addition to the impact of winter convection and top down control by htl microplankton is also a usual prey for mesozooplankton then ecological process of trophic cascading has to be also considered as a further driver of seasonal dynamics for example if the positive impact of convection on the microphytoplankton stock is only considered the 2003 winter peak of microphytoplankton should be the highest one of the simulated period whereas the highest peak was modeled for winter 2001 strong top down controls by both htl throughout autumn 2002 fig 4 and mesozooplankton at the beginning of winter 2003 fig 1 may explain the difference in the peaks of microphytoplankton biomass between winter of 2001 and 2003 this example illustrates that the seasonal dynamics of plankton biomass especially from winter to spring may result from an intricate combination of top down controls and convection intensity bottom up in the study area in the same way this combination of drivers may also influence the duration of winter to spring peaks for microzooplankton it is interesting to analyze whether the interannual variability of the winter convection could have some impacts on the seasonal dynamics of the modeled htl groups through the spatio temporal dynamics of their prey especially the answer to this question can be found in the analysis of the who eats what and when table 1 northern krill tended to become a major predator of some plankton groups such as microphytoplankton and mesozooplankton during moderate to high convective winters 2003 and 2004 european pilchard was also a main consumer of the largest size classes of plankton but this size based predation pattern changed in relation with the convection intensity european pilchards of intermediate and large size were generally the first predators of microplankton in years with low to very low convective winters but consumed much less of these prey in years with more convective winters when the main predators were the intermediate size classes of northern krill and european anchovy european anchovies especially those of large size are one of the three main predators of micro and mesozooplankton when winter convection tends to be low to very low whereas they exert very low predation on these plankton groups when winters are more convective on the whole the size based predation pattern appeared to change towards smaller individuals eating smaller zooplankton and microphytoplankton when the intensity of convection increases this pattern is in line with recent observations showing that european pilchard and european anchovy were consuming smaller prey than in previous studies le bourg et al 2015 and is probably one of the main factors explaining the decrease in their body condition and the current small pelagic fisheries crisis brosset et al 2016 saraux et al 2018 most of the seasonal dynamics of htl landings and biomass showed a stronger interannual variability in the two ways coupling mode but this variability could not be clearly related to changes in the intensity of winter convection however modeled variations in the seasonality of ltl groups influenced by winter convection may disrupt the process of predator prey match cushing 1996 that may impact the recruitment and biomass of the htl groups while the seasonal dynamics of ltl groups have been shown to be partly shaped by the intensity of winter convection there were no clear relationships with the interannual variability of htl groups along the simulated time sequence it is suggested here that the length of the simulation period was probably too short to detect a bottom up control of the htl dynamics by the hydrodynamics of the region palomera et al 2007 have shown a positive correlation between european pilchard and european anchovy biomass and the intensity of winter mixing in the catalan sea nw mediterranean sea from a 15 y time series another field study suggested a year and a half time lag between sardine catches and wind mixing in this area lloret et al 2004 the detectability of the response of small pelagic fishes to bottom up controls might also depend on the recurrence of winters with similar convective intensities as the small pelagic population dynamics emerge from those of several cohorts and age classes a succession of at least two or three low or high convective winters might be required to observe a clear response of the small pelagic community this hypothesis should be tested in future works with the present model but also putting more focus on the recruitment level each year a recent study by brosset et al 2017 found that global environmental indices such as nao mediterranean indices could not explain the observed changes in fish landings and the general decline in the condition of small pelagic fish populations in the mediterranean sea according to this study the observed changes might be rather due to a combination of more local environmental processes and or combined with anthropogenic factors such as fishing or pollution 4 3 spatial structuration of ltl and htl communities and associated trophic effects in relation with mesoscale hydrodynamics the present study enabled investigation of the effects of mesoscale hydrodynamics and htl predation on the distributions of plankton groups and nutrients in the gol and indirectly understanding of the spatial structuration of some htl groups of interest such as small pelagic planktivorous fishes i e european pilchard european anchovy and european sprat saraux et al 2014 highlighted a strong overlap of the latter three species distribution presence absence within the gol but they also showed a differential density of biomass at local scale due to either potential interspecific avoidance or different sensitivities to local environmental characteristics moreover le bourg et al 2015 and brosset et al 2016 showed overlaps in the diet and stable isotope ratios of these three planktivorous species in the gol probably related to their spatial distribution and prey availability in parallel some recent studies based on either coupled biogeochemical hydrodynamics modelling e g campbell et al 2013 or field observations marrec et al 2018 revealed an intricate spatial structuration of the plankton community in connection with the presence of mesoscale to sub mesoscale eddies physical processes down to sub mesoscale can temporarily favor the access to nutrients and light by local alterations of the density gradient involving changes in the ecological niches of plankton species down to minute spatial scale cotti rausch et al 2016 overall the model results showed that mesoscale eddies were areas of the strongest gradients in plankton concentrations and of the more significant gains or losses of plankton biomass when the two ways coupling is considered in such a configuration of coupling these gradients could be caused by a combination of processes acting together and whose it is rather difficult to decipher their respective roles as aforementioned hydrodynamic processes associated to the eddy could act on spatial distributions either mechanically by increasing dispersal or aggregation of plankton through advection and diffusion or and by locally modifying environmental conditions favoring furtive bloom or at the opposite accelerating senescence of plankton community secondly aggregation of plankton in the vicinity of eddies could have also attracted planktivorous pelagic fish and krill hence enhancing htl predation around eddies this predation would then have been able to furthermore shape spatial gradients by a differential consumption of plankton groups according to the size structure of htl organisms attracted and finally this differential predation could in turn reshape the plankton community in term of abundances or and size structure by provoking cascading trophic processes within the community itself on the one hand the edges of ae detected in the southwestern and central parts of the gol showed the most important impacts of two ways coupling whatever the plankton group considered this result is in coherence with the uplift of nutrients and the subsequent increase in primary productivity on the edges of anticyclonic eddies campbell et al 2013 review of mcgillicuddy 2016 on the other hand the two ways coupling only involved minor changes in the plankton distributions around cyclonic eddies in the gol this result could be explained by the shorter lifetimes of cyclonic structures generally observed in this area flexas et al 2002 hu 2011 the short life span of these eddies might not enable to reach a significant local increase in plankton biomass to attract htl in particular even though in osmose fish do not track food gradients but local fish movements follow a random walk equivalent to the diffusion term in a population advection diffusion model and their mean spatial distributions are driven by observed data their opportunistic feeding behavior may increase predation in cells with higher prey density however the structuring role of cyclonic eddies on spatial gradients may also depend on their locations in the gol the case of ce1 was particularly intriguing due to its location near the rhone mouth figs 5c 6 c 7 c 8 c there is a close interaction between the rhone plume enriched in microplankton and the northeastern edge of ce1 that shapes by transport the distributions of plankton biomass and in turn probably htl predation in this area of the gol the process of biomass aggregation resulting from the presence of an eddy potentially involved strong pressure of htl predation on microplankton groups data set showed that there could be an attractor effect of plankton spatial distribution with higher biomass in the rhone river plume for juveniles of different fish species morfin et al 2012 saraux et al 2014 our study shows that mesoscale structures and rhone river inputs may thus play an important role in fish recruitment in the gol and may be related to recent changes observed in small pelagic fish stocks this seems to corroborate the hypothesis of a bottom up control of their stocks le bourg et al 2015 saraux et al 2018 when examining the surface distributions of phosphate contents the differences in concentrations involved by the two ways coupling are in the order of the nanomolar up to 10 nm near the rhone mouth this order of magnitude is within the range of concentrations measured in the gol diaz et al 2008 phosphate exerts a control on primary productivity during part of the year in this area diaz et al 2001 and probably shapes the structure of the picoplankton community moutin et al 2002 in this study the two ways coupling may impact phosphate distributions indirectly through the htl activity of plankton predators or grazers but their metabolism also releases inorganic nutrients and organic matter in the environment libralato and solidoro 2009 and may in turn influence more directly the spatial distributions of nutrients the roles of htl activity on nutrient fields is hence accounted for a minima in the present work this type of processes within the htl community should be taken into account in e2e modelling developments as despite the low numbers of eddies our results highlighted the intricate interactions between mesoscale hydrodynamics and the structuration of nutrients ltl and htl communities 4 4 effects of two ways coupling on food web functioning and controls even if a small portion of the ltl stocks is consumed by htl species our results showed that this may however induce large seasonal and interannual variations for most of the model groups the changes of biomass by trophic level fig 9 induced by the two ways coupling could be interpreted in the light of two alternative hypotheses i the hypothesis of a dominant bottom up effect with a decreasing microphytoplankton biomass due to increased convection and reduced stratification see section 4 1 this may induce a decrease in the biomass of microzooplankton and in turn that of some planktivorous species such as northern krill and european pilchard this would partially release predation on mesozooplankton that increased in biomass while competitors of the european pilchard such as european anchovy and european sprat had also slightly increased in biomass mesozooplankton increase may have favoured the recruitment of higher predator species 4th trophic level which are also planktivorous at juvenile stages and globally increased their biomass ii the combined bottom up and top down effect hypothesis the large increase in the high predator species biomass by 38 may finally induce a top down feedback on planktivorous species this second hypothesis seems more plausible whether if only bottom up processes were controlling the food web functioning we could expect a decrease in the biomass of top predators and not an increase adults of atlantic horse mackerel atlantic mackerel blue whiting and southern shortfin squid may contribute by predation to the decreasing biomass of some planktivorous species the atlantic bluefin tuna may also be a potential predator for these forage species even if van beveren et al 2017 indicated that recent changes in mediterranean small pelagic teleosts are probably not due to increased tuna predation our results in accordance with coll et al 2018 showed that the hypothesis of top down control by other predators should not be neglected planktivorous species are probably concomitantly impacted by top down predation and bottom up effects decreasing plankton prey size and quantity synergic effects of climate and fishing have been shown in the southern benguela travers trolet et al 2014 but to our knowledge this is the first study using and end to end model that analyses the temporal and spatial effects of model coupling on both ltl and htl groups and on food web controls 5 conclusion the impacts of climate variability and fishing on food web complex interactions can be explored comprehensively with e2e models such as osmose gol in the gol wind regimes and hydrodynamics processes have a crucial role in the variability of ltl spatial distributions seasonal and interannual cycles according to our model results this variability at different scales in time and space may impact htl groups recruitment biomass and landings the hypothesis of a bottom up control could not explain alone the decline in biomass and size of small pelagic fish found in our model results and that look strikingly similar to recent concerns about fish and fisheries status in the gol our model results suggest that top down control by top predators and feedbacks on plankton dynamics should not be neglected the use of a fully dynamic two ways coupling between the models of ltl and htl organisms revealed interesting results on the whole even though small proportions of plankton global stocks were preyed upon by htl species some important consequences for the infra seasonal and annual cycles of both htl and plankton groups could be observed in the two ways coupling mode involving significant changes in biomass landings and food web interactions by cascading effects spatial effects especially the impacts of htl predation on the plankton fields were less clear except in areas in which primary productivity was high e g rofi or in the vicinity of mesoscale hydrodynamics structures e g eddies however these results remain preliminary as the only considered interaction between the ltl and htl models is made through predation while the vertical integration sensu shin et al 2010 between the two models could be made through other processes such as natural mortality and egestion by htl producing detritus and ensuing remineralization by heterotrophic plankton or such as excretion of dissolved inorganic organic nutrients in turn made available for the whole plankton community predation on htl larvae by carnivorous zooplankton especially by gelatinous organisms not included in this model may also have to be taken into account horizontal biodiversity integration sensu shin et al 2010 could also be improved to represent other major functional groups in the gol ecosystem such as benthic organisms or invasive species ecosystem based fisheries management and biodiversity conservation need to rely on the development of more holistic modelling approaches of the ecosystem to account for complex species multidimensional dynamics spatial temporal multispecies and their interactions this goes in pair with improvements in data acquisitions high frequency automated observations in the field on a variety of components and processes from the physical environment to the biogeochemistry up to the biomass and life histories of higher trophic level species this would help increasing the degree of realism and confidence in the parameterization of models and reduce uncertainty in their projections

assess these impacts rely on equation based models where physical and biological responses are specified with mathematical expressions and or probabilistic descriptions and interactions jorgensen 1996 such numerical models have been instrumental in the advancement of our knowledge of coastal systems however the expression of emergent behaviors predicated on nonlinear feedbacks can be problematic in the implementation of equation based models specific to the nexus of eco hydrological models sivapalan 2018 noted difficulties in accurately quantifying the spatial heterogeneity needed to inform equation based models thereby complicating the expression of closure relations at scales of interest further he suggested instead of specifying exact details of the heterogeneity in our models we can

co evolutionary interactions in lieu of a physical reductionist approach one such alternative is agent based modeling where behaviors and feedbacks at the core of the model naturally accommodate nonlinearity and emergence grimm and railsback 2005 here we assess coastal ecotone dynamics with an agent based model relying on vegetative transformations in response to sea level driven porewater salinity as a marker for groundwater changes from fresh to saline quantification of these changes both the landscape transformation from freshwater dominated marshes to saltwater dominated estuaries and the associated changes in freshwater resources are fundamental to the future of inhabited and natural coastal ecosystems as an exemplar we consider the southern tip of the florida peninsula which is home to both a large metropolitan area and the everglades fig 1 the relationship is symbiotic as the everglades protects and sustains freshwater resources for the natural and urban communities while concerned citizens and governments are dedicated to preservation and protection of its natural resources not only are the everglades home to spacious freshwater marshes and hardwood hammocks it includes the largest contiguous fresh to saltwater mangrove ecosystem in north america such coastal freshwater mangrove marsh ecosystems are a prominent feature around the globe with importance as atmospheric carbon sinks proliferent marine nurseries and bellwethers of coastal transformation 2 materials and methods 2 1 analysis domain and data we estimate the change in vegetation coverage and aquifer freshwater volume under a 14 382 hectare domain spanning a mangrove freshwater ecotone from 2015 through 2100 in response to a low and high sea level rise trajectory fig 2 shows the model domain with a false color overlay of vegetation in 2015 along the southern peninsula data inputs consist of landscape vegetation coverage obtained from a synthesis of field observations and aerial photography ruiz et al 2017 marsh water levels from the everglades depth estimation network eden telis et al 2015 land surface elevations fennema et al 2015 and sea level rise trajectories park et al 2017a a general description of the modelling framework is provided in the following sections with a detailed description following the odd overview design concepts and details protocol grimm et al 2010 in appendix a 2 2 model framework agent based modeling can be viewed as an evolution of cellular automata schiff 2011 finding good success in the analysis of ecosystem complexity and interactions grimm and railsback 2005 agent based models consist of dynamically interacting agents operating in a decentralized interconnected paradigm accommodating complexity and emergence netlogo is a programmable modeling environment designed to simulate complex phenomena in an agent based framework wilensky 1999 and is the modeling platform we employ netlogo distinguishes four types of agents patches turtles links and observers patches represent the world in a grid of cells turtles represent agents that operate in the world interacting with patches and each other links provide connections between agents observers allow interaction between agents within and external to the model domain our model defines agents for the dominant vegetation species turtles agents for the landscape cells patches and interactions between agents and the environment netlogo programs conventionally contain setup and go procedures the latter being executed in a loop sequencing through agents our setup procedure loads the timeseries input data loads gis shapefiles representing the vegetation map and timeseries mappings initializes patches with data from the gis layers and sprouts turtles on the patches according to the gis vegetation map species for each cell the go procedure iteratively calls the vegetation agents to assess their vitality followed by the propagation procedure governing species succession in response to environmental feedbacks 2 2 1 vitality behaviors a typical vegetation agent assesses whether the vegetation on a particular patch has been stressed enough to die for example cladium jamaicense sawgrass contains assessments of water depth and porewater salinity thresholds and durations agent vitality behaviors are detailed in appendix a 4 3 2 2 2 succession behaviors the propagation procedure queries each patch devoid of live vegetation assessing surrounding patches to identify neighboring species if environmental conditions are conducive for a neighboring species the species can establish on the vacant patch according to a fitness function shown in fig 3 note that the fitness function is only used to determine vegetation succession not vitality first a list of vegetation species on the surrounding 8 patches is obtained a cumulative fitness score is computed for each species by summing the individual fitness scores on a per species basis the species with highest cumulative fitness is selected for propagation however whether propagation actually occurs is determined by comparison of the species propagation success threshold i e mangrove success a user defined parameter against a randomly selected percentile of a uniform distribution if succession fails on a particular timestep there is no penalty on following timesteps the propagation is run as usual succession behavior rules are detailed in appendix a 4 3 with water depth and hydroperiod thresholds shown in table a 4 and succession probabilities listed in table a 5 threshold and model parameters values are listed in table b 1 of appendix b 2 2 3 porewater salinity the primary ecotone driver from freshwater to salt tolerant plants is root zone porewater salinity in the model this is driven by the relative elevation of mean sea level and freshwater depth on the vegetation patch since there is a coastal ridge along the northern shore of florida bay serving to buffer ocean and estuarine water from the interior and since freshwater in the marsh suppresses subterranean saline water in the root zone as expressed by the ghyben herzburg principle there are two model parameters to calibrate these effects msl offset and depth no porewater see table b 1 and fig b 1 all patches are initialized to porewater salinity of zero and have a maximum porewater salinity of 3 this is sufficient since the maximal glycophytic vegetation tolerance is 2 ppt table b 1 patch porewater salinity is then determined by progressive accumulation of porewater salinity for patches with elevation below mean sea level and no standing freshwater procedurally all patches with an elevation below mean sea level minus the msl offset parameter are selected if these patches have a fresh water depth less than depth no porewater then their porewater salinity is incremented by 1 ppt if the fresh water depth is greater than depth no porewater the porewater salinity is reset to zero 2 3 vegetation map as a component of the comprehensive everglades restoration plan cerp the department of interior conducts an extensive vegetation mapping project the vegetation assessment assigns a landscape characterization code the vegetation code to 50 m 50 m patches throughout a region vegetation codes derive from a tree of descriptors starting with one of seven overall landscape types for example shrubland s with additional code elements providing increasing levels of landscape and ecosystem specificity as in red mangrove dominant shrubland smr since our model is driven by species behaviors we assign the dominant species for each landscape code to each of the 50 50 m patches for example even though a red mangrove dominant shrubland smr may contain other species the model considers such a patch to be uniformly populated with red mangrove fig 2 shows the southern coastal region vegetation map in everglades national park with false color overlay ruiz et al 2017 2 4 hydrological data hydrologic data are informed through the netlogo time extension with daily mean water levels provided as timeseries input to patch agents the link between timeseries and patches is specified in a gis layer corresponding to the grid shown in fig 2 each model grid cell correspond to 3 3 grid blocks from the everglades depth estimation network eden telis et al 2015 with the daily water level extracted from the center eden cell of the 3 3 block eden observed data are available from 1990 through 2017 since the calibration model period of record is 1973 through 2015 and the projection model period of record 2015 through 2100 data extrapolation is needed to model data from 1973 through 1990 we take advantage of strong correlations between marsh water levels across the model domain r 2 0 89 0 09 and estimate missing data with linear regressions from each cell to a long term hydrologic station p 37 in the central everglades containing data back to 1973 projection model data also leverage strong temporospatial correlations to create future projections of stage first we compute a single timeseries of daily mean water level across all cells over the observational record 1990 2017 to create a reference timeseries second we compute empirical cumulative distribution functions for each day of the year year day 1 365 over all years of the reference timeseries third we compute linear regressions between the timeseries of each grid cell 1990 2017 and the reference r 2 0 95 0 05 these correlation coefficients will be used to model grid cell water levels from a future projection of the reference timeseries next the reference timeseries is projected forward in time by sampling from the empirical distribution at the corresponding projected year day with a gaussian kernel specifically for a projected year day say the first day of the year the projected value is sampled from the empirical distribution for the first day of the year at a random percentile selected from a normal distribution to produce a projected reference timeseries 2015 2100 to generate projected timeseries at each cell the correlation coefficients identified from each cell to the observed reference 1990 2017 are applied to the projected reference this is tenable since the timeseries are dominated by the yearly hydrologic cycle and the flat topography results in high correlations between model cell hydrologic response as noted above these projections are purely probabilistic and do not account for climate change or nonstationarity 2 5 sea level rise data sea level rise trajectories applied to the future projection model are obtained from park et al 2017a corresponding to low 50th percentile and high 99th percentile estimates from 2015 through 2100 these estimates are specific to south florida and based on a synthesis of tide gauge data global climate models and expert elicitation contributions from the greenland ice sheet west antarctic ice sheet east antarctic ice sheet glaciers thermal expansion regional ocean dynamics land water storage and long term local non climatic factors such as glacial isostatic adjustment sediment compaction and tectonics as noted in park et al 2017a these projections are comprehensive but do not include components related to a rapid collapse of greenland and antarctic ice sheets recent observations suggest that such a collapse is underway holland et al 2015 wouters et al 2015 thereby we select the median projection as the low and the 99th percentile as the high the sea level rise projections and projected marsh water levels are shown in fig 4 2 6 calibration model calibration of agent thresholds and behaviors is achieved by initializing a model spanning the current mangrove sawgrass ecotone with vegetation coverage observed in 1973 rintz and loope 1978 which at the time was a purely freshwater landscape as shown in fig 5 a the model domain is a grid of 22 990 patches 209 110 covering a spatial domain of 10 450 5500 m however only 17 680 patches are used according to the extent of the 1973 vegetation map the model is a four species model with three freshwater species accounting for 98 8 of the initial vegetation sawgrass 92 0 spikerush 4 3 wax myrtle 2 5 and red mangrove as the saline successor other species comprising 1 2 of the initial vegetation are not processed the model is run forward in time from 1973 to 2015 with parameters adjusted to best fit the observed 2015 landscape vegetation fig 5b fit is defined as the percentage of model patches that correspond to the 2015 observed vegetation at the end of the model run an example applied to two model parameters is shown in fig b 1 of appendix b sea level rise is modeled as a linear function increasing at 3 cm decade corresponding to the mean of observed linear trends at vaca key 3 69 mm yr and key west 2 42 mm yr model output is shown in fig 5c model parameters are listed in appendix b model code and data are available at https github com softwareliteracyfoundation ecotone 2 7 projection model the projection model is a spatial expansion of the calibration model with vegetation initialized from the 2015 vegetation map where available and with timeseries of marsh stage and sea levels projected from 2015 to 2100 the spatial domain is expanded by 8 6 km to the north and initialized with sawgrass since there is not a vegetation map in this region the resultant model domain covers 14 382 hectare in a grid of 57 528 patches 204 282 10 2 km wide by 14 1 km tall along the fresh to saline ecotone near taylor slough everglades national park fig 2 the model uses parameters determined by the calibration model table b 1 with the addition of one parameter msl open depth and three vegetation species cypress swamp bay and buttonwood the msl open depth defines a patch depth that when exceeded by mean sea level converts the patch from terrestrial to marine estuarine it is set to 70 cm corresponding to maximal freshwater depths the three additional species account for 3 5 of the initial species coverage and not considered for propagation they are assessed for vitality and can die in response to either msl exceeding the patch elevation plus msl open depth or to salinity exposure in the case of cypress and swamp bay their salinity thresholds are set to a maximum salinity of 1 ppt sustained over a period of 30 days model code and data are available at https github com softwareliteracyfoundation ecotone 3 results predicted landscape transformations under low and high sea level rise trajectories are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively under the low sea level rise projection the landscape is relatively unchanged through 2050 with the emergence of a mangrove stand in the south central model domain by 2060 the mangrove stand has expanded and by 2070 it has nearly engulfed the slightly elevated ridge running from the south central of the domain to the northeast landscape elevations are shown in appendix a 6 1 by 2080 the majority of the landscape seaward of the porewater salinity interface has transformed to mangroves with the emergence of an open water area in the southwest corner of the domain in response to the high sea level rise trajectory significant change is not forecast through 2040 with the emergence of the south central mangrove stand by 2050 the ensuing decade is forecast to support the rapid colonization of mangroves along the slightly elevated ridge by 2070 there has been substantial transformation with open water accounting for a major portion of the domain and a new coastline of mangrove swamp by 2080 the transformation from predominantly freshwater marsh to marine conditions and mangrove swamp is nearly complete quantification of the areal change in landscape dominant species vegetation cover in response to the two sea level rise forcings is shown in fig 8 under both scenarios the contemporary vegetation distributions remain in equilibrium until 2050 beyond which there is evidence of landscape transformation from freshwater marsh to mangrove marsh and open water the physical mechanism behind freshwater to saline tolerant vegetation transformation is infiltration of root zone porewater salinity it is also known that as saline water from rising ocean levels infiltrate landward in the surficial aquifer it does so from the bottom up since saline water is denser than the freshwater dausman and langevin 2005 from this we assume that at a point on the landscape where freshwater vegetation has been displaced that the saline water extends to the base of the surficial aquifer given estimates of the surficial aquifer thickness which here range from approximately 8 to 12 m fish and stewart 1991 and which are spatially mapped in the model gis coverage one can make conservative estimates of the freshwater volume replaced by saline water by using the vegetation coverage as an ecosystem response function fig 9 plots estimates of surficial aquifer volumes under the model domain of fresh and saline water in response to the two sea level rise trajectories assuming a porewater volume fraction of 0 2 dausman and langevin 2005 note that this does not require detailed estimates of aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity and that it is not required to estimate landcape vegetation changes model results indicate a transformation from current ecological equilibrium to saltwater dominated starting at 2050 dynamics of this transition from the freshwater biome perspective are presented in fig 10 where deviation of spatially averaged projected freshwater levels on land are compared with coverage of the dominant freshwater species from 2050 through 2070 here we find dynamic responses at two timescales the long term decline driven by increasing porewater salinity as ocean levels rise superimposed with shorter term yearly or interannual variations exhibiting species proliferation and recovery with punctuated events of rapid species decline the rapid declines appear well correlated with low freshwater elevation events consistent with observations that drought and dry conditions are a fundamental stressor of freshwater marsh plants while recovery is indicated during periods without deep water level recession 2054 2058 4 discussion following the suggestion of sivapalan 2018 that complex eco hydrologic domains can be assessed through ecosystem function expressed on the landscape and the recognition of jiang et al 2016 that linear correlation based models may not be ideal for capturing ecotone dynamics we find that an agent based model provides reasonable and compelling estimates for landscape and freshwater resource transformation of coastal marshes in response to sea level rise the agent based approach relies on specification of interactions between the environment and species competing on the landscape rather than highly detailed mappings and assumptions of subterranean aquifer geology and environmental forcings such as rainfall and evapotranspiration if we were not interested in quantifying the aquifer resource transformation but simply inferring it s areal coverage from the vegetative landscape response we would not need geologic properties at all the model exhibits interspecies competition between fresh and saline tolerant plants primarily sawgrass cladium jamaicense and red mangrove rhizophora mangle mediated by root zone porewater salinity determined by elevations of rain supplied marsh water level land surface and sea level consistent with known landscape response elevated porewater salinity denatures freshwater plants during periods of low marsh water level open patches are then colonized with fresh or salt tolerant plants depending on environmentally determined fitness functions of surrounding species model results predict continued equilibrium between fresh and saltwater species until 2050 after which there is eventual replacement of freshwater species with salt tolerant ones and fresh groundwater with saline groundwater ultimately transitioning into new marine habitat interestingly initiation of the transformation is essentially independent of whether sea levels rise along a low or high trajectory however the ensuing transformations are quite different as a function of sea level dynamics this likely reflects a difference between the low and high sea level rise trajectories of 13 cm between 2020 and 2050 but 70 cm between 2050 and 2100 under a low sea level rise trajectory the model domain transitions from freshwater resource volume of 28 6 million cubic meters in 2015 to 8 7 million cubic meters in 2100 while under a high trajectory the volume decreases to 0 by 2085 the model also predicts that mangrove establishment at the 2050 threshold is facilitated along a slightly elevated ridge that runs northeast from the lower central model domain this elevation difference is no more than 14 cm above the surrounding marsh the anticipated landscape and aquifer transformation horizons of 2050 2070 are consistent with a purely empirical independent mechanism and analysis by park et al 2017b assessing transformations in water level exceedances along the coastal ridge in florida bay 8 5 km directly south and seaward of the current mangrove freshwater ecotone there the transformation horizon of 2040 2070 is forecast for the coastal ridge to be continually inundated in response to the same sea level rise trajectories as sea level rises florida bay will expand into the everglades and south florida establishing new estuarine and marine habitats replacing fresh groundwater along the coastal ecotone the model predicts that avoidance of extreme low water events and generally higher marsh stage are keys to prolonging viability of freshwater resources goals expressed in the comprehensive everglades restoration plan national academies of sciences 2018 further as shown in the upper right of fig 2 and lower right of fig 1 the south dade agricultural areas are less than 10 km from the model domain this industry employs more than 20 000 people producing more than 2 7 billion in annual economic impact miami dade county agriculture 2019 and is predicated on the surficial aquifer as a source of freshwater additionally the florida keys aquaduct authority extracts potable water for over 70 000 residents from a well field located less than 5 km from the southern boundary of the agricultural area providing significant concern for saline intrusion mcthenia et al 2017 our results suggest that near the end of the century these areas can start experiencing freshwater resource reduction finally we note that the model is based on species specific behaviors in response to root zone porewater salinity with freshwater graminoids and red mangroves the dominant cross ecotone species similar coastal ecotones are found around the globe and can be assessed for water resource transformations using these methods appendix a model overview design concepts and details odd a 1 purpose the models dynamically quantify areal transformation of freshwater marsh into saline estuary in response to dynamic interactions between freshwater depth and root zone porewater salinity driven by sea level landscape vegetation changes are used as indicators of surficial groundwater salinization allowing estimates of changes fresh to saline water volumes in the surficial aquifer a 2 entities state variables and scales a 2 1 agents model agents consist of plant species netlogo turtles and landscape grid cells netlogo patches plant species agents are listed in table a 1 with initial coverage percentages listed in tables a 8 and a 9 the open water agent is an end point transformation for the other species state variables of the plant and grid cell agents are listed in tables a 2 and a 3 respectively a 2 2 spatial units landscape grid cells correspond to the 50 m 50 m spatial discretisation of the vegetation map developed by ruiz et al 2017 the calibration model domain is a grid of 22 990 patches 209 110 covering a spatial domain of 10 4 5 5 km the projection model covers 14 382 ha in a grid of 57 528 patches 204 282 10 2 km wide by 14 1 km tall a 2 3 environment the model environment consists of three primary variables land surface elevation water depth in relation to land surface and sea level elevation land surface elevation is assigned to each model grid cell from a gis layer based on the work of fennema et al 2015 as described in appendix a 6 daily water elevations are obtained from the everglades depth estimation network eden telis et al 2015 and mapped to landscape cells through a gis layer and the cell stage gauge variable the gis layer specified in appendix a 6 assigns to each cell the name of an eden cell from which the water level timeseries are applied a csv file of the eden timeseries data is dynamically accessed to retrieve the corresponding water elevation at each timestep sea level elevations are obtained from timeseries of projected sea levels in florida bay by park et al 2017b a 3 process overview and scheduling model timesteps are discretely updated with a user adjustable variable days per tick with a default value of 15 days since input data are available in daily increments the model timestep can be any period of days the appropriate data is selected according to the specific date of a model timestep the go function schedules agent and data process execution at each timestep as shown here

design concepts a 4 1 basic principles the models assume a fundamental driver of ecotone dynamics between freshwater marsh and saline estuary is root zone porewater salinity and that this salinity is mediated by dynamic balance between sea level elevation landscape cell elevation and freshwater that may be present on the cell species specific tolerances to root zone salinity hydroperiod and depth dictate plant vitality and death while porewater salinity determines species specific fitness for succession a 4 2 emergence the model is fundamentally one of interspecies competition driven by root zone salinity primal complexities arise from the nonlinear nature of landscape freshwater depth and randomness of plant death and succession therefore we do not expect behavioral emergence from interagent interactions a 4 3 adaptation vegetation agents do not internally adapt or change behaviors but they do respond to environmental changes these behaviors are governed by salinity thresholds prescribed by the logistic functions shown in fig 3 water depth and hydroperiod thresholds shown in table a 4 and succession probabilities listed in table a 5 for example based on observational data as expressed in fig 3 sawgrass can tolerate salinities near 1 ppt while for spikerush 2 ppt can be tolerated the depth parameter relates a water depth on the patch beyond which the plant is unable to transpire or its cellular structure is compromised days wet represents the continuous hydroperiod that the plant can tolerate resulting in decomposition of roots transpiration limits or cellular compromise days dry represents the tolerable period of time with no available water in the root zone resulting in desiccation threshold and model parameters values are listed in table b 1 of appendix b as noted in section 2 2 2 when empty cells are evaluated for species succession the surrounding species with the highest cumulative fitness is selected for propagation however whether propagation actually occurs is determined by comparison of the species propagation success threshold as listed in table a 5 to a uniform random variate a 4 4 objectives as noted in the preceding section agents do not engage in internal behavior or objective fitness adaptation however their objectives are responsive to the environment as detailed in the preceding section a 4 5 learning as noted in the preceding section agents do not alter or dynamically change their adaptive traits rather they respond to the environment a 4 6 prediction agents do not project or anticipate future states a 4 7 sensing environmental state variables that individuals are assumed to sense and consider in their decisions are listed in table a 6 a 4 8 interaction interactions exist between the landscape cell netlogo patch and the vegetation agent netlogo turtle on the cell the cell maintains information regarding water depth hydroperiod and porewater salinity vegetation agents process this state information to determine vitality and fitness there are no interagent interactions between vegetation agents the only feedback in the model acts within landscape cells to determine porewater salinity porewater salinity is forced by the elevation of mean sea level in relation to the elevation of the cell land surface but can be mediated by the presence of adequate freshwater depth on the cell as described appendix a 7 1 a 4 9 stochasticity evaluation of environmental variables days wet and days dry in plant vitality behaviors are randomly modulated with a gaussian kernel to simulate individual plant tolerances specifically when a patch hydroperiod is processed the physically simulated value is shifted by the number of days according to a normal distribution specified in table a 7 vegetation succession behaviors are also probabilistically influenced as described in section 2 2 2 and appendix a 4 3 a 4 10 collectives the models use agent collectives netlogo agentsets internally to avoid redundant operations for example collectives of cells with specific species or which have transformed to open water there are no collective behaviors associated with these collectives a 4 11 observation the number of patches of sawgrass and red mangrove are the primary observational variables of the models a 5 initialization each cell in the model is initialized with a vegetation species specified from a vegetation map the calibration model uses the 1973 vegetation map of rintz and loope 1978 while the prediction model uses the 2015 map of ruiz et al 2017 timeseries data of water depth and mean sea level elevation are initialized according to the user specified start date variable appendix a 6 details the input and initialization data initial species compositions for the calibration and projection models are shown in tables a 8 and a 9 respectively a 6 input data table a 10 lists the input files and associated variable names used in the models all timeseries data have daily resolution and extend over the model period of record with no repeated data sea level rise and marsh water level extrema are shown in fig 4 cell elevations are shown in fig a 1 a 6 1 elevation data the interplay between freshwater depths mean sea level and porewater salinity are largely determined by landscape elevation fig a 1 shows the model domain elevation indicating a southwest to northeast channel known locally as taylor slough there is also a small ridge south of taylor slough running southwest to northeast model simulations suggest that this ridge will provide an initial stand for red mangroves as sea levels rise a 6 2 aquifer geological data aquifer thickness is inferred from united states geological service wells and geologic cross sections shown in fig a 2 a 7 submodels model processes specified appendix a 3 are detailed here a 7 1 update patch depth salinity the procedure update patch depth salinity executes these steps at each timestep 1 set depth on all

ecotone 5 identify msl patches cells with freshwater depth less than depth no porewater into porewater patches 6 increment porewater salinity of porewater patches 7 identify msl patches with freshwater depth greater than depth no porewater into no porewater patches 8 reset porewater salinity to zero for no porewater patches 9 for msl patches a update cell salinity b accumulate number of days above salinity threshold into salinity days a 7 2 plant vitalities each plant species agent is assessed for vitality based on the current and accumulated environmental conditions in the go

needed apply gaussian offsets to hydroperiod variables to emulate individual plant tolerances as described appendix a 4 9 3 determine if the plants die by applying the environmental conditions and species thresholds described appendix a 4 3 4 if plant has died record the model time and reason for death 5 if plant has died remove the cell from the species cell collection a 7 3 succession the go propagation procedure processes patches with no living plants for succession 1 identify species on surrounding 8 cells into neighbor species 2 accumulate the porewater salinity mediated fitness score fig 3 for each species in neighbor species 3 if there is a tie in fitness randomly 50 uniform deviate select one of the species and reduce its fitness by 0 1 4 identify the species with maximum cumulative fitness 5 apply the species specific propagation threshold against a uniform random variate to decide if the selected species will actually propagate as described in section 2 2 2 6 if a species establishes on the cell set the species specific environmental tolerances into the cell agent variables appendix b calibration model calibration model parameters are shown in table b 1 fig b 1 plots model calibration fit in response to msl offset and depth no porewater finding optimal values of 2 cm for both parameters fit is defined as the percentage of model patches that correspond to the

25042,mangrove marshes are a significant global ecosystem finely tuned to contemporary sea level as sea level rises the mangrove to freshwater ecotone reflects underlying groundwater salinity indicating the transformation of freshwater resources into saltwater unsuitable for consumption or agriculture hydrological numerical models can predict this dynamic given sufficient environmental detail however detailed data is often lacking alternatively agent based models can predict landscape vegetation changes and the associated fresh to saline water transformation based only on landscape surface features we apply such a model to the southern tip of the florida peninsula at the nexus of a metropolis and world heritage wildlife preserve the florida everglades to predict ecotone dynamics and aquifer water resources in response to warming climate and rising sea level the model is based on species specific behaviors for freshwater grasses and salt tolerant red mangroves with relevance to global mangrove ecosystems keywords freshwater resource mangrove ecotone sea level rise 1 introduction as climate warms and sea level rises low lying coastal ecosystems are among the first to transform with potential for large shifts in ecotones and associated ecosystem services such as sustenance of freshwater resources these coastal ecotone dynamics reflect landscape changes from the adaptation of terrestrial estuarine and marine ecosystems in response to perpetual and nonstationary environmental dynamics and are expressed through a web of complex interactions and feedbacks between biota and environment given the inherent nonlinearity and interdependence in these dynamics one would expect that linear systems analysis may provide unsatisfying results deangelis and yurek 2015 as noted by jiang et al 2016 while habitat transitions can be abrupt modeling the specific drivers of abrupt change between halophytic and glycophytic vegetation is not a simple task correlative studies which dominate the literature are unlikely to establish ultimate causation for habitat shifts and do not generate strong predictive capacity for coastal land managers traditional methods to

photography ruiz et al 2017 marsh water levels from the everglades depth estimation network eden telis et al 2015 land surface elevations fennema et al 2015 and sea level rise trajectories park et al 2017a a general description of the modelling framework is provided in the following sections with a detailed description following the odd overview design concepts and details protocol grimm et al 2010 in appendix a 2 2 model framework agent based modeling can be viewed as an evolution of cellular automata schiff 2011 finding good success in the analysis of ecosystem complexity and interactions grimm and railsback 2005 agent based models consist of dynamically interacting agents operating in a decentralized interconnected paradigm accommodating complexity and emergence netlogo is a programmable modeling environment designed to simulate complex phenomena in an agent based framework wilensky 1999 and is the modeling platform we employ netlogo distinguishes four types of agents patches turtles links and observers patches represent the world in a grid of cells turtles represent agents that operate in the world interacting with patches and each other links provide connections between agents observers allow interaction between agents within and external to the model domain our model defines agents for the dominant vegetation species turtles agents for the landscape cells patches and interactions between agents and the environment netlogo programs conventionally contain setup and go procedures the latter being executed in a loop sequencing through agents our setup procedure loads the timeseries input data loads gis shapefiles representing the vegetation map and timeseries mappings initializes patches with data from the gis layers and sprouts turtles on the patches according to the gis vegetation map species for each cell the go procedure iteratively calls the vegetation agents to assess their vitality followed by the propagation procedure governing species succession in response to environmental feedbacks 2 2 1 vitality behaviors a typical vegetation agent assesses whether the vegetation on a particular patch has been stressed enough to die for example cladium jamaicense sawgrass contains assessments of water depth and porewater salinity thresholds and durations agent vitality behaviors are detailed in appendix a 4 3 2 2 2 succession behaviors the propagation procedure queries each patch devoid of live vegetation assessing surrounding patches to identify neighboring species if environmental conditions are conducive for a neighboring species the species can establish on the vacant patch according to a fitness function shown in fig 3 note that the fitness function is only used to determine vegetation succession not vitality first a list of vegetation species on the surrounding 8 patches is obtained a cumulative fitness score is computed for each species by summing the individual fitness scores on a per species basis the species with highest cumulative fitness is selected for propagation however whether propagation actually occurs is determined by comparison of the species propagation success threshold i e mangrove success a user defined parameter against a randomly selected percentile of a uniform distribution if succession fails on a particular timestep there is no penalty on following timesteps the propagation is run as usual succession behavior rules are detailed in appendix a 4 3 with water depth and hydroperiod thresholds shown in table a 4 and succession probabilities listed in table a 5 threshold and model parameters values are listed in table b 1 of appendix b 2 2 3 porewater salinity the primary ecotone driver from freshwater to salt tolerant plants is root zone porewater salinity in the model this is driven by the relative elevation of mean sea level and freshwater depth on the vegetation patch since there is a coastal ridge along the northern shore of florida bay serving to buffer ocean and estuarine water from the interior and since freshwater in the marsh suppresses subterranean saline water in the root zone as expressed by the ghyben herzburg principle there are two model parameters to calibrate these effects msl offset and depth no porewater see table b 1 and fig b 1 all patches are initialized to porewater salinity of zero and have a maximum porewater salinity of 3 this is sufficient since the maximal glycophytic vegetation tolerance is 2 ppt table b 1 patch porewater salinity is then determined by progressive accumulation of porewater salinity for patches with elevation below mean sea level and no standing freshwater procedurally all patches with an elevation below mean sea level minus the msl offset parameter are selected if these patches have a fresh water depth less than depth no porewater then their porewater salinity is incremented by 1 ppt if the fresh water depth is greater than depth no porewater the porewater salinity is reset to zero 2 3 vegetation map as a component of the comprehensive everglades restoration plan cerp the department of interior conducts an extensive vegetation mapping project the vegetation assessment assigns a landscape characterization code the vegetation code to 50 m 50 m patches throughout a region vegetation codes derive from a tree of descriptors starting with one of seven overall landscape types for example shrubland s with additional code elements providing increasing levels of landscape and ecosystem specificity as in red mangrove dominant shrubland smr since our model is driven by species behaviors we assign the dominant species for each landscape code to each of the 50 50 m patches for example even though a red mangrove dominant shrubland smr may contain other species the model considers such a patch to be uniformly populated with red mangrove fig 2 shows the southern coastal region vegetation map in everglades national park with false color overlay ruiz et al 2017 2 4 hydrological data hydrologic data are informed through the netlogo time extension with daily mean water levels provided as timeseries input to patch agents the link between timeseries and patches is specified in a gis layer corresponding to the grid shown in fig 2 each model grid cell correspond to 3 3 grid blocks from the everglades depth estimation network eden telis et al 2015 with the daily water level extracted from the center eden cell of the 3 3 block eden observed data are available from 1990 through 2017 since the calibration model period of record is 1973 through 2015 and the projection model period of record 2015 through 2100 data extrapolation is needed to model data from 1973 through 1990 we take advantage of strong correlations between marsh water levels across the model domain r 2 0 89 0 09 and estimate missing data with linear regressions from each cell to a long term hydrologic station p 37 in the central everglades containing data back to 1973 projection model data also leverage strong temporospatial correlations to create future projections of stage first we compute a single timeseries of daily mean water level across all cells over the observational record 1990 2017 to create a reference timeseries second we compute empirical cumulative distribution functions for each day of the year year day 1 365 over all years of the reference timeseries third we compute linear regressions between the timeseries of each grid cell 1990 2017 and the reference r 2 0 95 0 05 these correlation coefficients will be used to model grid cell water levels from a future projection of the reference timeseries next the reference timeseries is projected forward in time by sampling from the empirical distribution at the corresponding projected year day with a gaussian kernel specifically for a projected year day say the first day of the year the projected value is sampled from the empirical distribution for the first day of the year at a random percentile selected from a normal distribution to produce a projected reference timeseries 2015 2100 to generate projected timeseries at each cell the correlation coefficients identified from each cell to the observed reference 1990 2017 are applied to the projected reference this is tenable since the timeseries are dominated by the yearly hydrologic cycle and the flat topography results in high correlations between model cell hydrologic response as noted above these projections are purely probabilistic and do not account for climate change or nonstationarity 2 5 sea level rise data sea level rise trajectories applied to the future projection model are obtained from park et al 2017a corresponding to low 50th percentile and high 99th percentile estimates from 2015 through 2100 these estimates are specific to south florida and based on a synthesis of tide gauge data global climate models and expert elicitation contributions from the greenland ice sheet west antarctic ice sheet east antarctic ice sheet glaciers thermal expansion regional ocean dynamics land water storage and long term local non climatic factors such as glacial isostatic adjustment sediment compaction and tectonics as noted in park et al 2017a these projections are comprehensive but do not include components related to a rapid collapse of greenland and antarctic ice sheets recent observations suggest that such a collapse is underway holland et al 2015 wouters et al 2015 thereby we select the median projection as the low and the 99th percentile as the high the sea level rise projections and projected marsh water levels are shown in fig 4 2 6 calibration model calibration of agent thresholds and behaviors is achieved by initializing a model spanning the current mangrove sawgrass ecotone with vegetation coverage observed in 1973 rintz and loope 1978 which at the time was a purely freshwater landscape as shown in fig 5 a the model domain is a grid of 22 990 patches 209 110 covering a spatial domain of 10 450 5500 m however only 17 680 patches are used according to the extent of the 1973 vegetation map the model is a four species model with three freshwater species accounting for 98 8 of the initial vegetation sawgrass 92 0 spikerush 4 3 wax myrtle 2 5 and red mangrove as the saline successor other species comprising 1 2 of the initial vegetation are not processed the model is run forward in time from 1973 to 2015 with parameters adjusted to best fit the observed 2015 landscape vegetation fig 5b fit is defined as the percentage of model patches that correspond to the 2015 observed vegetation at the end of the model run an example applied to two model parameters is shown in fig b 1 of appendix b sea level rise is modeled as a linear function increasing at 3 cm decade corresponding to the mean of observed linear trends at vaca key 3 69 mm yr and key west 2 42 mm yr model output is shown in fig 5c model parameters are listed in appendix b model code and data are available at https github com softwareliteracyfoundation ecotone 2 7 projection model the projection model is a spatial expansion of the calibration model with vegetation initialized from the 2015 vegetation map where available and with timeseries of marsh stage and sea levels projected from 2015 to 2100 the spatial domain is expanded by 8 6 km to the north and initialized with sawgrass since there is not a vegetation map in this region the resultant model domain covers 14 382 hectare in a grid of 57 528 patches 204 282 10 2 km wide by 14 1 km tall along the fresh to saline ecotone near taylor slough everglades national park fig 2 the model uses parameters determined by the calibration model table b 1 with the addition of one parameter msl open depth and three vegetation species cypress swamp bay and buttonwood the msl open depth defines a patch depth that when exceeded by mean sea level converts the patch from terrestrial to marine estuarine it is set to 70 cm corresponding to maximal freshwater depths the three additional species account for 3 5 of the initial species coverage and not considered for propagation they are assessed for vitality and can die in response to either msl exceeding the patch elevation plus msl open depth or to salinity exposure in the case of cypress and swamp bay their salinity thresholds are set to a maximum salinity of 1 ppt sustained over a period of 30 days model code and data are available at https github com softwareliteracyfoundation ecotone 3 results predicted landscape transformations under low and high sea level rise trajectories are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively under the low sea level rise projection the landscape is relatively unchanged through 2050 with the emergence of a mangrove stand in the south central model domain by 2060 the mangrove stand has expanded and by 2070 it has nearly engulfed the slightly elevated ridge running from the south central of the domain to the northeast landscape elevations are shown in appendix a 6 1 by 2080 the majority of the landscape seaward of the porewater salinity interface has transformed to mangroves with the emergence of an open water area in the southwest corner of the domain in response to the high sea level rise trajectory significant change is not forecast through 2040 with the emergence of the south central mangrove stand by 2050 the ensuing decade is forecast to support the rapid colonization of mangroves along the slightly elevated ridge by 2070 there has been substantial transformation with open water accounting for a major portion of the domain and a new coastline of mangrove swamp by 2080 the transformation from predominantly freshwater marsh to marine conditions and mangrove swamp is nearly complete quantification of the areal change in landscape dominant species vegetation cover in response to the two sea level rise forcings is shown in fig 8 under both scenarios the contemporary vegetation distributions remain in equilibrium until 2050 beyond which there is evidence of landscape transformation from freshwater marsh to mangrove marsh and open water the physical mechanism behind freshwater to saline tolerant vegetation transformation is infiltration of root zone porewater salinity it is also known that as saline water from rising ocean levels infiltrate landward in the surficial aquifer it does so from the bottom up since saline water is denser than the freshwater dausman and langevin 2005 from this we assume that at a point on the landscape where freshwater vegetation has been displaced that the saline water extends to the base of the surficial aquifer given estimates of the surficial aquifer thickness which here range from approximately 8 to 12 m fish and stewart 1991 and which are spatially mapped in the model gis coverage one can make conservative estimates of the freshwater volume replaced by saline water by using the vegetation coverage as an ecosystem response function fig 9 plots estimates of surficial aquifer volumes under the model domain of fresh and saline water in response to the two sea level rise trajectories assuming a porewater volume fraction of 0 2 dausman and langevin 2005 note that this does not require detailed estimates of aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity and that it is not required to estimate landcape vegetation changes model results indicate a transformation from current ecological equilibrium to saltwater dominated starting at 2050 dynamics of this transition from the freshwater biome perspective are presented in fig 10 where deviation of spatially averaged projected freshwater levels on land are compared with coverage of the dominant freshwater species from 2050 through 2070 here we find dynamic responses at two timescales the long term decline driven by increasing porewater salinity as ocean levels rise superimposed with shorter term yearly or interannual variations exhibiting species proliferation and recovery with punctuated events of rapid species decline the rapid declines appear well correlated with low freshwater elevation events consistent with observations that drought and dry conditions are a fundamental stressor of freshwater marsh plants while recovery is indicated during periods without deep water level recession 2054 2058 4 discussion following the suggestion of sivapalan 2018 that complex eco hydrologic domains can be assessed through ecosystem function expressed on the landscape and the recognition of jiang et al 2016 that linear correlation based models may not be ideal for capturing ecotone dynamics we find that an agent based model provides reasonable and compelling estimates for landscape and freshwater resource transformation of coastal marshes in response to sea level rise the agent based approach relies on specification of interactions between the environment and species competing on the landscape rather than highly detailed mappings and assumptions of subterranean aquifer geology and environmental forcings such as rainfall and evapotranspiration if we were not interested in quantifying the aquifer resource transformation but simply inferring it s areal coverage from the vegetative landscape response we would not need geologic properties at all the model exhibits interspecies competition between fresh and saline tolerant plants primarily sawgrass cladium jamaicense and red mangrove rhizophora mangle mediated by root zone porewater salinity determined by elevations of rain supplied marsh water level land surface and sea level consistent with known landscape response elevated porewater salinity denatures freshwater plants during periods of low marsh water level open patches are then colonized with fresh or salt tolerant plants depending on environmentally determined fitness functions of surrounding species model results predict continued equilibrium between fresh and saltwater species until 2050 after which there is eventual replacement of freshwater species with salt tolerant ones and fresh groundwater with saline groundwater ultimately transitioning into new marine habitat interestingly initiation of the transformation is essentially independent of whether sea levels rise along a low or high trajectory however the ensuing transformations are quite different as a function of sea level dynamics this likely reflects a difference between the low and high sea level rise trajectories of 13 cm between 2020 and 2050 but 70 cm between 2050 and 2100 under a low sea level rise trajectory the model domain transitions from freshwater resource volume of 28 6 million cubic meters in 2015 to 8 7 million cubic meters in 2100 while under a high trajectory the volume decreases to 0 by 2085 the model also predicts that mangrove establishment at the 2050 threshold is facilitated along a slightly elevated ridge that runs northeast from the lower central model domain this elevation difference is no more than 14 cm above the surrounding marsh the anticipated landscape and aquifer transformation horizons of 2050 2070 are consistent with a purely empirical independent mechanism and analysis by park et al 2017b assessing transformations in water level exceedances along the coastal ridge in florida bay 8 5 km directly south and seaward of the current mangrove freshwater ecotone there the transformation horizon of 2040 2070 is forecast for the coastal ridge to be continually inundated in response to the same sea level rise trajectories as sea level rises florida bay will expand into the everglades and south florida establishing new estuarine and marine habitats replacing fresh groundwater along the coastal ecotone the model predicts that avoidance of extreme low water events and generally higher marsh stage are keys to prolonging viability of freshwater resources goals expressed in the comprehensive everglades restoration plan national academies of sciences 2018 further as shown in the upper right of fig 2 and lower right of fig 1 the south dade agricultural areas are less than 10 km from the model domain this industry employs more than 20 000 people producing more than 2 7 billion in annual economic impact miami dade county agriculture 2019 and is predicated on the surficial aquifer as a source of freshwater additionally the florida keys aquaduct authority extracts potable water for over 70 000 residents from a well field located less than 5 km from the southern boundary of the agricultural area providing significant concern for saline intrusion mcthenia et al 2017 our results suggest that near the end of the century these areas can start experiencing freshwater resource reduction finally we note that the model is based on species specific behaviors in response to root zone porewater salinity with freshwater graminoids and red mangroves the dominant cross ecotone species similar coastal ecotones are found around the globe and can be assessed for water resource transformations using these methods appendix a model overview design concepts and details odd a 1 purpose the models dynamically quantify areal transformation of freshwater marsh into saline estuary in response to dynamic interactions between freshwater depth and root zone porewater salinity driven by sea level landscape vegetation changes are used as indicators of surficial groundwater salinization allowing estimates of changes fresh to saline water volumes in the surficial aquifer a 2 entities state variables and scales a 2 1 agents model agents consist of plant species netlogo turtles and landscape grid cells netlogo patches plant species agents are listed in table a 1 with initial coverage percentages listed in tables a 8 and a 9 the open water agent is an end point transformation for the other species state variables of the plant and grid cell agents are listed in tables a 2 and a 3 respectively a 2 2 spatial units landscape grid cells correspond to the 50 m 50 m spatial discretisation of the vegetation map developed by ruiz et al 2017 the calibration model domain is a grid of 22 990 patches 209 110 covering a spatial domain of 10 4 5 5 km the projection model covers 14 382 ha in a grid of 57 528 patches 204 282 10 2 km wide by 14 1 km tall a 2 3 environment the model environment consists of three primary variables land surface elevation water depth in relation to land surface and sea level elevation land surface elevation is assigned to each model grid cell from a gis layer based on the work of fennema et al 2015 as described in appendix a 6 daily water elevations are obtained from the everglades depth estimation network eden telis et al 2015 and mapped to landscape cells through a gis layer and the cell stage gauge variable the gis layer specified in appendix a 6 assigns to each cell the name of an eden cell from which the water level timeseries are applied a csv file of the eden timeseries data is dynamically accessed to retrieve the corresponding water elevation at each timestep sea level elevations are obtained from timeseries of projected sea levels in florida bay by park et al 2017b a 3 process overview and scheduling model timesteps are discretely updated with a user adjustable variable days per tick with a default value of 15 days since input data are available in daily increments the model timestep can be any period of days the appropriate data is selected according to the specific date of a model timestep the go function schedules agent and data process execution at each timestep as shown here

design concepts a 4 1 basic principles the models assume a fundamental driver of ecotone dynamics between freshwater marsh and saline estuary is root zone porewater salinity and that this salinity is mediated by dynamic balance between sea level elevation landscape cell elevation and freshwater that may be present on the cell species specific tolerances to root zone salinity hydroperiod and depth dictate plant vitality and death while porewater salinity determines species specific fitness for succession a 4 2 emergence the model is fundamentally one of interspecies competition driven by root zone salinity primal complexities arise from the nonlinear nature of landscape freshwater depth and randomness of plant death and succession therefore we do not expect behavioral emergence from interagent interactions a 4 3 adaptation vegetation agents do not internally adapt or change behaviors but they do respond to environmental changes these behaviors are governed by salinity thresholds prescribed by the logistic functions shown in fig 3 water depth and hydroperiod thresholds shown in table a 4 and succession probabilities listed in table a 5 for example based on observational data as expressed in fig 3 sawgrass can tolerate salinities near 1 ppt while for spikerush 2 ppt can be tolerated the depth parameter relates a water depth on the patch beyond which the plant is unable to transpire or its cellular structure is compromised days wet represents the continuous hydroperiod that the plant can tolerate resulting in decomposition of roots transpiration limits or cellular compromise days dry represents the tolerable period of time with no available water in the root zone resulting in desiccation threshold and model parameters values are listed in table b 1 of appendix b as noted in section 2 2 2 when empty cells are evaluated for species succession the surrounding species with the highest cumulative fitness is selected for propagation however whether propagation actually occurs is determined by comparison of the species propagation success threshold as listed in table a 5 to a uniform random variate a 4 4 objectives as noted in the preceding section agents do not engage in internal behavior or objective fitness adaptation however their objectives are responsive to the environment as detailed in the preceding section a 4 5 learning as noted in the preceding section agents do not alter or dynamically change their adaptive traits rather they respond to the environment a 4 6 prediction agents do not project or anticipate future states a 4 7 sensing environmental state variables that individuals are assumed to sense and consider in their decisions are listed in table a 6 a 4 8 interaction interactions exist between the landscape cell netlogo patch and the vegetation agent netlogo turtle on the cell the cell maintains information regarding water depth hydroperiod and porewater salinity vegetation agents process this state information to determine vitality and fitness there are no interagent interactions between vegetation agents the only feedback in the model acts within landscape cells to determine porewater salinity porewater salinity is forced by the elevation of mean sea level in relation to the elevation of the cell land surface but can be mediated by the presence of adequate freshwater depth on the cell as described appendix a 7 1 a 4 9 stochasticity evaluation of environmental variables days wet and days dry in plant vitality behaviors are randomly modulated with a gaussian kernel to simulate individual plant tolerances specifically when a patch hydroperiod is processed the physically simulated value is shifted by the number of days according to a normal distribution specified in table a 7 vegetation succession behaviors are also probabilistically influenced as described in section 2 2 2 and appendix a 4 3 a 4 10 collectives the models use agent collectives netlogo agentsets internally to avoid redundant operations for example collectives of cells with specific species or which have transformed to open water there are no collective behaviors associated with these collectives a 4 11 observation the number of patches of sawgrass and red mangrove are the primary observational variables of the models a 5 initialization each cell in the model is initialized with a vegetation species specified from a vegetation map the calibration model uses the 1973 vegetation map of rintz and loope 1978 while the prediction model uses the 2015 map of ruiz et al 2017 timeseries data of water depth and mean sea level elevation are initialized according to the user specified start date variable appendix a 6 details the input and initialization data initial species compositions for the calibration and projection models are shown in tables a 8 and a 9 respectively a 6 input data table a 10 lists the input files and associated variable names used in the models all timeseries data have daily resolution and extend over the model period of record with no repeated data sea level rise and marsh water level extrema are shown in fig 4 cell elevations are shown in fig a 1 a 6 1 elevation data the interplay between freshwater depths mean sea level and porewater salinity are largely determined by landscape elevation fig a 1 shows the model domain elevation indicating a southwest to northeast channel known locally as taylor slough there is also a small ridge south of taylor slough running southwest to northeast model simulations suggest that this ridge will provide an initial stand for red mangroves as sea levels rise a 6 2 aquifer geological data aquifer thickness is inferred from united states geological service wells and geologic cross sections shown in fig a 2 a 7 submodels model processes specified appendix a 3 are detailed here a 7 1 update patch depth salinity the procedure update patch depth salinity executes these steps at each timestep 1 set depth on all cells 2 accumulate hydroperiod days wet days dry for all cells 3 identify cells with elevation below mean sea level into msl patches 4 identify msl patches in coastal zone within 1 5 km of mangrove ecotone 5 identify msl patches cells with freshwater depth less than depth no porewater into porewater patches 6 increment porewater salinity of porewater patches 7 identify msl patches with freshwater depth greater than depth no porewater into no porewater patches 8 reset porewater salinity to zero for no porewater patches 9 for msl patches a update cell salinity b accumulate number of days above salinity threshold into salinity days a 7 2 plant vitalities each plant species agent is assessed for vitality based on the current and accumulated environmental conditions in the go species procedures these procedures follow a common set of steps based on the specific tolerances for each species as identified appendix a 4 3 1 identify cells with living species i e sawgrass 2 if needed apply gaussian offsets to hydroperiod variables to emulate individual plant tolerances as described appendix a 4 9 3 determine if the plants die by applying the environmental conditions and species thresholds described appendix a 4 3 4 if plant has died record the model time and reason for death 5 if plant has died remove the cell from the species cell collection a 7 3 succession the go propagation procedure processes patches with no living plants for succession 1 identify species on surrounding 8 cells into neighbor species 2 accumulate the porewater salinity mediated fitness score fig 3 for each species in neighbor species 3 if there is a tie in fitness randomly 50 uniform deviate select one of the species and reduce its fitness by 0 1 4 identify the species with maximum cumulative fitness 5 apply the species specific propagation threshold against a uniform random variate to decide if the selected species will actually propagate as described in section 2 2 2 6 if a species establishes on the cell set the species specific environmental tolerances into the cell agent variables appendix b calibration model calibration model parameters are shown in table b 1 fig b 1 plots model calibration fit in response to msl offset and depth no porewater finding optimal values of 2 cm for both parameters fit is defined as the percentage of model patches that correspond to the 2015 observed vegetation at the end of the model run the netlogo user interface for the calibration model is shown in fig b 2 appendix c projection model the projection model uses the same parameters

25043,the mechanistic basis for problem specific question driven ecological simulation models often includes general physical phenomena although linking general physical environmental process models with custom written spatially explicit ecological models appears conceptually straightforward practical implementation of such structures is often problematic for ecological modellers and may require specific software engineering knowledge we describe a general coupling framework that introduces an intermediate layer between the two types of models we used a popular programming language netlogo to implement a spatially explicit simulation model for insect population growth and migration and a commonly used complex atmospheric dispersion model hysplit to project air particle here insect pest

models and spatially explicit ecological models can be especially problematic model integration has been seen as both opportunity and challenge argent 2004 laniak et al 2013 while the benefits of reusability and adoption of existing models with the primary goal of reducing time investment in model development have been long realized laniak et al 2013 explorations of solutions and discussions on how to avoid and overcome potential pitfalls are ongoing belete et al 2017 also the technical aspects of model integration vary among implementations with four major categories in environmental science distinguished by belete et al 2017 as component based web service based service oriented a hybrid of component based and web service based and tailor made custom made techniques all these approaches have advantages and disadvantages and all are currently being used in environmental model integration efforts in integrated ecological models as mentioned above representations of the ecological processes most commonly are developed de novo whereas representations of the physical environmental processes often can be outsourced to an established model in this note we describe a

available during winter bowling et al 2016 persistent annual sugarcane aphid population growth and dispersal in north america is driven by both the wind aided dispersal of alates and the capability to

simulation is established through an intermediate process program link l that controls the flow of information between the two terminal modules fig 1 and appendix in each cycle the information exchange is initiated as soon as nl output with information regarding the number of aphids dispersing from each nl patch and the patch locations treated as point sources of particles is saved to files used as input by hs at this point nl enters an idle state awaiting hs output l calls specific hs programs in order to simulate aphid dispersal and to convert the hs output into nl readable format in the next step nl reads the hs output with geo referenced particle concentration data concentration of potential aphid colonists landing in each nl patch once the process is completed nl executes the steps that simulate sorghum development and the colonization development mortality and dispersal of aphids and saves updated hs input data files if dispersing aphids are present the program l the central component of the workflow controls the order and the timing of process calls moderating the dialogue in order to prevent the potential situation in which an intermediate configuration or

25043,the mechanistic basis for problem specific question driven ecological simulation models often includes general physical phenomena although linking general physical environmental process models with custom written spatially explicit ecological models appears conceptually straightforward practical implementation of such structures is often problematic for ecological modellers and may require specific software engineering knowledge we describe a general coupling framework that introduces an intermediate layer between the two types of models we used a popular programming language netlogo to implement a spatially explicit simulation model for insect population growth and migration and a commonly used complex atmospheric dispersion model hysplit to project air particle here insect pest transport dispersion and deposition we developed an algorithm that facilitates an ongoing dialogue between these two models the dialogue takes place along a temporal scale with frequency and duration

spatially explicit representation of physical environmental processes using input from these sophisticated physical models seems a natural and conceptually straightforward step however establishing computational linkages often is challenging argent 2004 laniak et al 2013 in particular creating an ongoing dialogue during the course of a simulation between georeferenced physical environmental models and spatially explicit ecological models can be especially problematic model integration has been seen as both opportunity and challenge argent 2004 laniak et al 2013 while the benefits of reusability and adoption of existing models with the primary goal of reducing time investment in model development have been long realized laniak et al 2013 explorations of solutions and discussions on how to avoid and overcome potential pitfalls are ongoing belete et al 2017 also the technical aspects of model integration vary among implementations with four major categories in environmental science distinguished by belete et al 2017 as component based web service based service oriented a hybrid of component based and web service based and tailor made custom made techniques all these approaches have advantages and disadvantages and all are currently being used in environmental model integration efforts in integrated ecological models as mentioned above representations of the ecological processes most commonly are developed de novo whereas representations of the physical environmental processes often can be outsourced to an established model in this note we describe a

sampling survey covered 10 sites located along the eastern ligurian riviera italy extending over 80 km of coastline fig 1 sampling was conducted in july 2008 each site consisted of a 150 m transect located in the rocky midlittoral zone immediately above the mean low water level all sites were chosen consistently in terms of slope and aspect to open water thrush et al 2011 all the ligurian coast is highly exposed except for a few small embayments to dominant winds from the south east and south west sectors showing a long fetch and the shore is generally quite steep all the sites were chosen in wind exposed conditions and the slope of the shore was nearly vertical on average 60 to 90 inclination all the sites except montenero and monterosso located in the a zone of the cinque terre mpa are accessible for recreational activities but additional three sites are within the b zone of the portofino mpa pc west pc east portofino the starting point of each transect was located in an unbiased haphazard fashion and samples were collected at this point and every 10 m measured with a tape measure resulting in a sample size of 15 sampling points for each site each sampling point was also logged with a gps accuracy 10 m rms garmin etrex h at each sampling point a 20 20 cm quadrat was visually censused to identify the large organisms invertebrates and seaweeds that define the algal turf habitat and assess species density number of species per quadrat to provide percent cover estimates the quadrat was divided into 25 equal squares each representing 4 of coverage each taxon observed was given an abundance rank 1 4 within each square 1 4 of the square 1 and the total percent substrate cover was obtained by adding up scores for all squares where the taxon was present organisms filling less than 1 4 of a square 1 were given a percent cover value of 0 5 following dethier et al 1993 visible solitary organisms were also counted in each quadrat infauna vagile and sessile small benthic organisms were sampled using cores at each sampling point we collected two cores by pushing a stainless steel corer 5 cm internal diameter firmly into the turf and encrusting fauna the top of the core was then plugged while a flexible metal blade was slid against the rock to free the encrusting turf and organisms contained within the corer at each sampling point one of the cores was used to sample the turf infauna the sample was placed into a plastic jar preserved with 70 isopropyl alcohol and stained with rose bengal specimens were then sorted and enumerated at the lowest taxonomic resolution possible the second core sample was collected for the analysis of turf organic matter and sediment content this core was stored in a plastic bag kept cool and in the dark until frozen on return to the laboratory samples for turf total organic and sediment content were defrosted and air dried then algae and large organisms with calcified shells e g mussels and barnacles were removed from the sample samples were then dried at 60 c for 48 h weighed then combusted at 400 c for 6 h and reweighed to measure total organic and inorganic sediment content respectively 2 2 emergy analysis emergy theory is defined by two key concepts solar emergy itself and solar transformity solar emergy is identified by the quantity of solar energy required directly or not to provide a given flow or storage of energy or matter odum 1996 emergy is expressed in solar emergy joule sej and is usually calculated on an annual scale transformity measures the input of emergy per unit output and is calculated as the ratio of the emergy necessary to produce a flow or a storage to the actual energy of that flow or storage ulgiati and brown 2002 the transformity is expressed in solar emergy joule per joule of output flow sej j 1 for certain products or flows easily quantifiable in units of mass or money a conversion value expressed in sej g 1 or sej 1 can be used brown and ulgiati 2004 brown and buranakarn 2003 brown and ulgiati 2018 paoli et al 2008a b these coefficients are respectively named specific emergy and emergy per unit money transformity specific emergy and emergy per unit money can be gathered under the locution unit emergy value uev hereinafter odum 1996 and 2000 the emergy approach can attribute a system value to an ecosystem or a habitat through a biophysical accounting procedure odum 1996 brown and ulgiati 1999 odum 2000 pulselli et al 2011 berrios et al 2017 franzese et al 2015 vassallo et al 2017 the value calculated with emergy corresponds to the amount of natural resources e g nutrients rain used directly and indirectly to build up and maintain the biomass of all the organisms within the habitat vassallo et al 2017 the first step to put in practice emergy theory consists in the drawing of a system diagram where the system is represented as a box containing the components and surrounded by all the inputs on left and upper boundaries represented as circles the outputs are located outside the right boundary while the heat losses are represented below from the diagram an emergy table was built as follows first column lists all inputs to the ecosystem second column shows the corresponding unit of measure third column contains uevs and fourth column reports the emergy values obtained from the multiplication of input flows and

franzese et al 2015 practical applications are mainly addressed to the study of terrestrial forests campbell and brown 2012 campbell and tilley 2014 turcato et al 2015 or marine systems in particular marine protected areas mpas vassallo et al 2013 paoli et al 2013 berrios et al 2017 vassallo et al 2017 franzese et al 2017 picone et al 2017 paoli et al 2017a b paoli et al 2018 the applied methodology is based on the scheme proposed by vassallo et al 2017 which is summarized in three main steps 1 trophodynamic assessment an estimate of the primary production exploited to generate and to maintain the benthic biodiversity of the study area 2 supporting units calculation estimation of time required to yield primary production calculated in the previous phase 3 ecologic and monetary equivalents evaluation an estimate through emergy of the biophysical value ascribable to the production calculated in the trophodynamic assessment then translated into monetary units here below each phase is described in more detail 2 3 1 trophodynamic assessment the main trophic and taxonomic groups composing the ecosystem were identified and described in operational taxonomic units otus for both macroalgae and infauna then a database of the biomass per unit area associated with each trophic group was created as far as macroalgae are concerned coverage values from the visual quadrats were converted into biomass using conversions factors wcf from ballesteros 1985 except for the cystoseira species where conversion factors were calculated ad hoc on harvested samples table 1 dry weights of the considered algal species have been transformed into carbon weights g m2 by means of the conversion factors ccf from brey 2016 the sum of the carbon weights of the different species composes the total carbon weight of the primary producers otus the midlittoral benthic fauna was grouped according to their systematics phyla mollusca crustacea annelida echinodermata and their feeding behavior grazers deposit feeders suspensions feeders and predators for a total of eleven different otus table 2 only sessile species were considered being the midlittoral habitats located in a transitional zone at the tidal level the effect of fish can be considered negligible the abundance values of each otu from the individual samples were converted into biomass using individual weight conversion factors from goren 1980 and brey 1990 paoli et al 2016 2018 the individual weights ascribed to each considered species are reported in table 3 classified according to the corresponding otu the assessment of the biomass stocked in the otus is the basic information for the calculation of the primary production required in space and time to generate the natural capital stocked within the habitat the total biomass associated to the natural capital stock of the ecosystem b or primary biomass was obtained as sum of autotrophic biomass ba and heterotrophic one be ba is given by the sum of the different primary producers biomasses be is a function of each heterotrophic otu biomass and its trophic level pauly and christensen 1995 proposed a calculation for the evaluation of the primary production supporting fisheries based on the assumption that in nature a fixed rate of energy trophic efficiency rate is transferred from a trophic level to the following according to christensen and pauly 1993 the transfer efficiency between trophic levels is assumed equal to 15 in coastal systems the supporting primary production for heterotrophic biomass be stock is then calculated as 1 b e i 1 n h e t e r o t r o p h i c o t u i b i o m a s s 7 t l i 1 where tli is the trophic level of each heterotrophic otu lindeman 1942 the biomasses and the obtained productivities were expressed in carbon grams per square meters the corresponding quantity of nitrogen and phosphorus fixed were calculated by adopting the classical mass ratio of c n p 41 7 1 redfield 1963 the trophic levels were assessed by means of the simulations of the trophic web as in paoli et al 2016 through the matlab software https www mathworks com 2 3 2 supporting unit calculation for natural capital once biomass b was calculated the number of years during which this production has been generated has to be accounted supporting time hereinafter this calculation is required in order to apply the emergy procedure based on the estimate of annual natural fluxes allowing the transformation of nutrients into organic matter supporting time measured in years was calculated as ratio between total primary biomass to generate natural capital stock and an average yearly productivity rate here two rates were considered for the biomass of macrophytes a specific productivity rate equal to 375 gc m 2 a 1 has been adopted charpy roubaud and sournia 1990 while for the productivity that supported the storage of heterotrophic biomass a rate of 650 gc m 2 a 1 considering macroalgae seagrass microphytobentonic and phytoplanktonic average productivity has been taken into account 2 4 ecological evaluation and estimate of monetary equivalents emergy associated to each sampling site was assessed starting from data of nutrients and natural fluxes calculated following the described approach from b calculation inputs to emergy table listed in table 4 were obtained inputs are represented by the quantity of nutrients items 1 3 used to generate the required primary production and the amounts of natural resources items 4 9 necessary to convey and successively transform them in organic matter values of each item calculated according to the formula reported in table 4 and multiplied by the corresponding uevs table 5 provide their associated emergy contents the uevs used in this study were updated to the 1 52e 25 sej a 1 biosphere emergy baseline calculated by brown and ulgiati 2010 the sum of input emergy values provided an estimate of the amount of resources required by the site and represents the biophysical assessment of the investment made by nature to generate all the resources exploited vassallo et al 2017 the emergy values of different inputs were summed according to emergy algebra rules as a consequence items can be classified as i splits that are flows of the same kind with different emergy but the same uev for example a water stream that divides into two ii co products that are outflows of a different kind and different uev for example flows of wool and mutton produced by the sheep agricultural system are co products co products have different uevs because they emerge from different stages in the series of transformations during the same process according to algebra rules only the maximum among co products was chosen and included into the sum to avoid double counting in particular the nutrients were considered as a different set of co products and then compared with sun rain wind and current representing another co product set being these two groups generated on a different spatial and temporal scale tides and geothermal heat were considered as splits according to previous researches and being generated by different processes at the global scale brown et al 1991 the sum of 1 the largest among nutrients emergy contributions 2 the maximum among sun rain wind and currents 3 geothermal heat and 4 tides and 5 runoff composed the total emergy requirement for the midlittoral habitat in each site once this emergy amount was calculated the corresponding economic value was obtained the emergy value is then considered a proxy of natural capital value as cost invested by nature in order to express the solar emergy as units of money the standard practice odum 1996 is to divide the solar emergy sej by the mean solar emergy to currency ratio sej in our case of the economy that encompasses the flow of solar emergy campbell and tilley 2014 this ratio is named emergy money ratio emr hereinafter that represents the emergy buying power of money in a system since it values how much emergy corresponds on average to one unit of money produced by the considered national economy odum 1996 therefore given an emergy amount expressed in sej it can be translated into whatever currency simply by dividing this amount by the chosen emr here the 9 60e 11 sej ratio is employed pereira et al 2013 monetary equivalents of biophysical values such as the natural capital value of the midlittoral zone are expressed in emergy euros em the potential role of the different cystoseira species depending on their abundances as continuous or discontinuous fringe on the economic value of the above midlittoral community was evaluated in each sampling point one of the following main conditions was assessed presence of a continuous belt of cystoseira amentacea presence of a discontinuous belt of c amentacea presence of a continuous belt of cystoseira compressa and presence of a discontinuous belt of c compressa the condition of the fringe was determined according to the definition provided by the carlit index methodology for the assessment of the ecological status of rocky shores ballesteros et al 2007 revised specifically for the italian coasts by mangialajo et al 2008b a continuous belt is an uninterrupted assemblage of dense cystoseira thalli while a discontinuous belt is a co dominated assemblage composed by patches of cystoseira and other species the sampling design and specifically the site selection see paragraph 2 1 sites and sampling allowed to tease apart any strong potential bias due to site specificity and unconsidered drivers the effect of underlying cystoseira fringe on the midlittoral natural capital was assessed through a kruskal wallis non parametric test since assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were not satisfied post hoc comparisons were performed by dunn test statistical analyses were performed using the software r r core team 2015 3 results 3 1 system diagram fig 2 shows the system diagram of a generic midlittoral habitat above the cystoseira fringe the diagram summarizes the general functioning of the system and how cystoseira affects it inputs are depicted on the left side of the diagram main box indicates habitat boundaries including the habitat itself and the generated functions box 3 2 biomass assessment moving easterly along the coast the sites from pontetto to portofino were mostly characterised by continuous discontinuous c amentacea fringe while the sites from framura to monesteroli were mainly characterised by continuous discontinuous fringe of the cogeneric c compressa a less sensitive species while c amentacea is presently missing in the easternmost side of the ligurian coast probably due to disturbance events occurred in the last century de la fuente et al 2018 table 1 reports the biomass values in terms of gdw m2 of the different macroalgal species otus in the different sites fig 3 shows the proportional density of each otu in the different sampling sites overall the otus mollusca susp crustacea gra and crustacea dep display the highest values of density in the framura site we observed the largest density which is mainly due to two otus mollusca susp crustacea gra and particularly the mollusca susp presenting the highest value of density values of biomass for the 10 sites converted from density values of the 15 sampling points per site are reported in table 6 heterotrophic component contributes for more than the 50 biomass in half of the sites while in pontetto pc east and levanto the heterotrophs contribution is lower than 35 3 3 natural capital evaluation biomass b that supported in space and time the stored biomass was calculated together with supporting units for each site fig 4 emergy tables were obtained from b and supporting units values table 7 the average emergy value of midlittoral habitats above cystoseira fringe is 1 23e 12 sej m2 corresponding to 1 28 em m2 with a minimum value of 0 74 em m2 and a maximum one of 2 54 em m2 coefficient of variation 0 49 is rather high because of the large variability among the considered sites the emergy value is mainly due to the heterotrophic component which contributes with a percentage from 66 to 90 of the total emergy amount the large variability of the natural capital for the individual site was investigated taking into account the type and condition of the underlying cystoseira fringe data were grouped across sites according to the four classes continuous and discontinuous fringe of c amentacea or c compressa fig 5 highest and most variable values were observed in presence of c compressa continuous fringe here the average emergy value of the natural capital is 1 48e 12 sej m2 corresponding to 1 54 em m2 moreover c compressa continuous fringe displays the overall highest value 4 00e 12 sej equal to 4 16 em m2 where the fringe is not continuous the above midlittoral community shows very similar average values 1 01e 12 sej equal to 1 05 em m2 for c compressa discontinuous and 1 14e 12 sej equal to 1 18 em m2 for c amentacea discontinuous in the c amentacea continuous fringe condition the average value is lower than the unit 0 89 em m2 nonetheless in presence of a c amentacea continuous fringe the natural capital values show the lowest scatter c amentacea continuous st dev 0 45 c compressa continuous st dev 1 01 c amentacea discontinuous st dev 0 75 c compressa discontinuous st dev 0 55 results of the kruskal wallis test performed in order to understand if the natural capital value may be influenced by the condition of the underlying cystoseira belt highlight significant differences among groups p value 0 0204 the post hoc comparisons performed on paired groups reveal that the only significant difference is between the two continuous fringe conditions p vale 0 0036 4 discussion the midlittoral zone is a highly dynamic environment that provides a range of ecosystem functions supporting high biological productivity mclusky et al 1992 ysebaert et al 2003 vassallo et al 2012 contributing to flood defense borsje et al 2011 and providing important habitats for marine and terrestrial organisms elliott et al 2007 nagelkerken et al 2008 yates et al 2014 atkinson et al 2004 mander et al 2007 rog et al 2017 in the mediterranean sea the lower midlittoral zone is characterized by species belonging to the cystoseira genus that often dominate complex and diverse benthic assemblages giaccone et al 1994 ballesteros et al 1998 hereu et al 2008 playing an important role as habitat forming and providing relevant ecosystem functions for these reasons it is highly important to provide metrics to assess the health status of these environments in order to set up effective management measures in the proposed emergy diagram fig 2 the main ecosystem functions of the habitats located in the midlittoral zone above the cystoseira fringe were identified i e refuge biogeochemical cycles maintenance food provisioning water oxygenation and protection from physical agents from which related ecosystem services of this habitat arise water quality regulation and ecotourism in this study only the value of the natural capital has been assessed since it is the first step to be considered in ecosystem services analyses the natural capital value has been evaluated using the functioning of trophic network and the resources amount consumed in space and time by the communities to store biomass and to keep basic activities e g metabolic activities the value of functions and services can be strongly different and larger than that of natural capital without which nonetheless functions and services cannot be generated obtained values of the natural capital can be compared with those recently calculated with the same approach by franzese et al 2017 picone et al 2017 and paoli et al 2018 table 8 in some italian marine protected areas in emergy evaluations the monetary equivalents of solar emergy joules amounts are used mainly with communication purposes the translation from emergy units to money units does not change the biophysical feature of the accounting method but instead it represents a tool to include natural value in socio economic and policy contexts franzese et al 2017 vassallo et al 2017 paoli et al 2018 the value of the midlittoral habitat natural capital on average equal to 1 28 em m2 is consistent with the average values calculated for the benthic habitats of the mpas ranging between 0 29 to 2 81 these values cannot be interpreted as exchange values to be placed on the market since the emergy theory embraces the strong sustainability perspective goodland and daly 1992 giannetti et al 2010 weak sustainability assumes the substitutability between natural and man made capital whilst the strong one imposes the complete no substitutability and the consequent need to maintain the natural capital untouched neumayer 2003 if the weak sustainability perspective is adopted it cannot be assured that ecosystem services are provided at the present level with consequences also in profitability terms the natural capital of the considered midlittoral habitats seems to be lower than the values calculated in similar studies and specifically by paoli et al 2018 for photophilic and sciaphilic hard bottoms located in the same area the lower value can be explained considering that the upper midlittoral habitats are subjected to a huge variability of environmental conditions e g desiccation wave action intensity temperature salinity irradiation this variability can affect fundamental biotic processes such as recruitment predation and competition availability of resources and trophic relations overall reducing the complexity of biotic interactions concerning the cystoseira fringe low bordering the midlittoral habitat the natural capital is higher where a c compressa continuous fringe is present but with values showing a larger variability compared to the condition of a c amentacea continuous fringe fig 5 when a c amentacea continuous fringe condition occurs the natural capital values show the lowest scatter suggesting that this species could play a role in the stabilization of the above habitat maintaining homogeneous conditions on the above habitat conversely a possible interpretation of the low natural capital values above a continuous c amentacea fringe may refer to the differential refuge and attractive potential played by this canopy forming brown alga causing a concentration of species in its understorey rather than above consequently lowering the economic value of the midlittoral habitats in fact the relevant role of c amentacea in maintaining high habitat complexity and species diversity in its understorey community compared to c compressa is well known mangialajo et al 2008a the natural capital value of the midlittoral habitats can be employed as effective tool for managers in order to 1 monitor the welfare conditions of communities through time and evaluate the efficacy of adopted conservation strategies 2 make people more aware about the role played by these habitats and by the cystoseira belt protecting them 3 highlight differences in the role played by different cystoseira species 4 provide immediate indicators to include nature in policies and decisional processes further investigations will be devoted to methodology improvement taking into account for instance inter annual variations of biomass through the application of dynamic models nonetheless moving from the results here obtained it will be possible to ascribe a biophysical value also to functions generated by the considered habitats and finally to assess potential changes in the provisioning of ecosystem services that can be maintained at the current level only if the natural capital is preserved 5 conclusions the natural capital value can represent a useful baseline to monitor if the conditions of the considered environment change along time as a consequence of existing or new pressures the economic value expressed in currency units can be conveyed not only to scientists but also to managers and general public the results of this work referred to the midlittoral zone encourage further studies in order to evaluate the overall natural capital value of its habitats along the mediterranean sea for this reason it is necessary to address specifically also the cystoseira habitats evaluating the ecosystem functions and services that they provide as foundation species the estimate of natural value of cystoseira habitat will allow to raise awareness of the public towards the preservation of this habitat forming species in order to protect biodiversity and support the policy makers in the process of creating new legal and management instruments in terms of protection conservation and restoration actions if required as strongly supported by european funding programmes e g life programme

quantification of ecosystem relevance through their economic value aims at raising public awareness and supporting policy makers in the process of creating new legal instruments supporting the preservation of biodiversity in this framework a methodology for ecological and monetary evaluation of natural capital based on biophysical accounting and on emergy theory is applied to the habitats of the upper midlittoral zone located above continuous and non continuous cystoseira fringe the proposed approach is a quantitative measure able to analyse the overall functioning of the system and its efficiency in exploiting available resources the mean economic value of the habitats in the midlittoral zone assessed through the present study is 1 28 em m2 higher values but associated with a larger variability were observed in presence of continuous c compressa fringe conversely in the presence of a continuous c amentacea fringe a noticeable habitat forming species lower natural capital values were recorded possibly due to the attractive potential of this species in its understorey rather than in the above habitats concurrently with a lower variability of the natural capital values

assessed through the application of emergy analysis emergy analysis is a thermodynamic based methodology introduced during the 80 s by howard odum 1996 it is an approach of quantitative analysis that standardizes the values of non monitized and monitized resources services and commodities in a single common unit the unit of equivalent solar energy joules required to keep the studied system vital and operating in the considered condition brown and herendeen 1996 this makes emergy a very versatile technique that can be applied to any natural or human system or to a mix of the two a growing interest in the quantification of the monetary value of ecosystems arose in the last decades aiming at raising awareness of the general public towards the preservation of biodiversity and at supporting the policy makers in the process of creating new legal instruments beaumont et al 2008 brown et al 2001 costanza et al 1997 odum 2000 efforts were addressed not only to the monetisation of ecosystems but also to the understanding of the link between ecosystems and human well being costanza and daly 1992 presented the concept of natural capital distinct from human capital and manufactured capital natural capital includes land air water sea and ecosystems therein human capital comprises all individuals capacities for work while manufactured capital encompasses all material goods generated through economic activity and technological change interactions between the three capital types generate well being and a tight link exists between ecosystem services provision and natural capital only if natural capital is preserved the supply of services in the future and at the actual level can be guaranteed de groot et al 2012 from natural capital ecosystem functions arise these latter represent the potential to generate services that arise from natural capital stocks functions originate directly from the ecological structures and processes of ecosystems and their mutual interactions de groot et al 2010 if functions depend on natural capital ecosystem services es arise from functions es represent benefits that ecosystems directly and indirectly generate for the mankind the main difference between functions and services resides in the fact that while the value and the perception of services by humans change according to cultural social and economic features functions exist and bring their potential independently from humans and their perspectives de groot et al 2010 since es generate well being it is important to know and to evaluate each step or component of this so called pathway from nature to well being de groot et al 2010 paoli et al 2017a the goal of this study is to assess the natural capital of the midlittoral zone habitats along the ligurian coast taking into particular account the potential role of the engineer canopy forming species cystoseira amentacea and cystoseira compressa that represent the lower fringe of the midlittoral zone the hypothesis tested is that the two species and the continuity discontinuity of the fringe differently affect the natural capital of the above community 2 materials and methods 2 1 sites and sampling survey covered 10 sites located along the eastern ligurian riviera italy extending over 80 km of coastline fig 1 sampling was conducted in july 2008 each site consisted of a 150 m transect located in the rocky midlittoral zone immediately above the mean low water level all sites were chosen consistently in terms of slope and aspect to open water thrush et al 2011 all the ligurian coast is highly exposed except for a few small embayments to dominant winds from the south east and south west sectors showing a long fetch and the shore is generally quite steep all the sites were chosen in wind exposed conditions and the slope of the shore was nearly vertical on average 60 to 90 inclination all the sites except montenero and monterosso located in the a zone of the cinque terre mpa are accessible for recreational activities but additional three sites are within the b zone of the portofino mpa pc west pc east portofino the starting point of each transect was located in an unbiased haphazard fashion and samples were collected at this point and every 10 m measured with a tape measure resulting in a sample size of 15 sampling points for each site each sampling point was also logged with a gps accuracy 10 m rms garmin etrex h at each sampling point a 20 20 cm quadrat was visually censused to identify the large organisms invertebrates and seaweeds that define the algal turf habitat and assess species density number of species per quadrat to provide percent cover estimates the quadrat was divided into 25 equal squares each representing 4 of coverage each taxon observed was given an abundance rank 1 4 within each square 1 4 of the square 1 and the total percent substrate cover was obtained by adding up scores for all squares where the taxon was present organisms filling less than 1 4 of a square 1 were given a percent cover value of 0 5 following dethier et al 1993 visible solitary organisms were also counted in each quadrat infauna vagile and sessile small benthic organisms were sampled using cores at each sampling point we collected two cores by pushing a stainless steel corer 5 cm internal diameter firmly into the turf and encrusting fauna the top of the core was then plugged while a flexible metal blade was slid against the rock to free the encrusting turf and organisms contained within the corer at each sampling point one of the cores was used to sample the turf infauna the sample was placed into a plastic jar preserved with 70 isopropyl alcohol and stained with rose bengal specimens were then sorted and enumerated at the lowest taxonomic resolution possible the second core sample was collected for the analysis of turf organic matter and sediment content this core was stored in a plastic bag kept cool and in the dark until frozen on return to the laboratory samples for turf total organic and sediment content were defrosted and air dried then algae and large organisms with calcified shells e g mussels and barnacles were removed from the sample samples were then dried at 60 c for 48 h weighed then combusted at 400 c for 6 h and reweighed to measure total organic and inorganic sediment content respectively 2 2 emergy analysis emergy theory is defined by two key concepts solar emergy itself and solar transformity solar emergy is identified by the quantity of solar energy required directly or not to provide a given flow or storage of energy or matter odum 1996 emergy is expressed in solar emergy joule sej and is usually calculated on an annual scale transformity measures the input of emergy per unit output and is calculated as the ratio of the emergy necessary to produce a flow or a storage to the actual energy of that flow or storage ulgiati and brown 2002 the transformity is expressed in solar emergy joule per joule of output flow sej j 1 for certain products or flows easily quantifiable in units of mass or money a conversion value expressed in sej g 1 or sej 1 can be used brown and ulgiati 2004 brown and buranakarn 2003 brown and ulgiati 2018 paoli et al 2008a b these coefficients are respectively named specific emergy and emergy per unit money transformity specific emergy and emergy per unit money can be gathered under the locution unit emergy value uev hereinafter odum 1996 and 2000 the emergy approach can attribute a system value to an ecosystem or a habitat through a biophysical accounting procedure odum 1996 brown and ulgiati 1999 odum 2000 pulselli et al 2011 berrios et al 2017 franzese et al 2015 vassallo et al 2017 the value calculated with emergy corresponds to the amount of natural resources e g nutrients rain used directly and indirectly to build up and maintain the biomass of all the organisms within the habitat vassallo et al 2017 the first step to put in practice emergy theory consists in the drawing of a system diagram where the system is represented as a box containing the components and surrounded by all the inputs on left and upper boundaries represented as circles the outputs are located outside the right boundary while the heat losses are represented below from the diagram an emergy table was built as follows first column lists all inputs to the ecosystem second column shows the corresponding unit of measure third column contains uevs and fourth column reports the emergy values obtained from the multiplication of input flows and uev 2 3 natural capital value assessment emergy has been recently employed for the study of ecosystems and natural capital evaluation brown and ulgiati 1999 odum and odum 2000 pulselli et al 2011 franzese et al 2015 practical applications are mainly addressed to the study of terrestrial forests campbell and brown 2012 campbell and tilley 2014 turcato et al 2015 or marine systems in particular marine protected areas mpas vassallo et al 2013 paoli et al 2013 berrios et al 2017 vassallo et al 2017 franzese et al 2017 picone et al 2017 paoli et al 2017a b paoli et al 2018 the applied methodology is based on the scheme proposed by vassallo et al 2017 which is summarized in three main steps 1 trophodynamic assessment an estimate of the primary production exploited to generate and to maintain the benthic biodiversity of the study area 2 supporting units calculation estimation of time required to yield primary production calculated in the previous phase 3 ecologic and monetary equivalents evaluation an estimate through emergy of the biophysical value ascribable to the production calculated in the trophodynamic assessment then translated into monetary units here below each phase is described in more detail 2 3 1 trophodynamic assessment the main trophic and taxonomic groups composing the ecosystem were identified and described in operational taxonomic units otus for both macroalgae and infauna then a database of the biomass per unit area associated with each trophic group was created as far as macroalgae are concerned coverage values from the visual quadrats were converted into biomass using conversions factors wcf from ballesteros 1985 except for the cystoseira species where conversion factors were calculated ad hoc on harvested samples table 1 dry weights of the considered algal species have been transformed into carbon weights g m2 by means of the conversion factors ccf from brey 2016 the sum of the carbon weights of the different species composes the total carbon weight of the primary producers otus the midlittoral benthic fauna was grouped according to their systematics phyla mollusca crustacea annelida echinodermata and their feeding behavior grazers deposit feeders suspensions feeders and predators for a total of eleven different otus table 2 only sessile species were considered being the midlittoral habitats located in a transitional zone at the tidal level the effect of fish can be considered negligible the abundance values of each otu from the individual samples were converted into biomass using individual weight conversion factors from goren 1980 and brey 1990 paoli et al 2016 2018 the individual weights ascribed to each considered species are reported in table 3 classified according to the corresponding otu the assessment of the biomass stocked in the otus is the basic information for the calculation of the primary production required in space and time to generate the natural capital stocked within the habitat the total biomass associated to the natural capital stock of the ecosystem b or primary biomass was obtained as sum of autotrophic biomass ba and heterotrophic one be ba is given by the sum of the different primary producers biomasses be is a function of each heterotrophic otu biomass and its trophic level pauly and christensen 1995 proposed a calculation for the evaluation of the primary production supporting fisheries based on the assumption that in nature a fixed rate of energy trophic efficiency rate is transferred from a trophic level to the following according to christensen and pauly 1993 the transfer efficiency between trophic levels is assumed equal to 15 in coastal systems the supporting primary production for heterotrophic biomass be stock is then calculated as 1 b e i 1 n h e t e r o t r o p h i c o t u i b i o m a s s 7 t l i 1 where tli is the trophic level of each heterotrophic otu lindeman 1942 the biomasses and the obtained productivities were expressed in carbon grams per square meters the corresponding quantity of nitrogen and phosphorus fixed were calculated by adopting the classical mass ratio of c n p 41 7 1 redfield 1963 the trophic levels were assessed by means of the simulations of the trophic web as in paoli et al 2016 through the matlab software https www mathworks com 2 3 2 supporting unit calculation for natural capital once biomass b was calculated the number of years during which this production has been generated has to be accounted supporting time hereinafter this calculation is required in order to apply the emergy procedure based on the estimate of annual natural fluxes allowing the transformation of nutrients into organic matter supporting time measured in years was calculated as ratio between total primary biomass to generate natural capital stock and an average yearly productivity rate here two rates were considered for the biomass of macrophytes a specific productivity rate equal to 375 gc m 2 a 1 has been adopted charpy roubaud and sournia 1990 while for the productivity that supported the storage of heterotrophic biomass a rate of 650 gc m 2 a 1 considering macroalgae seagrass microphytobentonic and phytoplanktonic average productivity has been taken into account 2 4 ecological evaluation and estimate of monetary equivalents emergy associated to each sampling site was assessed starting from data of nutrients and natural fluxes calculated following the described approach from b calculation inputs to emergy table listed in table 4 were obtained inputs are represented by the quantity of nutrients items 1 3 used to generate the required primary production and the amounts of natural resources items 4 9 necessary to convey and successively transform them in organic matter values of each item calculated according to the formula reported in table 4 and multiplied by the corresponding uevs table 5 provide their associated emergy contents the uevs used in this study were updated to the 1 52e 25 sej a 1 biosphere emergy baseline calculated by brown and ulgiati 2010 the sum of input emergy values provided an estimate of the amount of resources required by the site and represents the biophysical assessment of the investment made by nature to generate all the resources exploited vassallo et al 2017 the emergy values of different inputs were summed according to emergy algebra rules as a consequence items can be classified as i splits that are flows of the same kind with different emergy but the same uev for example a water stream that divides into two ii co products that are outflows of a different kind and different uev for example flows of wool and mutton produced by the sheep agricultural system are co products co products have different uevs because they emerge from different stages in the series of transformations during the same process according to algebra rules only the maximum among co products was chosen and included into the sum to avoid double counting in particular the nutrients were considered as a different set of co products and then compared with sun rain wind and current representing another co product set being these two groups generated on a different spatial and temporal scale tides and geothermal heat were considered as splits according to previous researches and being generated by different processes at the global scale brown et al 1991 the sum of 1 the largest among nutrients emergy contributions 2 the maximum among sun rain wind and currents 3 geothermal heat and 4 tides and 5 runoff composed the total emergy requirement for the midlittoral habitat in each site once this emergy amount was calculated the corresponding economic value was obtained the emergy value is then considered a proxy of natural capital value as cost invested by nature in order to express the solar emergy as units of money the standard practice odum 1996 is to divide the solar emergy sej by the mean solar emergy to currency ratio sej in our case of the economy that encompasses the flow of solar emergy campbell and tilley 2014 this ratio is named emergy money ratio emr hereinafter that represents the emergy buying power of money in a system since it values how much emergy corresponds on average to one unit of money produced by the considered national economy odum 1996 therefore given an emergy amount expressed in sej it can be translated into whatever currency simply by dividing this amount by the chosen emr here the 9 60e 11 sej ratio is employed pereira et al 2013 monetary equivalents of biophysical values such as the natural capital value of the midlittoral zone are expressed in emergy euros em the potential role of the different cystoseira species depending on their abundances as continuous or discontinuous fringe on the economic value of the above midlittoral community was evaluated in each sampling point one of the following main conditions was assessed presence of a continuous belt of cystoseira amentacea presence of a discontinuous belt of c amentacea presence of a continuous belt of cystoseira compressa and presence of a discontinuous belt of c compressa the condition of the fringe was determined according to the definition provided by the carlit index methodology for the assessment of the ecological status of rocky shores ballesteros et al 2007 revised specifically for the italian coasts by mangialajo et al 2008b a continuous belt is an uninterrupted assemblage of dense cystoseira thalli while a discontinuous belt is a co dominated assemblage composed by patches of cystoseira and other species the sampling design and specifically the site selection see paragraph 2 1 sites and sampling allowed to tease apart any strong potential bias due to site specificity and unconsidered drivers the effect of underlying cystoseira fringe on the midlittoral natural capital was assessed through a kruskal wallis non parametric test since assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were not satisfied post hoc comparisons were performed by dunn test statistical analyses were performed using the software r r core team 2015 3 results 3 1 system diagram fig 2 shows the system diagram of a generic midlittoral habitat above the cystoseira fringe the diagram summarizes the general functioning of the system and how cystoseira affects it inputs are depicted on the left side of the diagram main box indicates habitat boundaries including the habitat itself and the generated functions box 3 2 biomass assessment moving easterly along the coast the sites from pontetto to portofino were mostly characterised by continuous discontinuous c amentacea fringe while the sites from framura to monesteroli were mainly characterised by continuous discontinuous fringe of the cogeneric c compressa a less sensitive species while c amentacea is presently missing in the easternmost side of the ligurian coast probably due to disturbance events occurred in the last century de la fuente et al 2018 table 1 reports the biomass values in terms of gdw m2 of the different macroalgal species otus in the different sites fig 3 shows the proportional density of each otu in the different sampling sites overall the otus mollusca susp crustacea gra and crustacea dep display the highest values of density in the framura site we observed the largest density which is mainly due to two otus mollusca susp crustacea gra and particularly the mollusca susp presenting the highest value of density values of biomass for the 10 sites converted from density values of the 15 sampling points per site are reported in table 6 heterotrophic component contributes for more than the 50 biomass in half of the sites while in pontetto pc east and levanto the heterotrophs contribution is lower than 35 3 3 natural capital evaluation biomass b that supported in space and time the stored biomass was calculated together with supporting units for each site fig 4 emergy tables were obtained from b and supporting units values table 7 the average emergy value of midlittoral habitats above cystoseira fringe is 1 23e 12 sej m2 corresponding to 1 28 em m2 with a minimum value of 0 74 em m2 and a maximum one of 2 54 em m2 coefficient of variation 0 49 is rather high because of the large variability among the considered sites the emergy value is mainly due to the heterotrophic component which contributes with a percentage from 66 to 90 of the total emergy amount the large variability of the natural capital for the individual site was investigated taking into account the type and condition of the underlying cystoseira fringe data were grouped across sites according to the four classes continuous and discontinuous fringe of c amentacea or c compressa fig 5 highest and most variable values were observed in presence of c compressa continuous fringe here the average emergy value of the natural capital is 1 48e 12 sej m2 corresponding to 1 54 em m2 moreover c compressa continuous fringe displays the overall highest value 4 00e 12 sej equal to 4 16 em m2 where the fringe is not continuous the above midlittoral community shows very similar average values 1 01e 12 sej equal to 1 05 em m2 for c compressa discontinuous and 1 14e 12 sej equal to 1 18 em m2 for c amentacea discontinuous in the c amentacea continuous fringe condition the average value is lower than the unit 0 89 em m2 nonetheless in presence of a c amentacea continuous fringe the natural capital values show the lowest scatter c amentacea continuous st dev 0 45 c compressa continuous st dev 1 01 c amentacea discontinuous st dev 0 75 c compressa discontinuous st dev 0 55 results of the kruskal wallis test performed in order to understand if the natural capital value may be influenced by the condition of the underlying cystoseira belt highlight significant differences among groups p value 0 0204 the post hoc comparisons performed on paired groups reveal that the only significant difference is between the two continuous fringe conditions p vale 0 0036 4 discussion the midlittoral zone is a highly dynamic environment that provides a range of ecosystem functions supporting high biological productivity mclusky et al 1992 ysebaert et al 2003 vassallo et al 2012 contributing to flood defense borsje et al 2011 and providing important habitats for marine and terrestrial organisms elliott et al 2007 nagelkerken et al 2008 yates et al 2014 atkinson et al 2004 mander et al 2007 rog et al 2017 in the mediterranean sea the lower midlittoral zone is characterized by species belonging to the cystoseira genus that often dominate complex and diverse benthic assemblages giaccone et al 1994 ballesteros et al 1998 hereu et al 2008 playing an important role as habitat forming and providing relevant ecosystem functions for these reasons it is highly important to provide metrics to assess the health status of these environments in order to set up effective management measures in the proposed emergy diagram fig 2 the main ecosystem functions of the habitats located in the midlittoral zone above the cystoseira fringe were identified i e refuge biogeochemical cycles maintenance food provisioning water oxygenation and protection from physical agents from which related ecosystem services of this habitat arise water quality regulation and ecotourism in this study only the value of the natural capital has been assessed since it is the first step to be considered in ecosystem services analyses the natural capital value has been evaluated using the functioning of trophic network and the resources amount consumed in space and time by the communities to store biomass and to keep basic activities e g metabolic activities the value of functions and services can be strongly different and larger than that of natural capital without which nonetheless functions and services cannot be generated obtained values of the natural capital can be compared with those recently calculated with the same approach by franzese et al 2017 picone et al 2017 and paoli et al 2018 table 8 in some italian marine protected areas in emergy evaluations the monetary equivalents of solar emergy joules amounts are used mainly with communication purposes the translation from emergy units to money units does not change the biophysical feature of the accounting method but instead it represents a tool to include natural value in socio economic and policy contexts franzese et al 2017 vassallo et al 2017 paoli et al 2018 the value of the midlittoral habitat natural capital on average equal to 1 28 em m2 is consistent with the average values calculated for the benthic habitats of the mpas ranging between 0 29 to 2 81 these values cannot be interpreted as exchange values to be placed on the market since the emergy theory embraces the strong sustainability perspective goodland and daly 1992 giannetti et al 2010 weak sustainability assumes the substitutability between natural and man made capital whilst the strong one imposes the complete no substitutability and the consequent need to maintain the natural capital untouched neumayer 2003 if the weak sustainability perspective is adopted it cannot be assured that ecosystem services are provided at the present level with consequences also in profitability terms the natural capital of the considered midlittoral habitats seems to be lower than the values calculated in similar studies and specifically by paoli et al 2018 for photophilic and sciaphilic hard bottoms located in the same area the lower value can be explained considering that the upper midlittoral habitats are subjected to a huge variability of environmental conditions e g desiccation wave action intensity temperature salinity irradiation this variability can affect fundamental biotic processes such as recruitment predation and competition availability of resources and trophic relations overall reducing the complexity of biotic interactions concerning the cystoseira fringe low bordering the midlittoral habitat the natural capital is higher where a c compressa continuous fringe is present but with values showing a larger variability compared to the condition of a c amentacea continuous fringe fig 5 when a c amentacea continuous fringe condition occurs the natural capital values show the lowest scatter suggesting that this species could play a role in the stabilization of the above habitat maintaining homogeneous conditions on the above habitat conversely a possible interpretation of the low natural capital values above a continuous c amentacea fringe may refer to the differential refuge and attractive potential played by this canopy forming brown alga causing a concentration of species in its understorey rather than above consequently lowering the economic value of the midlittoral habitats in fact the relevant role of c amentacea in maintaining high habitat complexity and species diversity in its understorey community compared to c compressa is well known mangialajo et al 2008a the natural capital value of the midlittoral habitats can be employed as effective tool for managers in order to 1 monitor the welfare conditions of communities through time and evaluate the efficacy of adopted conservation strategies 2 make people more aware about the role played by these habitats and by the cystoseira belt protecting them 3 highlight differences in the role played by different cystoseira species 4 provide immediate indicators to include nature in policies and decisional processes further investigations will be devoted to methodology improvement taking into account for instance inter annual variations of biomass through the application of dynamic models nonetheless moving from the results here obtained it will be possible to ascribe a biophysical value also to functions generated by the considered habitats and finally to assess potential changes in the provisioning of ecosystem services that can be maintained at the current level only if the natural capital is preserved 5 conclusions the natural capital value can represent a useful baseline to monitor if the conditions of the considered environment change along time as a consequence of existing or new pressures the economic value expressed in currency units can be conveyed not only to scientists but also to managers and general public the results of this work referred to the midlittoral zone encourage further studies in order to evaluate the overall natural capital value of its habitats along the mediterranean sea for this reason it is necessary to address specifically also the cystoseira habitats evaluating the ecosystem functions and services that they provide as foundation species the estimate of natural value of cystoseira habitat will allow to raise awareness of the public towards the preservation of this habitat forming species in order to protect biodiversity and support the policy makers in the process of creating new legal and management instruments in terms of protection conservation and restoration actions if required as strongly supported by european funding programmes e g life programme
