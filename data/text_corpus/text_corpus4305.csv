21525,an infinite froude number or aerodynamic theory is developed for the prediction of the additional lift drag moment and flap hinge moment acting on a planing vessel fitted with transom stern flaps excellent agreement between the theory and the experiment for lift drag and flap hinge moment is obtained for flap chord to vessel beam ratios of 0 1 and 0 2 however the theory slightly underpredicts the experimental data for greater values of the flap chord the predictions for the moment are much less satisfactory it is therefore recommended to repeat the experiments using modern

angle degrees 1 introduction 1 1 background research flaps are often fitted to the stern of planing boats in order to improve the trim of the vessel when under way generally speaking such craft suffer from excessive bow up trim and therefore it is usual to adjust the flaps so that they possess a positive angle of attack this provides an upward force at the stern which corrects reduces the excessive trim of the boat the classic and original experimental research on the effectiveness of trim flaps was performed by brown 1971 his model prismatic boat was tested in a towing tank and the consequent forces and moments generated by the flaps were measured for an extensive set of conditions in which the trim angle τ the flap angle δ f and the beam froude number f b u g b were varied here u is the speed of the boat g is the acceleration due to gravity and b is the beam in his work the model had a constant beam and a constant deadrise angle β 1 0 a challenging feature of the work was to obtain data for the prescribed wetted length to beam ratio λ l b brown 1971 collected data for the increase in lift δ l drag δ d moment δ m and the flap hinge moment δ h flap chord to vessel beam ratios of 0 1 and 0 2 were studied brown 1971 created straight line fits for the variation of flap induced lift coefficient versus the flap angle showing that the function is essentially independent of both the vessel trim angle and the wetted length in the current notation his formula is 1 δ c l δ l 1 2 ρ u 2 s f 0 046 δ f in which ρ is the water density s f c f b f is the area of both flaps c f is the flap chord and b f is the beam of both flaps next the additional drag coefficient associated with the flap was given by the formula 2 δ c d δ d 1 2 ρ u 2 s f 2 0 00024 τ δ f δ f the factor of 2 which has been introduced here in this paper in order to correct the original published equation will be discussed presently the additional moment coefficient on the boat due to the flap was given by the formula 3 δ c m δ m 1 2 ρ u 2 s f c f 0 0276 b c f δ f finally the additional flap hinge moment coefficient was approximated by the formula 4 δ c h δ h 1 2 ρ u 2 s f c f 0 0064 δ f these formulas were deemed to be applicable for the following range of relevant variables 0 c f l 0 10 0 δ f 1 5 0 τ 1 0 and 2 f b 7 many years later macpherson 2012 published a short note in which he showed that a better regression fit of the lift data could be derived by also accounting for the aspect ratio of both flaps a f using for example the correction formula developed by jones 1941 this correction considers that the relatively low aspect ratio of a flap will reduce its effectiveness in this approach one assumes that the influence of aspect ratio for a flap attached to the trailing edge of a lifting surface is identical to that for a simple planar wing somewhat later chen and fwu 1992 performed their own experiments in a similar manner their measured data were limited to the increase in lift flap chord to vessel beam ratios of 0 15 and 0 3 were studied a more extensive set of tests was conducted by chen hsueh and fwu 1993 they measured the flap induced increases in lift drag and moment flap chord to vessel beam ratios of 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 were studied these three sets of experimental data are summarized in table 1 where it is noted that there is some overlap between the data sets this permits one to partly verify the consistency of the data 1 2 practical applications practical application of transom flaps to realistically shaped vessels has been investigated by many researchers in these applications the model has often been fitted with stern wedges which are located immediately forward of the transom however the influence of such wedges is essentially identical to that of flaps located immediately behind the transom an early example of such studies is that of cole and millward 1973 in which the effect of wedges on the ship model resistance was measured in a towing tank millward 1976 considered the action of wedges on two different hulls similarly wang 1980 measured the forces due to flaps appended to planing hulls grigoropoulos and loukakis 1996 also fitted wedges to planing hulls and measured their effect on the resistance of the model another and more recent publication is that of yaakob shamsuddin and king 2004 who demonstrated that the installation of flaps produced a reduction in the resistance of planing hulls 1 3 current research the fact that the data for the increment in lift moment and flap hinge moment exhibit a linear behavior with respect to the flap deflection angle suggests that a simple and traditional linear theory should be applicable the relatively small practical angles of vessel trim and flap angle also support this concept a crucial additional point is that the froude number based on flap chord is very high this fact implies that an infinite froude number theory should provide realistic results it is well established that in such a situation the flow disturbance generated by the boat is equivalent to that of an equivalent vortex distribution as used to model the action of an aerodynamic lifting surface 2 theory 2 1 planar distribution of vorticity we start the analysis by defining the coordinate system in which the longitudinal axis x is directed forward the y axis is directed to port and the z axis is directed upward the axis system moves forward with the lifting surface with a speed u fig 1 a shows the discretization of vorticity along the centerline of the lifting surface using vorticity elements which have a triangular variation in strength both longitudinally x and transversely y thus being of a tent like form fig 1 b illustrates an assembly of such elements to model the action of the lifting surface the elements overlap in a suitable manner so that the final variation in vorticity is separately piecewise linear in x and y the bases of the elements are rectangular with dimension δ x j δ y these bases are not depicted because it would overly complicate the illustration while the current analysis utilizes an effectively continuous distribution of vorticity it has been traditional to employ a simpler system of discrete horseshoe vortices as illustrated by ashley and landahl 1965 page 136 figure 7 4 the use of such simple vortex lattice systems has been explained by many researchers including margason and lamar 1971 and liu and ikehata 1994 2 2 tent function element we now quote the formula for a horseshoe vortex of strength γ and whose axis is aligned with the y axis of the coordinate system the lateral extent of the vortex filament is between y s and y s the two longitudinal x wise parts of the vortex then extend infinitely far downstream the formula for the vertical component of the velocity induced by this vortex can be quoted from ashley and landahl 1965 page 87 equation 5 35 it is 5 w x y 0 γ 4 π 1 y s 1 x 2 y s 2 x 1 y s 1 x 2 y s 2 x the algebra is simplified by the fact that one only needs to evaluate the induced velocity on the surface itself namely z 0 the distribution of vorticity inside the tent element is defined by the formula 6 γ x y γ i 1 x δ x j 1 y δ y in which the source element spacing is δ x j longitudinally and δ y transversely integration of eq 5 using eq 6 with respect to the longitudinal source variation x first requires replacing x by x x in which x is the field coordinate and x is the source coordinate similarly one then replaces y by y y and then integrates transversely with respect to y after considerable algebra the final result for the downwash induced by the tent element is 7 w x y 0 1 16 π δ x j δ y k 1 1 t k l 1 1 t l f x k δ x j y l δ y where the corner influence function is defined as 8 f x y 5 x x 2 y 2 2 x 2 y 2 ln x x 2 y 2 4 x y ln y x 2 y 2 4 x y ln x 1 2 y 2 it can be demonstrated that the last term placed within the delimiters does not contribute to the summation in eq 7 this superfluous term can be removed from the formula finally the integration weights in eq 7 are 9 t k 1 for k 1 2 for k 0 1 for k 1 previous research using the boundary element method has demonstrated that more accurate results can be achieved by integrating the influence function in this case eq 8 with respect to the field variable that is one considers a field panel rather than a field point this concept is referred to as the galerkin method examples of the superiority of this approach include those of barnell 1984 section 4 2 and doctors 1986 for simplicity we shall assume that the spacing of the panels is uniform in the transverse direction then integrating eq 8 with respect to y over the field panel as was done for the source panel gives the result 10 w x y 0 1 576 π δ x j δ y 3 k 1 1 t k l 2 2 u l f x k δ x j y l δ y where the new influence function is now defined as 11 f x y 12 x y x 2 2 y 2 ln y x 2 y 2 3 y 2 12 x 2 y 2 ln x x 2 y 2 x 2 x 2 47 y 2 x 2 y 2 y 2 54 x 2 7 4 y 2 and the new weights are 12 u l 1 for l 2 4 for l 1 6 for l 0 4 for l 1 1 for l 2 a further refinement in the method naturally follows one can also apply the galerkin concept longitudinally a question arises as to whether one can consider the longitudinal variation to be tent like however as the field point will be chosen to be at the center of the field panel it is deemed that the best that one can achieve is to effect the longitudinal field integration assuming a constant weighting function the final result after some tedious algebra is 13 w x y 0 1 2880 π δ x i δ x j δ y 3 k 1 1 t k l 2 2 u l m 1 2 1 2 v m f x k δ x j m δ x i y l δ y where the third version of the influence function is now given as 14 f x y 15 x y 2 4 x 2 y 2 ln x x 2 y 2 15 y x 2 4 y 2 x 2 ln y x 2 y 2 2 x 4 94 x 2 y 2 2 y 4 x 2 y 2 15 4 x 4 y 30 x 2 y 3 105 4 y 5 and the new weights are 15 v m 1 for m 1 2 1 for m 1 2 2 3 assembly of elements the kinematic condition is applied at the center of the field panels as indicated in fig 1 b in the case of a field point using eq 8 or eq 11 this is interpreted as being located at an offset δ x i 2 behind the nominal coordinate in the case of a field panel using the galerkin technique and employing eq 14 this is interpreted as being the half panel behind the nominal field coordinate in either implementation the purpose of the longitudinal asymmetry is to enforce the kutta condition at the trailing edge as explained by ashley and landahl 1965 page 57 section 2 11 the so called collocation points are depicted in fig 1 b we denote the slope at the i th field point as α i this slope is computed as 16 α i α ahead of flap α α f on the flap so the kinematic condition is stated as 17 j 1 n w i j γ j u α i for i 1 to n 2 4 forces and moments the lift is computed in the usual manner within the framework of linear theory so the disturbance induced by the surface is considered small and the usual approximations associated with this are made hence one can compute the following quantities the pressure difference p i between the lower and the upper surface lift l drag d moment m and flap hinge moment h 18 p i ρ u γ i 19 l i 1 n p i δ x i δ y 20 d i 1 n p i δ x i δ y α i 21 m i 1 n p i δ x i δ y x i 22 h i 1 n p i δ x i δ y x f i 3 discretization convergence tests 3 1 elliptic wing our first test of the theory and the numerical approximation is the classic planar elliptic wing this problem was solved analytically by hauptman and miloh 1986a equations 65a and 65b a small typographical error in their lift equation has been corrected by hauptman and miloh 1986b the complete elliptic integral of the second kind e here is the same as that defined by abramowitz and stegun 1972 chapter 17 equation 17 3 3 for the case when the aspect ratio a s 2 s is less than unity the lift and the nose up moment coefficients are computed by the following sequence of formulas k π a 4 h 1 k 2 a k h ln 1 h k b 1 k a e 2 h 2 c l α 4 k 1 k a b c m α 4 k e h 2 3 b for the case when the aspect ratio is greater than unity the two coefficients are calculated as follows k 4 π a h 1 k 2 a k sin 1 h h b k a e 2 h 2 c l α 4 a b c m α 4 e h 2 3 b the computer software based on the above methodology has been tested in the first place on the classic flat elliptic lifting surface the results for the lift coefficient are presented in fig 2 a and for the moment coefficient in fig 2 b the results are plotted as a function of the aspect ratio a the most refined of the three types of panels employs eqs 13 and 14 this is indicated by the panel type of gal x y the straightforward numerical results relate to two different meshes as annotated on the plots specifically these are meshes of n x n y 14 14 panels and 20 20 panels the third set of results is a richardson extrapolation based on the formula 23 q a b n c where q is the quantity of interest and n n x n y is the number of panels the three constants in eq 23 can be determined by executing the prediction software for three different discretizations or meshes a series of tests using the software has demonstrated that the order of error for quantities such as the lift and drag is typically c 1 surprisingly this number is almost independent of the choice of panel type described in section 2 2 in fig 2 we have applied the extrapolation utilizing the coarse meshes of 14 14 and 20 20 as well as the finer mesh of 40 40 panels it is demonstrated here that there is near perfect agreement between the extrapolated numerical data and the analytic theory of hauptman and miloh 1986a the typical errors associated with the discretization can be assessed by a study of the two parts of fig 2 timing of the execution has also been performed on the software for the finest panelizations referred to here the vast part of the execution time relates to the inversion of the matrix associated with the set of equations expressed by eq 17 as an example the case of 80 80 panels 6400 panels considered later requires about 375 s on a macbook computer equipped with a 2 7 ghz intel core i7 processor 3 2 planing surface with flaps the second set of computations applies directly to the case of interest in the current research this is a flat rectangular surface set at an angle τ fitted with a trailing flap set at an angle of deflection δ f there are two differences in the calculations from the aerodynamic case just considered firstly in the aerodynamic case we have used radians for the angle of attack but in the hydrodynamic planing case we will use degrees for the trim angle secondly the hydrodynamic forces act only on the under surface this introduces a factor of 1 2 into the calculation of the forces the first five parts of fig 3 provide a thorough test for the required discretization of the surface firstly fig 3 a shows the variation of the lift coefficient with respect to the aspect ratio of both flaps a f b f c f b c f using five different discretizations or approaches the first four approaches apply to a planing surface with the same aspect ratio a 1 2 this aspect ratio is typical of most of the available experimental data the minor differences between the results demonstrate that applying the richardson extrapolation based on a discretization of 80 80 yields convergent results the fifth and last curve applies to a different planing surface aspect ratio of 1 4 the fact that the lift behavior is visually identical to that for the shorter surface with an aspect ratio of 1 2 illustrates that this parameter is irrelevant and that the lift enhancement provided by the flap is a near field fluid phenomenon it is emphasized that an advantage of the linearized approach is that one only needs to execute the software for say a unit value of the flap angle δ f this result may be used to infer the performance at other flap angles furthermore the result for the lift increment is independent of the planing angle τ the increased drag experienced by a flapped planing plate is the subject of fig 3 b and c while the linear theory predicts that the lift increases proportionately with the flap angle the increase in drag is instead given by the expressions 24 δ c d δ c d 1 δ c d 2 25 δ c d 1 δ f τ 26 δ c d 2 δ f 2 once again the linear theory allows one to compute the mixed drag coefficient δ c d 1 and the quadratic drag coefficient δ c d 2 by considering just one trim angle and just one flap angle in the numerical implementation the first term in eq 24 quantifies the interaction between the planing surface and the flap this interaction is the sum of two contributions the first contribution is the influence of the flap on the pressure distribution under the entire planing surface the second contribution is the influence of the planing surface on the pressure distribution under the deflected flap the second term in eq 24 results from the influence of the flap generated pressure on the flap itself as for the case of the lift increment in fig 3 b and c the discussion regarding a suitable discretization of the surface applies to the case of the drag increment the moment increment due to the action of the flap is considered in fig 3 d in contrast to the discussion of lift and drag the data in this subfigure indicate a minor influence of the chord length of the planing surface the last test of convergence with respect to the paneling or discretization in fig 3 e again shows well behaved convergence behavior this time for the flap hinge moment finally in fig 3 f we summarize the converged results for the dimensionless coefficients from the previous five subfigures in order to plot these five disparate coefficients on the one graph some of the them have been multiplied by a suitable numerical factor as indicated in the legend this single graph epitomizes the behavior of a full width flap fitted to a planing surface the graph is suitable for predicting flap performance on any planing boat a clear and anticipated characteristic of the results is that the increment in lift force due to the activation of the flap together with the associated drag and the moments increases with the flap aspect ratio 4 experimental data 4 1 geometry of the planing surface the three quoted experiments all were performed on prismatic planing surfaces being prismatic means that the wetted length at the centerline is somewhat greater than the wetted length at the chine thus the wetted surface in plan view is similar to that illustrated in fig 1 b however the calculations were effected on a rectangular shape using the average wetted length the reason for this decision is that the simple theory applies strictly only to the planar case no deadrise angle where the wetted surface is indeed essentially rectangular incidentally the shape of the leading edge of the planing surface has almost no effect on the behavior of the flap this point is demonstrated by the fact that changing the aspect ratio a from 0 5 to 0 25 in the first five parts of fig 3 produces no visually discernible effect a further point is that the dimensions of the wetted surface include the flap itself this is a logical choice because one wishes the influence of the flap its lift drag and moment to be zero when the flap deflection is zero 4 2 brown 1971 the original and most comprehensive set of data on flap behavior was published by brown 1971 it is summarized in table 1 he tested a total of 10 flap configurations of which seven relates to flaps that spanned the full width of the planing surface the lift drag moment and hinge moment from the first of these 10 tests are plotted in fig 4 the partly processed data appear in brown 1971 tables 1 and 2 these tables list the dependence of the various beam based dimensionless coefficients on the beam froude number to obtain the data in the current format one must weight the coefficients with respect to the speed and then convert the force and moment coefficients using the definitions employed by brown 1971 as well as the corresponding definitions used in the present work thus the first set of symbols in fig 4 a was determined in the present work by weighting the data with factors of f b 2 as annotated in the plot the second set of data was determined by using weights of 1 as shown there is little difference between these two sets of data illustrating that the original coefficients varied very little with speed finally the third set of symbols is replotted from the original data in brown 1971 table 3 who used the f b 2 weighting the extremely close agreement between the three sets of experimental points confirms our interpretation of this classic publication the continuous curve shown in fig 4 a is simply eq 1 the extremely linear relationship between the lift increment and the flap deflection angle is confirmed we now consider the corresponding drag data in fig 4 b where there is a discrepancy between the original analysis and the present re analysis of the data published by brown 1971 table 3 as implied by the dashed curve there appears to be a missing factor of 2 in the original analysis the second order relationship between the drag increment and the flap angle indicated by eq 24 is to be noted the moment increment is plotted in fig 4 c where it is observed that there is good agreement between the three analyses of the experimental data incidentally it would seem that the line fit of eq 3 to the data could be improved however this line fit is a compromise between ten sets of flap conditions for this set of tests it visibly overpredicts the data lastly the flap hinge moment is plotted in fig 4 d there seems to be a discrepancy between the original data represented by the thin symbols and the curve fit given by eq 4 the original data are too low by a factor of 2 the corrected data are plotted as the thick symbols and these are in accordance with the published linear curve fit comments made about fig 4 a and c with respect to the use of the speed dependent weighting factors apply to this subfigure as well 4 3 chen and fwu 1992 this source of flap data is limited to measurements of the lift nevertheless it does provide the useful ability to compare with some of the data of brown 1971 4 4 chen hsueh and fwu 1993 the scope of the experiments of chen and fwu 1992 was later expanded to include drag and moment as well as lift additionally the range of flap aspect ratios was increased 5 results 5 1 lift fig 5 a through e presents the increment in lift coefficient δ c l as a function of the flap deflection δ f each for a different flap chord the expected linear behavior of the flap is confirmed there is good consistency between the three sources of experimental data the theory developed in the current work provides an excellent prediction for λ f c f b equal to 0 1 and 0 15 however there is a small underprediction for λ f 0 2 in fig 5 c the underprediction increases further for values of 0 3 and 0 4 in fig 5 d and e the dependence of the lift on the flap aspect ratio proposed by macpherson 2012 is confirmed by both the experiments and the theory that is the lift is less for low aspect ratio flaps this matter is further explored in fig 5 f here the lift curve slope δ c l δ f is plotted as a function of the aspect ratio of both flaps a f as noted already the experiments and theory are in excellent agreement for values of a f greater than about 2 5 but the disparity increases for smaller values of the flap aspect ratio also plotted in this figure is the formula of brown 1971 namely eq 1 his formula is seen to be a good average value for a range of flap aspect ratios 5 2 drag we now consider the increase in drag in fig 6 as pointed out earlier and as specified by eq 24 the trim of the planing surface as well as the flap deflection influences the drag so there are two curves in fig 6 a and four curves in fig 6 b the experimental data points in fig 6 a exhibit some scatter and furthermore the data for the case of τ 4 are negative for two out of three points thus one must be careful about drawing conclusions regarding accuracy of the theory fig 6 b demonstrates that on the whole the theory does successful predict the dependence of the drag increment on both τ and δ f we clarify that in the case of the data sourced from brown 1971 there are two points for each value of δ f these correspond to two values of the wetted length to beam ratio c b of the planing surface these values are nominally 2 and 4 this illustrates the relative unimportance of this parameter this point was also demonstrated by the theory in the first five subfigures of fig 3 fig 6 c and d again show that the theory exhibits the proper trends however the predictions fall short of the experimental data for the high values of the flap chord the same shortfall behavior was seen for the lift in fig 5 finally we plot the two coefficients of eq 24 in fig 6 e and f the comparisons between theory and experiment are poor for example the theoretical prediction for δ c d 1 for the case of a f 10 in fig 6 e is high while the corresponding prediction for δ c d 2 in fig 6 f is low this is despite the relative good agreement demonstrated in fig 6 a this discrepancy can be explained by the established fact that root mean square regression fits of the type employed here are always problematic specifically one can substantially adjust the values of the various coefficients with little effect on the goodness of the curve fit to the data the horizontal dashed lines in fig 6 e and f are the two coefficients contained in eq 2 after including the abovementioned correcting factor of 2 this required correction was explained in connection with fig 4 b 5 3 moment the moment increment due to the action of the flap is plotted in the four parts of fig 7 it is disappointing that the theory underpredicts by around 60 it is not known why this should be so particularly for the cases when λ 0 1 and 0 2 for which lift and drag is well predicted by the theory it seems unlikely that the coding in the computer software is wrong because the calculation of all the four quantities of interest is identical except for the inclusion of the relevant lever arm or slope of the surface as the case may be 5 4 flap hinge moment the last physical quantity of interest is the increment in flap hinge moment which is shown in the two parts of fig 8 in this case the theory is in good agreement with the current theory for λ f 0 1 in fig 8 a however there is some discrepancy in fig 8 b in comparing these two parts of the figure one sees that the theory predicts a lower effectiveness of the flap as a hinge moment generator when the flap aspect ratio becomes less this is expected behavior in line with the well known influence of the aspect ratio of a lifting wing however the experimental data exhibit the reverse effect suggesting that they are in error 6 concluding remarks 6 1 current work the infinite froude number or aerodynamic lifting surface theory developed is a well behaved approach for computing the forces and moments three types of elements have been developed all based on a tent like pressure source panel but with different approaches to the implementation of the calculation of the field panel the numerical experiments illustrate that employing 80 panels longitudinally and 80 panels transversely through eqs 13 and 14 is sufficient to provide computations converged to about 0 6 for the lift and drag and about 2 for the moment this statement applies to a surface with a length to beam ratio of 2 a further comment on the validity of the infinite froude number theory is appropriate the four parts of fig 4 demonstrate that the method of averaging the data of brown 1971 over the large speed range is insignificant the speed range is typically 10 f b 2 50 this point may be observed by comparing the three sets of towing tank data so there is strong evidence that the froude number does not play a part the richardson extrapolation is very effective employing a mesh of 80 80 panels with corresponding coarser meshes reduces this error to what is visually zero on a graph 6 2 reliability of towing tank data there is concern about the reliability of the original processing of the towing tank data fig 4 b suggests that the final published flap drag data of brown 1971 need to be doubled in order to be consistent with his raw data this point is confirmed by the generally good agreement with the theory this point is also confirmed by the consistency of the corrected data with those of chen hsueh and fwu 1993 in fig 6 b the implication of this discovery is that the formulas published by savitsky and brown 1975 equation 5 and savitsky and brown 1976 equation 6 should be modified by the addition of a factor of 2 on the right hand side there is also much discrepancy in the data for the moment reference to fig 7 a and b illustrates the great degree of scatter in the data as well as the very large discrepancy between the two source of experimental data 6 3 reliability of computer software as an additional test for the reliability of the computer software we can consult the work of jacobs and pinkerton 1930 in that work a rectangular raf 30 symmetric airfoil with an aspect ratio of 7 2 was tested in a wind tunnel at two values of the chord reynolds number namely r n 0 356 1 0 6 and r n 6 70 1 0 6 the airfoil was fitted with a full span flap with two different aspect ratios the results for the integrated quantities of lift moment and hinge moment are summarized in table 2 some of the aerodynamic coefficients in the work of jacobs and pinkerton 1930 involve chord length rather than flap chord length they have been converted to the current notation additionally a factor of 1 2 has been introduced here to account for the current hydrodynamic case as already noted there is satisfactory agreement between the current theoretical calculations which are converged to within plotting accuracy and the theoretical calculations of jacobs and pinkerton 1930 listed in table 2 we remind that the current work applies to a flat plate whereas the work of jacobs and pinkerton 1930 applies to a foil with a thickness distribution finally table 2 illustrates that the experimental data for the coefficients all lie below the theoretical values this is in line with the well known effects of viscosity which has been ignored in the theoretical work we can conclude that the theoretical lines for the moment plotted in fig 7 are quite reasonable and that the experimental results are inexplicably too high in value 6 4 future work the principal deficiency of this research is the lack of reliable experimental data it is therefore recommended that the experimental work on the performance of transom stern flaps be revisited using modern instrumentation it will be possible to obtain much more accurate and reliable data for the increment in the forces and moments produced by these flaps the question of part span flaps was studied in the towing tank by brown 1971 the corresponding data were listed for three out of the 10 configurations unfortunately some of that data display the wrong tendencies in the sense that part span flaps with a lower aspect ratio appear to generate greater dimensionless forces therefore these data were excluded from the present study it is therefore recommended that part span flaps are included in future experimental work such configurations can be analyzed by the current theory if readers of this paper are aware of such flap data and can assist i would be very appreciative and would happily extend the analysis which i have presented here

angle degrees 1 introduction 1 1 background research flaps are often fitted to the stern of planing boats in order to improve the trim of the vessel when under way generally speaking such craft suffer from excessive bow up trim and therefore it is usual to adjust the flaps so that they possess a positive angle of attack this provides an upward force at the stern which corrects reduces the excessive trim of the boat the classic and original experimental research on the effectiveness of trim flaps was performed by brown 1971 his model prismatic boat was tested in a towing tank and the consequent forces and moments generated by the flaps were measured for an extensive set of conditions in which the trim angle τ the flap angle δ f and the beam froude number f b u g b were varied here u is the speed of the boat g is the acceleration due to gravity and b is the beam in his work the model had a constant beam and a constant deadrise angle β 1 0 a challenging feature of the work was to obtain data for the prescribed wetted length to beam ratio λ l b brown 1971 collected data for the increase in lift δ l drag δ d moment δ m and the flap hinge moment δ h flap chord to vessel beam ratios of 0 1 and 0 2 were studied brown 1971 created straight line fits for the variation of flap induced lift coefficient versus the flap angle showing that the function is essentially independent of both the vessel trim angle and the wetted length in the current notation his formula is 1 δ c l δ l 1 2 ρ u 2 s f 0 046 δ f in which ρ is the water density s f c f b f is the area of both flaps c f is the flap chord and b f is the beam of both flaps next the additional drag coefficient associated with the flap was given by the formula 2 δ c d δ d 1 2 ρ u 2 s f 2 0 00024 τ δ f δ f the factor of 2 which has been introduced here in this paper in order to correct the original published equation will be discussed presently the additional moment coefficient on the boat due to the flap was given by the formula 3 δ c m δ m 1 2 ρ u 2 s f c f 0 0276 b c f δ f finally the additional flap hinge moment coefficient was approximated by the formula 4 δ c h δ h 1 2 ρ u 2 s f c f 0 0064 δ f these formulas were deemed to be applicable for the following range of relevant variables 0 c f l 0 10 0 δ f 1 5 0 τ 1 0 and 2 f b 7 many years later macpherson 2012 published a short note in which he showed that a better regression fit of the lift data could be derived by also accounting for the aspect ratio of both flaps a f using for example the correction formula developed by jones 1941 this correction considers that the relatively low aspect ratio of a flap will reduce its effectiveness in this approach one assumes that the influence of aspect ratio for a flap attached to the trailing edge of a lifting surface is identical to that for a simple planar wing somewhat later chen and fwu 1992 performed their own experiments in a similar manner their measured data were limited to the increase in lift flap chord to vessel beam ratios of 0 15 and 0 3 were studied a more extensive set of tests was conducted by chen hsueh and fwu 1993 they measured the flap induced increases in lift drag and moment flap chord to vessel beam ratios of 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 were studied these three sets of experimental data are summarized in table 1 where it is noted that there is some overlap between the data sets this permits one to partly verify the consistency of the data 1 2 practical applications practical application of transom flaps to realistically shaped vessels has been investigated by many researchers in these applications the model has often been fitted with stern wedges which are located immediately forward of the transom however the influence of such wedges is essentially identical to that of flaps located immediately behind the transom an early example of such studies is that of cole and millward 1973 in which the effect of wedges on the ship model resistance was measured in a towing tank millward 1976 considered the action of wedges on two different hulls similarly wang 1980 measured the forces due to flaps appended to planing hulls grigoropoulos and loukakis 1996 also fitted wedges to planing hulls and measured their effect on the resistance of the model another and more recent publication is that of yaakob shamsuddin and king 2004 who demonstrated that the installation of flaps produced a reduction in the resistance of planing hulls 1 3 current research the fact that the data for the increment in lift moment and flap hinge moment exhibit a linear behavior with respect to the flap deflection angle suggests that a simple and traditional linear theory should be applicable the relatively small practical angles of vessel trim and flap angle also support this concept a crucial additional point is that the froude number based on flap chord is very high this fact implies that an infinite froude number theory should provide realistic results it is well established that in such a situation the flow disturbance generated by the boat is equivalent to that of an equivalent vortex distribution as used to model the action of an aerodynamic lifting surface 2 theory 2 1 planar distribution of vorticity we start the analysis by defining the coordinate system in which the longitudinal axis x is directed forward the y axis is directed to port and the z axis is directed upward the axis system moves forward with the lifting surface with a speed u fig 1 a shows the discretization of vorticity along the centerline of the lifting surface using vorticity elements which have a triangular variation in strength both longitudinally x and transversely y thus being of a tent like form fig 1 b illustrates an assembly of such elements to model the action of the lifting surface the elements overlap in a suitable manner so that the final variation in vorticity is separately piecewise linear in x and y the bases of the elements are rectangular with dimension δ x j δ y these bases are not depicted because it would overly complicate the illustration while the current analysis utilizes an effectively continuous distribution of vorticity it has been traditional to employ a simpler system of discrete horseshoe vortices as illustrated by ashley and landahl 1965 page 136 figure 7 4 the use of such simple vortex lattice systems has been explained by many researchers including margason and lamar 1971 and liu and ikehata 1994 2 2 tent function element we now quote the formula for a horseshoe vortex of strength γ and whose axis is aligned with the y axis of the coordinate system the lateral extent of the vortex filament is between y s and y s the two longitudinal x wise parts of the vortex then extend infinitely far downstream the formula for the vertical component of the velocity induced by this vortex can be quoted from ashley and landahl 1965 page 87 equation 5 35 it is 5 w x y 0 γ 4 π 1 y s 1 x 2 y s 2 x 1 y s 1 x 2 y s 2 x the algebra is simplified by the fact that one only needs to evaluate the induced velocity on the surface itself namely z 0 the distribution of vorticity inside the tent element is defined by the formula 6 γ x y γ i 1 x δ x j 1 y δ y in which the source element spacing is δ x j longitudinally and δ y transversely integration of eq 5 using eq 6 with respect to the longitudinal source variation x first requires replacing x by x x in which x is the field coordinate and x is the source coordinate similarly one then replaces y by y y and then integrates transversely with respect to y after considerable algebra the final result for the downwash induced by the tent element is 7 w x y 0 1 16 π δ x j δ y k 1 1 t k l 1 1 t l f x k δ x j y l δ y where the corner influence function is defined as 8 f x y 5 x x 2 y 2 2 x 2 y 2 ln x x 2 y 2 4 x y ln y x 2 y 2 4 x y ln x 1 2 y 2 it can be demonstrated that the last term placed within the delimiters does not contribute to the summation in eq 7 this superfluous term can be removed from the formula finally the integration weights in eq 7 are 9 t k 1 for k 1 2 for k 0 1 for k 1 previous research using the boundary element method has demonstrated that more accurate results can be achieved by integrating the influence function in this case eq 8 with respect to the field variable that is one considers a field panel rather than a field point this concept is referred to as the galerkin method examples of the superiority of this approach include those of barnell 1984 section 4 2 and doctors 1986 for simplicity we shall assume that the spacing of the panels is uniform in the transverse direction then integrating eq 8 with respect to y over the field panel as was done for the source panel gives the result 10 w x y 0 1 576 π δ x j δ y 3 k 1 1 t k l 2 2 u l f x k δ x j y l δ y where the new influence function is now defined as 11 f x y 12 x y x 2 2 y 2 ln y x 2 y 2 3 y 2 12 x 2 y 2 ln x x 2 y 2 x 2 x 2 47 y 2 x 2 y 2 y 2 54 x 2 7 4 y 2 and the new weights are 12 u l 1 for l 2 4 for l 1 6 for l 0 4 for l 1 1 for l 2 a further refinement in the method naturally follows one can also apply the galerkin concept longitudinally a question arises as to whether one can consider the longitudinal variation to be tent like however as the field point will be chosen to be at the center of the field panel it is deemed that the best that one can achieve is to effect the longitudinal field integration assuming a constant weighting function the final result after some tedious algebra is 13 w x y 0 1 2880 π δ x i δ x j δ y 3 k 1 1 t k l 2 2 u l m 1 2 1 2 v m f x k δ x j m δ x i y l δ y where the third version of the influence function is now given as 14 f x y 15 x y 2 4 x 2 y 2 ln x x 2 y 2 15 y x 2 4 y 2 x 2 ln y x 2 y 2 2 x 4 94 x 2 y 2 2 y 4 x 2 y 2 15 4 x 4 y 30 x 2 y 3 105 4 y 5 and the new weights are 15 v m 1 for m 1 2 1 for m 1 2 2 3 assembly of elements the kinematic condition is applied at the center of the field panels as indicated in fig 1 b in the case of a field point using eq 8 or eq 11 this is interpreted as being located at an offset δ x i 2 behind the nominal coordinate in the case of a field panel using the galerkin technique and employing eq 14 this is interpreted as being the half panel behind the nominal field coordinate in either implementation the purpose of the longitudinal asymmetry is to enforce the kutta condition at the trailing edge as explained by ashley and landahl 1965 page 57 section 2 11 the so called collocation points are depicted in fig 1 b we denote the slope at the i th field point as α i this slope is computed as 16 α i α ahead of flap α α f on the flap so the kinematic condition is stated as 17 j 1 n w i j γ j u α i for i 1 to n 2 4 forces and moments the lift is computed in the usual manner within the framework of linear theory so the disturbance induced by the surface is considered small and the usual approximations associated with this are made hence one can compute the following quantities the pressure difference p i between the lower and the upper surface lift l drag d moment m and flap hinge moment h 18 p i ρ u γ i 19 l i 1 n p i δ x i δ y 20 d i 1 n p i δ x i δ y α i 21 m i 1 n p i δ x i δ y x i 22 h i 1 n p i δ x i δ y x f i 3 discretization convergence tests 3 1 elliptic wing our first test of the theory and the numerical approximation is the classic planar elliptic wing this problem was solved analytically by hauptman and miloh 1986a equations 65a and 65b a small typographical error in their lift equation has been corrected by hauptman and miloh 1986b the complete elliptic integral of the second kind e here is the same as that defined by abramowitz and stegun 1972 chapter 17 equation 17 3 3 for the case when the aspect ratio a s 2 s is less than unity the lift and the nose up moment coefficients are computed by the following sequence of formulas k π a 4 h 1 k 2 a k h ln 1 h k b 1 k a e 2 h 2 c l α 4 k 1 k a b c m α 4 k e h 2 3 b for the case when the aspect ratio is greater than unity the two coefficients are calculated as follows k 4 π a h 1 k 2 a k sin 1 h h b k a e 2 h 2 c l α 4 a b c m α 4 e h 2 3 b the computer software based on the above methodology has been tested in the first place on the classic flat elliptic lifting surface the results for the lift coefficient are presented in fig 2 a and for the moment coefficient in fig 2 b the results are plotted as a function of the aspect ratio a the most refined of the three types of panels employs eqs 13 and 14 this is indicated by the panel type of gal x y the straightforward numerical results relate to two different meshes as annotated on the plots specifically these are meshes of n x n y 14 14 panels and 20 20 panels the third set of results is a richardson extrapolation based on the formula 23 q a b n c where q is the quantity of interest and n n x n y is the number of panels the three constants in eq 23 can be determined by executing the prediction software for three different discretizations or meshes a series of tests using the software has demonstrated that the order of error for quantities such as the lift and drag is typically c 1 surprisingly this number is almost independent of the choice of panel type described in section 2 2 in fig 2 we have applied the extrapolation utilizing the coarse meshes of 14 14 and 20 20 as well as the finer mesh of 40 40 panels it is demonstrated here that there is near perfect agreement between the extrapolated numerical data and the analytic theory of hauptman and miloh 1986a the typical errors associated with the discretization can be assessed by a study of the two parts of fig 2 timing of the execution has also been performed on the software for the finest panelizations referred to here the vast part of the execution time relates to the inversion of the matrix associated with the set of equations expressed by eq 17 as an example the case of 80 80 panels 6400 panels considered later requires about 375 s on a macbook computer equipped with a 2 7 ghz intel core i7 processor 3 2 planing surface with flaps the second set of computations applies directly to the case of interest in the current research this is a flat rectangular surface set at an angle τ fitted with a trailing flap set at an angle of deflection δ f there are two differences in the calculations from the aerodynamic case just considered firstly in the aerodynamic case we have used radians for the angle of attack but in the hydrodynamic planing case we will use degrees for the trim angle secondly the hydrodynamic forces act only on the under surface this introduces a factor of 1 2 into the calculation of the forces the first five parts of fig 3 provide a thorough test for the required discretization of the surface firstly fig 3 a shows the variation of the lift coefficient with respect to the aspect ratio of both flaps a f b f c f b c f using five different discretizations or approaches the first four approaches apply to a planing surface with the same aspect ratio a 1 2 this aspect ratio is typical of most of the available experimental data the minor differences between the results demonstrate that applying the richardson extrapolation based on a discretization of 80 80 yields convergent results the fifth and last curve applies to a different planing surface aspect ratio of 1 4 the fact that the lift behavior is visually identical to that for the shorter surface with an aspect ratio of 1 2 illustrates that this parameter is irrelevant and that the lift enhancement provided by the flap is a near field fluid phenomenon it is emphasized that an advantage of the linearized approach is that one only needs to execute the software for say a unit value of the flap angle δ f this result may be used to infer the performance at other flap angles furthermore the result for the lift increment is independent of the planing angle τ the increased drag experienced by a flapped planing plate is the subject of fig 3 b and c while the linear theory predicts that the lift increases proportionately with the flap angle the increase in drag is instead given by the expressions 24 δ c d δ c d 1 δ c d 2 25 δ c d 1 δ f τ 26 δ c d 2 δ f 2 once again the linear theory allows one to compute the mixed drag coefficient δ c d 1 and the quadratic drag coefficient δ c d 2 by considering just one trim angle and just one flap angle in the numerical implementation the first term in eq 24 quantifies the interaction between the planing surface and the flap this interaction is the sum of two contributions the first contribution is the influence of the flap on the pressure distribution under the entire planing surface the second contribution is the influence of the planing surface on the pressure distribution under the deflected flap the second term in eq 24 results from the influence of the flap generated pressure on the flap itself as for the case of the lift increment in fig 3 b and c the discussion regarding a suitable discretization of the surface applies to the case of the drag increment the moment increment due to the action of the flap is considered in fig 3 d in contrast to the discussion of lift and drag the data in this subfigure indicate a minor influence of the chord length of the planing surface the last test of convergence with respect to the paneling or discretization in fig 3 e again shows well behaved convergence behavior this time for the flap hinge moment finally in fig 3 f we summarize the converged results for the dimensionless coefficients from the previous five subfigures in order to plot these five disparate coefficients on the one graph some of the them have been multiplied by a suitable numerical factor as indicated in the legend this single graph epitomizes the behavior of a full width flap fitted to a planing surface the graph is suitable for predicting flap performance on any planing boat a clear and anticipated characteristic of the results is that the increment in lift force due to the activation of the flap together with the associated drag and the moments increases with the flap aspect ratio 4 experimental data 4 1 geometry of the planing surface the three quoted experiments all were performed on prismatic planing surfaces being prismatic means that the wetted length at the centerline is somewhat greater than the wetted length at the chine thus the wetted surface in plan view is similar to that illustrated in fig 1 b however the calculations were effected on a rectangular shape using the average wetted length the reason for this decision is that the simple theory applies strictly only to the planar case no deadrise angle where the wetted surface is indeed essentially rectangular incidentally the shape of the leading edge of the planing surface has almost no effect on the behavior of the flap this point is demonstrated by the fact that changing the aspect ratio a from 0 5 to 0 25 in the first five parts of fig 3 produces no visually discernible effect a further point is that the dimensions of the wetted surface include the flap itself this is a logical choice because one wishes the influence of the flap its lift drag and moment to be zero when the flap deflection is zero 4 2 brown 1971 the original and most comprehensive set of data on flap behavior was published by brown 1971 it is summarized in table 1 he tested a total of 10 flap configurations of which seven relates to flaps that spanned the full width of the planing surface the lift drag moment and hinge moment from the first of these 10 tests are plotted in fig 4 the partly processed data appear in brown 1971 tables 1 and 2 these tables list the dependence of the various beam based dimensionless coefficients on the beam froude number to obtain the data in the current format one must weight the coefficients with respect to the speed and then convert the force and moment coefficients using the definitions employed by brown 1971 as well as the corresponding definitions used in the present work thus the first set of symbols in fig 4 a was determined in the present work by weighting the data with factors of f b 2 as annotated in the plot the second set of data was determined by using weights of 1 as shown there is little difference between these two sets of data illustrating that the original coefficients varied very little with speed finally the third set of symbols is replotted from the original data in brown 1971 table 3 who used the f b 2 weighting the extremely close agreement between the three sets of experimental points confirms our interpretation of this classic publication the continuous curve shown in fig 4 a is simply eq 1 the extremely linear relationship between the lift increment and the flap deflection angle is confirmed we now consider the corresponding drag data in fig 4 b where there is a discrepancy between the original analysis and the present re analysis of the data published by brown 1971 table 3 as implied by the dashed curve there appears to be a missing factor of 2 in the original analysis the second order relationship between the drag increment and the flap angle indicated by eq 24 is to be noted the moment increment is plotted in fig 4 c where it is observed that there is good agreement between the three analyses of the experimental data incidentally it would seem that the line fit of eq 3 to the data could be improved however this line fit is a compromise between ten sets of flap conditions for this set of tests it visibly overpredicts the data lastly the flap hinge moment is plotted in fig 4 d there seems to be a discrepancy between the original data represented by the thin symbols and the curve fit given by eq 4 the original data are too low by a factor of 2 the corrected data are plotted as the thick symbols and these are in accordance with the published linear curve fit comments made about fig 4 a and c with respect to the use of the speed dependent weighting factors apply to this subfigure as well 4 3 chen and fwu 1992 this source of flap data is limited to measurements of the lift nevertheless it does provide the useful ability to compare with some of the data of brown 1971 4 4 chen hsueh and fwu 1993 the scope of the experiments of chen and fwu 1992 was later expanded to include drag and moment as well as lift additionally the range of flap aspect ratios was increased 5 results 5 1 lift fig 5 a through e presents the increment in lift coefficient δ c l as a function of the flap deflection δ f each for a different flap chord the expected linear behavior of the flap is confirmed there is good consistency between the three sources of experimental data the theory developed in the current work provides an excellent prediction for λ f c f b equal to 0 1 and 0 15 however there is a small underprediction for λ f 0 2 in fig 5 c the underprediction increases further for values of 0 3 and 0 4 in fig 5 d and e the dependence of the lift on the flap aspect ratio proposed by macpherson 2012 is confirmed by both the experiments and the theory that is the lift is less for low aspect ratio flaps this matter is further explored in fig 5 f here the lift curve slope δ c l δ f is plotted as a function of the aspect ratio of both flaps a f as noted already the experiments and theory are in excellent agreement for values of a f greater than about 2 5 but the disparity increases for smaller values of the flap aspect ratio also plotted in this figure is the formula of brown 1971 namely eq 1 his formula is seen to be a good average value for a range of flap aspect ratios 5 2 drag we now consider the increase in drag in fig 6 as pointed out earlier and as specified by eq 24 the trim of the planing surface as well as the flap deflection influences the drag so there are two curves in fig 6 a and four curves in fig 6 b the experimental data points in fig 6 a exhibit some scatter and furthermore the data for the case of τ 4 are negative for two out of three points thus one must be careful about drawing conclusions regarding accuracy of the theory fig 6 b demonstrates that on the whole the theory does successful predict the dependence of the drag increment on both τ and δ f we clarify that in the case of the data sourced from brown 1971 there are two points for each value of δ f these correspond to two values of the wetted length to beam ratio c b of the planing surface these values are nominally 2 and 4 this illustrates the relative unimportance of this parameter this point was also demonstrated by the theory in the first five subfigures of fig 3 fig 6 c and d again show that the theory exhibits the proper trends however the predictions fall short of the experimental data for the high values of the flap chord the same shortfall behavior was seen for the lift in fig 5 finally we plot the two coefficients of eq 24 in fig 6 e and f the comparisons between theory and experiment are poor for example the theoretical prediction for δ c d 1 for the case of a f 10 in fig 6 e is high while the corresponding prediction for δ c d 2 in fig 6 f is low this is despite the relative good agreement demonstrated in fig 6 a this discrepancy can be explained by the established fact that root mean square regression fits of the type employed here are always problematic specifically one can substantially adjust the values of the various coefficients with little effect on the goodness of the curve fit to the data the horizontal dashed lines in fig 6 e and f are the two coefficients contained in eq 2 after including the abovementioned correcting factor of 2 this required correction was explained in connection with fig 4 b 5 3 moment the moment increment due to the action of the flap is plotted in the four parts of fig 7 it is disappointing that the theory underpredicts by around 60 it is not known why this should be so particularly for the cases when λ 0 1 and 0 2 for which lift and drag is well predicted by the theory it seems unlikely that the coding in the computer software is wrong because the calculation of all the four quantities of interest is identical except for the inclusion of the relevant lever arm or slope of the surface as the case may be 5 4 flap hinge moment the last physical quantity of interest is the increment in flap hinge moment which is shown in the two parts of fig 8 in this case the theory is in good agreement with the current theory for λ f 0 1 in fig 8 a however there is some discrepancy in fig 8 b in comparing these two parts of the figure one sees that the theory predicts a lower effectiveness of the flap as a hinge moment generator when the flap aspect ratio becomes less this is expected behavior in line with the well known influence of the aspect ratio of a lifting wing however the experimental data exhibit the reverse effect suggesting that they are in error 6 concluding remarks 6 1 current work the infinite froude number or aerodynamic lifting surface theory developed is a well behaved approach for computing the forces and moments three types of elements have been developed all based on a tent like pressure source panel but with different approaches to the implementation of the calculation of the field panel the numerical experiments illustrate that employing 80 panels longitudinally and 80 panels transversely through eqs 13 and 14 is sufficient to provide computations converged to about 0 6 for the lift and drag and about 2 for the moment this statement applies to a surface with a length to beam ratio of 2 a further comment on the validity of the infinite froude number theory is appropriate the four parts of fig 4 demonstrate that the method of averaging the data of brown 1971 over the large speed range is insignificant the speed range is typically 10 f b 2 50 this point may be observed by comparing the three sets of towing tank data so there is strong evidence that the froude number does not play a part the richardson extrapolation is very effective employing a mesh of 80 80 panels with corresponding coarser meshes reduces this error to what is visually zero on a graph 6 2 reliability of towing tank data there is concern about the reliability of the original processing of the towing tank data fig 4 b suggests that the final published flap drag data of brown 1971 need to be doubled in order to be consistent with his raw data this point is confirmed by the generally good agreement with the theory this point is also confirmed by the consistency of the corrected data with those of chen hsueh and fwu 1993 in fig 6 b the implication of this discovery is that the formulas published by savitsky and brown 1975 equation 5 and savitsky and brown 1976 equation 6 should be modified by the addition of a factor of 2 on the right hand side there is also much discrepancy in the data for the moment reference to fig 7 a and b illustrates the great degree of scatter in the data as well as the very large discrepancy between the two source of experimental data 6 3 reliability of computer software as an additional test for the reliability of the computer software we can consult the work of jacobs and pinkerton 1930 in that work a rectangular raf 30 symmetric airfoil with an aspect ratio of 7 2 was tested in a wind tunnel at two values of the chord reynolds number namely r n 0 356 1 0 6 and r n 6 70 1 0 6 the airfoil was fitted with a full span flap with two different aspect ratios the results for the integrated quantities of lift moment and hinge moment are summarized in table 2 some of the aerodynamic coefficients in the work of jacobs and pinkerton 1930 involve chord length rather than flap chord length they have been converted to the current notation additionally a factor of 1 2 has been introduced here to account for the current hydrodynamic case as already noted there is satisfactory agreement between the current theoretical calculations which are converged to within plotting accuracy and the theoretical calculations of jacobs and pinkerton 1930 listed in table 2 we remind that the current work applies to a flat plate whereas the work of jacobs and pinkerton 1930 applies to a foil with a thickness distribution finally table 2 illustrates that the experimental data for the coefficients all lie below the theoretical values this is in line with the well known effects of viscosity which has been ignored in the theoretical work we can conclude that the theoretical lines for the moment plotted in fig 7 are quite reasonable and that the experimental results are inexplicably too high in value 6 4 future work the principal deficiency of this research is the lack of reliable experimental data it is therefore recommended that the experimental work on the performance of transom stern flaps be revisited using modern instrumentation it will be possible to obtain much more accurate and reliable data for the increment in the forces and moments produced by these flaps the question of part span flaps was studied in the towing tank by brown 1971 the corresponding data were listed for three out of the 10 configurations unfortunately some of that data display the wrong tendencies in the sense that part span flaps with a lower aspect ratio appear to generate greater dimensionless forces therefore these data were excluded from the present study it is therefore recommended that part span flaps are included in future experimental work such configurations can be analyzed by the current theory if readers of this paper are aware of such flap data and can assist i would be very appreciative and would happily extend the analysis which i have presented here

shortest path to the target however in the case where the target is too far from the usv it may not be feasible to generate a shortest path to the target in real time moreover an usv with cheap sensors cannot locate the target position accurately due to sensor measurement noise however a star or dijkstra algorithms do not use filtering ristic et al 2004a to improve the target estimation therefore we require filtering ristic et al 2004a for tracking a maneuvering target using an usv with cheap sensors in this paper we introduce usv motion controllers to improve the target estimation accuracy considering the situation in which the usv is equipped with cheap sensors providing coarse range bearing measurements of an ut to derive the optimal motion controllers for the usv the usv needs to estimate the maneuvering ut s motion information location velocity and acceleration based on coarse range bearing measurements many methods wang et al 2011 ristic and arulampalam 2003 bi and ren 2008 yang et al 2016 ristic et al 2004b quan et al 2014 wan et al 2010 liang qun et al 2015 kim and hong 2004 pignol et al 2010 bar shalom and fortmann 1988 rong li and jilkov 2005 were developed for tracking a maneuvering ut we utilize a maneuvering ut tracking method in bar shalom and fortmann 1988 to estimate the maneuvering ut s motion information in real time the tracking method in bar shalom and fortmann 1988 utilizes a linear process model in the cartesian coordinates since both the process model and the measurement model are linear in the cartesian coordinates the usv motion controllers presented in this paper utilizes the linear kalman filter lkf ristic et al 2004b which is optimal for a linear system by applying the lkf to coarse range bearing measurements the usv can estimate the relative location of the ut in real time under the proposed approach we predict the feasible position of the usv within a finite time steps in the future the feasible future position of the usv is discretized as a tree structure such that each node in the tree presents the feasible future position of the usv the tree structure is built in real time considering the maximum turn rate of the usv then the usv tracks an edge of the tree which does not intersect an obstacle in this way our collision avoidance approach considers the limited turn rate of the usv in practice standard deviation in bearing noise changes according to the change in ship relative bearing for example the ut may not be detected by the usv if the ut is behind the usv as the usv gets closer to the ut the usv s sensing accuracy improves in general also in the case where the usv is too far from the ut communication link between the usv and the ut may be lost hence the usv needs to get closer to the ut while estimating the ut s location as far as we know the proposed motion controllers are unique in achieving following two goals simultaneously considering both the usv s maximum turn rate and its bearing standard deviation the usv approaches the ut while estimating the ut s location using coarse range bearing measurements avoid getting too close to obstacles the organization of this paper is as follows section 2 presents the preliminary information of the paper section 3 presents the optimal motion controllers section 4 presents matlab simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method section 5 provides conclusions 2 preliminary information 2 1 graph theory this subsection discusses several definitions in graph theory a graph g is a set g v g e g in which v g is the vertex set and e g is a set of pairs of vertices a tree graph is a graph without cycles in the tree one vertex is set as the root since a tree has no cycles a path from the root to any vertex in the tree is unique in a rooted tree the depth of a vertex v is the number of edges in the path from the root to v in a rooted tree a child of a vertex v is a vertex say c v satisfying that the path from the root to c v contains v and that v is adjacent to c v 2 2 the linear models for tracking a maneuvering ut this subsection provides the process model and the measurement model for tracking a maneuvering ut we first present the process model for a maneuvering ut which was presented in bar shalom and fortmann 1988 this paper considers discrete time systems let t indicate the sample interval of the discrete time systems let x k t y k t indicate the ut s 2 d location in the x y plane at sample index k let x k t y k t t indicate the ut s 2 d velocity at sample index k in addition let x k t y k t t indicate the ut s 2 d acceleration at sample index k let x k x k t x k t x k t y k t y k t y k t t indicate the state vector presenting the ut state the process model is 1 x k 1 f x k w k in which w k is the process noise with following distribution w k n 0 q k here n α β is the symbol for gaussian distribution with mean α and covariance β moreover we utilize 2 f m f 0 0 m f here 3 m f 1 t a m t 1 e a m t a m 2 0 1 1 e a m t a m 2 0 0 e a m t the covariance for process noise is 4 q k 2 a m σ m 2 m q 0 0 m q here we utilize 5 m q t 5 20 t 4 8 t 3 6 t 4 8 t 3 6 t 2 2 t 3 6 t 2 2 t a m and σ m in eq 4 are tuning parameters for tracking a maneuvering ut in order to estimate the ut s 2 d location more accurately one can tune both a m and σ m we next present the measurement model of the paper suppose that the usv measures the 2 d location in the x y plane of the ut let z k indicate the measurement of the ut at sample index k then the measurement model is 6 z k h x k v k in which h is 7 h 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 in addition v k is the measurement noise with following properties v k n 0 r k how to calculate z k and r k at every sample index k is presented in section 2 4 note that both the process model 1 and the measurement model 6 are linear this implies that the considered system is linear 2 3 lkf the authors of bar shalom and fortmann 1988 utilized the lkf ristic et al 2004b to track a maneuvering ut the lkf is used in this paper since the lkf is optimal for linear systems which are handled in this paper ristic et al 2004b the lkf can be utilized to calculate the mean and the covariance of x k at every sample index k ristic et al 2004b let x ˆ k k indicate the mean of x k at every sample index k the lkf is used to calculate x ˆ k k and its covariance uncertainty p k k at every sample index k let d k 1 z 1 z 2 z k 1 suppose that both the predictive density p x k d k 1 and the likelihood density p z k d k 1 have gaussian distribution then the posterior density p x k d k is gaussian 2 3 1 prediction consider the case where the current sample index is k one predicts x ˆ k k 1 and its covariance p k k 1 as follows 8 x ˆ k k 1 f x ˆ k 1 k 1 9 p k k 1 f p k 1 k 1 f t q k 1 2 3 2 measurement update the kalman gain is set as 10 k k p k k 1 h t h p k k 1 h t r k 1 one updates both state vector and its covariance as 11 x ˆ k k x ˆ k k 1 k k z k h x ˆ k k 1 12 p k k i k k h p k k 1 let x ˆ k k indicate the estimate of x k one can utilize the lkf in section 2 3 to calculate x ˆ k k at every sample index k ristic et al 2004b by merging eq 9 and eq 12 one gets 13 p k k i k k h f p k 1 k 1 f t q k 1 where k k appears in eq 10 using matrix inversion lemma eq 10 and eq 13 the recursive update of the covariance matrix is derived as 14 p k k f p k 1 k 1 f t q k 1 1 h t r k 1 h 1 we omit the detailed process of deriving eq 14 due to page limits see that no measurements are used in eq 14 thus eq 14 can be calculated off line without using any measurements 2 4 usv models 2 4 1 motion model of the usv let r k o x k o y k o 0 indicate the vector presenting the global coordinate of the usv at sample index k the third term in r k o is zero since the usv moves on the sea surface and its depth is zero we present the motion model of the usv this paper considers an usv with a constant speed let v k o denote the usv s forward speed at sample index k we use a unicycle model zhang et al 2013 which was validated through field tests using surface vehicles bae et al 2019 jo et al 2019 a unicycle model is used to control an usv with two actuators on both side of the usv bae et al 2019 jo et al 2019 this unicycle model is suitable for a highly maneuvering usv let θ k denote the heading angle of the usv with respect to the x axis at sample index k then we have 15 x k 1 o x k o v k o t cos θ k y k 1 o y k o v k o t sin θ k θ k 1 θ k t w k here w k is the angular velocity of the usv which can be generated by the difference of two actuators on both side of the usv bae et al 2019 jo et al 2019 let u k denote the 2d unit vector presenting the usv s heading direction at sample index k using 15 we get 16 u k cos θ k sin θ k 0 then using 15 we derive the simplified motion model of the usv as 17 r k 1 o r k o t v k o u k at each sample index k u k is set as command for the heading direction of the usv once the heading command u k is set then the corresponding angle command is 18 θ k a t a n 2 u k 2 u k 1 here 16 is used and c o l n denotes the n th element in a column vector col considering the maximum turn rate of the usv we have the following acceleration constraints 19 a c o s u k u k 1 a m a x t here a m a x is the maximum turn rate of the usv 2 4 2 measurement model of the usv we present how to calculate z k and r k in eq 6 at every sample index k let r k t x k t y k t z k t indicate the vector presenting the ut s location at sample index k here z k t is the depth of the ut at sample index k let r k t p x k t y k t 0 indicate the vector presenting the projection of the ut r k t onto the sea surface at sample index k the usv measures the bearing and range of the ut also the ut sends its depth information to the usv at each sample index let b k indicate the bearing measurement of the ut suppose that the noise in b k has a gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation b r g s i e we use 20 b k tan 1 r 2 r 1 n k here r r k t r k o and n k has a gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation b r g s in addition let r k indicate the range measurement of the auv at sample index k suppose that the noise in r k has a gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation r n g s i e we use 21 r k r m k here m k has a gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation r n g s this implies that 22 v a r r k r n g s 2 let d k indicate the depth of the ut at sample index k since the ut s depth can be measured rather accurately using depth sensors r k p r k t p r k o is estimated as 23 r k p r k 2 d k 2 using taylor series we get 24 v a r r k p r k p r k 2 v a r r k furthermore eqs 22 24 lead to 25 v a r r k p r n g s 2 r k 2 r k 2 d k 2 let r k m indicate the relative location measurement which is calculated utilizing both eq 20 and eq 23 we get 26 r k m r k p cos b k r k p sin b k t then we calculate z k in eq 6 as 27 z k r k m r k o utilizing eq 27 we calculate r k in eq 6 as 28 r k v a r r k m here v a r r k m denotes the variance of r k m note that v a r r k o 0 since the usv s location is accessible recall v a r r k p appears in eq 25 utilizing eq 28 and the jacobian matrix of eq 26 we calculate 29 r k b d i a g v a r r k p b r g s 2 b t here d i a g a b c is the diagonal matrix with elements a b c in this order in addition b is the jacobian matrix which is 30 b r k p cos b k r k p r k p cos b k b k r k p sin b k r k p r k p sin b k b k 3 optimal motion controllers based on the ut state estimation 3 1 ut state estimation note that the ut s depth can be measured rather accurately using the depth sensors on the ut also the ut sends its depth information to the usv at each sample index this paper tackles the estimation of the ut s projection onto the sea surface in other words we present the estimation for r k t p x k t y k t 0 instead of r k t x k t y k t z k t recall that x ˆ k k 1 x ˆ k k 4 presents the estimation of r k t p x k t y k t 0 at each sample index k we update the ut estimate by running the lkf in section 2 3 then based on the ut estimate we perform optimal motion controls within a single sampling interval 3 2 optimal motion controllers at every sample index k one generates the ut estimate x ˆ k k p k k utilizing the lkf in section 2 3 using the ut estimate x ˆ k k p k k at every sample index k one predicts feasible paths for the usv within t m sample indexes in the future meanwhile one predicts the ut s location t m sample indexes in the future then one chooses the optimal path for the usv considering the following two aspects simultaneously 1 maximize the information gain of the ut 2 get closer to the ut while estimating the ut s location at every sample index the usv chooses one path among feasible paths and moves along the edge of the chosen path within a single sample interval after the usv moves along the chosen edge the usv calculates a new ut estimate by processing new bearing range measurements in this way our motion controllers at every sample index are determined based on the most recent ut estimate we first discuss how to anticipate the ut s location j sample indexes in the future here j 1 2 t m let x ˆ k j k 1 x ˆ k j k 4 indicate the ut s anticipated location after j sample indexes in the future note that x i indicates the i th element in a column vector x for this prediction we utilize 31 x ˆ k j k f j x ˆ k k recall that f is presented in 4 we next discuss how to anticipate the usv s feasible location j sample indexes in the future here j 1 2 t m considering the acceleration limit 19 of the usv a tree structure is built to anticipate the usv s future location j sample indexes forward in time at every sample index k one generates a tree structure rooted at the usv s current location r k o every vertex with depth d in the tree presents the anticipated usv location after d sample indexes in the future we say that a vertex expands if one generates a new child of the vertex let n d indicate the maximum number of children expanded from a single vertex a vertex expands by selecting a heading value and propagating the parameterized usv dynamics forward in that direction here feasible heading directions are discretized considering the maximum turn rate of the usv the tree is expanded in a breadth first manner in other words the tree expands uniformly outward from the usv s current location fig 1 illustrates the tree whose depth is 2 and n d 3 in this figure the root is at the usv s current location the order of expansion is illustrated on each arrow feasible heading directions are discretized as 20 0 20 degrees respectively this indicates that the maximum turn rate of the usv is 20 per unit sample interval each vertex say v with depth j has its associated ut estimate x ˆ k j k which is derived utilizing eq 31 in addition v stores p k j k v which is the covariance of x ˆ k j k as the usv reaches the vertex v we next discuss the procedure to calculate the covariance matrix at each vertex suppose that a vertex say v is associated to the ut estimate x ˆ k j k p k j k v then the ut estimate and its covariance are calculated at c v a child of v here c v has depth j 1 utilizing eq 14 one predicts the covariance matrix at c v as 32 p k j 1 k c v f p k j k v f t q k 1 r k j v r k j v r k j v 1 h 1 in eq 32 r k j v is the variance of measurement noise when the ut is at x ˆ k j k 1 x ˆ k j k 4 and the usv is at v eq 32 is independent of measurements thus can be simulated forward in time without using measurements suppose that a vertex say u has depth j in the tree let d ˆ u indicate the distance between the anticipated ut location x ˆ k j k 1 x ˆ k j k 4 and u 33 c o s t u w d t r p k j k u d ˆ u is stored as the cost of u eq 33 is set since one desires to find a path meeting the following two goals 1 maximize the information gain of the ut 2 get closer to the ut while estimating the ut s location in eq 33 w d is the weight of the first goal compared to the second goal the effect of changing w d is analyzed in section 4 there may be a case where the ut estimate at sample index k is not reliable this implies that t r p k k t h r e s where t h r e s 0 is a constant in the case where t r p k k t h r e s we use c o s t u d ˆ u instead of 33 this implies that the usv moves to decrease the relative distance to the ut while not using the predicted covariance matrix among all vertices in the tree we choose one vertex 34 u a r g m i n u c o s t u the edge along the path to u is chosen as the next traversal edge after the usv finishes traversing the chosen edge the usv calculates a new ut estimate by processing new bearing range measurements in this way our motion controllers at every sample index are based on the most recent ut estimate note that at every sample index the usv selects one path among feasible paths and tracks the edge of the chosen path within a single sample interval 3 2 1 consider both obstacles and the standard deviation in bearing noise we discuss a method to avoid the situation in which the usv is too close to obstacles once an obstacle is detected then the tree structure can be built such that it does not intersect the obstacle suppose that the tree generates a new vertex say v t f whose depth is t f here t f 1 2 t m we remove the vertex v t f if it satisfies one of following two conditions are met the relative distance between v t f and an obstacle boundary is shorter than s a f e d i s t here s a f e d i s t 0 is a constant in matlab simulations we use s a f e d i s t 500 meters v t f is inside an obstacle once a vertex is removed or the depth of a vertex reaches t m then we do not expand the vertex anymore every vertex keeps expanding until there is no vertex to expand anymore in this way the tree is built guaranteeing that the tree does not get too close to an obstacle fig 2 depicts both the usv and the estimated ut state fig 2 illustrates the situation in which t m 1 and n d 5 in the tree with depth 1 every vertex is generated considering the maximum turn rate of the usv an obstacle is depicted as a circle the dotted arrow is avoided since it results in entering the obstacle the current ut estimate is depicted in fig 2 the anticipated ut location after a single sample interval is depicted as the head of an arrow emanating from the estimated ut in fig 2 the angle formed by two dashed lines depicts the ship relative bearing of the anticipated ut location with respect to the anticipated usv location suppose that the usv can access a table representing the bearing standard deviation with respect to ship relative bearing the proposed motion controllers are developed based on the table presenting bearing standard deviation which changes according to the change in ship relative bearing recall that the anticipated covariance is calculated utilizing eq 32 in eq 32 r k j v is the measurement noise variance as the ut is located at x ˆ k j k 1 x ˆ k j k 4 and the usv is at v to calculate r k j v in eq 32 one can utilize the table representing the bearing standard deviation with respect to ship relative bearing 4 matlab simulations we run matlab simulations to verify the performance of the proposed method each scenario runs from 0 to 3000 s in eq 21 we use r n g s 100 meters see that range measurements are very coarse the table presenting the bearing noise b r g s is as follows if the ship relative bearing is bigger than 50 then the standard deviation of bearing noise is 100 if the ship relative bearing is between 30 and 50 then the standard deviation of bearing noise is 90 if the ship relative bearing is less than 30 then the standard deviation of bearing noise is 45 see that bearing measurements are very coarse the settings for ut state estimation are as follows we initialize x ˆ 0 0 as 35 x ˆ 0 0 r 0 sin b 0 r 0 o 1 0 2 1 r 0 cos b 0 r 0 o 2 0 2 1 here 0 2 1 is a zero matrix with size 2 by 1 in addition b 0 and r 0 indicate the measurements at sample index 0 p 0 0 is initialized as 36 p 0 0 d i a g δ 2 v m a x 2 a m a x 2 δ 2 v m a x 2 a m a x 2 here v m a x is the maximum speed of the ut which is assumed to be known a priori let a m a x denote the maximum acceleration of the ut which is assumed to be known a priori also δ represents the uncertainty in the initial position estimate in simulations we use v m a x 20 a m a x 1 and δ 100 in meters the simulation settings are as follows initially we set w d 10 2 we use t h r e s 10 5 a m 0 1 and σ m 0 1 in eq 4 the sampling interval is t 1 second in the tree we set n d 5 and t m 3 the maximum turn rate of the usv is 30 per second we set the speed of the usv as 10 m s the initial course of the usv is in the east direction we run m c 20 monte carlo simulations let e k j j 1 2 m c denote the ut s location estimate at sample index k utilizing the j th monte carlo simulation e k j e k is the error of the ut estimate at sample index k the following rmse is used 37 r m s e k j 1 m c e k j e k 2 m c we simulate the case where the communication between the ut and the usv is lost assume that the communication between the ut and the usv is lost if any of the following two conditions are met 1 the relative distance between the ut and the usv is longer than 20 km 2 the line of sight between the ut and the usv is blocked by an obstacle in the case where the communication is lost the ut decreases its depth gets closer to the sea surface in order to receive the communication signal of the usv as long as the communication link is established the ut maintains its depth to 10 m the ut freely maneuvers in underwater environments as long as the communication link is preserved in the matlab simulations we use two illustrative scenarios scenarios 1 and 2 4 1 scenario 1 fig 3 depicts the scenario 1 the ut starts from 20000 0 10 and it moves with speed 5 m s between sample index 0 and 500 the ut performs a coordinates turn with turn rate ω 0 5 degrees per second the ut s movement under the coordinates turn is 38 x k 1 f c x k here we use 39 f c 1 s w 0 0 c w 0 0 cos ω t 0 0 sin ω t 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 c w 0 1 s w 0 0 sin ω

case eq 39 is simplified to 40 f c 1 t 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 t 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 after the sample index 2000 the ut performs a coordinates turn with turn rate ω 0 1 degrees per second in fig 3 obstacle boundaries are depicted with red circles this figure considers one monte carlo simulation the path of the usv under the proposed controllers is depicted with magenta circles due to coarse range bearing measurements the trajectory of the usv is not smooth in addition the path of the ut is plotted with green asterisks considering one monte carlo simulation fig 4 a presents the change of the ut s depth as time elapses initially the communication between the ut and the usv is lost thus the ut changes its depth accordingly fig 4 b presents the distance between the ut and the usv as time elapses the usv approaches the ut as time elapses fig 5 depicts the rmse in the case where the optimal motion controllers are used useoptcontrol fig 5 also depicts the rmse in the case where the usv uses no motion controllers nooptcontrol recall that z k in 27 is the measured target position at time step k in the case where the usv uses no motion controllers the usv just moves towards z k with constant speed at each time step k the rmse without the motion controllers nooptcontrol is much larger than that under the proposed motion controllers useoptcontrol using the optimal motion controllers running one monte carlo simulation under matlab takes about 42 s in the case where the usv uses no motion controllers running one monte carlo simulation under matlab takes only 1 s 4 2 scenario 2 fig 6 depicts the scenario 2 the ut starts from 10000 2000 10 and it moves away from the usv with speed 5 m s between sample index 0 and 2000 the ut moves with a constant

proposed controllers due to coarse range bearing measurements the trajectory of the usv is not smooth in addition the path of the ut is plotted with green asterisks considering one monte carlo simulation fig 7 a presents the change of the ut s depth as time elapses initially the communication between the ut and the usv is lost thus the ut changes its depth accordingly fig 7 b presents the distance between the ut and the usv as time elapses the usv approaches the ut as time elapses fig 8 depicts the rmse in the case where the optimal motion controllers are used useoptcontrol fig 8 also depicts the rmse in the case where the usv uses no motion controllers nooptcontrol the rmse without the motion controllers nooptcontrol is much larger than that under the proposed motion controllers useoptcontrol using the optimal motion controllers running one monte carlo simulation under matlab takes about 40 s in the case where the usv uses no motion controllers running one monte carlo simulation under matlab takes only 1 s 4 3 discussions in simulations each scenario runs for 3000 s running one monte carlo simulation under matlab takes almost 40 s this implies that the proposed control is suitable for real time implementations in real time implementations it is desirable to use c programming rather than matlab c programming code can be optimized for real time implementations 5 conclusions this paper introduces optimal motion controllers of the usv so that the usv tracks the ut using coarse range bearing measurements in practice bearing standard deviation may vary as the

motion control underwater vehicle tracking unmanned surface vehicle coarse range bearing measurements 1 introduction this paper handles the situation in which an unmanned surface vehicle usv tracks a maneuvering underwater target ut here we consider an usv equipped with cheap sensors providing coarse range bearing measurements of a maneuvering ut this scenario can be utilized in various situations for instance a cheap usv can be used to follow a maneuvering unmanned underwater vehicle uuv to aid the localization of the uuv the authors of bahr et al 2009 chen et al 2017 allotta et al ridolfi liu et al 2014 xu et al 2019 presented cooperative localization cl of an uuv assisted by an usv which can utilize global positioning systems gps to localize itself any usv has its motion constraints such as the bounded turn rate as a method to improve the tracking effectiveness this paper introduces usv motion controllers under the motion constraint that the maximum turn rate of the usv is bounded above many papers exist on path planning of robots choset et al 2005 kim et al 2018 a new approach to all pai 2004 kuffner and lavalle 2011 karaman and frazzoli 2011 kim 2019 plonski et al 2013 in the literature many path planning algorithms choset et al 2005 kim et al 2018 a new approach to all pai 2004 divide the environment into multiple grid cells as the environment gets bigger the number of grid cells required to present the environment also increases the computational burden of these algorithms increases considerably as one increases grid sizes or environment complexity thus this paper considers an environment without grid cells in this paper we consider a scenario where the usv is deployed in environments with many obstacles in this case it is important to generate a path to the target while avoiding collision with obstacles a star or dijkstra algorithms were commonly used to generate a global path for the usv to reach its target point without colliding with obstacles chen et al 2019 singh et al 2018 the authors of singh et al 2018 extended the implementation of dijkstra algorithm in a space cluttered with static and moving obstacles a star or dijkstra algorithms fidnds a shortest path to the target however in the case where the target is too far from the usv it may not be feasible to generate a shortest path to the target in real time moreover an usv with cheap sensors cannot locate the target position accurately due to sensor measurement noise however a star or dijkstra algorithms do not use filtering ristic et al 2004a to improve the target estimation therefore we require filtering ristic et al 2004a for tracking a maneuvering target using an usv with cheap sensors in this paper we introduce usv motion controllers to improve the target estimation accuracy considering the situation in which the usv is equipped with cheap sensors providing coarse range bearing measurements of an ut to derive the optimal motion controllers for the usv the usv needs to estimate the maneuvering ut s motion information location velocity and acceleration based on coarse range bearing measurements many methods wang et al 2011 ristic and arulampalam 2003 bi and

for tracking a maneuvering ut we utilize a maneuvering ut tracking method in bar shalom and fortmann 1988 to estimate the maneuvering ut s motion information in real time the tracking method in bar shalom and fortmann 1988 utilizes a linear process model in the cartesian coordinates since both the process model and the measurement model are linear in the cartesian coordinates the usv motion controllers presented in this paper utilizes the linear kalman filter lkf ristic et al 2004b which is optimal for a linear system by applying the lkf to coarse range bearing measurements the usv can estimate the relative location of the ut in real time under the proposed approach we predict the feasible position of the usv within a finite time steps in the future the feasible future position of the usv is discretized as a tree structure such that each node in the tree presents the feasible future position of the usv the tree structure is built in real time considering the maximum turn rate of the usv then the usv tracks an edge of the tree which does not intersect an obstacle in this way our collision avoidance approach considers the limited turn rate of the usv in practice standard deviation in bearing noise changes according to the change in ship relative bearing for example the ut may not be detected by the usv if the ut is behind the usv as the usv gets closer to the ut the usv s sensing accuracy improves in general also in the case where the usv is too far from the ut communication link between the usv and the ut may be lost hence the usv needs to get closer to the ut while estimating the ut s location as far as we know the proposed motion controllers are unique in achieving following two goals simultaneously considering both the usv s maximum turn rate and its bearing standard deviation the usv approaches the ut while estimating the ut s location using coarse range bearing measurements avoid getting too close to obstacles the organization of this paper is

proposed method section 5 provides conclusions 2 preliminary information 2 1 graph theory this subsection discusses several definitions in graph theory a graph g is a set g v g e g in which v g is the vertex set and e g is a set of pairs of vertices a tree graph is a graph without cycles in the tree one vertex is set as the root since a tree has no cycles a path from the root to any vertex in the tree is unique in a rooted tree the depth of a vertex v is the number of edges in the path from the root to v in a rooted tree a child of a vertex v is a vertex say c v satisfying that the path from the root to c v contains v and that v is adjacent to c v 2 2 the linear models for tracking a maneuvering ut this subsection provides the process model and the measurement model for tracking a maneuvering ut we first present the process model for a maneuvering ut which was presented in bar shalom and fortmann 1988 this paper considers discrete time systems let t indicate the sample interval of the discrete time systems let x k t y k t indicate the ut s 2 d location in the x y plane at sample index k let x k t y k t t indicate the ut s 2 d velocity at sample index k in addition let x k t y k t t indicate the ut s 2 d acceleration at sample index k let x k x k t x k t x k t y k t y k t y k t t indicate the state vector presenting the ut state the process model is 1 x k 1 f x k w k in which w k is the process noise with following distribution w k n 0 q k here n α β is the symbol for gaussian distribution with mean α and covariance β moreover we utilize 2 f m f 0 0 m f here 3 m f 1 t a m t 1 e a m t a m 2 0 1 1 e a m t a m 2 0 0 e a m t the covariance for process noise is 4 q k 2 a m σ m 2 m q 0 0 m q here we utilize 5 m q t 5 20 t 4 8 t 3 6 t 4 8 t 3 6 t 2 2 t 3 6 t 2 2 t a m and σ m in eq 4 are tuning parameters for tracking a maneuvering ut in order to estimate the ut s 2 d location more accurately one can tune both a m and σ m we next present the measurement model of the paper suppose that the usv measures the 2 d location in the x y plane of the ut let z k indicate the measurement of the ut at sample index k then the measurement model is 6 z k h x k v k in which h is 7 h 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 in addition v k is the measurement noise with following properties v k n 0 r k how to calculate z k and r k at every sample index k is presented in section 2 4 note that both the process model 1 and the measurement model 6 are linear this implies that the considered system is linear 2 3 lkf the authors of bar shalom and fortmann 1988 utilized the lkf ristic et al 2004b to track a maneuvering ut the lkf is used in this paper since the lkf is optimal for linear systems which are handled in this paper ristic et al 2004b the lkf can be utilized to calculate the mean and the covariance of x k at every sample index k ristic et al 2004b let x ˆ k k indicate the mean of x k at every sample index k the lkf is used to calculate x ˆ k k and its covariance uncertainty p k k at every sample index k let d k 1 z 1 z 2 z k 1 suppose that both the predictive density p x k d k 1 and the likelihood density p z k d k 1 have gaussian distribution then the posterior density p x k d k is gaussian 2 3 1 prediction consider the case where the current sample index is k one predicts x ˆ k k 1 and its covariance p k k 1 as follows 8 x ˆ k k 1 f x ˆ k 1 k 1 9 p k k 1 f p k 1 k 1 f t q k 1 2 3 2 measurement update the kalman gain is set as 10 k k p k k 1 h t h p k k 1 h t r k 1 one updates both state vector and its covariance as 11 x ˆ k k x ˆ k k 1 k k z k h x ˆ k k 1 12 p k k i k k h p k k 1 let x ˆ k k indicate the estimate of x k one can utilize the lkf in section 2 3 to calculate x ˆ k k at every sample index k ristic et al 2004b by merging eq 9 and eq 12 one gets 13 p k k i k k h f p k 1 k 1 f t q k 1 where k k appears in eq 10 using matrix inversion lemma eq 10 and eq 13 the recursive update of the covariance matrix is derived as 14 p k k f p k 1 k 1 f t q k 1 1 h t r k 1 h 1 we omit the detailed process of deriving eq 14 due to page limits see that no measurements are used in eq 14 thus eq 14 can be calculated off line without using any measurements 2 4 usv models 2 4 1 motion model of the usv let r k o x k o y k o 0 indicate the vector presenting the global coordinate of the usv at sample index k the third term in r k o is zero since the usv moves on the sea surface and its depth is zero we present the motion model of the usv this paper considers an usv with a constant speed let v k o denote the usv s forward speed at sample index k we use a unicycle model zhang et al 2013 which was validated through field tests using surface vehicles bae et al 2019 jo et al 2019 a unicycle model is used to control an usv with two actuators on both side of the usv bae et al 2019 jo et al 2019 this unicycle model is suitable for a highly maneuvering usv let θ k denote the heading angle of the usv with respect to the x axis at sample index k then we have 15 x k 1 o x k o v k o t cos θ k y k 1 o y k o v k o t sin θ k θ k 1 θ k t w k here w k is the angular velocity of the usv which can be generated by the difference of two actuators on both side of the usv bae et al 2019 jo et al 2019 let u k denote the 2d unit vector presenting the usv s heading direction at sample index k using 15 we get 16 u k cos θ k sin θ k 0 then using 15 we derive the simplified motion model of the usv as 17 r k 1 o r k o t v k o u k at each sample index k u k is set as command for the heading direction of the usv once the heading command u k is set then the corresponding angle command is 18 θ k a t a n 2 u k 2 u k 1 here 16 is used and c o l n denotes the n th element in a column vector col considering the maximum turn rate of the usv we have the following acceleration constraints 19 a c o s u k u k 1 a m a x t here a m a x is the maximum turn rate of the usv 2 4 2 measurement model of the usv we present how to calculate z k and r k in eq 6 at every sample index k let r k t x k t y k t z k t indicate the vector presenting the ut s location at sample index k here z k t is the depth of the ut at sample index k let r k t p x k t y k t 0 indicate the vector presenting the projection of the ut r k t onto the sea surface at sample index k the usv measures the bearing and range of the ut also the ut sends its depth information to the usv at each sample index let b k indicate the bearing measurement of the ut suppose that the noise in b k has a gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation b r g s i e we use 20 b k tan 1 r 2 r 1 n k here r r k t r k o and n k has a gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation b r g s in addition let r k indicate the range measurement of the auv at sample index k suppose that the noise in r k has a gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation r n g s i e we use 21 r k r m k here m k has a gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation r n g s this implies that 22 v a r r k r n g s 2 let d k indicate the depth of the ut at sample index k since the ut s depth can be measured rather accurately using depth sensors r k p r k t p r k o is estimated as 23 r k p r k 2 d k 2 using taylor series we get 24 v a r r k p r k p r k 2 v a r r k furthermore eqs 22 24 lead to 25 v a r r k p r n g s 2 r k 2 r k 2 d k 2 let r k m indicate the relative location measurement which is calculated utilizing both eq 20 and eq 23 we get 26 r k m r k p cos b k r k p sin b k t then we calculate z k in eq 6 as 27 z k r k m r k o utilizing eq 27 we calculate r k in eq 6 as 28 r k v a r r k m here v a r r k m denotes the variance of r k m note that v a r r k o 0 since the usv s location is accessible recall v a r r k p appears in eq 25 utilizing eq 28 and the jacobian matrix of eq 26 we calculate 29 r k b d i a g v a r r k p b r g s 2 b t here d i a g a b c is the diagonal matrix with elements a b c in this order in addition b is the jacobian matrix which is 30 b r k p cos b k r k p r k p cos b k b k r k p sin b k r k p r k p sin b k b k 3 optimal motion controllers based on the ut state estimation 3 1 ut state estimation note that the ut s depth can be measured rather accurately using the depth sensors on the ut also the ut sends its depth information to the usv at each sample index this paper tackles the estimation of the ut s projection onto the sea surface in other words we present the estimation for r k t p x k t y k t 0 instead of r k t x k t y k t z k t recall that x ˆ k k 1 x ˆ k k 4 presents the estimation of r k t p x k t y k t 0 at each sample index k we update the ut estimate by running the lkf in section 2 3 then based on the ut estimate we perform optimal motion controls within a single sampling interval 3 2 optimal motion controllers at every sample index k one generates the ut estimate x ˆ k k p k k utilizing the lkf in section 2 3 using the ut estimate x ˆ k k p k k at every sample index k one predicts feasible paths for the usv within t m sample indexes in the future meanwhile one predicts the ut s location t m sample indexes in the future then one chooses the optimal path for the usv considering the following two aspects simultaneously 1 maximize the information gain of the ut 2 get closer to the ut while estimating the ut s location at every sample index the usv chooses one path among feasible paths and moves along the edge of the chosen path within a single sample interval after the usv moves along the chosen edge the usv calculates a new ut estimate by processing new bearing range measurements in this way our motion controllers at every sample index are determined based on the most recent ut estimate we first discuss how to anticipate the ut s location j sample indexes in the future here j 1 2 t m let x ˆ k j k 1 x ˆ k j k 4 indicate the ut s anticipated location after j sample indexes in the future note that x i indicates the i th element in a column vector x for this prediction we utilize 31 x ˆ k j k f j x ˆ k k recall that f is presented in 4 we next discuss how to anticipate the usv s feasible location j sample indexes in the future here j 1 2 t m considering the acceleration limit 19 of the usv a tree structure is built to anticipate the usv s future location j sample indexes forward in time at every sample index k one generates a tree structure rooted at the usv s current location r k o every vertex with depth d in the tree presents the anticipated usv location after d sample indexes in the future we say that a vertex expands if one generates a new child of the vertex let n d indicate the maximum number of children expanded from a single vertex a vertex expands by selecting a heading value and propagating the parameterized usv dynamics forward in that direction here feasible heading directions are discretized considering the maximum turn rate of the usv the tree is expanded in a breadth first manner in other words the tree expands uniformly outward from the usv s current location fig 1 illustrates the tree whose depth is 2 and n d 3 in this figure the root is at the usv s current location the order of expansion is illustrated on each arrow feasible heading directions are discretized as 20 0 20 degrees respectively this indicates that the maximum turn rate of the usv is 20 per unit sample interval each vertex say v with depth j has its associated ut estimate x ˆ k j k which is derived utilizing eq 31 in addition v stores p k j k v which is the covariance of x ˆ k j k as the usv reaches the vertex v we next discuss the procedure to calculate the covariance matrix at each vertex suppose that a vertex say v is associated to the ut estimate x ˆ k j k p k j k v then the ut estimate and its covariance are calculated at c v a child of v here c v has depth j 1 utilizing eq 14 one predicts the covariance matrix at c v as 32 p k j 1 k c v f p k j k v f t q k 1 r k j v r k j v r k j v 1 h 1 in eq 32 r k j v is the variance of measurement noise when the ut is at x ˆ k j k 1 x ˆ k j k 4 and the usv is at v eq 32 is independent of measurements thus can be simulated forward in time without using measurements suppose that a vertex say u has depth j in the tree let d ˆ u indicate the distance between the anticipated ut location x ˆ k j k 1 x ˆ k j k 4 and u 33 c o s t u w d t r p k j k u d ˆ u is stored as the cost of u eq 33 is set since one desires to find a path meeting the following two goals 1 maximize the information gain of the ut 2 get closer to the ut while estimating the ut s location in eq 33 w d is the weight of the first goal compared to the second goal the effect of changing w d is analyzed in section 4 there may be a case where the ut estimate at sample index k is not reliable this implies that t r p k k t h r e s where t h r e s 0 is a constant in the case where t r p k k t h r e s we use c o s t u d ˆ u instead of 33 this implies that the usv moves to decrease the relative distance to the ut while not using the predicted covariance matrix among all vertices in the tree we choose one vertex 34 u a r g m i n u c o s t u the edge along the path to u is chosen as the next traversal edge after the usv finishes traversing the chosen edge the usv calculates a new ut estimate by processing new bearing range measurements in this way our motion controllers at every sample index are based on the most recent ut estimate note that at every sample index the usv selects one path among feasible paths and tracks the edge of the chosen path within a single sample interval 3 2 1 consider both obstacles and the standard deviation in bearing noise we discuss a method to avoid the situation in which the usv is too close to obstacles once an obstacle is detected then the tree structure can be built such that it does not intersect the obstacle suppose that the tree generates a new vertex say v t f whose depth is t f here t f 1 2 t m we remove the vertex v t f if it satisfies one of following two conditions are met the relative distance between v t f and an obstacle boundary is shorter than s a f e d i s t here s a f e d i s t 0 is a constant in matlab simulations we use s a f e d i s t 500 meters v t f is inside an obstacle once a vertex is removed or the depth of a vertex reaches t m then we do not expand the vertex anymore every vertex keeps expanding until there is no vertex to expand anymore in this way the tree is built guaranteeing that the tree does not get too close to an obstacle fig 2 depicts both the usv and the estimated ut state fig 2 illustrates the situation in which t m 1 and n d 5 in the tree with depth 1 every vertex is generated considering the maximum turn rate of the usv an obstacle is depicted as a circle the dotted arrow is avoided since it results in entering the obstacle the current ut estimate is depicted in fig 2 the anticipated ut location after a single sample interval is depicted as the head of an arrow emanating from the estimated ut in fig 2 the angle formed by two dashed lines depicts the ship relative bearing of the anticipated ut location with respect to the anticipated usv location suppose that the usv can access a table representing the bearing standard deviation with respect to ship relative bearing the proposed motion controllers are developed based on the table presenting bearing standard deviation which changes according to the change in ship relative bearing recall that the anticipated covariance is calculated utilizing eq 32 in eq 32 r k j v is the measurement noise variance as the ut is located at x ˆ k j k 1 x ˆ k j k 4 and the usv is at v to calculate r k j v in eq 32 one can utilize the table representing the bearing standard deviation with respect to ship relative bearing 4 matlab simulations we run matlab simulations to verify the performance of the proposed method each scenario runs from 0 to 3000 s in eq 21 we use r n g s 100 meters see that range measurements are very coarse the table presenting the bearing noise b r g s is as follows if the ship relative bearing is bigger than 50 then the standard deviation of bearing noise is 100 if the ship relative bearing is between 30 and 50 then the standard deviation of bearing noise is 90 if the ship relative bearing is less than 30 then the standard deviation of bearing noise is 45 see that bearing measurements are very coarse the settings for ut state estimation are as follows we initialize x ˆ 0 0 as 35 x ˆ 0 0 r 0 sin b 0 r 0 o 1 0 2 1 r 0 cos b 0 r 0 o 2 0 2 1 here 0 2 1 is a zero matrix with size 2 by 1 in addition b 0 and r 0 indicate the measurements at sample index 0 p 0 0 is initialized as 36 p 0 0 d i a g δ 2 v m a x 2 a m a x 2 δ 2 v m a x 2 a m a x 2 here v m a x is the maximum speed of the ut which is assumed to be known a priori let a m a x denote the maximum acceleration of the ut which is assumed to be known a priori also δ represents the uncertainty in the initial position estimate in simulations we use v m a x 20 a m a x 1 and δ 100 in meters the simulation settings are as follows initially we set w d 10 2 we use t h r e s 10 5 a m 0 1 and σ m 0 1 in eq 4 the sampling interval is t 1 second in the tree we set n d 5 and t m 3 the maximum turn rate of the usv is 30 per second we set the speed of the usv as 10 m s the initial course of the usv is in the east direction we run m c 20 monte carlo simulations let e k j j 1 2 m c denote the ut s location estimate at sample index k utilizing the j th monte carlo simulation e k j e k is the error of the ut estimate at sample index k the following rmse is used 37 r m s e k j 1 m c e k j e k 2 m c we simulate the case where the communication between the ut and the usv is lost assume that the communication between the ut and the usv is lost if any of the following two conditions are met 1 the relative distance between the ut and the usv is longer than 20 km 2 the line of sight between the ut and the usv is blocked by an obstacle in the case where the communication is lost the ut decreases its depth gets closer to the sea surface in order to receive the communication signal of the usv as long as the communication link is established the ut maintains its depth to 10 m the ut freely maneuvers in underwater environments as long as the communication link is preserved in the matlab simulations we use two illustrative scenarios scenarios 1 and 2 4 1 scenario 1 fig 3 depicts the scenario 1 the ut starts from 20000 0 10 and it moves with speed 5 m s between sample index 0 and 500 the ut performs a coordinates turn with turn rate ω 0 5 degrees per second the ut s movement under the coordinates turn is 38 x k 1 f c x k here we use 39 f c 1 s w 0 0 c w 0 0 cos ω t 0 0 sin ω t 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 c w 0 1 s w 0 0 sin ω

case eq 39 is simplified to 40 f c 1 t 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 t 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 after the sample index 2000 the ut performs a coordinates turn with turn rate ω 0 1 degrees per second in fig 3 obstacle boundaries are depicted with red circles this figure considers one monte carlo simulation the path of the usv under the proposed controllers is depicted with magenta circles due to coarse range bearing measurements the trajectory of the usv is not smooth in addition the path of the ut is plotted with green asterisks considering one monte carlo simulation fig 4 a presents the change of the ut s depth as time elapses initially the communication between the ut and the usv is lost thus the ut changes its depth accordingly fig 4 b presents the distance between the ut and the usv as time elapses the usv approaches the ut as time elapses fig 5 depicts the rmse in the case where the optimal motion controllers are used useoptcontrol fig 5 also depicts the rmse in the case where the usv uses no motion controllers nooptcontrol recall that z k in 27 is the measured target position at time step k in the case where the usv uses no motion controllers the usv just moves towards z k with constant speed at each time step k the rmse without the motion controllers nooptcontrol is much larger than that under the proposed motion controllers useoptcontrol using the optimal motion controllers running one monte carlo simulation under matlab takes about 42 s in the case where the usv uses no motion controllers running one monte carlo simulation under matlab takes only 1 s 4 2 scenario 2 fig 6 depicts the scenario 2 the ut starts from 10000 2000 10 and it moves away from the usv with speed 5 m s between sample index 0 and 2000 the ut moves with a constant velocity after the sample index 2000 the ut performs a coordinates turn with turn rate ω 0 1 degrees per second considering one monte carlo simulation fig 6 shows the path of the usv under the proposed controllers due to coarse range bearing measurements the trajectory of the usv is not smooth in addition the path of the ut is plotted with green asterisks considering one monte carlo simulation fig 7 a presents the change of the ut s depth as time elapses initially the communication between the ut and the usv is lost thus the ut changes its depth accordingly fig 7 b presents the distance between the ut and the usv as time elapses the usv approaches the ut as time elapses fig 8 depicts the rmse in the case where the optimal motion controllers are used useoptcontrol fig 8 also depicts the rmse in the case where the usv uses no motion controllers nooptcontrol the rmse without the motion controllers nooptcontrol is much larger than that under the proposed motion controllers useoptcontrol using the optimal motion controllers running one monte carlo simulation under matlab takes about 40 s in the case where the usv uses no motion controllers running one monte carlo simulation under matlab takes only 1 s 4 3 discussions in simulations each scenario runs for 3000 s running one monte carlo simulation under matlab takes almost 40 s this implies that the proposed control is suitable for real time implementations in real time implementations it is desirable to use c programming rather than matlab c programming code can be optimized for real time implementations 5 conclusions this paper introduces optimal motion controllers of the usv so that the usv tracks the ut using coarse range bearing measurements in practice bearing standard deviation may vary as the ship relative bearing varies considering this practical aspect the proposed motion controllers are unique in achieving following two goals simultaneously 1 considering both the usv s maximum turn rate and its bearing standard deviation the usv approaches the ut while estimating the ut s location using coarse range bearing measurements 2 avoid getting too close to obstacles in this paper the performance of the proposed method is verified under matlab simulations as our future works we will do experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed motion controllers declaration of

loads occurring at violent wave encounters simulation measurement and characterization of these loads and related structure responses are however difficult to evaluate design of high speed planing craft structures is still generally based on the simplistic semi empirical methods presented in savitsky and brown 1976 and allen and jones 1978 in combination with basic plate and beam theory as implemented in classification rules and scantling codes such as dnvgl 2015 and iso 2019 this semi empirical approach is well established straight forward and requires limited efforts but on the other hand involves substantial uncertainties thereby offering limited opportunities for structure optimization e g koelbel 1995 rosén et al 2007 grimsley et al 2010 mccue 2012 bowles and soja 2014 razola et al 2014 razola et al 2016 rosén et al 2017 further progress of the structure design of high speed planing craft will require first principles methods in rosén et al 2020 an approach for time domain simulation of slamming loads and related local and global structure responses for a high speed planing craft in waves is presented establishment of direct calculation approaches for structure design of high speed planing craft will however require appropriate experimental validation of the used simulation methods the phenomena of planing and hull water impact have been studied experimentally for more than a century in the last couple of decades systematic experimental series with planing craft in waves have for example been performed by soletic 2010 taunton et al 2011 begovic et al 2014

thodal 2016 magoga 2017 volpi et al 2017 and prini et al 2018 rosén 2005 presents an approach for reconstructing the detailed momentary slamming pressure distribution based on point measurements in a few positions on the hull bottom which in rosén et al 2007 is used for evaluating the design pressures and the structure design of a large high speed craft examples of measuring slamming loads as well as related structure responses have also been made for example by camilleri et al 2018 comparing measured pressures against design pressure predictions according to the iso dnvgl and lr scantling codes by magoga 2017 presenting preliminary correlation of the stress and pressure records of slamming events and by amin et al 2008 concluding that a direct comparison of measured strain time histories and finite element analysis was hard to achieve hou et al 2019 presents a method for structure dynamic analysis of a high speed planing craft where pointwise acceleration data collected from sea trials are enforced as excitation for global structure finite element analysis slamming has also been studied experimentally through drop tests where a test section is dropped into a water surface

slamming pressures and craft rigid body motions and accelerations the major objective of the paper is to thoroughly describe motivate and verify the experimental design in addition the capabilities of the experimental setup are demonstrated through systematic experiments in regular waves and significant results are presented and discussed in relation to corresponding results from time domain simulations with a numerical modelling approach that has been developed in a parallel study presented in rosén et al 2020 2 physical model 2 1 model craft to enable building on the experiences from begovic et al 2014 2016b 2016a begovic and bertorello 2012 it was decided to use a similar monohedral model hull for the present study the scale of the new model was chosen as the compromise to accommodate for counteracting requirements such as the local structure as big as possible for reliable testing easily installable in the hull and finally relatively long acquisition time at the planing regime in model testing as described in fig 1 fig 2 and table 1 the craft is 2 75 m long 0 613 m wide and has a constant dead rise angle of 16 9 from the transom all the way to the very bow part as seen in the pictures the hull bottom has eight windows which enables alternative placements of the model structure when the local structure was ready it has been mounted together with the aluminium panels at the bottom and the model was trimmed to the required weight longitudinal lcg and vertical vcg position of the centre of gravity and gyration radii as reported in table 1 2 2 model structure the idea with the model structure is not to represent some real high speed craft structure but instead to create a hypothetic simplified local structure that responds to the slamming loads in a realistic way and which can be accurately reproduced in comparative simulations with well defined material properties boundary conditions etc the following requirements were worked out to guide the design of the model structure 1 the model structure shall fit into one of the compartments in the model hull see fig 2 2 the model structure materials scantlings boundary conditions etc shall be well defined so that its characteristics can be modelled by finite element method with high accuracy 3 the structure responses shall be large enough to be measurable 4 the structure responses shall be small enough to avoid material yield or fracture 5 the structure responses shall be small enough to eliminate kinematic hydroelastic effects i e influence of the structure deformations on the water flow according to stenius et al 2011 this requirement is to ensure comparability between the experimental results and the numerical results 6 the critical natural periods of the model structure elements shall be significantly smaller than typical slamming load periods to eliminate inertia related hydroelastic effects according to stenius et al 2011 same as for requirement 5 this is to ensure comparability between the experimental results and the numerical results 7 the model structure shall be equipped with sensors for relevant and accurate measurement of structural responses requirement 1 is somewhat trivial simply defining the dimensional limits for the model structure to meet requirement 2 it was decided to develop a rigid frame that could provide well defined boundaries to a number of bottom plates various frame concepts and layouts were explored leading to the final design shown in fig 3 and fig 4 the structure consists of a 1 5 mm thick aluminium plate young s modulus 69 000 mpa poisson s ratio 0 33 fitting the framing of the model hull see fig 2 this plate is then bonded by epoxy resin araldite 2015 to the main frame that is constructed using 20x20 rexroth aluminium profiles young s modulus 70 000 mpa poisson s ratio 0 34 as seen in the lower picture in fig 3 this main frame defines one 186 186 mm square bottom plate and another 229 186 mm plate which is divided in two smaller 229 78 mm rectangular plates by an aluminium t profile with dimensions of 30 30 3 mm young s modulus 69 000 mpa poisson s ratio 0 33 there is a gap between the 45 degree angled rexroth profile fasteners seen in the panel corners and the panels allowing the panels undisturbed out of plane deformation the idea with this layout is to have one simple square panel which should be easy to represent in a finite element model and another slightly more complex arrangement with the two rectangular panels supported by a deformable stiffener the total weight of the model structure is 2 72 kg requirements 3 and 4 were in the design phase considered based on simulations according to rosén et al 2020 for representative operational conditions requirements 5 and 6 were considered through simulations modal analysis and evaluation of hydroelastic effects according to stenius et al 2011 requirements 3 6 were furthermore verified experimentally as described in the following section based on simulations and experiences from previous experiments it was decided to place the model structure in the foremost port compartment as pictured in fig 5 the distance from the transom to the front side of the third bulkhead is 1603 mm and from the front side of the third bulkhead to the first edge of the frame of the model structure there is a gap of 18 mm a global coordinate system is defined according to fig 5 with the origin in the intersection between the keel and transom the local coordinate system of the model structure is defined with origin in the lower aft corner of the bottom plate as shown in fig 6 the global coordinates of the origin of the local coordinate system is given by x 1603 35 18 1586 mm and y 27 mm the model structure was fastened by gluing the bottom plate to the hull model similarly the other windows in the hull bottom were covered by aluminium plates where the plate in the foremost starboard window adjacent to the model structure was additionally stiffened with two longitudinal 30 30 3 mm aluminium t profiles to limit deformations and provide good support for pressure sensors 2 3 instrumentation requirement 7 was considered through various concept studies to capture strain and stress variations and gradients in time as well as space it was considered appropriate to have measurement points distributed transversally as well as longitudinally based on these considerations it was decided to equip the square panel with five strain gauges measuring the strain in the transversal direction as specified in fig 6 and table 2 to enable capturing of the complete load and response processes also the measuring the slamming pressure over the model structure was of interest with the model structure crowded with strain gauges and cabling it was decided to measure the pressure on the bottom plate on the opposite side of the keel considering the expected symmetry in the flow field when towing the model craft in head waves as pictured in fig 5 a matrix with six pressure sensors was installed with three sensors at the fore and three at the aft end of the square panel in the model structure with this arrangement the momentary slamming pressure distribution over this panel can be captured by using the slamming pressure distribution reconstruction method according to rosén 2005 the pressure gauges were of the type xp5 with 3 8 mm sensor membrane diameters measuring range up to 2 bar furthermore the model craft was equipped with two accelerometers of the type cross bow cxl04gp3 r al measuring vertical acceleration at the centre of gravity and the bow measuring range up to 4 g two laser sensors of the type keyence il 600 fixed on the carriage have measured vertical displacement at two points from which the heave and pitch have been determined measuring range 200 1000 mm with the accuracy of 0 5 mm 1 m the coordinates of all sensors are specified in table 3 more details about the model structure design and the instrumentation can be found in lei and persson 2017 3 numerical model the development of the experimental setup has been guided by simulations performed with the approach presented in rosén et al 2020 this simulation approach enables modelling of the complete fluid structure interaction process for high speed planing craft in waves by linking a non linear strip method through a slamming pressure modelling technique with a finite element representation of the hull structure this is based on the crucial assumption that the fluid structure interaction can be considered as quasi static thereby allowing for rigid body simulation of the craft motions and slamming loads and quasi static application of these loads in the finite element structure model rosén 2004 stenius et al 2011 in the present study a finite element representation of the model structure is developed by using the abaqus software two different meshing approaches are explored for the rexroth profiles both very detailed modelling with solid elements and more simplistic and less computationally demanding modelling with quadratic shell elements s8r where the rexroth profiles are idealized as quadratic cross section tubes with cross sectional properties corresponding to the rexroth profile properties the mesh for the shell configuration with an element size of 5 mm that ensures convergence is here displayed in fig 7 two different boundary condition configurations were used for the static verification tests described in the following section the frame structure was clamped similarly as in the verification experiment for the simulations in waves the plate edges were clamped to represent the bonding of the model structure to the model craft structure simulations in waves are performed by discretizing the momentary pressure distribution from the hydromechanic simulations in each time step in accordance with the model structure plate mesh applying the discretized pressures on the corresponding hull plate elements quasi statically and calculating the structure responses the validity of this quasi static load application approach in the here studied situation is verified in the following section more details about the finite element model can be found in lei and persson 2017 4 verification of model structure requirements the structure mechanics related requirements imposed on the model structure have been verified through a set of experiments 4 1 displacement and strains requirements 2 7 concerning the reproducibility of the model structure s characteristics in finite element analysis and the instrumentation were verified through static testing in an idealized loading situation where the model structure frame was clamped to a rigid beam placed into a load cell as shown in fig 8 point loads were applied in the centre of the square plate from 5 n to 40 n in 5 n steps load magnitudes and displacements were measured by the load cell system strains were measured with strain gauges 1 4 according to fig 6 the repeatability of the tests is evaluated in table 4 showing the differences for each strain gauge and load case between two repeated rounds of experiments except for the 5 n load case the repeatability is concluded to be good comparing measurements with corresponding finite element calculations yields a difference of 3 for the displacements in the centre of the square plate and up to 10 for the strains as shown in fig 9 4 2 modal analysis requirements 5 and 6 concerning the assumption of quasi static fluid structure interaction used in the simulations rosén et al 2020 were verified by characterizing involved hydroelastic effects in terms of ratio between the loading period and first mode natural period of the structure plates hydroelastic effects can be neglected and the quasi static assumption can be confirmed if this ratio is greater than 5 for wet condition according to stenius et al 2011 or greater than 2 for the dry condition according to bereznitski 2001 to determine the loading period of a wave encounter for the bottom plate the simulated pressure pulse was studied the loading period is here defined as the time it takes for the plate to get wetted this was realized by looking at the different time steps from the simulation in order to follow the pressure pulse front at a slamming event the shortest loading periods were found to be around 0 053s the natural frequency of the square panel of the model structure has been determined by experimental modal analysis using an impact hammer to excite the structure and four uniaxial accelerometers pcb 52b10 shown in fig 10 to cover the whole panel 12 nodes were considered and for each node 5 measurements have been performed once the data acquisition was concluded data were recorded using the acquisition system lms scadas iii and post processed by means of the software lms test lab 15a by the analysis of the frfs the modal parameters such as natural frequencies and mode shapes were extracted the test has been performed for two different conditions i ship model suspended in air by means of bungee cords and ii ship model in free free boundary condition in water with the structure panel completely immersed test results reveal as expected that the response in terms of frequency response function i e output input and the natural frequencies are lower in the case of the test with the panel immersed in the water as can be seen from table 5 and fig 11 power spectral density psd of the panel for two examined conditions is given in fig 11 in the frequency range 0 1024 hz for each node 5 measurements are performed and grey curves in fig 11 are mean values for each node the resultant psd red and blue curves in fig 11 are obtained as the mean value of grey curves due to the high number of measured peaks analysis of mode shapes has been performed and only few natural frequencies at the same mode shape are reported in table 5 the first mode shape for the panel in the air and in the water is given in fig 11 test results reveal as expected that the natural frequencies are lower in the case of the test with the panel immersed in the water due to the water added mass as can be seen from table 5 and fig 11 the first observed peak at 101 4 hz means the first natural period of the structure is 9 8 ms which compared to the expected loading period of 0 053s gives a ratio of around 5 4 larger than the minimum of 5 described in stenius et al 2011 thus the hydroelastic effect can be ignored and quasi static load application assumption used in simulation is valid 5 experiments the experiments have been performed in the towing tank of the university of naples federico ii which measures 135 m 9 m x 4 2 m the model craft was towed at constant speed at a point located 800 mm from the stern free in heave and pitch and restrained in sway roll yaw and surge the setup is shown in fig 12 the towing speed was set to 5 54 m s which corresponds to frl 1 07 and cv 2 257 as a compromise of planing regime with clear flow separation and appropriate measurement time with the model craft at constant speed for almost 10 s between acceleration and deceleration running trim at this speed is 4 736 deg two ultrasonic wave gauges baumer undk 301u6103 si4 precision on static flat target of 0 3 mm 1 m were used to measure the encountering waves one 3 215 m ahead of the model towing point and the other aligned laterally 3 88 m offset the towing point the test matrix of regular waves reported in begovic et al 2014 2016 was used as target scaled to the 2 75 m length model used in the present study the set of regular waves as generated and measured during the experiments are detailed in table 6 tests were repeated 2 3 times in each wave to check repeatability the smallest time scale to consider when choosing sampling rate is the rise time of the slamming pressure which corresponds to the time the slamming pressure pulse front takes to pass the pressure sensor membranes based on simulations the shortest rise times to be expected in these experiments would be in the order of 1 9 ms which in turn corresponds to a frequency of 526 hz the sampling rate was set to 5 khz to ensuring appropriate margins all data have been sampled with hardware anti aliasing 3rd order butterworth filter at 2 4 khz from the previous experiences in the towing tank the uncertainty in the 95 confidence level of all measured values are as follows carriage speed negligible encounter wave height at speed higher than 5 m s up to 3 vertical displacement by laser 2 heave and pitch obtained by the error propagation up to 6 accelerations 1 5 and pressure up to 2 these values are in line with the data reported by ittc seakeeping committee 2017 of uncertainty analysis for heave pitch and added resistance of a kvlcc2 tanker at a confidence level of 95 as wave amplitude less than 3 wavelength less than 2 the predominant source of uncertainty is a type b uncertainty of the wave probe heave and pitch 5 and 7 5 respectively again type b uncertainties of the corresponding measurement devices are dominant 6 experimental results and comparison with simulations results from the performed experiments are presented and compared with corresponding simulation results generated with the numerical approach presented in rosén et al 2020 the fluid structure interaction process that is intended to be captured is highly complex and the presented experimental setup is truly novel and still involves substantial uncertainties it is therefore too early to consider the experiments as a solid reference for validating the numerical approach measured and simulated structure responses are presented and compared only to demonstrate and discuss the capabilities of these modelling approaches when it comes to the craft rigid body motions and accelerations the here used experimental and numerical modelling approaches can however be regarded as rather mature and evaluated e g as presented in begovic et al 2012 2014 2016 a b garme and rosén 2003 garme 2005 and rosén et al 2017 the motion and acceleration responses will therefore be presented first to serve as a basis for presenting and discussing the structure responses and hydromechanics pressure loads fig 13 gives examples of heave and pitch motion time series this is in one of the rougher conditions studied with a wave amplitude and length h λ 0 021 and λ l 1 94 wave amplitude 55 mm wave period 1 85 s measured and simulated heave correlate very well whereas measured pitch is somewhat smaller than simulated it can be noted that the heave response is rather harmonic whereas the pitch response indicates nonlinearities in terms of sharper crests fig 14 compares measured and simulated heave and pitch amplitudes for all studied conditions the different markers at the same wavelength represent different wave heights there is in general very good match between measurements and simulations except for pitch in the largest wave amplitude in λ l 1 942 heave in the longer waves and both heave and pitch in the single largest wave amplitude in λ l 2 716 for measured slamming related acceleration signals filtering is a crucial and debated issue riley et al 2010 for example argues for a 10 hz cut off frequency in full scale razola et al 2016 as well as van derwerken and judge 2017 recommends at least 20 hz whereas rosén et al 2017 found 30 hz to be most appropriate for removing vibration and noise while conserving the rigid body dynamics in the present study a sensitivity analysis has been performed where 30 hz was concluded to be feasible and it is here used for all presented data fig 15 exemplifies measured and simulated time series of the vertical acceleration at the craft centre of gravity for the same condition as fig 13 i e h λ 0 021 and λ l 1 94 55 mm 1 85 s there is a very good match between measured and simulated responses both capturing the typical transient character of slamming related accelerations fig 16 compiles the positive peak values for measured and simulated accelerations for all studied wave conditions measurements and simulations correlate very well except for the higher waves in λ l 2 716 table 7 summarizes all measured and simulated motion and acceleration amplitudes for all tested wave amplitudes in the two wavelengths λ l 1 94 and 2 716 fig 17 displays measured and simulated strains pressures and accelerations at individual slams extracted from time series in three different wave conditions with wave length λ l 1 94 and wave amplitudes 25 41 55 mm column wise the noisy signals are measured and the clean are simulated starting from the bottom of fig 17 very good correlation can be seen between measured and simulated accelerations the experimental and numerical approaches are very well in line regarding the modelling of the global rigid body motions however regarding the local hydromechanic pressures and structure strain processes clear discrepancies between measurements and simulations can be seen in fig 17 the strain gauges are located as defined in table 2 and as indicated in fig 6 all five gauges are measuring strain in the transversal direction of the plate the strain curves in fig 17 from top to bottom represents gauge 9 4 3 1 and 2 as seen gauges 1 2 and 3 that are located at the plate edge closest to the keel measures negative strains which means that they are subjected to compression gauge 9 located at the centre of the plate measures positive strains meaning it is subjected to tension finally gauge 4 measures positive strain tension in the early phases of the slamming sequence and negative strain compression in the later phases which indicates that it is located close to the inflection point these strain signals can be understood by recalling that the studied plate can be considered as clamped along the edges and that the slamming pressure pulse front is more or less parallel to the keel and mainly propagating from the lower to the upper edge of the plate hence both the experimental and the numerical modelling approaches are capturing the very details of the local slamming related structure response processes the measured strains are however systematically larger than the simulated the pressure sensors are located as defined in fig 5 and table 3 quite similar pressure sequences have been observed for the aft and bow sensor equipped sections sensors 11 14 16 4 5 6 respectively for clarity only the aft section sensor locations are here represented in fig 17 where they are numbered 1 2 3 in sequence from keel to chine i e corresponding to sensors 11 14 16 as seen the measured and simulated pressures correlates very well closest to the keel location 1 in all three studied events at the other locations further away from the keel locations 2 and 3 the simulated pressures are lower and somewhat lagged behind the measured pressures the pressures can be studied in even more detail by applying the pressure distribution reconstruction method presented in rosén 2005 which enables formulation of momentary slamming pressure distributions from the discrete point measurements fig 18 displays examples of reconstructed pressure distributions at the aft pressure sensor equipped section at a number of time instants during the impact event in fig 17 i e h λ 0 021 and λ l 1 94 wave amplitude 55 mm and wave period 1 85 s this makes even more clear the good correlation between measurements and simulations in the early phases of impact and the diverging correlation in the later phases fig 19 compiles measured and simulated strain amplitudes at the locations of strain gauges 2 4 and 9 for all studied wave conditions where the different markers at the same wavelength represent results for the wave heights variation as seen measured strains are systematically larger than simulated for all cases similarly as observed for the cases studied in fig 17 7 discussion and conclusions an experimental setup for modelling local slamming related structure responses for planing high speed craft in waves has been presented and demonstrated through systematic experiments and comparison with numerical simulations the used approach to integrate a model structure into a planing craft scale model hull has been found feasible a set of requirements has been formulated for the model structure to ensure crucial aspects such as rigid quasi static fluid structure interaction and well defined model structure characteristics which can be reproduced by finite element modelling with high accuracy all requirements have been thoroughly verified through testing in idealized static loading conditions and operational modal analysis oma in air and in water the capabilities of the experimental setup have been demonstrated through systematic experiments where the craft model was towed at constant speed in regular waves free in heave and pitch and restrained in the other degrees of freedom this initial experimental series considered one speed and ten different wave lengths with a single wave amplitude tested in eight of the wave lengths and variation of three different wave amplitudes in two of the wave lengths summing up to in total 14 different test conditions the used instrumentation for craft rigid body motions and accelerations and the wave environment are to be considered as reliable standards the crucial aspect of acceleration filtering has been considered through a sensitivity analysis and 30 hz was determined to be an appropriate cut off level equipping the aft and bow edges of the studied plate with three pressure sensors each is concluded to provide appropriate information for capturing and reconstructing the detailed slamming pressure distribution sequences over the studied plate due to space limitations the pressure sensors have been placed on the opposite side of the keel from the studied panel this introduces some uncertainties if the symmetric loading situation in head seas which this placement relies on is not perfectly achieved the plate in the model structure in this study was equipped with 5 strain gauges for measuring transversal strains the three transversally placed gauges are concluded to provide a clear record of the strain and related bending moment distribution along the most heavily loaded transversal cross section of the plate complementary gauges could be considered for future studies but there is a trade off to be made between experimental resolution and space and cost limitations experimental results have been compared with simulations performed with the numerical approach presented in rosén et al 2020 due to the early stage of development of these two modelling approaches the purpose here has not been to use the experimental results for validating the simulations the intention is instead to demonstrate and discuss the capabilities of the two approaches in general very good agreement is found between measured and simulated heave and pitch motions and vertical accelerations in the craft centre of gravity this adds further confirmation of the capabilities of both experimental and numerical approaches in modelling planing craft rigid body motions for the hydromechanic slamming pressure over the studied panel measurements and simulations correlate very well in the early phases of impact but in the later phases the simulated pressures are lower and also somewhat lagged behind the measured pressures both the experimental and the numerical modelling approaches are concluded to clearly capture the very details of the local slamming related structure response processes the measured strains are however found to be systematically larger than the simulated the observed pressure and strain results confirm that the local fluid structure interaction is significantly more demanding to model than the global rigid body motions very small differences in impact sequence between the experiments and simulations for example small differences in relative impact angle or velocity can create quite large differences in impact pressure and corresponding differences in structure responses one observed detail that differed between the experiments and simulations was that the water flow was not completely separated in the aftmost parts of the craft chines in the experiments whereas clean separation occurs by definition in the simulations the presented experimental approach is concluded to provide unique opportunities for detailed studies of the whole dynamic situation for planing craft in waves parallel development and evaluation of the experimental and numerical approaches is an obvious advantage future work could involve extended testing at different speeds in particular higher and different craft displacements in particular lighter and also in irregular waves to explore the sensitivity of different modelling parameters future work could also involve more thorough evaluation of the different parts of the modelling setup one option for tracing differences between the experimental and numerical approaches could be to make structure simulations with pressure loads formulated from the corresponding experimental situation future work could also explore separate or combined application of the experimental and numerical approaches for evaluating and further developing the prevailing semi empirical design methods or for establishing

loads occurring at violent wave encounters simulation measurement and characterization of these loads and related structure responses are however difficult to evaluate design of high speed planing craft structures is still generally based on the simplistic semi empirical methods presented in savitsky and brown 1976 and allen and jones 1978 in combination with basic plate and beam theory as implemented in classification rules and scantling codes such as dnvgl 2015 and iso 2019 this semi empirical approach is well established straight forward and requires limited efforts but on the other hand involves substantial uncertainties thereby offering limited opportunities for structure optimization e g koelbel 1995 rosén et al 2007 grimsley et al 2010 mccue 2012 bowles and soja 2014 razola et al 2014 razola et al 2016 rosén et al 2017 further progress of the structure design of high speed planing craft will require first principles methods in rosén et al 2020 an approach for time domain simulation of slamming loads and related local and global structure responses for a high speed planing craft in waves is presented establishment of direct calculation approaches for structure design of high speed planing craft will however require appropriate experimental validation of the used simulation methods the phenomena of planing and hull water impact have been studied experimentally for more than a century in the last couple of decades systematic experimental series with planing craft in waves have for example been performed by soletic 2010 taunton et al 2011 begovic et al 2014

few positions on the hull bottom which in rosén et al 2007 is used for evaluating the design pressures and the structure design of a large high speed craft examples of measuring slamming loads as well as related structure responses have also been made for example by camilleri et al 2018 comparing measured pressures against design pressure predictions according to the iso dnvgl and lr scantling codes by magoga 2017 presenting preliminary correlation of the stress and pressure records of slamming events and by amin et al 2008 concluding that a direct comparison of measured strain time histories and finite element analysis was hard to achieve hou et al 2019 presents a method for structure dynamic analysis of a high speed planing craft where pointwise acceleration data collected from sea trials are enforced as excitation for global structure finite element analysis slamming has also been studied experimentally through drop tests where a test section is dropped into a water surface

accommodate for counteracting requirements such as the local structure as big as possible for reliable testing easily installable in the hull and finally relatively long acquisition time at the planing regime in model testing as described in fig 1 fig 2 and table 1 the craft is 2 75 m long 0 613 m wide and has a constant dead rise angle of 16 9 from the transom all the way to the very bow part as seen in the pictures the hull bottom has eight windows which enables alternative placements of the model structure when the local structure was ready it has been mounted together with the aluminium panels at the bottom and the model was trimmed to the required weight longitudinal lcg and vertical vcg position of the centre of gravity and gyration radii as reported in table 1 2 2 model structure the idea with the model structure is not to represent some real high speed craft structure but instead to create a hypothetic simplified local structure that responds to the slamming loads in a realistic way and which can be accurately reproduced in comparative simulations with well defined material properties boundary conditions etc the following requirements were worked out to guide the design of the model structure 1 the model structure shall fit into one of the compartments in the model hull see fig 2 2 the model structure materials scantlings boundary conditions etc shall be well defined so that its characteristics can be modelled by finite element method with high accuracy 3 the structure responses shall be large enough to be measurable 4 the structure responses shall be small enough to avoid material yield or fracture 5 the structure responses shall be small enough to eliminate kinematic hydroelastic effects i e influence of the structure deformations on the water flow according to stenius et al 2011 this requirement is to ensure comparability between the experimental results and the numerical results 6 the critical natural periods of the model structure elements shall be significantly smaller than typical slamming load periods to eliminate inertia related hydroelastic effects according to stenius et al 2011 same as for requirement 5 this is to ensure comparability between the experimental results and the numerical results 7 the model structure shall be equipped with sensors for relevant and accurate measurement of structural responses requirement 1 is somewhat trivial simply defining the dimensional limits for the model structure to meet requirement 2 it was decided to develop a rigid frame that could provide well defined boundaries to a number of bottom plates various frame concepts and layouts were explored leading to the final design shown in fig 3 and fig 4 the structure consists of a 1 5 mm thick aluminium plate young s modulus 69 000 mpa poisson s ratio 0 33 fitting the framing of the model hull see fig 2 this plate is then bonded by epoxy resin araldite 2015 to the main frame that is constructed using 20x20 rexroth aluminium profiles young s modulus 70 000 mpa poisson s ratio 0 34 as seen in the lower picture in fig 3 this main frame defines one 186 186 mm square bottom plate and another 229 186 mm plate which is divided in two smaller 229 78 mm rectangular plates by an aluminium t profile with dimensions of 30 30 3 mm young s modulus 69 000 mpa poisson s ratio 0 33 there is a gap between the 45 degree angled rexroth profile fasteners seen in the panel corners and the panels allowing the panels undisturbed out of plane deformation the idea with this layout is to have one simple square panel which should be easy to represent in a finite element model and another slightly more complex arrangement with the two rectangular panels supported by a deformable stiffener the total weight of the model structure is 2 72 kg requirements 3 and 4 were in the design phase considered based on simulations according to rosén et al 2020 for representative operational conditions requirements 5 and 6 were considered through simulations modal analysis and evaluation of hydroelastic effects according to stenius et al 2011 requirements 3 6 were furthermore verified experimentally as described in the following section based on simulations and experiences from previous experiments it was decided to place the model structure in the foremost port compartment as pictured in fig 5 the distance from the transom to the front side of the third bulkhead is 1603 mm and from the front side of the third bulkhead to the first edge of the frame of the model structure there is a gap of 18 mm a global coordinate system is defined according to fig 5 with the origin in the intersection between the keel and transom the local coordinate system of the model structure is defined with origin in the lower aft corner of the bottom plate as shown in fig 6 the global coordinates of the origin of the local coordinate system is given by x 1603 35 18 1586 mm and y 27 mm the model structure was fastened by gluing the bottom plate to the hull model similarly the other windows in the hull bottom were covered by aluminium plates where the plate in the foremost starboard window adjacent to the model structure was additionally stiffened with two longitudinal 30 30 3 mm aluminium t profiles to limit deformations and provide good support for pressure sensors 2 3 instrumentation requirement 7 was considered through various concept studies to capture strain and stress variations and gradients in time as well as space it was considered appropriate to have measurement points distributed transversally as well as longitudinally based on these considerations it was decided to equip the square panel with five strain gauges measuring the strain in the transversal direction as specified in fig 6 and table 2 to enable capturing of the complete load and response processes also the measuring the slamming pressure over the model structure was of interest with the model structure crowded with strain gauges and cabling it was decided to measure the pressure on the bottom plate on the opposite side of the keel considering the expected symmetry in the flow field when towing the model craft in head waves as pictured in fig 5 a matrix with six pressure sensors was installed with three sensors at the fore and three at the aft end of the square panel in the model structure with this arrangement the momentary slamming pressure distribution over this panel can be captured by using the slamming pressure distribution reconstruction method according to rosén 2005 the pressure gauges were of the type xp5 with 3 8 mm sensor membrane diameters measuring range up to 2 bar furthermore the model craft was equipped with two accelerometers of the type cross bow cxl04gp3 r al measuring vertical acceleration at the centre of gravity and the bow measuring range up to 4 g two laser sensors of the type keyence il 600 fixed on the carriage have measured vertical displacement at two points from which the heave and pitch have been determined measuring range 200 1000 mm with the accuracy of 0 5 mm 1 m the coordinates of all sensors are specified in table 3 more details about the model structure design and the instrumentation can be found in lei and persson 2017 3 numerical model the development of the experimental setup has been guided by simulations performed with the approach presented in rosén et al 2020 this simulation approach enables modelling of the complete fluid structure interaction process for high speed planing craft in waves by linking a non linear strip method through a slamming pressure modelling technique with a finite element representation of the hull structure this is based on the crucial assumption that the fluid structure interaction can be considered as quasi static thereby allowing for rigid body simulation of the craft motions and slamming loads and quasi static application of these loads in the finite element structure model rosén 2004 stenius et al 2011 in the present study a finite element representation of the model structure is developed by using the abaqus software two different meshing approaches are explored for the rexroth profiles both very detailed modelling with solid elements and more simplistic and less computationally demanding modelling with quadratic shell elements s8r where the rexroth profiles are idealized as quadratic cross section tubes with cross sectional properties corresponding to the rexroth profile properties the mesh for the shell configuration with an element size of 5 mm that ensures convergence is here displayed in fig 7 two different boundary condition configurations were used for the static verification tests described in the following section the frame structure was clamped similarly as in the verification experiment for the simulations in waves the plate edges were clamped to represent the bonding of the model structure to the model craft structure simulations in waves are performed by discretizing the momentary pressure distribution from the hydromechanic simulations in each time step in accordance with the model structure plate mesh applying the discretized pressures on the corresponding hull plate elements quasi statically and calculating the structure responses the validity of this quasi static load application approach in the here studied situation is verified in the following section more details about the finite element model can be found in lei and persson 2017 4 verification of model structure requirements the structure mechanics related requirements imposed on the model structure have been verified through a set of experiments 4 1 displacement and strains requirements 2 7 concerning the reproducibility of the model structure s characteristics in finite element analysis and the instrumentation were verified through static testing in an idealized loading situation where the model structure frame was clamped to a rigid beam placed into a load cell as shown in fig 8 point loads were applied in the centre of the square plate from 5 n to 40 n in 5 n steps load magnitudes and displacements were measured by the load cell system strains were measured with strain gauges 1 4 according to fig 6 the repeatability of the tests is evaluated in table 4 showing the differences for each strain gauge and load case between two repeated rounds of experiments except for the 5 n load case the repeatability is concluded to be good comparing measurements with corresponding finite element calculations yields a difference of 3 for the displacements in the centre of the square plate and up to 10 for the strains as shown in fig 9 4 2 modal analysis requirements 5 and 6 concerning the assumption of quasi static fluid structure interaction used in the simulations rosén et al 2020 were verified by characterizing involved hydroelastic effects in terms of ratio between the loading period and first mode natural period of the structure plates hydroelastic effects can be neglected and the quasi static assumption can be confirmed if this ratio is greater than 5 for wet condition according to stenius et al 2011 or greater than 2 for the dry condition according to bereznitski 2001 to determine the loading period of a wave encounter for the bottom plate the simulated pressure pulse was studied the loading period is here defined as the time it takes for the plate to get wetted this was realized by looking at the different time steps from the simulation in order to follow the pressure pulse front at a slamming event the shortest loading periods were found to be around 0 053s the natural frequency of the square panel of the model structure has been determined by experimental modal analysis using an impact hammer to excite the structure and four uniaxial accelerometers pcb 52b10 shown in fig 10 to cover the whole panel 12 nodes were considered and for each node 5 measurements have been performed once the data acquisition was concluded data were recorded using the acquisition system lms scadas iii and post processed by means of the software lms test lab 15a by the analysis of the frfs the modal parameters such as natural frequencies and mode shapes were extracted the test has been performed for two different conditions i ship model suspended in air by means of bungee cords and ii ship model in free free boundary condition in water with the structure panel completely immersed test results reveal as expected that the response in terms of frequency response function i e output input and the natural frequencies are lower in the case of the test with the panel immersed in the water as can be seen from table 5 and fig 11 power spectral density psd of the panel for two examined conditions is given in fig 11 in the frequency range 0 1024 hz for each node 5 measurements are performed and grey curves in fig 11 are mean values for each node the resultant psd red and blue curves in fig 11 are obtained as the mean value of grey curves due to the high number of measured peaks analysis of mode shapes has been performed and only few natural frequencies at the same mode shape are reported in table 5 the first mode shape for the panel in the air and in the water is given in fig 11 test results reveal as expected that the natural frequencies are lower in the case of the test with the panel immersed in the water due to the water added mass as can be seen from table 5 and fig 11 the first observed peak at 101 4 hz means the first natural period of the structure is 9 8 ms which compared to the expected loading period of 0 053s gives a ratio of around 5 4 larger than the minimum of 5 described in stenius et al 2011 thus the hydroelastic effect can be ignored and quasi static load application assumption used in simulation is valid 5 experiments the experiments have been performed in the towing tank of the university of naples federico ii which measures 135 m 9 m x 4 2 m the model craft was towed at constant speed at a point located 800 mm from the stern free in heave and pitch and restrained in sway roll yaw and surge the setup is shown in fig 12 the towing speed was set to 5 54 m s which corresponds to frl 1 07 and cv 2 257 as a compromise of planing regime with clear flow separation and appropriate measurement time with the model craft at constant speed for almost 10 s between acceleration and deceleration running trim at this speed is 4 736 deg two ultrasonic wave gauges baumer undk 301u6103 si4 precision on static flat target of 0 3 mm 1 m were used to measure the encountering waves one 3 215 m ahead of the model towing point and the other aligned laterally 3 88 m offset the towing point the test matrix of regular waves reported in begovic et al 2014 2016 was used as target scaled to the 2 75 m length model used in the present study the set of regular waves as generated and measured during the experiments are detailed in table 6 tests were repeated 2 3 times in each wave to check repeatability the smallest time scale to consider when choosing sampling rate is the rise time of the slamming pressure which corresponds to the time the slamming pressure pulse front takes to pass the pressure sensor membranes based on simulations the shortest rise times to be expected in these experiments would be in the order of 1 9 ms which in turn corresponds to a frequency of 526 hz the sampling rate was set to 5 khz to ensuring appropriate margins all data have been sampled with hardware anti aliasing 3rd order butterworth filter at 2 4 khz from the previous experiences in the towing tank the uncertainty in the 95 confidence level of all measured values are as follows carriage speed negligible encounter wave height at speed higher than 5 m s up to 3 vertical displacement by laser 2 heave and pitch obtained by the error propagation up to 6 accelerations 1 5 and pressure up to 2 these values are in line with the data reported by ittc seakeeping committee 2017 of uncertainty analysis for heave pitch and added resistance of a kvlcc2 tanker at a confidence level of 95 as wave amplitude less than 3 wavelength less than 2 the predominant source of uncertainty is a type b uncertainty of the wave probe heave and pitch 5 and 7 5 respectively again type b uncertainties of the corresponding measurement devices are dominant 6 experimental results and comparison with simulations results from the performed experiments are presented and compared with corresponding simulation results generated with the numerical approach presented in rosén et al 2020 the fluid structure interaction process that is intended to be captured is highly complex and the presented experimental setup is truly novel and still involves substantial uncertainties it is therefore too early to consider the experiments as a solid reference for validating the numerical approach measured and simulated structure responses are presented and compared only to demonstrate and discuss the capabilities of these modelling approaches when it comes to the craft rigid body motions and accelerations the here used experimental and numerical modelling approaches can however be regarded as rather mature and evaluated e g as presented in begovic et al 2012 2014 2016 a b garme and rosén 2003 garme 2005 and rosén et al 2017 the motion and acceleration responses will therefore be presented first to serve as a basis for presenting and discussing the structure responses and hydromechanics pressure loads fig 13 gives examples of heave and pitch motion time series this is in one of the rougher conditions studied with a wave amplitude and length h λ 0 021 and λ l 1 94 wave amplitude 55 mm wave period 1 85 s measured and simulated heave correlate very well whereas measured pitch is somewhat smaller than simulated it can be noted that the heave response is rather harmonic whereas the pitch response indicates nonlinearities in terms of sharper crests fig 14 compares measured and simulated heave and pitch amplitudes for all studied conditions the different markers at the same wavelength represent different wave heights there is in general very good match between measurements and simulations except for pitch in the largest wave amplitude in λ l 1 942 heave in the longer waves and both heave and pitch in the single largest wave amplitude in λ l 2 716 for measured slamming related acceleration signals filtering is a crucial and debated issue riley et al 2010 for example argues for a 10 hz cut off frequency in full scale razola et al 2016 as well as van derwerken and judge 2017 recommends at least 20 hz whereas rosén et al 2017 found 30 hz to be most appropriate for removing vibration and noise while conserving the rigid body dynamics in the present study a sensitivity analysis has been performed where 30 hz was concluded to be feasible and it is here used for all presented data fig 15 exemplifies measured and simulated time series of the vertical acceleration at the craft centre of gravity for the same condition as fig 13 i e h λ 0 021 and λ l 1 94 55 mm 1 85 s there is a very good match between measured and simulated responses both capturing the typical transient character of slamming related accelerations fig 16 compiles the positive peak values for measured and simulated accelerations for all studied wave conditions measurements and simulations correlate very well except for the higher waves in λ l 2 716 table 7 summarizes all measured and simulated motion and acceleration amplitudes for all tested wave amplitudes in the two wavelengths λ l 1 94 and 2 716 fig 17 displays measured and simulated strains pressures and accelerations at individual slams extracted from time series in three different wave conditions with wave length λ l 1 94 and wave amplitudes 25 41 55 mm column wise the noisy signals are measured and the clean are simulated starting from the bottom of fig 17 very good correlation can be seen between measured and simulated accelerations the experimental and numerical approaches are very well in line regarding the modelling of the global rigid body motions however regarding the local hydromechanic pressures and structure strain processes clear discrepancies between measurements and simulations can be seen in fig 17 the strain gauges are located as defined in table 2 and as indicated in fig 6 all five gauges are measuring strain in the transversal direction of the plate the strain curves in fig 17 from top to bottom represents gauge 9 4 3 1 and 2 as seen gauges 1 2 and 3 that are located at the plate edge closest to the keel measures negative strains which means that they are subjected to compression gauge 9 located at the centre of the plate measures positive strains meaning it is subjected to tension finally gauge 4 measures positive strain tension in the early phases of the slamming sequence and negative strain compression in the later phases which indicates that it is located close to the inflection point these strain signals can be understood by recalling that the studied plate can be considered as clamped along the edges and that the slamming pressure pulse front is more or less parallel to the keel and mainly propagating from the lower to the upper edge of the plate hence both the experimental and the numerical modelling approaches are capturing the very details of the local slamming related structure response processes the measured strains are however systematically larger than the simulated the pressure sensors are located as defined in fig 5 and table 3 quite similar pressure sequences have been observed for the aft and bow sensor equipped sections sensors 11 14 16 4 5 6 respectively for clarity only the aft section sensor locations are here represented in fig 17 where they are numbered 1 2 3 in sequence from keel to chine i e corresponding to sensors 11 14 16 as seen the measured and simulated pressures correlates very well closest to the keel location 1 in all three studied events at the other locations further away from the keel locations 2 and 3 the simulated pressures are lower and somewhat lagged behind the measured pressures the pressures can be studied in even more detail by applying the pressure distribution reconstruction method presented in rosén 2005 which enables formulation of momentary slamming pressure distributions from the discrete point measurements fig 18 displays examples of reconstructed pressure distributions at the aft pressure sensor equipped section at a number of time instants during the impact event in fig 17 i e h λ 0 021 and λ l 1 94 wave amplitude 55 mm and wave period 1 85 s this makes even more clear the good correlation between measurements and simulations in the early phases of impact and the diverging correlation in the later phases fig 19 compiles measured and simulated strain amplitudes at the locations of strain gauges 2 4 and 9 for all studied wave conditions where the different markers at the same wavelength represent results for the wave heights variation as seen measured strains are systematically larger than simulated for all cases similarly as observed for the cases studied in fig 17 7 discussion and conclusions an experimental setup for modelling local slamming related structure responses for planing high speed craft in waves has been presented and demonstrated through systematic experiments and comparison with numerical simulations the used approach to integrate a model structure into a planing craft scale model hull has been found feasible a set of requirements has been formulated for the model structure to ensure crucial aspects such as rigid quasi static fluid structure interaction and well defined model structure characteristics which can be reproduced by finite element modelling with high accuracy all requirements have been thoroughly verified through testing in idealized static loading conditions and operational modal analysis oma in air and in water the capabilities of the experimental setup have been demonstrated through systematic experiments where the craft model was towed at constant speed in regular waves free in heave and pitch and restrained in the other degrees of freedom this initial experimental series considered one speed and ten different wave lengths with a single wave amplitude tested in eight of the wave lengths and variation of three different wave amplitudes in two of the wave lengths summing up to in total 14 different test conditions the used instrumentation for craft rigid body motions and accelerations and the wave environment are to be considered as reliable standards the crucial aspect of acceleration filtering has been considered through a sensitivity analysis and 30 hz was determined to be an appropriate cut off level equipping the aft and bow edges of the studied plate with three pressure sensors each is concluded to provide appropriate information for capturing and reconstructing the detailed slamming pressure distribution sequences over the studied plate due to space limitations the pressure sensors have been placed on the opposite side of the keel from the studied panel this introduces some uncertainties if the symmetric loading situation in head seas which this placement relies on is not perfectly achieved the plate in the model structure in this study was equipped with 5 strain gauges for measuring transversal strains the three transversally placed gauges are concluded to provide a clear record of the strain and related bending moment distribution along the most heavily loaded transversal cross section of the plate complementary gauges could be considered for future studies but there is a trade off to be made between experimental resolution and space and cost limitations experimental results have been compared with simulations performed with the numerical approach presented in rosén et al 2020 due to the early stage of development of these two modelling approaches the purpose here has not been to use the experimental results for validating the simulations the intention is instead to demonstrate and discuss the capabilities of the two approaches in general very good agreement is found between measured and simulated heave and pitch motions and vertical accelerations in the craft centre of gravity this adds further confirmation of the capabilities of both experimental and numerical approaches in modelling planing craft rigid body motions for the hydromechanic slamming pressure over the studied panel measurements and simulations correlate very well in the early phases of impact but in the later phases the simulated pressures are lower and also somewhat lagged behind the measured pressures both the experimental and the numerical modelling approaches are concluded to clearly capture the very details of the local slamming related structure response processes the measured strains are however found to be systematically larger than the simulated the observed pressure and strain results confirm that the local fluid structure interaction is significantly more demanding to model than the global rigid body motions very small differences in impact sequence between the experiments and simulations for example small differences in relative impact angle or velocity can create quite large differences in impact pressure and corresponding differences in structure responses one observed detail that differed between the experiments and simulations was that the water flow was not completely separated in the aftmost parts of the craft chines in the experiments whereas clean separation occurs by definition in the simulations the presented experimental approach is concluded to provide unique opportunities for detailed studies of the whole dynamic situation for planing craft in waves parallel development and evaluation of the experimental and numerical approaches is an obvious advantage future work could involve extended testing at different speeds in particular higher and different craft displacements in particular lighter and also in irregular waves to explore the sensitivity of different modelling parameters future work could also involve more thorough evaluation of the different parts of the modelling setup one option for tracing differences between the experimental and numerical approaches could be to make structure simulations with pressure loads formulated from the corresponding experimental situation future work could also explore separate or combined application of the experimental and numerical approaches for evaluating and further developing the prevailing semi empirical design methods or for establishing

21528,historically frequent submarine slide hazards have directly or indirectly caused much devastating damage to offshore infrastructure resulting in large economic losses that have attracted increasing international attention previous studies have focused more on the characteristics of submarine slides themselves kinematics sedimentology etc but studies on the interaction between submarine sliding soils and the ambient water that affects these characteristics are relatively limited in this paper the mass transfer process at soil water interfaces during submarine slide motions at different velocities is investigated by a series of experiments using a carefully designed flume testing system the results show that the extent of the mass transfer process at soil water interfaces mainly depends on the velocity and material properties shear strength and apparent viscosity of submarine sliding soils based on the experimental results an empirical prediction equation for average mass transfer flux parameters at soil water interfaces during movements of viscous marine sliding soils is recommended providing a new reference for assessing the characteristics of submarine slides keywords submarine slides turbidity currents mass transfer electrical resistivity 1 introduction submarine slides are a frequent type of ocean geohazards triggered by earthquakes gas hydrate dissociation waves and other factors jia et al 2016 usually showing the phenomenon of large scale marine soil sliding for long run out distances guo et al 2020 during the movement of submarine slides sliding soils often exhibit a characteristic staged evolution under the complicated influence of the ambient water from the instability to sedimentation of submarine sliding soils they mainly experience the stages of slope failure intact soil blocks debris flows and turbidity currents nisbet and piper 1998 sassa and sekiguchi 2010 fan et al 2018 wang et al 2018 guo et al 2019 these currents can easily lead to a wide subaqueous danger area near the submarine slide zone in particular for some offshore infrastructure on the seabed e g submarine pipelines and cables the sliding soils with relatively high strength and density at the early sliding stage not only have strong destructive effects on this infrastructure e g some accidents have been caused by submarine slides an oil spill from submarine pipelines of the texaco company usa 1977 zhang 2004 and damage to submarine optical cables in the luzon strait china 2006 hsu and sibuet 2009 but also develop serious turbidity currents at the later sliding stage e g some submarine electric cables near southwestern taiwan island china were fractured by turbidity currents carter et al 2012 it is clear that investigating how submarine sliding soils evolve into turbidity currents is necessary to evaluate the hazard characteristics of submarine slides and their engineering prevention and control some careful studies e g mohrig et al 1998 mohrig and marr 2003 ilstad et al 2004 zakeri et al 2008 lee 2019 found that the suspended soil particles generated during the submarine slide motion and the evolutionary trend to turbidity currents are mainly due to the difference in density between the submarine sliding soils and water the density ratio between the former and latter is generally 1 2 the mass of submarine sliding soils transfer into the ambient water at the soil water interface a process that can be called the mass transfer to analyse the mass transfer characteristics of the submarine slide motion previous studies have made some valuable attempts for example mohrig et al 1998 used rakes of vertically stacked siphons to collect the turbid water in their flume model tests analysing the variations in water density during the movement of simulated submarine slides which can reflect the degree of the mass transfer process to a certain extent further mohrig and marr 2003 studied the mass transfer process from debris flows to turbidity currents by the difference recognition of acoustic reflectance from a reversible ultrasonic transducer and proposed a theoretical model to describe the mass transfer process during the movement of submarine slides additionally using a particle tracking technique to capture the process of soil particles detaching into the water ilstad et al 2004 discussed the influence of submarine sliding soil material on the mass transfer process however the above testing methods of the siphon collection technique acoustic reflectance imaging technique and particle tracking technique are still difficult to apply to effectively and quantitatively study a key parameter the mass transfer flux units of kg m2 s which can represent the mass of submarine sliding soils transferred to the ambient water per unit area and time the lack of a mass transfer flux parameter leads to neglecting the influence of mass transfers at soil water interfaces in some numerical modelling of submarine slide motions e g zakeri et al 2009 liu et al 2015 dong 2016 fan et al 2019 which may have unknown effects on some numerical simulation results on this basis this paper focuses on the debris flow stage of submarine slide motion that is the submarine soils have been triggered to failure and slide on the seabed with a certain velocity the mass transfer process at interfaces between submarine sliding soils and their ambient water is investigated based on experiments using a self designed flume testing system the main factors affecting the mass transfer process during submarine slide motions are discussed based on the test results and a preliminary prediction equation for the average mass transfer flux at soil water interfaces during the movement of submarine sliding soil is given the key aim of this study is to provide a reference for the assessment and simulation of submarine slide hazards 2 methodology 2 1 theoretical basis in theory the mass transfer process reflects the diffusibility of particles from high density materials to low density materials the mass transfer process during submarine slide motion should be subject to the conservation of mass that is the diffusible mass from submarine sliding soil to the ambient water as shown in fig 1 mohrig and marr 2003 describe this part of the mass as r h l h ε p t where r h is the erosion rate of the sliding soil head m s l h is the arc length for the section of the head subject to erosion m ε p is the average density of the sliding soil kg m3 and t is some given interval of time s is equal to the mass of suspended turbidity currents which can be described as ε t a t where ε t is the average density of the suspended soil within the current kg m3 and a t is the total volume of the turbidity current per unit width m2 without considering the turbidity redeposition in general the occurrence of the mass transfer process from high density materials to low density materials requires the subjected dynamic action to reach the critical beginning conditions for the material particles there are usually three expressions for the critical conditions wang et al 2014 stress flow velocity or power in this study the critical shear stress τ cr units of pa is used as a criterion for the occurrence of the mass transfer process during the movement of a submarine slide in water that is whether the shear stress of the water flow at soil water interfaces of the submarine sliding soil motion exceeds the critical resisting shear capacity of soil particles here the sliding soils are assumed to be uniform and the mass transfer process is considered to be particle based as shown in the partial enlargement in fig 1 a single soil particle several ovals simple represent fine grained soil particles is taken as an example it is mainly affected by the resultant action between the shear force of water flow decomposed into drag and lift forces particle gravity and viscous resistance caused by other particles along the shear direction of water once the shear force of water flow exceeds the gravity and viscous resistance of the particle it is sheared away from the parent sliding soil and enters the water to form a suspended turbidity current which satisfies the force balance therefore the shear stress state at the soil water interfaces of submarine sliding soil motion is very important for studying the mass transport process for viscous marine soils the critical shear stress can be estimated according to the shields method wen et al 2016 as follows 1 τ cr g θ cr ε p ε w d 50 2 θ cr 0 3 1 1 2 d 0 055 1 e 0 02 d 3 d g s 1 η w 1 3 d 50 where g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 θ cr is the critical shields coefficient ε w is the density of water kg m3 d 50 is the median value of soil particle size m s is the density ratio of the sliding soil to water d is the dimensionless particle size and η w is the viscous coefficient of water flow m2 s 2 2 experimental facility to realize the purpose of monitoring the mass transfer process during the movement of submarine slides a flume testing system is designed for this study see fig 2 referring to an equivalent simulation method from previous studies e g gauer et al 2005 sahdi et al 2014 the actual process during the movement of submarine sliding soil dynamic portion in water

are 1 4 0 7 0 6 m and 1 0 0 3 0 2 m respectively and the flowmeter is a fluxus f601 ultrasonic flowmeter produced by the flexim company berlin germany which is suitable for testing flow velocities from 0 01 25 m s the electrical resistivity probes are the core part of the testing system for monitoring the mass transfer process based on a working principle of establishing links between the variations in electrical resistance exhibited by the soils in the applied electric field usually characterized by a parameter named the soil electrical resistivity ρ r ω m which is defined by the ohm s law as shown in eq 4 fukue et al 1999 samouëlian et al 2005 and the masses of soil samples and the detailed device for electrical resistivity testing in this study uses two electrode probes the probes are 0 02 m in length and 0 00125 m in diameter and the gap between the two electrodes is 0 0185 m with a keithley 2602a current supply and data recording instrument tektronix inc beaverton oregon usa minimum current is 1 0 10 12 a two cameras with a resolution of 2 million pixels are set on the outlet head and in the water tank 2 but the cameras failed to play their expected role because the water became turbid too rapidly after the beginning of the experiment 4 ρ r r s p l u s p i l where r is the electrical resistance ω s p is the electrode cross sectional area m2 l is the electrode gap m u is the voltage v and i is the current a the main experimental steps in this study are as follows a before the start of experiments valve 1 is closed and water tank 1 is filled with water b the soil sample maintaining an approximate cross sectional area of 0 2 0 08 m is placed on the simulated seabed here the simulated seabed is rough sheet material to avoid the effect of soil material seabed on the mass transfer measurements which refers to the seabed setting from zakeri et al 2008 in the u type channel two electrical resistivity probes are inserted into one side of the soil sample and the keithley 2602a current supply voltage is set to 5 v and data recording instrument is set to the working state c valve 2 is closed and water tank 2 is filled with water until the soil sample has been completely submerged in water to a certain depth d after the experiment starts valve 1 is first opened so that the water in the pipe connects water tank 1 and tank 2 while ensuring that the flowmeter is open to the working position e starting the variable frequency pump to a target velocity level valve 2 of water tank 2 is opened with the continuous action of the flowing water suspended turbidity currents gradually form at the soil water interfaces of soil samples until the soil mass within the electric field covered by the electrical resistivity probes is completely diffused i e the keithley 2602a electrical current value in no longer changes then the experiment stops in addition after the turbid water in the collecting tank is settled to clean the clean water is pumped into water tank 1 to recycle and avoid waste soil samples in this study consist of commercially supplied kaolin soils which are usually used to simulate real marine soft clay in the laboratory e g zakeri et al 2008 gue 2012 sahdi et al 2014 the index properties of the kaolin are determined using the china standard and are reported in table 1 the soil samples are prepared by the vacuum stirred method combined with isotropic consolidation the detailed sample preparation process is shown as follows a dry kaolin soils and water were first poured into a vacuum stirred tank with an initial water content of 180 and the samples were sufficiently mixed for 2 h under a certain of vacuum pressure b the samples are continuously and quickly slide into a sample preparation box to reduce air infiltration c under a light uniform pressure 0 56 kpa the samples are consolidated and drained until the required water content was reached through this process the uniform soil samples can be prepared for testing the soil water contents prepared in this study are 112 approximately 2 times the liquid limit of the kaolin clay and 157 approximately 3 times the liquid limit which can basically characterize the high water content and low strength characteristics of typical fluidized submarine sliding soils the corresponding average densities of soil samples are 1347 and 1262 kg m3 respectively moreover the mass transfer flux derived from the experimental scale and the flux on the natural scale is similar through distorted scale modelling given the description from the study by mohrig and marr 2003 the similarity relationship for some important parameters in this study between experimental and prototype scales can be derived as a velocity v unit in m s v e λ 0 5 v p b time t unit in s t e λ 0 5 t p c mass transfer values per unit area m s unit in kg m2 m s e λ m s p where λ is the similarity scale ratio the subscript e and p of these parameters refer to the experimental and prototype scales respectively the similarity relationship contributes to applying the research results of this study in engineering 3 equivalent simulation and calibration 3 1 equivalent simulation relations to verify the validity of the equivalent simulation method used in this study and establish equivalence relations for the mass transfer flux between the experiment and prototype the shear stress state at soil water interfaces before and after the equivalent simulation are compared and analysed based on a relation between the shear stress and mass transfer flux from the mass transfer theory of viscous marine soils as follows 5 d m w d t m τ b τ c r 1 where dm w dt is the mass transfer flux from the experiment kg m2 s τ b is the shear stress of water flow pa and m is a suspension coefficient considering the difficulty of using physical experiments to test the shear stress at soil water interfaces during the movement of submarine slides the relatively stable commercial computational fluid dynamics cfd software ansys cfx is employed to extract the velocity and shear stress fields at the soil water interfaces before and after the equivalent simulation the ansys cfx numerical software has accumulated rich experience in simulating the movement of submarine slides in water e g gauer et al 2005 xie et al 2016 the algorithm used by the software solver is the finite volume method detailed theoretical information about the numerical method can be found in the study by zakeri et al 2009 in this study the cfd method is used to simulate two situations the movement of submarine sliding soils in water prototype and the water flowing through soil samples experiment for simplification an approximated rectangular submarine sliding body is used meaning that the morphology of the soil water interface is seen as a plane the specific numerical model settings see fig 3 are as follows a the model size is the same as the experiment size b there are 120 000 tetrahedral elements in total with a maximum grid size of 0 02 m in the simulation domain c the rheological strength models of soil samples are tested by a combination method nian et al 2019 and expressed as a typical form of herschel bulkley fluid zakeri et al 2008 that is s u 1 125 20 γ 0 2 for the sample with 112 water content and s u 2 16 2 5 γ 0 2 for the sample with 157 water content the water is a newtonian fluid with a density of 1025 kg m3 and viscosity of 0 00167 pa s d in fig 3a the bottom boundary of the domain is set as a rough no slip surface with an equivalent roughness of 0 5 mm the soil sample starts moving at an initial velocity v 0 range of 0 2 10 m s and the other boundaries of the domain are free slip boundaries in fig 3b the water mass inlet is the velocity boundary v 0 the outlet is the opening boundary with a gauge pressure of zero and the other boundaries are the same as in fig 3a e the total calculation time is 0 1 s and the simulation step is 0 001 s the case with a sample water content of 157 and v 0 of 1 m s is taken as an example to compare the velocity fields at soil water interfaces before and after the equivalent simulation as shown in fig 4 here velocities at the centre of soils point 1 in the x y section image and the soil water interfaces points 2 8 are simply used to represent the general characteristics of overall interfaces in the x y section are both involved comparison of the results shows that the centre velocity values point 1 between the prototype state and the equivalent simulation state are very close and have the same movement direction the values are 0 86 m s and 0 83 m s respectively for the velocities at the soil water interfaces points 2 8 although their values are different the distributions of the velocity fields are similar where the velocities at the top interface points 4 6 of the soil samples are the largest and the velocities at one side points 6 8 with the same direction as the sliding soils are larger than those at the other side points 2 4 therefore the velocity fields at the soil water interfaces between the experiment and prototype are comparable and the equivalent simulation method used in this study is reasonable the results show that the average interface shear stresses in the experiment and the prototype are 5 90 10 2 pa and 2 90 10 2 pa respectively these shear stress values are significantly larger than the critical shear stress 0 14 10 2 pa calculated by the shields method eqs 1 3 meaning that the mass transfer process inevitably occurs in the experiments then an equivalent relation for the mass transfer flux between the experiment dm w dt and the prototype dm s dt of this example can be obtained by entering these shear stress values into eq 5 that is dm w dt 2 09 dm s dt considering all simulation cases the kaolin samples with two water contents of 112 and 157 and different velocities from 0 2 m s to 10 m s the equivalent simulation relation for the mass transport flux at soil water interfaces can be obtained using the same analytical method as the above example 6 d m w d t δ d m s d t where δ is the equivalent simulation coefficient which can be selected in fig 5 the variation trend in fig 5 shows that the equivalent simulation coefficient increases first and then decreases at a turning point of 1 m s with increasing velocities from 0 2 m s to 10 m s in addition the equivalent coefficient of the soil sample with a water content of 157 is higher than that of the soil sample with a water content of 112 this result occurs mainly because the soil sample with a higher water content has a lower critical shear stress and the equivalent coefficient is then higher at the same velocity in addition the equivalent simulation coefficients are all larger than 1 meaning that the mass transfer process in the experiment is stronger than that in the prototype 3 2 experimental calibration relations to realize the conversion of soil electrical resistivity results measured directly from experiments to the mass transfer value m w kg m2 at soil water interfaces the electrical resistivity testing device should be used to calibrate their conversion relations and the calibration device is shown in fig 6 a first the soil samples water contents range from 110 5 160 1 which can cover the sample water contents in the formal experiments are placed into a plexiglass box with a size of 0 2 0 2 0 08 m the size of soil samples is approximately consistent with that in the experiment and some probe holes are presented on the surface of the box the electrical resistivity probes are inserted into the box along the preset probe holes and are fixed and the keithley 2602a current supply voltage is set to 5 v and data recording instrument is set to the working state then the soil samples in the box are gradually replaced by water from the box top to downward so that the materials in the electric field formed by the two probes experience a gradual change process of soil soil water mixture water to simulate the mass transfer process of soil particles diffusing into water finally the electric current changes in the above process are continuously recorded by the keithley 2602a instrument the calibration results can be seen in fig 6b where the variation trend of the electrical resistivity data of soil samples of different water contents is basically consistent with increasing water height in the soil box h w which is viewed as 0 m at the box top and increases towards the bottom of the box that is within the influence range of the electric field 0 015 0 0385 m which is slightly larger than the actual position of the probes grey coloured area 0 0175 0 036 m their ratio is approximately 1 27 times formed by the electrical resistivity probes the soil electrical resistivity shows a linearly increasing trend with increasing water height the material in the electric field transfers from soil to water however the soil electrical resistivities are essentially unchanged at 2 72 ω m all soil material and 5 33 ω m all water before entering the electric field and after passing the electric field then the coordinate system between the electrical resistivity and water height is returned to 0 based on the electric field influence range using a horizontal value of 0 015 m and a vertical value of 2 72 ω m as the starting point and their relations can be expressed as 7 ρ r 111 06 h w according to the size of soil samples in the test box the water height parameters h w can be expressed by the mass transfer values at soil water interfaces m w h w v w a w m w a w ρ ω m w ρ ω where v w and m w are the volume and mass of diffused soils m3 and kg respectively a w is the cross sectional area of the test box 0 016 m2 and ρ ω is the density of soils with a water content of ω kg m3 thus the calibration relations between the electrical resistivity of soil samples and the mass transfer values at soil water interfaces are shown in eq 8 within the influence range of the electric field formed by the electrical resistivity probes in the formal flume experiments of this study the variation in mass transfer values at soil water interfaces can be determined inversely by the soil resistivity data during the experiments according to the calibration relations 8 m w ρ r ρ ω 111 06 4 test results and discussion based on the above equivalent simulation relation eq 6 and calibration relation eq 8 the average mass transfer flux at soil water interfaces of submarine sliding soils can be obtained via the designed flume testing system taking the soil sample with a water content of 157 as an example changes in soil electrical resistivity over time under different velocity conditions 1 16 2 05 m s can be seen in fig 7 the results show that all the electrical resistivities of soil samples at different velocity conditions increase over time and basically remain stable at a mean value after the soil mass completely diffuses in the test range of the electrical resistivity probes where the total changed value of soil electrical resistivity corresponding to the velocities of 1 35 2 05 m s is the same at 2 61 ω m which is consistent with the calibration results in fig 6b however the soil electrical resistivity change at 1 16 m s velocity is obviously smaller than others due to the water depletion in water tank 1 it can also be found that the higher the water velocity conditions are the faster the soil electrical resistivity reaches a stable value this trend reveals that the velocity of submarine sliding soils should be an important factor influencing the mass transfer process in addition there is a significant data surge in the electrical resistivity time curve at a velocity of 1 35 m s mainly due to the sudden separation of a part of the soil block from parent soils under the action of flowing water then the results of soil electrical resistivity over time for the samples with two water contents can be converted to average mass transfer fluxes based on eqs 6 and 8 as shown in table 2 on the one hand the flux shows more intuitively the important influence of velocity conditions on the mass transfer process that is a higher velocity leads to a larger mass transfer flux on the other hand the average mass transfer flux of soil samples with a water content of 157 is significantly larger than that of soil samples with a water content of 112 at same velocity conditions that may be because the soils with a higher water content usually have a lower shear strength s u pa i e the capacity of resisting shear stress of soils which has a positive correlation with shear strain rate γ s 1 the ratio of them s u γ is the apparent viscosity μ app pa s characterizing the internal friction of a non newtonian fluid when it flows as shown in eq 9 in other words the mass transfer process at interfaces of the sliding body with a lower shear strength or apparent viscosity is stronger under the same velocities for a herschel bulkley fluid zakeri et al 2008 9 s u τ y k γ n thus s u γ μ app τ y γ k γ n 1 where τ y is the yield shear strength of soils pa k is the viscosity coefficient pa s n n is the fluid parameter to further quantify the influences of these parameters on the mass transfer flux the velocity and shear strength of submarine sliding soils can be normalised to a dimensionless parameter re non newtonian based on the study of zakeri et al 2008 the parameter re non newtonian is a representation of the reynolds number of non newtonian fluids such as submarine sliding soils whose expression is shown in eq 10 besides the results of average mass transfer flux per unit width dm s w dt where w is the width of the sliding body m w 0 08m in this study are constructed to a non dimensional relationship by the apparent viscosity μ app the relations between the normalised mass transfer flux and re non newtonian can be given as shown in fig 8 10 r e non newtonian ρ v 2 μ app γ ρ v 2 s u it can be seen from fig 8 that the mass transfer fluxes of kaolin samples with two different contents approximately 2 and 3 times the soil liquid limit have the same increasing trend with increasing re non newtonian reflecting essential characteristics of the mass transfer process at soil water interfaces of submarine sliding soils that are dependent on the hydrodynamic action and material properties with the movement of submarine sliding soils with a weaker material property low shear strength and apparent viscosity or higher run out velocity there are more soil particles diffusing into water to form turbidity currents that rule is also in line with the actual situation of submarine slide movement in nature that is the turbidity currents are mainly generated at the debris flow stage weaker materials and accompanied by a higher sliding velocity compared with the intact soil block glided from the place where the slope loses stability nisbet and piper 1998 dong 2016 therefore an empirical prediction equation for the average mass transfer flux during the movement of viscous marine sliding soils can be proposed as follows 11 d m s w d t μ app 2 06 10 8 r e non newtonian 2 7 r 2 0 992 although the effects of some complex factors such as vortices and material particle sizes lee 2019 are not discussed in this paper the research methodology proposed in this study can achieve good results for the mass transfer flux at the soil water interfaces of submarine sliding soils and the mass transfer flux parameters are determined by a preliminary quantitative analysis using typical fine grained kaolin soils in the application of the prediction equation eq 11 the average mass transfer flux at soil water interfaces during the movement of submarine slides can be predicted simply according to their flow velocity conditions and material properties shear strength and apparent viscosity 5 conclusions to study the mass transfer process during the movement of submarine slides a flume testing system is first designed referring to an equivalent simulation method the actual process during the movement of submarine sliding soils in water is equivalently simulated as a process of water flowing through soil samples then the validity of the equivalent simulation in this study is verified by the velocity and shear stress fields at soil water interfaces via a numerical approach and equivalence relations for the mass transfer flux between the experiment and the prototype are established based on the critical shear stress conditions moreover the calibration relations for the electrical resistivity testing device in experiments are given to monitor the mass transfer process at soil water interfaces kaolin clay with different water contents 112 and 157 which are approximately 2 and 3 times the liquid limit of soils respectively is adopted for the soil samples in experiments for different velocities from 1 16 m s to 2 05 m s the average mass transfer flux at the soil water interfaces of submarine sliding soils is investigated using the flume testing system the results show that the velocity conditions and material properties shear strength and apparent viscosity of submarine sliding soils are two important factors influencing the mass transfer process the average mass transfer flux at soil water interfaces increases with increasing velocity or decreasing soil shear strength or apparent viscosity finally the above two factors with significant influence are normalised and an empirical prediction equation for the average mass transfer flux at soil water interfaces during the movement of viscous marine sliding soils by reynolds numbers is proposed the prediction equation for the mass transfer flux during the movement of submarine soils fills the gaps in related research fields to a certain extent and contributes to the assessment and simulation of submarine slide hazards however this prediction equation still has limitations in modelling without considering more soil particle grading conditions and sample water contents it is recommended to conduct further physical experiments to obtain more measured data

21528,historically frequent submarine slide hazards have directly or indirectly caused much devastating damage to offshore infrastructure resulting in large economic losses that have attracted increasing international attention previous studies have focused more on the characteristics of submarine slides themselves kinematics sedimentology etc but studies on the interaction between submarine sliding soils and the ambient water that affects these characteristics are relatively limited in this paper the mass transfer process at soil water interfaces during submarine slide motions at different velocities is investigated by a series of experiments using a carefully designed flume testing system the results show that the extent of the mass transfer process at soil water interfaces mainly depends on the velocity and material properties shear strength and apparent viscosity of submarine sliding soils based on the experimental results an empirical prediction equation for average mass transfer flux parameters at soil water interfaces during movements of viscous marine sliding soils is recommended providing a new reference for assessing the characteristics of submarine slides keywords submarine slides turbidity currents mass transfer electrical resistivity 1 introduction submarine slides are a frequent type of ocean geohazards triggered by earthquakes gas hydrate dissociation waves and other factors jia et al 2016 usually showing the phenomenon of large scale marine soil sliding for long run out distances guo et al 2020 during the movement of submarine slides sliding soils often exhibit a characteristic staged evolution under the complicated influence of the ambient water from the instability to sedimentation of submarine sliding soils they mainly experience the stages of slope failure intact soil blocks debris flows and turbidity currents nisbet and piper 1998 sassa and sekiguchi 2010 fan et al 2018 wang et al 2018 guo et al 2019 these currents can easily lead to a wide subaqueous danger area near the submarine slide zone in particular for some offshore infrastructure on the seabed e g submarine pipelines and cables the sliding soils with relatively high strength and density at the early sliding stage not only have strong destructive effects on this infrastructure e g some accidents have been caused by submarine slides an oil spill from submarine pipelines of the texaco company usa 1977 zhang 2004 and damage to submarine optical cables in the luzon strait china 2006 hsu and sibuet 2009 but also develop serious turbidity currents at the later sliding stage e g some submarine electric cables near southwestern taiwan island china were fractured by turbidity currents carter et al 2012 it is clear that investigating how submarine sliding soils evolve into turbidity currents is necessary to evaluate the hazard characteristics of submarine slides and their engineering prevention and control some careful studies e g mohrig et al 1998 mohrig and marr 2003 ilstad et al 2004 zakeri et al 2008 lee 2019 found that the suspended soil particles generated during the submarine slide motion and the evolutionary trend to turbidity currents are mainly due to the difference in density between the submarine sliding soils and water the density ratio between the former and latter is generally 1 2 the mass of submarine sliding soils transfer into the ambient water at the soil water interface a process that can be called the mass transfer to analyse the mass transfer characteristics of the submarine slide motion previous studies have made some valuable attempts for example mohrig et al 1998 used rakes of vertically stacked siphons to collect the turbid water in their flume model tests analysing the variations in water density during the movement of simulated submarine slides which can reflect the degree of the mass transfer process to a certain extent further mohrig and marr 2003 studied the mass transfer process from debris flows to turbidity currents by the difference recognition of acoustic reflectance from a reversible ultrasonic transducer and proposed a theoretical model to describe the mass transfer process during the movement of submarine slides additionally using a particle tracking technique to capture the process of soil particles detaching into the water ilstad et al 2004 discussed the influence of submarine sliding soil material on the mass transfer process however the above testing methods of the siphon collection technique acoustic reflectance imaging technique and particle tracking technique are still difficult to apply to effectively and quantitatively study a key parameter the mass transfer flux units of kg m2 s which can represent the mass of submarine sliding soils transferred to the ambient water per unit area and time the lack of a mass transfer flux parameter leads to neglecting the influence of mass transfers at soil water interfaces in some numerical modelling of submarine slide motions e g zakeri et al 2009 liu et al 2015 dong 2016 fan et al 2019 which may have unknown effects on some numerical simulation results on this basis this paper focuses on the debris flow stage of submarine slide motion that is the submarine soils have been triggered to failure and slide on the seabed with a certain velocity the mass transfer process at interfaces between submarine sliding soils and their ambient water is investigated based on experiments using a self designed flume testing system the main factors affecting the mass transfer process during submarine slide motions are discussed based on the test results and a preliminary prediction equation for the average mass transfer flux at soil water interfaces during the movement of submarine sliding soil is given the key aim of this study is to provide a reference for the assessment and simulation of submarine slide hazards 2 methodology 2 1 theoretical basis in theory the mass transfer process reflects the diffusibility of particles from high density materials to low density materials the mass transfer process during submarine slide motion should be subject to the conservation of mass that is the diffusible mass from submarine sliding soil to the ambient water as shown in fig 1 mohrig and marr 2003 describe this part of the mass as r h l h ε p t where r h is the erosion rate of the sliding soil head m s l h is the arc length for the section of the head subject to erosion m ε p is the average density of the sliding soil kg m3 and t is some given interval of time s is equal to the mass of suspended turbidity currents which can be described as ε t a t where ε t is the average density of the suspended soil within the current kg m3 and a t is the total volume of the turbidity current per unit width m2 without considering the turbidity redeposition in general the occurrence of the mass transfer process from high density materials to low density materials requires the subjected dynamic action to reach the critical beginning conditions for the material particles there are usually three expressions for the critical conditions wang et al 2014 stress flow velocity or power in this study the critical shear stress τ cr units of pa is used as a criterion for the occurrence of the mass transfer process during the movement of a submarine slide in water that is whether the shear stress of the water flow at soil water interfaces of the submarine sliding soil motion exceeds the critical resisting shear capacity of soil particles here the sliding soils are assumed to be uniform and the mass transfer process is considered to be particle based as shown in the partial enlargement in fig 1 a single soil particle several ovals simple represent fine grained soil particles is taken as an example it is mainly affected by the resultant action between the shear force of water flow decomposed into drag and lift forces particle gravity and viscous resistance caused by other particles along the shear direction of water once the shear force of water flow exceeds the gravity and viscous resistance of the particle it is sheared away from the parent sliding soil and enters the water to form a suspended turbidity current which satisfies the force balance therefore the shear stress state at the soil water interfaces of submarine sliding soil motion is very important for studying the mass transport process for viscous marine soils the critical shear stress can be estimated according to the shields method wen et al 2016 as follows 1 τ cr g θ cr ε p ε w d 50 2 θ cr 0 3 1 1 2 d 0 055 1 e 0 02 d 3 d g s 1 η w 1 3 d 50 where g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 θ cr is the critical shields coefficient ε w is the density

flow m2 s 2 2 experimental facility to realize the purpose of monitoring the mass transfer process during the movement of submarine slides a flume testing system is designed for this study see fig 2 referring to an equivalent simulation method from previous studies e g gauer et al 2005 sahdi et al 2014 the actual process during the movement of submarine sliding soil dynamic portion in water static portion is equivalently simulated as a process of the water dynamic portion flowing through soil samples static portion in fig 2 the total testing system includes a power water supply component water tank 1 with a variable frequency pump pipes and outlet a water environment component water tank 2 and u type channel testing components flowmeter electrical resistivity probes and cameras and other auxiliary components such as a collecting tank computer and supports the size of water tank 1 is 1 4 0 8 0 8 m and the power water supply component can realize stable and adjustable flow velocities in a range of 1 16 2 05 m s under the control of the variable frequency pump maximum flow rate of 15 000 l h and power ranging from 18 180 w the sizes of water tank 2 and the u type channel are 1 4 0 7 0 6 m and 1 0 0 3 0 2 m respectively and the flowmeter is a fluxus f601 ultrasonic flowmeter produced by the flexim company berlin germany which is suitable for testing flow velocities from 0 01 25 m s the electrical resistivity probes are the core part of the testing system for monitoring the mass transfer process based on a working principle of establishing links between the variations in electrical resistance exhibited by the soils in the applied electric field usually characterized by a parameter named the soil electrical resistivity ρ r ω m which is defined by the ohm s law as shown in eq 4 fukue et al 1999 samouëlian et al 2005 and the masses of soil samples and the detailed device for electrical resistivity testing in this study uses two electrode probes the probes are 0 02 m in length and 0 00125 m in diameter and the gap between the two electrodes is 0 0185 m with a keithley 2602a current supply and data recording instrument tektronix inc beaverton oregon usa minimum current is 1 0 10 12 a two cameras with a resolution of 2 million pixels are set on the outlet head and in the water tank 2 but the cameras failed to play their expected role because the water became turbid too rapidly after the beginning of the experiment 4 ρ r r s p l u s p i l where r is the electrical resistance ω s p is the electrode cross sectional area m2 l is the electrode gap m u is the voltage v and i is the current a the main experimental steps in this study are as follows a before the start of experiments valve 1 is closed and water tank 1 is filled with water b the soil sample maintaining an approximate cross sectional area of 0 2 0 08 m is placed on the simulated seabed here the simulated seabed is rough sheet material to avoid the effect of soil material seabed on the mass transfer measurements which refers to the seabed setting from zakeri et al 2008 in the u type channel two electrical resistivity probes are inserted into one side of the soil sample and the keithley 2602a current supply voltage is set to 5 v and data recording instrument is set to the working state c valve 2 is closed and water tank 2 is filled with water until the soil sample has been completely submerged in water to a certain depth d after the experiment starts valve 1 is first opened so that the water in the pipe connects water tank 1 and tank 2 while ensuring that the flowmeter is open to the working position e starting the variable frequency pump to a target velocity level valve 2 of water tank 2 is opened with the continuous action of the flowing water suspended turbidity currents gradually form at the soil water interfaces of soil samples until the soil mass within the electric field covered by the electrical resistivity probes is completely diffused i e the keithley 2602a electrical current value in no longer changes then the experiment stops in addition after the turbid water in the collecting tank is settled to clean the clean water is pumped into water tank 1 to recycle and avoid waste soil samples in this study consist of commercially supplied kaolin soils which are usually used to simulate real marine soft clay in the laboratory e g zakeri et al 2008 gue 2012 sahdi et al 2014 the index properties of the kaolin are determined using the china standard and are reported in table 1 the soil samples are prepared by the vacuum stirred method combined with isotropic consolidation the detailed sample preparation process is shown as follows a dry kaolin soils and water were first poured into a vacuum stirred tank with an initial water content of 180 and the samples were sufficiently mixed for 2 h under a certain of vacuum pressure b the samples are continuously and quickly slide into a sample preparation box to reduce air infiltration c under a light uniform pressure 0 56 kpa the samples are consolidated and drained until the required water content was reached through this process the uniform soil samples can be prepared for testing the soil water contents prepared in this study are 112 approximately 2 times the liquid limit of the kaolin clay and 157 approximately 3 times the liquid limit which can basically characterize the high water content and low strength characteristics of typical fluidized submarine sliding soils the corresponding average densities of soil samples are 1347 and 1262 kg m3 respectively moreover the mass transfer flux derived from the experimental scale and the flux on the natural scale is similar through distorted scale modelling given the description from the study by mohrig and marr 2003 the similarity relationship for some important parameters in this study between experimental and prototype scales can be derived as a velocity v unit in m s v e λ 0 5 v p b time t unit in s t e λ 0 5 t p c mass transfer values per unit area m s unit in kg m2 m s e λ m s p where λ is the similarity scale ratio the subscript e and p of these parameters refer to the experimental and prototype scales respectively the similarity relationship contributes to applying the research results of this study in engineering 3 equivalent simulation and calibration 3 1 equivalent simulation relations to verify the validity of the equivalent simulation method used in this study and establish equivalence relations for the mass transfer flux between the experiment and prototype the shear stress state at soil water interfaces before and after the equivalent simulation are compared and analysed based on a relation between the shear stress and mass transfer flux from the mass transfer theory of viscous marine soils as follows 5 d m w d t m τ b τ c r 1 where dm w dt is the mass transfer flux from the experiment kg m2 s τ b is the shear stress of water flow pa and m is a suspension coefficient considering the difficulty of using physical experiments to test the shear stress at soil water interfaces during the movement of submarine slides the relatively stable commercial computational fluid dynamics cfd software ansys cfx is employed to extract the velocity and shear stress fields at the soil water interfaces before and after the equivalent simulation the ansys cfx numerical software has accumulated rich experience in simulating the movement of submarine slides in water e g gauer et al 2005 xie et al 2016 the algorithm used by the software solver is the finite volume method detailed theoretical information about the numerical method can be found in the study by zakeri et al 2009 in this study the cfd method is used to simulate two situations the movement of submarine sliding soils in water prototype and the water flowing through soil samples experiment for simplification an approximated rectangular submarine sliding body is used meaning that the morphology of the soil water interface is seen as a plane the specific numerical model settings see fig 3 are as follows a the model size is the same as the experiment size b there are 120 000 tetrahedral elements in total with a maximum grid size of 0 02 m in the simulation domain c the rheological strength models of soil samples are tested by a combination method nian et al 2019 and expressed as a typical form of herschel bulkley fluid zakeri et al 2008 that is s u 1 125 20 γ 0 2 for the sample with 112 water content and s u 2 16 2 5 γ 0 2 for the sample with 157 water content the water is a newtonian fluid with a density of 1025 kg m3 and viscosity of 0 00167 pa s d in fig 3a the bottom boundary of the domain is set as a rough no slip surface with an equivalent roughness of 0 5 mm the soil sample starts moving at an initial velocity v 0 range of 0 2 10 m s and the other boundaries of the domain are free slip boundaries in fig 3b the water mass inlet is the velocity boundary v 0 the outlet is the opening boundary with a gauge pressure of zero and the other boundaries are the same as in fig 3a e the total calculation time is 0 1 s and the simulation step is 0 001 s the case with a sample water content of 157 and v 0 of 1 m s is taken as an example to compare the velocity fields at soil water interfaces before and after the equivalent simulation as shown in fig 4 here velocities at the centre of soils point 1 in the x y section image and the soil water interfaces points 2 8 are simply used to represent the general characteristics of overall interfaces in the x y section are both involved comparison of the results shows that the centre velocity values point 1 between the prototype state and the equivalent simulation state are very close and have the same movement direction the values are 0 86 m s and 0 83 m s respectively for the velocities at the soil water interfaces points 2 8 although their values are different the distributions of the velocity fields are similar where the velocities at the top interface points 4 6 of the soil samples are the largest and the velocities at one side points 6 8 with the same direction as the sliding soils are larger than those at the other side points 2 4 therefore the velocity fields at the soil water interfaces between the experiment and prototype are comparable and the equivalent simulation method used in this study is reasonable the results show that the average interface shear stresses in the experiment and the prototype are 5 90 10 2 pa and 2 90 10 2 pa respectively these shear stress values are significantly larger than the critical shear stress 0 14 10 2 pa calculated by the shields method eqs 1 3 meaning that the mass transfer process inevitably occurs in the experiments then an equivalent relation for the mass transfer flux between the experiment dm w dt and the prototype dm s dt of this example can be obtained by entering these shear stress values into eq 5 that is dm w dt 2 09 dm s dt considering all simulation cases the kaolin samples with two water contents of 112 and 157 and different velocities from 0 2 m s to 10 m s the equivalent simulation relation for the mass transport flux at soil water interfaces can be obtained using the same analytical method as the above example 6 d m w d t δ d m s d t where δ is the equivalent simulation coefficient which can be selected in fig 5 the variation trend in fig 5 shows that the equivalent simulation coefficient increases first and then decreases at a turning point of 1 m s with increasing velocities from 0 2 m s to 10 m s in addition the equivalent coefficient of the soil sample with a water content of 157 is higher than that of the soil sample with a water content of 112 this result occurs mainly because the soil sample with a higher water content has a lower critical shear stress and the equivalent coefficient is then higher at the same velocity in addition the equivalent simulation coefficients are all larger than 1 meaning that the mass transfer process in the experiment is stronger than that in the prototype 3 2 experimental calibration relations to realize the conversion of soil electrical resistivity results measured directly from experiments to the mass transfer value m w kg m2 at soil water interfaces the electrical resistivity testing device should be used to calibrate their conversion relations and the calibration device is shown in fig 6 a first the soil samples water contents range from 110 5 160 1 which can cover the sample water contents in the formal experiments are placed into a plexiglass box with a size of 0 2 0 2 0 08 m the size of soil samples is approximately consistent with that in the experiment and some probe holes are presented on the surface of the box the electrical resistivity probes are inserted into the box along the preset probe holes and are fixed and the keithley 2602a current supply voltage is set to 5 v and data recording instrument is set to the working state then the soil samples in the box are gradually replaced by water from the box top to downward so that the materials in the electric field formed by the two probes experience a gradual change process of soil soil water mixture water to simulate the mass transfer process of soil particles diffusing into water finally the electric current changes in the above process are continuously recorded by the keithley 2602a instrument the calibration results can be seen in fig 6b where the variation trend of the electrical resistivity data of soil samples of different water contents is basically consistent with increasing water height in the soil box h w which is viewed as 0 m at the box top and increases towards the bottom of the box that is within the influence range of the electric field 0 015 0 0385 m which is slightly larger than the actual position of the probes grey coloured area 0 0175 0 036 m their ratio is approximately 1 27 times formed by the electrical resistivity probes the soil electrical resistivity shows a linearly increasing trend with increasing water height the material in the electric field transfers from soil to water however the soil electrical resistivities are essentially unchanged at 2 72 ω m all soil material and 5 33 ω m all water before entering the electric field and after passing the electric field then the coordinate system between the electrical resistivity and water height is returned to 0 based on the electric field influence range using a horizontal value of 0 015 m and a vertical value of 2 72 ω m as the starting point and their relations can be expressed as 7 ρ r 111 06 h w according to the size of soil samples in the test box the water height parameters h w can be expressed by the mass transfer values at soil water interfaces m w h w v w a w m w a w ρ ω m w ρ ω where v w and m w are the volume and mass of diffused soils m3 and kg respectively a w is the cross sectional area of the test box 0 016 m2 and ρ ω is the density of soils with a water content of ω kg m3 thus the calibration relations between the electrical resistivity of soil samples and the mass transfer values at soil water interfaces are shown in eq 8 within the influence range of the electric field formed by the electrical resistivity probes in the formal flume experiments of this study the variation in mass transfer values at soil water interfaces can be determined inversely by the soil resistivity data during the experiments according to the calibration relations 8 m w ρ r ρ ω 111 06 4 test results and discussion based on the above equivalent simulation relation eq 6 and calibration relation eq 8 the average mass transfer flux at soil water interfaces of submarine sliding soils can be obtained via the designed flume testing system taking the soil sample with a water content of 157 as an example changes in soil electrical resistivity over time under different velocity conditions 1 16 2 05 m s can be seen in fig 7 the results show that all the electrical resistivities of soil samples at different velocity conditions increase over time and basically remain stable at a mean value after the soil mass completely diffuses in the test range of the electrical resistivity probes where the total changed value of soil electrical resistivity corresponding to the velocities of 1 35 2 05 m s is the same at 2 61 ω m which is consistent with the calibration results in fig 6b however the soil electrical resistivity change at 1 16 m s velocity is obviously smaller than others due to the water depletion in water tank 1 it can also be found that the higher the water velocity conditions are the faster the soil electrical resistivity reaches a stable value this trend reveals that the velocity of submarine sliding soils should be an important factor influencing the mass transfer process in addition there is a significant data surge in the electrical resistivity time curve at a velocity of 1 35 m s mainly due to the sudden separation of a part of the soil block from parent soils under the action of flowing water then the results of soil electrical resistivity over time for the samples with two water contents can be converted to average mass transfer fluxes based on eqs 6 and 8 as shown in table 2 on the one hand the flux shows more intuitively the important influence of velocity conditions on the mass transfer process that is a higher velocity leads to a larger mass transfer flux on the other hand the average mass transfer flux of soil samples with a water content of 157 is significantly larger than that of soil samples with a water content of 112 at same velocity conditions that may be because the soils with a higher water content usually have a lower shear strength s u pa i e the capacity of resisting shear stress of soils which has a positive correlation with shear strain rate γ s 1 the ratio of them s u γ is the apparent viscosity μ app pa s characterizing the internal friction of a non newtonian fluid when it flows as shown in eq 9 in other words the mass transfer process at interfaces of the sliding body with a lower shear strength or apparent viscosity is stronger under the same velocities for a herschel bulkley fluid zakeri et al 2008 9 s u τ y k γ n thus s u γ μ app τ y γ k γ n 1 where τ y is the yield shear strength of soils pa k is the viscosity coefficient pa s n n is the fluid parameter to further quantify the influences of these parameters on the mass transfer flux the velocity and shear strength of submarine sliding soils can be normalised to a dimensionless parameter re non newtonian based on the study of zakeri et al 2008 the parameter re non newtonian is a representation of the reynolds number of non newtonian fluids such as submarine sliding soils whose expression is shown in eq 10 besides the results of average mass transfer flux per unit width dm s w dt where w is the width of the sliding body m w 0 08m in this study are constructed to a non dimensional relationship by the apparent viscosity μ app the relations between the normalised mass transfer flux and re non newtonian can be given as shown in fig 8 10 r e non newtonian ρ v 2 μ app γ ρ v 2 s u it can be seen from fig 8 that the mass transfer fluxes of kaolin samples with two different contents approximately 2 and 3 times the soil liquid limit have the same increasing trend with increasing re non newtonian reflecting essential characteristics of the mass transfer process at soil water interfaces of submarine sliding soils that are dependent on the hydrodynamic action and material properties with the movement of submarine sliding soils with a weaker material property low shear strength and apparent viscosity or higher run out velocity there are more soil particles diffusing into water to form turbidity currents that rule is also in line with the actual situation of submarine slide movement in nature that is the turbidity currents are mainly generated at the debris flow stage weaker materials and accompanied by a higher sliding velocity compared with the intact soil block glided from the place where the slope loses stability nisbet and piper 1998 dong 2016 therefore an empirical prediction equation for the average mass transfer flux during the movement of viscous marine sliding soils can be proposed as follows 11 d m s w d t μ app 2 06 10 8 r e non newtonian 2 7 r 2 0 992 although the effects of some complex factors such as vortices and material particle sizes lee 2019 are not discussed in this paper the research methodology proposed in this study can achieve good results for the mass transfer flux at the soil water interfaces of submarine sliding soils and the mass transfer flux parameters are determined by a preliminary quantitative analysis using typical fine grained kaolin soils in the application of the prediction equation eq 11 the average mass transfer flux at soil water interfaces during the movement of submarine slides can be predicted simply according to their flow velocity conditions and material properties shear strength and apparent viscosity 5 conclusions to study the mass transfer process during the movement of submarine slides a flume testing system is first designed referring to an equivalent simulation method the actual process during the movement of submarine sliding soils in water is equivalently simulated as a process of water flowing through soil samples then the validity of the equivalent simulation in this study is verified by the velocity and shear stress fields at soil water interfaces via a numerical approach and equivalence relations for the mass transfer flux between the experiment and the prototype are established based on the critical shear stress conditions moreover the calibration relations for the electrical resistivity testing device in experiments are given to monitor the mass transfer process at soil water interfaces kaolin clay with different water contents 112 and 157 which are approximately 2 and 3 times the liquid limit of soils respectively is adopted for the soil samples in experiments for different velocities from 1 16 m s to 2 05 m s the average mass transfer flux at the soil water interfaces of submarine sliding soils is investigated using the flume testing system the results show that the velocity conditions and material properties shear strength and apparent viscosity of submarine sliding soils are two important factors influencing the mass transfer process the average mass transfer flux at soil water interfaces increases with increasing velocity or decreasing soil shear strength or apparent viscosity finally the above two factors with significant influence are normalised and an empirical prediction equation for the average mass transfer flux at soil water interfaces during the movement of viscous marine sliding soils by reynolds numbers is proposed the prediction equation for the mass transfer flux during the movement of submarine soils fills the gaps in related research fields to a certain extent and contributes to the assessment and simulation of submarine slide hazards however this prediction equation still has limitations in modelling without considering more soil particle grading conditions and sample water contents it is recommended to conduct further physical experiments to obtain more measured data

21529,with the establishment of satellite constellations and terrestrial networks of automatic identification system ais receivers an increasing number of ship trajectories have become available and the data size of trajectories that must be recorded is increasing as a result transmitting processing and storing data have become important issues at the same time ship behaviour information is hidden in ais data hence an effective method is required to not only compress redundant information but also maintain the main characteristic elements included in the trajectory in this paper a novel algorithm considering the spatial and motion features of trajectories is designed which can compress ais trajectories based on ship behaviour characteristics the proposed algorithm has two main parts the douglas peucker dp algorithm is employed to simplify trajectories according to spatial features and a sliding window is adopted to simplify trajectories based on motion features furthermore statistical theory is applied to help determine the thresholds of motion features in sliding window algorithms the two results are merged to form a trajectory simplification algorithm that considers ship behaviours to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm numerical experiments are performed the results indicate that the proposed algorithm can efficiently simplify trajectories by considering ship behaviour as needed keywords water traffic automatic identification system ais ship behaviours trajectory compression 1 introduction the automatic identification system ais which is a kind of tracking and self reporting system can identify and locate vessels by communication among nearby ships satellites and base stations it is required that international voyaging ships with a gross tonnage greater than 300 and all passenger ships must be equipped with the ais as application of the ais has become more widespread a large number of vessel movement tracks have been provided each ship broadcasts ais information including statistical information and dynamic information at a time interval in the range of two to 6 min which is determined by their motion international telecommunications union 2014 the department in charge of maritime transportation acknowledges that there are thousands of ais messages that must be routinely dealt with every second hammond and peters 2012 this means that it is overwhelming to employ enough human and machine operators to deal with this amount of information an efficient compression algorithm could improve these conditions it is increasingly common for authorities to receive ais messages from space pallotta et al 2013 which provides an efficient method for monitoring vessel behaviour and performing duties however the channel bandwidth of satellites is usually limited and it is also necessary to apply efficient data compression to transmit satellite based ais information in traffic analysis there is no doubt that it is less efficient to display trajectories and analyse macroscopic traffic flow situations when the number of ais trajectories is large simplification algorithms that compress redundant information are crucial in actual applications the compression of ais trajectories is an important procedure in pre processing data zhao and shi 2019 adopted the douglas peucker dp algorithm to simplify ais trajectory position information and then cluster trajectories according to dynamic time warping dtw the dp algorithm simultaneously guarantees the clustering results and reduces the computational complexity if the compression algorithm can be executed by considering dynamic information of ais data it can also promote efficient network abstraction of multi vessel trajectory data varlamis et al 2019 kontopoulos et al 2019 hence an excellent compression algorithm is required to not only compress redundant position information but also retain the ship behaviour information included in the trajectory as previously described obtaining an effective simplifying algorithm for compressing superfluous position information while preserving important dynamic information is important and meaningful qi and zheng 2016 designed an algorithm to recognize deviation in the course of a vessel and extract significant points of the trajectory for simplification both clustering techniques and distributed processing techniques were adopted by spiliopoulos et al 2017 to transform massive spatiotemporal ais data into information which was beneficial for understanding variation trends in global trade patroumpas et al 2017 proposed a system to monitor maritime activity and recognize important changes in trajectories their system can identify salient points that reflect movement features such as turning slowing and stopping along every trajectory to perform online data reduction ais trajectories are a kind of line that includes ship behaviour characteristics therefore line simplification theory can be applied in ais trajectories the dp algorithm douglas and peucker 1973 ramer 1972 which is an effective and precise method has been extensively applied to simplify line data meratnia and rolf 2004 muckell et al 2010 2014 and moving objective trajectories in terms of vessel trajectories the dp algorithm was employed by etienne et al 2012 to compress the number of positions of trajectories while preserving the salient positions to lower the time cost of vessel traffic pattern recognition their experiment which was carried out based on 104 201 records showed that the compression rate could reach 84 54 with thresholds set to 10 m li et al 2010 designed a method that takes the time attribute of vessel trajectories into account they regarded a vessel trajectory as a line located in three dimensional space their experiment with 30 000 records concluded that the proposed method could preserve additional salient points that could retain more characteristic details about the speed of a trajectory a similarity study was carried out by zhu et al 2014 the dp algorithm was adopted by de vires and van someren 2012 to achieve stopping and moving points on the ship trajectory zhang et al 2016 also adopted the dp algorithm to simplify trajectories and ship domains in navigational situations to determine thresholds it could ensure that the track points retained on the simplified trajectory were located in the range of the corresponding primary track points the experiment showed that the compression rate reached 98 25 with thresholds set at 0 8 times the length of the ship it used 5 902 840 records from 962 ships in qiong zhou waters li et al 2016 performed several experiments to determine reasonable thresholds while simultaneously taking trajectory simplification and visualization quality into account at present most research focuses on spatial features when simplifying trajectories however few studies simplifying trajectories take both spatial and motion features into account for example zhao and shi 2018 simplified trajectories considering spatial features and variations in course patroumpas et al 2017 performed online reduction of data by considering salient points such as turning points and stopping points as their research target is critical points it is inevitable that some normal points will be discarded there are two drawbacks in these studies on the one hand not all motion features are taken into consideration some studies have focused on speed characteristics while other studies have focused on course characteristics on the other hand although critical points can be retained by some methods this also results in discarding some normal points which means that some clear dynamic information may be ignored hence if more points involved in the motion feature of trajectories can be considered it will be beneficial in retaining more dynamic information used for maritime research and traffic behaviour analysis hence it is necessary to propose an algorithm to achieve this goal furthermore thresholds are also a key factor the threshold has effects on both compression rate and quality reasonable thresholds should ensure that the compression rate is high and that ship behaviour information such as speed variation and course alteration can be retained some methods and experiments have been proposed to reasonably determine thresholds for example zhang et al 2014 made use of the ais based minimum ship domain evaluation method as a criterion for determining thresholds li et al 2016 conducted several experiments to determine appropriate thresholds to guarantee the quality of the trajectory simplification effect and of visualization however threshold optimization is mainly directed at spatial characteristics it is imperative to obtain a method for determining appropriate thresholds for the motion characteristics of trajectories such as speed and course variation to fill this gap in this study we propose an ais trajectory simplification algorithm that considers ship behaviours the contributions of this study are threefold first course over ground and sailing speed as ship behaviour characteristics are considered when trajectories are simplified they are seldom considered together in the previous literature second statistical theory is applied to determine thresholds for course variation and speed variation third a novel simplification algorithm that is based on dp and the sliding window algorithm is proposed and numerical examples are employed to test the algorithm the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the next section introduces the proposed algorithm considering ship behaviours in section 3 numerical examples are provided to test the proposed algorithm section 4 presents the conclusions 2 simplification algorithm for ship trajectories in this section three parts are included first the method for determining thresholds is presented it can choose reasonable simplification thresholds by considering ship behaviour characteristics second a novel simplification method considering ship behaviours is proposed last the compression performance is evaluated based on the compression rate length loss rate and shape similarity 2 1 method of determining thresholds it is compulsory to include an ais transceiver on cargo ships with gross tonnage greater than 500 not engaged in international waters on passenger ships and on ships with gross tonnage greater than 300 and engaged in international waters according to the international maritime organization 1974 when a ship is equipped with an ais transceiver authorities can obtain dynamic and statistical information about it our study centres on dynamic information generally dynamic information includes latitude longitude course over ground cog speed over ground sog and so on most previous studies pay more attention to variations in position because of this deviation in position is used to determine simplification thresholds however many ship behaviours are also hidden in dynamic information such as the alteration of cog and variation in sog for example offices on ships usually operate with a constant course and speed this implies that changes in course and speed are rare hence track points that indicate alterations in course and speed on trajectories have significant meaning they should be retained when trajectories are simplified in reality these points are ignored in most previous studies we propose a method that determines thresholds for simplifying trajectories while considering both spatial features and motion features the method includes two parts one is determining thresholds for position variation the other is determining thresholds for speed and course variation in terms of position variation we employ existing research findings the dp algorithm is adopted to compress position information and a threshold of 0 8 times the ship length as proposed by zhang et al 2016 is utilized in the paper hence we address the major problem of how to determine the thresholds of sog and cog variation as described above great alterations in course and speed are rare however the course and speed often fluctuate with the effect of added resistance from wind and waves on a small scale we assume that the cog alteration and sog variation for every trajectory obey a gaussian distribution as follows 1 θ n μ θ σ θ 2 v n μ v σ v where μ θ is the mean value of the variation in cog for a trajectory σ θ is the standard deviation of the variation in cog for a trajectory and θ is the variation in cog in eq 2 μ v represents the mean speed for a trajectory σ v indicates the standard deviation of the speed for a trajectory and v denotes the speed in this paper μ θ σ θ μ v and σ v are determined by parameter estimation according to statistical theory the arithmetic mean measures the central value of a dataset and the standard deviation quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a dataset they can be utilized to help us determine possible intervals in which the values of the course variation and speed for a trajectory are located if the speed or course variation is not located in the possible interval the operational behaviour may have changed however in a compression algorithm the compression rate should also be considered hence we assume that the variation in course or speed which reaches the requirement shown in eqs 3 and 4 implies that the operational behaviour in a trajectory has changed in these formulas c is the threshold coefficient which is employed not only to quantify the dispersion of ship behaviour but also to determine the compression rate and it should be appropriate for all the trajectories it is apparent that if c is too low more ship behaviour can be retained but the compression rate is decreased in a trajectory if c is too large excessive ship behaviour in a trajectory will be disregarded hence the appropriate threshold coefficient c can assist us in guaranteeing the compression rate while considering ship behaviour and it will be determined by the experiments described in section 3 3 θ μ θ c σ θ o r θ μ θ c σ θ 4 v μ v c σ v o r v μ v c σ θ in these formulas the course variation is calculated as follows as shown in fig 1 θ 0 θ 4 are course alterations ais information is usually updated every 2 s to 3 min depending on speed as presented in table 1 from the update rate we can conclude that the distance between two points such as p 1 and p 2 in fig 1 is not very great this indicates that the distance error can be ignored in the mercator coordinates furthermore the mercator projection is a kind of equal angle projection the angle is not distorted in consideration of these factors we can calculate the course alteration with the cosine law from the mercator coordinates hence eqs 5 8 are adopted to project track points such as p 1 p 2 and p 3 on the trajectory into mercator coordinates and then the cosine law is employed to determine θ θ 0 is obtained from π θ θ 1 θ 4 in fig 1 can also be calculated using a similar method 5 r a cos ϕ 0 1 e 2 sin 2 ϕ 0 6 q ln tan π 4 ϕ 2 1 e sin ϕ 1 e sin ϕ e 2 7 x r λ 8 y r q where ϕ and λ are the latitude and longitude respectively and a is the long radius of the earth ellipsoid e is the first eccentricity of the earth ellipsoid ϕ 0 represents the standard latitude of the mercator projection r is the radius of the parallel circle of the standard latitude q is the isometric latitude 2 2 the proposed simplification algorithm for a ship trajectory 2 2 1 position data simplification in our proposed algorithm position data are still simplified by the dp algorithm this is because excellent compression results are obtained the details of the dp algorithm are presented below in table 2 2 2 2 speed and course data simplification a sliding window simplification algorithm is adopted to simplify speed and course data the core idea of the sliding window simplification algorithm is to copy a fixed number of data points in a window of fixed size if data points located in the sliding window meet the simplification requirement they will be omitted with window sliding we can achieve data simplification the theory of window sliding is illustrated in fig 2 the ais trajectory is regarded as the point set t p p 1 p 2 p n as shown in fig 2 a three track points are included in the sliding window as shown in fig 2 b and they are used to calculate the course variation then the course variation and speed at point p 2 are checked if the requirements are met the point will be retained the points that do not meet the requirement will be omitted then the window moves forward as shown in fig 2 c the procedures are shown in table 3 2 2 3 implementation of the proposed simplification algorithm in our proposed algorithm there are two parts as shown in figure 3 in the first part the dp algorithm and sliding window algorithm are concurrently executed the dp algorithm is utilized to simplify the position data and thresholds are set at 0 8 times the ship length in accordance with the current research results the sliding window algorithm is employed to simplify the speed and course data and statistical theory is adopted to help determine reasonable thresholds for the speed and course variations in the second part a merging operation is available to obtain the union of two simplification results compressed by the dp algorithm and sliding window algorithm which achieves final simplification results by considering the ship behaviours 2 3 compression evaluation in this section the compression effect is evaluated based on the compression rate length loss rate and shape similarity the compression rate is found by dividing the number of discarded track points by the original number of track points the length loss rate is calculated from the simplified trajectories and original trajectories according to eqs 9 12 9 l n 1 n 1 p n p n 1 10 l l l o l s 11 l r l l l o 100 12 c r n n s n 100 where p n p n 1 denotes the distance between two adjacent track points on the trajectories it is apparent that l is the total length of the trajectories ll is the length loss l o is the length of the original trajectory l s is the length of the simplified trajectory lr is the length loss rate cr is the compression rate in eq 12 n is the number of track points on the original trajectory and n s is the number of track points on the simplified trajectory furthermore the dtw distance is employed as shown in eq 13 and 14 to evaluate the spatiotemporal differences between the original trajectory and the simplified trajectory 13 cd i j dist i j min cd i 1 j 1 cd i 1 j cd i j 1 14 d t w c d n n s where cd is the cumulative distance between the ith track point on the original trajectory and the jth track point on the simplified trajectory dist i j is the euclidean distance between the ith track point on the original trajectory and the jth track point on the simplified trajectory in application the running time is also a key evaluation index when a large amount of ais data needs to be simplified hence we also consider the running time in this paper 3 experiment and analysis 3 1 threshold coefficient analysis and determination in general the compression rate can be promoted by setting a higher threshold for the simplification algorithm which means a larger length loss and dtw distance the rule is also appropriate for our research although every trajectory has a different μ θ σ θ μ v and σ v in our research a higher compression rate can still be achieved with a higher threshold coefficient in terms of the same trajectory hence the variation tendency in the compression rate length loss and dtw distance is similar for every trajectory by employing different threshold coefficients if we want to determine a reasonable threshold coefficient for all trajectories we just need to select a trajectory as an example by simultaneously considering the compression rate length loss rate and dtw distance in this section the ship with mmsi 355757000 is considered as an example in fig 4 simplification results with different threshold coefficients are presented in this figure the red line is the original trajectory and green cubes are points retained by the simplification algorithms in fig 5 the compression rates corresponding to fig 4 are shown fig 6 shows the length loss rate of simplified trajectories with different threshold coefficients the dtw distances between simplified trajectories with different threshold coefficients are presented in fig 7 from fig 4 it is concluded that the number of simplified points will decrease as the threshold coefficient increase this can also be demonstrated by the compression rates shown in fig 5 the compression rate increases when higher threshold coefficients are employed however the variation in the compression rate is small when the threshold coefficients are 1 6 and 1 8 and their compression rates are 81 18 and 85 11 respectively furthermore the maximum compression rate is achieved by setting the threshold coefficient to 2 2 its value is 97 30 without loss of generality a higher compression rate means that more points are discarded this finding implies that there is a greater difference between the simplified trajectory and the original trajectory which can be illustrated by the length loss rate and dtw distance as shown in figs 6 and 7 in fig 6 the length loss rate increases when higher threshold coefficients are employed the minimal length loss is achieved when the threshold coefficient is 1 and the maximal length loss rate is obtained by setting the threshold coefficient to 2 2 on the other hand the dtw distance between the simplified trajectory and the original trajectory presents similar characteristics generally the dtw distance is utilized to measure the similarity between two trajectories a greater dtw distance usually indicates that the similarity between two trajectories is lower from fig 7 it is easily concluded that the dtw distance becomes greater between the simplified trajectory and the original trajectory as the threshold coefficients increase in other words the similarity between the simplified trajectory and the original trajectory tends to be lower as the thresholds increase considering the compression rate length loss rate and dtw distance simultaneously we recommend a threshold coefficient of 1 6 according to the experimental results even if the optimal compression rate length loss and dtw distance are not achieved by a threshold coefficient of 1 6 there are two reasons for this first the compression rate with a threshold coefficient of 1 6 reaches 81 18 which can satisfy the requirement of simplification second the simplified trajectory can retain characteristics of the original trajectory to a maximum degree in terms of the dtw distance and length loss rate although the minimal dtw distance and length loss rate are calculated by setting the threshold coefficient to 1 their compression rates are too low to simplify the trajectories based on these observations we conclude that the optimal threshold coefficient is 1 6 3 2 comparison experiments with other algorithms and analysis to further test the proposed simplification algorithm performance it is compared with three other typical simplification algorithms they are the dp algorithm opw sp algorithm and sliding window algorithm keogh et al 2001 and the thresholds in these algorithms are set as follows in the dp algorithm the thresholds are set as 0 8 times the ship length 6 m and 2 m s are employed as thresholds in the opw sp algorithm and the sliding window algorithm adopts 0 5 m as the thresholds in the proposed algorithm the mean speed and course variation are 15 30 kn and 3 36 respectively and the standard deviations of speed and course variation are 0 85 kn and 5 63 respectively furthermore the threshold coefficient is set as 1 6 we continue to take as an example the ship with mmsi 355757000 and the compression results with different algorithms are presented in fig 8 in fig 8 similar to fig 4 the red line is the original trajectory and green cubes are points retained by the different simplification algorithms fig 8 a shows the compression results of the dp algorithm the compression results of the opw sp algorithm are presented in fig 8 b fig 8 c shows the compression results of the sliding window algorithm fig 8 d illustrates the compression results of the proposed algorithm the compression rate achieved by the different algorithms is described in fig 9 and fig 10 presents the length loss rate of the different algorithms fig 8 illustrates that the sliding window algorithm retains more points there are fewer points retained by the proposed algorithm than by the sliding window algorithm the dp algorithm retains the minimum number of points and opw sp is second this can also be concluded from fig 9 in fig 9 the compression rate of the dp algorithm is 99 22 closely followed by the opw sp algorithm 95 56 the compression rate achieved by the sliding window algorithm is minimal 34 25 the dp algorithm compresses trajectories by only considering position information and significant changes in speed and course are disregarded hence the compression rate of the dp algorithm is the highest a higher compression rate means that more points are disregarded and the maximum dtw is achieved by evaluating the similarity with the original trajectory for the sliding window algorithm the intervals for points located in the sliding window are small thus it is not sensitive to threshold variation although the sliding window only considers position information the compression rate is minimal which indicates that a larger number of points are retained hence the length loss rate and dtw distance achieved by the sliding window algorithm are also minimal the results are shown in figs 10 and 11 in fig 10 the length loss rate in the sliding window algorithm is minimal 0 28 and that of the proposed algorithm is the second largest 0 30 the maximum length loss rate 0 64 is achieved by the opw sp algorithm and the length loss rate in the dp algorithm is sub maximal for similarity the sliding window achieves the minimum dtw distance and the maximum dtw distance is calculated by the dp algorithm the sub minimal and sub maximal dtw distances are achieved by the proposed algorithm and the opw sp algorithm respectively this indicates that the trajectory simplified by the sliding window is most similar to the original trajectory and that the proposed algorithm takes second place it is apparent that the proposed algorithm is not always optimal when considering the length loss rate compression rate and dtw distance however the target simplified trajectory is required to retain the characteristics of the trajectory and compress the track points to a maximum degree the proposed algorithm meets these requirements exactly although the compression rate achieved by the proposed algorithm is inferior to those achieved by the dp and opw sp algorithms the proposed algorithm is superior to the dp and opw sp algorithms in terms of similarity this is mainly because the characteristics of speed and course variation in trajectory are considered in the proposed algorithm even so its compression rate still reaches 81 18 which can satisfy the requirement for simplification moreover its length loss rate is less than the length loss rates of the dp and opw sp algorithms in summary the proposed algorithm can guarantee similarity between the simplified trajectory and the original trajectory to a maximum degree and avoid length loss moreover its compression rate can also meet the requirement on this basis we conclude that the proposed algorithm is better than the other algorithms the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm cannot be powerfully tested by a numerical experiment with a single trajectory to further test the compression effectiveness of the proposed method in this study three months of ais data in the chengshan jiao waters were collected from july 2014 to september 2014 as experimental data we utilized the maritime mobile service identity mmsi number to obtain the track point sequence data of all vessels in these waters as ais data can generate errors during collection transmission and reception it is necessary to eliminate possible noise to ensure sufficient data quality in this paper the algorithm based on the fundamental physical law of the vessel movement proposed by qu et al 2011 and zhang et al 2017 is employed to cleanse ais data the data size is shown in tables 4 and 5 in experimental data there are 38 404 081 records of dynamic and static information from 6799 ships and 8 6 of the total data cannot be utilized due to missing information furthermore our experimental data still contain different types of trajectories such as linear trajectories and curved trajectories some representative experimental data presented in fig 12 can illustrate this in summary regardless of the size of experimental data and types of trajectories included in experimental data the requirement of the numerical experiment is met hence the experimental data collected from chengshan jiao waters can be used to verify our proposed compression algorithm according to experimental data the total compression rate running time and length loss rate of the different algorithms achieved in the numerical experiments are presented in fig 13 and fig 14 in terms of compression rate the dp algorithm the opw sp algorithm and the proposed algorithm are not obviously different their compression rates are 95 90 92 62 and 87 31 the maximum difference between their compression rates is 8 59 the optimal length loss rate is achieved by the proposed algorithm in other words the proposed algorithm can achieve the goal of simplifying trajectories by considering course variation and speed however the total running time of the proposed algorithm is longer than that of the other algorithms it takes 3870 7 s the minimum time cost is obtained by the dp algorithm which takes 2109 8 s the difference in time cost is 1760 9 s between the two algorithms in practice considering both the course variation and speed makes computation more complex it is inevitable that this will increase the total running time however this increase can be mitigated by distributed computation when mass ais data need to be simplified thus we can simultaneously guarantee the superiority of the proposed algorithm and optimize the running time 4 conclusion this paper proposes a simplification algorithm that considers spatial and motion features there are two novelties in our proposed algorithm first the simplification algorithm is based on dp and the sliding window algorithm in the proposed algorithm the dp algorithm is utilized to simplify trajectories by considering position characteristics and the sliding window algorithm is employed to compress trajectories by considering course variation and speed characteristics second thresholds are the key factor in trajectory simplification in this paper we propose a method that is based on statistical theory to determine the thresholds for motion features furthermore the proposed method can adjust threshold coefficients according to requirements if we want to retain more ship behaviours the threshold coefficient can be set to a low value if a high compression rate is required we can set the threshold coefficient to a high value hence the proposed method has strong flexibility to test the performance of the proposed algorithm numerical experiments are employed the results show that the proposed algorithm has better comprehensive performance than the other algorithms it can guarantee a compression rate by considering ship behaviours in contrast to other algorithms our research also has drawbacks for example the threshold coefficient cannot be determined adaptively and the running time is high in future research a method for adaptively determining the threshold coefficient should be designed and a distribution algorithm should be employed to optimize the running time when mass ais data need to be simplified furthermore the proposed method could also be adopted to simplify ais

21529,with the establishment of satellite constellations and terrestrial networks of automatic identification system ais receivers an increasing number of ship trajectories have become available and the data size of trajectories that must be recorded is increasing as a result transmitting processing and storing data have become important issues at the same time ship behaviour information is hidden in ais data hence an effective method is required to not only compress redundant information but also maintain the main characteristic elements included in the trajectory in this paper a novel algorithm considering the spatial and motion features of trajectories is designed which can compress ais trajectories based on ship behaviour characteristics the proposed algorithm has two main parts the douglas peucker dp algorithm is employed to simplify trajectories according to spatial features and a sliding window is adopted to simplify trajectories based on motion features furthermore statistical theory is applied to help determine the thresholds of motion features in sliding window algorithms the two results are merged to form a trajectory simplification algorithm that considers ship behaviours to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm numerical experiments are performed the results indicate that the proposed algorithm can efficiently simplify trajectories by considering ship behaviour as needed keywords water traffic automatic identification system ais ship behaviours trajectory compression 1 introduction the automatic identification system ais which is a kind of tracking and self reporting system can identify and locate vessels by communication among nearby ships satellites and base stations it is required that international voyaging ships with a gross tonnage greater than 300 and all passenger ships must be equipped with the ais as application of the ais has become more widespread a large number of vessel movement tracks have been provided each ship broadcasts ais information including statistical information and dynamic information at a time interval in the range of two to 6 min which is determined by their motion international telecommunications union 2014 the department in charge of maritime transportation acknowledges that there are thousands of ais messages that must be routinely dealt with every second hammond and peters 2012 this means that it is overwhelming to employ enough human and machine operators to deal with this amount of information an efficient compression algorithm could improve these conditions it is increasingly common for authorities to receive ais messages from space pallotta et al 2013 which provides an efficient method for monitoring vessel behaviour and performing duties however the channel bandwidth of satellites is usually limited and it is also necessary to apply efficient data compression to transmit satellite based ais information in traffic analysis there is no doubt that it is less efficient to display trajectories and analyse macroscopic traffic flow situations when the number of ais trajectories is large simplification algorithms that compress redundant information are crucial in actual applications the compression of ais trajectories is an important procedure in pre processing data zhao and shi 2019 adopted the douglas peucker dp algorithm to simplify ais trajectory position information and then cluster trajectories according to dynamic time warping dtw the dp algorithm simultaneously guarantees the clustering results and reduces the computational complexity if the compression algorithm can be executed by considering dynamic information of ais data it can also promote efficient network abstraction of multi vessel trajectory data varlamis et al 2019 kontopoulos et al 2019 hence an excellent compression algorithm is required to not only compress redundant position information but also retain the ship behaviour information included in the trajectory as previously described obtaining an effective simplifying algorithm for compressing superfluous position information while preserving important dynamic information is important and meaningful qi and zheng 2016 designed an algorithm to recognize deviation in the course of a vessel and extract significant points of the trajectory for simplification both clustering techniques and distributed processing techniques were adopted by spiliopoulos et al 2017 to transform massive spatiotemporal ais data into information which was beneficial for understanding variation trends in global trade patroumpas et al 2017 proposed a system to monitor maritime activity and recognize important changes in trajectories their system can identify salient points that reflect movement features such as turning slowing and stopping along every trajectory to perform online data reduction ais trajectories are a kind of line that includes ship behaviour characteristics therefore line simplification theory can be applied in ais trajectories the dp algorithm douglas and peucker 1973 ramer 1972 which is an effective and precise method has been extensively applied to simplify line data meratnia and rolf 2004 muckell et al 2010 2014 and moving objective trajectories in terms of vessel trajectories the dp algorithm was employed by etienne et al 2012 to compress the number of positions of trajectories while preserving the salient positions to lower the time cost of vessel traffic pattern recognition their experiment which was carried out based on 104 201 records showed that the compression rate could reach 84 54 with thresholds set to 10 m li et al 2010 designed a method that takes the time attribute of vessel trajectories into account they regarded a vessel trajectory as a line located in three dimensional space their experiment with 30 000 records concluded that the proposed method could preserve additional salient points that could retain more characteristic details about the speed of a trajectory a similarity study was carried out by zhu et al 2014 the dp algorithm was adopted by de vires and van someren 2012 to achieve stopping and moving points on the ship trajectory zhang et al 2016 also adopted the dp algorithm to simplify trajectories and ship domains in navigational situations to determine thresholds it could ensure that the track points retained on the simplified trajectory were located in the range of the corresponding primary track points the experiment showed that the compression rate reached 98 25 with thresholds set at 0 8 times the length of the ship it used 5 902 840 records from 962 ships in qiong zhou waters li et al 2016 performed several experiments to determine reasonable thresholds while simultaneously taking trajectory simplification and visualization quality into account at present most research focuses on spatial features when simplifying trajectories however few studies simplifying trajectories take both spatial and motion features into account for example zhao and shi 2018 simplified trajectories considering spatial features and variations in course patroumpas et al 2017 performed online reduction of data by considering salient points such as turning points and stopping points as their research target is critical points it is inevitable that some normal points will be discarded there are two drawbacks in these studies on the one hand not all motion features are taken into consideration some studies have focused on speed characteristics while other studies have focused on course characteristics on the other hand although critical points can be retained by some methods this also results in discarding some normal points which means that some clear dynamic information may be ignored hence if more points involved in the motion feature of trajectories can be considered it will be beneficial in retaining more dynamic information used for maritime research and traffic behaviour analysis hence it is necessary to propose an algorithm to achieve this goal furthermore thresholds are also a key factor the threshold has effects on both compression rate and quality reasonable thresholds should ensure that the compression rate is high and that ship behaviour information such as speed variation and course alteration can be retained some methods and experiments have been proposed to reasonably determine thresholds for example zhang et al 2014 made use of the ais based minimum ship domain evaluation method as a criterion for determining thresholds li et al 2016 conducted several experiments to determine appropriate thresholds to guarantee the quality of the trajectory simplification effect and of visualization however threshold optimization is mainly directed at spatial characteristics it is imperative to obtain a method for determining appropriate thresholds for the motion characteristics of trajectories such as speed and course variation to fill this gap in this study we propose an ais trajectory simplification algorithm that considers ship behaviours the contributions of this study are threefold first course over ground and sailing speed as ship behaviour characteristics are considered when trajectories are simplified they are seldom considered together in the previous literature second statistical theory is applied to determine thresholds for course variation and speed variation third a novel simplification algorithm that is based on dp and the sliding window algorithm is proposed and numerical examples are employed to test the algorithm the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the next section introduces the proposed algorithm considering ship behaviours in section 3 numerical examples are provided to test the proposed algorithm section 4 presents the conclusions 2 simplification algorithm for ship trajectories in this section three parts are included first the method for determining thresholds is presented it can choose reasonable simplification thresholds by considering ship behaviour characteristics second a novel simplification method considering ship behaviours is proposed last the compression performance is evaluated based on the compression rate length loss rate and shape similarity 2 1 method of determining thresholds it is compulsory to include an ais transceiver on cargo ships with gross tonnage greater than 500 not engaged in international waters on passenger ships and on ships with gross tonnage greater than 300 and engaged in international waters according to the international maritime organization 1974 when a ship is equipped with an ais transceiver authorities can obtain dynamic and statistical information about it our study centres on dynamic information generally dynamic information includes latitude longitude course over ground cog speed over ground sog and so on most previous studies pay more attention to variations in position because of this deviation in position is used to determine simplification thresholds however many ship behaviours are also hidden in dynamic information such as the alteration of cog and variation in sog for example offices on ships usually operate with a constant course and speed this implies that changes in course and speed are rare hence track points that indicate alterations in course and speed on trajectories have significant meaning they should be retained when trajectories are simplified in reality these points are ignored in most previous studies we propose a method that determines thresholds for simplifying trajectories while considering both spatial features and motion features the method includes two parts one is determining thresholds for position variation the other is determining thresholds for speed and course variation in terms of position variation we employ existing research findings the dp algorithm is adopted to compress position information and a threshold of 0 8 times the ship length as proposed by zhang et al 2016 is utilized in the paper hence we address the major problem of how to determine the thresholds of sog and cog variation as described above great alterations in course and speed are rare however the course and speed often fluctuate with the effect of added resistance from wind and waves on a small scale we assume that the cog alteration and sog variation for every trajectory obey a gaussian distribution as follows 1 θ n μ θ σ θ 2 v n μ v σ v where μ θ is the mean value of the variation in cog for a trajectory σ θ is the standard deviation of the variation in cog for a trajectory and θ is the variation in cog in eq 2 μ v represents the mean speed for a trajectory σ v indicates the standard deviation of the speed for a trajectory and v denotes the speed in this paper μ θ σ θ μ v and σ v are determined by parameter estimation according to statistical theory the arithmetic mean measures the central value of a dataset and the standard deviation quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion in a dataset they can be utilized to help us determine possible intervals in which the values of the course variation and speed for a trajectory are located if the speed or course variation is not located in the possible interval the operational behaviour may have changed however in a compression algorithm the compression rate should also be considered hence we assume that the variation in course or speed which reaches the requirement shown in eqs 3 and 4 implies that the operational behaviour in a trajectory has changed in these formulas c is the threshold coefficient which is employed not only to quantify the dispersion of ship behaviour but also to determine the compression rate and it should be appropriate for all the trajectories it is apparent that if c is too low more ship behaviour can be retained but the compression rate is decreased in a trajectory if c is too large excessive ship behaviour in a trajectory will be disregarded hence the appropriate threshold coefficient c can assist us in guaranteeing the compression rate while considering ship behaviour and it will be determined by the experiments described in section 3 3 θ μ θ c σ θ o r θ μ θ c σ θ 4 v μ v c σ v o r v μ v c σ θ in these formulas the course variation is calculated as follows as shown in fig 1 θ 0 θ 4 are course alterations ais information is usually updated every 2 s to 3 min depending on speed as presented in table 1 from the update rate we can conclude that the distance between two points such as p 1 and p 2 in fig 1 is not very great this indicates that the distance error can be ignored in the mercator coordinates furthermore the mercator projection is a kind of equal angle projection the angle is not distorted in consideration of these factors we can calculate the course alteration with the cosine law from the mercator coordinates hence eqs 5 8 are adopted to project track points such as p 1 p 2 and p 3 on the trajectory into mercator coordinates and then the cosine law is employed to determine θ θ 0 is obtained from π θ θ 1 θ 4 in fig 1 can also be calculated using a similar method 5 r a cos ϕ 0 1 e 2 sin 2 ϕ 0 6 q ln tan π 4 ϕ 2 1 e sin ϕ 1 e sin ϕ e 2 7 x r λ 8 y r q where ϕ and λ are the latitude and longitude respectively and a is the long radius of the earth ellipsoid e is the first eccentricity of the earth ellipsoid ϕ 0 represents the standard latitude of the mercator projection r is the radius of the parallel circle of the standard latitude q is the isometric latitude 2 2 the proposed simplification algorithm for a ship trajectory 2 2 1 position data simplification in our proposed algorithm position data are still simplified by the dp algorithm this is because excellent compression results are obtained the details of the dp algorithm are presented below in table 2 2 2 2 speed and course data simplification a sliding window simplification algorithm is adopted to simplify speed and course data the core idea of the sliding window simplification algorithm is to copy a fixed number of data points in a window of fixed size if data points located in the sliding window meet the simplification requirement they will be omitted with window sliding we can achieve data simplification the theory of window sliding is illustrated in fig 2 the ais trajectory is regarded as the point set t p p 1 p 2 p n as shown in fig 2 a three track points are included in the sliding window as shown in fig 2 b and they are used to calculate the course variation then the course variation and speed at point p 2 are checked if the requirements are met the point will be retained the points that do not meet the requirement will be omitted then the window moves forward as shown in fig 2 c the procedures are shown in table 3 2 2 3 implementation of the proposed simplification algorithm in our proposed algorithm there are two parts as shown in figure 3 in the first part the dp algorithm and sliding window algorithm are concurrently executed the dp algorithm is utilized to simplify the position data and thresholds are set at 0 8 times the ship length in accordance with the current research results the sliding window algorithm is employed to simplify the speed and course data and statistical theory is adopted to help determine reasonable thresholds for the speed and course variations in the second part a merging operation is available to obtain the union of two simplification results compressed by the dp algorithm and sliding window algorithm which achieves final simplification results by considering the ship behaviours 2 3 compression evaluation in this section the compression effect is evaluated based on the compression rate length loss rate and shape similarity the compression rate is found by dividing the number of discarded track points by the original number of track points the length loss rate is calculated from the simplified trajectories and original trajectories according to eqs 9 12 9 l n 1 n 1 p n p n 1 10 l l l o l s 11 l r l l l o 100 12 c r n n s n 100 where p n p n 1 denotes the distance between two adjacent track points on the trajectories it is apparent that l is the total length of the trajectories ll is the length loss l o is the length of the original trajectory l s is the length of the simplified trajectory lr is the length loss rate cr is the compression rate in eq 12 n is the number of track points on the original trajectory and n s is the number of track points on the simplified trajectory furthermore the dtw distance is employed as shown in eq 13 and 14 to evaluate the spatiotemporal differences between the original trajectory and the simplified trajectory 13 cd i j dist i j min cd i 1 j 1 cd i 1 j cd i j 1 14 d t w c d n n s where cd is the cumulative distance between the ith track point on the original trajectory and the jth track point on the simplified trajectory dist i j is the euclidean distance between the ith track point on the original trajectory and the jth track point on the simplified trajectory in application the running time is also a key evaluation index when a large amount of ais data needs to be simplified hence we also consider the running time in this paper 3 experiment and analysis 3 1 threshold coefficient analysis and determination in general the compression rate can be promoted by setting a higher threshold for the simplification algorithm which means a larger length loss and dtw distance the rule is also appropriate for our research although every trajectory has a different μ θ σ θ μ v and σ v in our research a higher compression rate can still be achieved with a higher threshold coefficient in terms of the same trajectory hence the variation tendency in the compression rate length loss and dtw distance is similar for every trajectory by employing different threshold coefficients if we want to determine a reasonable threshold coefficient for all trajectories we just need to select a trajectory as an example by simultaneously considering the compression rate length loss rate and dtw distance in this section the ship with mmsi 355757000 is considered as an example in fig 4 simplification results with different threshold coefficients are presented in this figure the red line is the original trajectory and green cubes are points retained by the simplification algorithms in fig 5 the compression rates corresponding to fig 4 are shown fig 6 shows the length loss rate of simplified trajectories with different threshold coefficients the dtw distances between simplified trajectories with different threshold coefficients are presented in fig 7 from fig 4 it is concluded that the number of simplified points will decrease as the threshold coefficient increase this can also be demonstrated by the compression rates shown in fig 5 the compression rate increases when higher threshold coefficients are employed however the variation in the compression rate is small when the threshold coefficients are 1 6 and 1 8 and their compression rates are 81 18 and 85 11 respectively furthermore the maximum compression rate is achieved by setting the threshold coefficient to 2 2 its value is 97 30 without loss of generality a higher compression rate means that more points are discarded this finding implies that there is a greater difference between the simplified trajectory and the original trajectory which can be illustrated by the length loss rate and dtw distance as shown in figs 6 and 7 in fig 6 the length loss rate increases when higher threshold coefficients are employed the minimal length loss is achieved when the threshold coefficient is 1 and the maximal length loss rate is obtained by setting the threshold coefficient to 2 2 on the other hand the dtw distance between the simplified trajectory and the original trajectory presents similar characteristics generally the dtw distance is utilized to measure the similarity between two trajectories a greater dtw distance usually indicates that the similarity between two trajectories is lower from fig 7 it is easily concluded that the dtw distance becomes greater between the simplified trajectory and the original trajectory as the threshold coefficients increase in other words the similarity between the simplified trajectory and the original trajectory tends to be lower as the thresholds increase considering the compression rate length loss rate and dtw distance simultaneously we recommend a threshold coefficient of 1 6 according to the experimental results even if the optimal compression rate length loss and dtw distance are not achieved by a threshold coefficient of 1 6 there are two reasons for this first the compression rate with a threshold coefficient of 1 6 reaches 81 18 which can satisfy the requirement of simplification second the simplified trajectory can retain characteristics of the original trajectory to a maximum degree in terms of the dtw distance and length loss rate although the minimal dtw distance and length loss rate are calculated by setting the threshold coefficient to 1 their compression rates are too low to simplify the trajectories based on these observations we conclude that the optimal threshold coefficient is 1 6 3 2 comparison experiments with other algorithms and analysis to further test the proposed simplification algorithm performance it is compared with three other typical simplification algorithms they are the dp algorithm opw sp algorithm and sliding window algorithm keogh et al 2001 and the thresholds in these algorithms are set as follows in the dp algorithm the thresholds are set as 0 8 times the ship length 6 m and 2 m s are employed as thresholds in the opw sp algorithm and the sliding window algorithm adopts 0 5 m as the thresholds in the proposed algorithm the mean speed and course variation are 15 30 kn and 3 36 respectively and the standard deviations of speed and course variation are 0 85 kn and 5 63 respectively furthermore the threshold coefficient is set as 1 6 we continue to take as an example the ship with mmsi 355757000 and the compression results with different algorithms are presented in fig 8 in fig 8 similar to fig 4 the red line is the original trajectory and green cubes are points retained by the different simplification algorithms fig 8 a shows the compression results of the dp algorithm the compression results of the opw sp algorithm are presented in fig 8 b fig 8 c shows the compression results of the sliding window algorithm fig 8 d illustrates the compression results of the proposed algorithm the compression rate achieved by the different algorithms is described in fig 9 and fig 10 presents the length loss rate of the different algorithms fig 8 illustrates that the sliding window algorithm retains more points there are fewer points retained by the proposed algorithm than by the sliding window algorithm the dp algorithm retains the minimum number of points and opw sp is second this can also be concluded from fig 9 in fig 9 the compression rate of the dp algorithm is 99 22 closely followed by the opw sp algorithm 95 56 the compression rate achieved by the sliding window algorithm is minimal 34 25 the dp algorithm compresses trajectories by

sliding window algorithm is minimal 0 28 and that of the proposed algorithm is the second largest 0 30 the maximum length loss rate 0 64 is achieved by the opw sp algorithm and the length loss rate in the dp algorithm is sub maximal for similarity the sliding window achieves the minimum dtw distance and the maximum dtw distance is calculated by the dp algorithm the sub minimal and sub maximal dtw distances are achieved by the proposed algorithm and the opw sp algorithm respectively this indicates that the trajectory simplified by the sliding window is most similar to the original trajectory

coefficients according to requirements if we want to retain more ship behaviours the threshold coefficient can be set to a low value if a high compression rate is required we can set the threshold coefficient to a high value hence the proposed method has strong flexibility to test the performance of the proposed algorithm numerical experiments are employed the results show that the proposed algorithm has better comprehensive performance than the other algorithms it can guarantee a compression rate by considering ship behaviours in contrast to other algorithms our research also has drawbacks for example the threshold coefficient cannot be determined adaptively and the running time is high in future research a method for adaptively determining the threshold coefficient should be designed and a distribution algorithm should be employed to optimize the running time when mass ais data need to be simplified furthermore the proposed method could also be adopted to simplify ais data in clustering trajectories to improve the clustering efficiency credit authorship contribution statement zhaokun wei conceptualization methodology software xinlian xie supervision project
