17025,there are many sampling approaches available for lead pb in drinking water selecting the best approach for its intended use is critical the objective of this work was to compare water pb levels collected by multiple sampling approaches from a model home plumbing system hps that included an old pb service line lsl as a function of daily water usage specifically flushed direct lsl sequential profile random daytime rdt first draw and manual composite samples were compared and daily water usage rates ranged from 1 4 to 120 gallons day 5 3 454 2 l day pb levels in water collected directly from the lsl reached equilibrium after 7 15 5 h of stagnation and approximately 55 of the equilibrium pb concentration was reached after 2 h sequential sampling accurately identified the lsl however the peak profile pb concentrations were a fraction of the pb measured directly from the lsl daily water usage patterns greatly impacted total pb levels in all water sampling approaches although manual composite and rdt samples were more sensitive to changes manual composite and rdt samples were equal to or greater than first draw samples throughout the study and differences grew larger as water usage decreased keywords lead drinking water house sampling water usage 1 introduction lead pb is a neurotoxin that can cause permanent cognitive and behavioral impairments in children and cardiovascular and kidney problems in adults fowler and duval 1991 atsdr 2007 lanphear et al 2018 lead in tap water originates from the corrosion or dissolution of leaded plumbing materials lead

proportional sampling flushed first draw after 30 min and 6 h and rdt at twenty nine homes with and without lsls they reported that rdt samples were most similar to proportional exposure based samples whereas 6 hour first draw overestimated and flushed samples severely underestimated exposure sampling at sites with lsls consumer household drinking water usage patterns are recognized as important factors impacting pb levels at the tap but associated complexities e g variability in flow rate daily use rate water stagnation make it challenging to predict the extent of the impact and understand related mechanisms lower water usage and long stagnation times have been linked to elevated pb release from pb sources masters et al 2015 salehi et al 2020 water quality in plumbing may change over long stagnation periods as a result of chemical and biological reactions which can increase pb solubility or enhance corrosion lytle and schock 2000 korshin et al 2000 regularly moving water through

stability of corrosion by products or other solids enmeshed in pipe scale layers and can help remove loose pb particles out of the pipe brown and cornwell 2015 ansi awwa 2017 the release of particulate pb was attributed in part to low water usage in flint homes which led the state of michigan and epa to promote the flush for flint program epa 2016 that encouraged residents to use repeated flushing as a means to remove pb particles from household plumbing and improve the effectiveness of corrosion control treatment by preventing the loss of orthophosphate and disinfectant residuals in homes water usage patterns also impact mass transfer factors including the rate pb ions diffuse into the water from pb sources and then transport pb ions through plumbing burkhardt et al 2020 a critical need still exists to identify differences in the results and interpretation of pb sampling approaches in drinking water and to better define appropriate sampling purposes the objective of this work was to compare drinking water tap sampling approaches and associated pb concentrations in water samples collected from a model home plumbing system hps that contained an lsl direct lsl flushed lsl first draw rdt sequential profile stagnation profile and manual composite sampling approaches were compared the impact of water usage on pb particulate and soluble concentration associated with sampling approaches was also examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 home plumbing system a home plumbing system hps simulator fig 1 was constructed in epa s andrew w breidenbach environmental research center awberc cincinnati oh and has been in continuous operation since january 23 2012 the number of fixtures pipe length and the daily water usage were modeled after a household of four cahalan and lytle 2017 based in part on earlier water use considerations mayer et al 1999 the hps was constructed with copper plumbing using occasional leaded solder joints and contained an electric hot water tank four faucets pb content 8 a toilet and a shower fig 1 the hps was plumbed directly from awberc s cold water plumbing greater cincinnati water works tap water and was adjusted to a target ph of 7 5 using 0 6 m hcl to enhance corrosivity a 6 7 ft 2 03 m long lsl was added in line to the hps supporting information si figure s1 in february 2017 after removal from a home in cincinnati and a conditioning period i e hps was by passed beginning in september 2016 specific details regarding the design and construction of the hps can be found in si section s2 whereas the procedure used to condition the lsl is described in section s3 the results presented herein span september 2016 february 2019 this includes lsl sample results during a 6 month conditioning period where it was separate from the hps and hps tap results after the lsl was installed in line with the rest of the hps 2 2 hps water usage patterns and sampling procedures the faucets were given specific

polypropylene 25 mm syringe filter ge life sciences marlborough ma to distinguish between soluble and particulate pb 2 6 data analysis statistical analyses of data were performed using sigmaplot 13 0 the mann whitney test was used to compare two groups and the kruskal wallis test was used for comparing more than two groups a p value less than 0 1 indicated a statistically significant difference

modeling 3 results 3 1 flushed and stagnation sampling directly from lsl during conditioning and after installation to hps excluding three elevated pb samples collected within the first two weeks of conditioning flushed total pb levels averaged 5 4 2 3 µg l between september 28 2016 and november 8 2016 fig 2 a during this time soluble pb averaged 3 7 2 0 µg l and was statistically different from total pb u 94 p 0 001 albeit a very small concentration this indicated particulate pb uptake as water passed through the lsl likely through a scouring mechanism three elevated total pb flushed samples as high as 85 µg l near the beginning of the conditioning period were observed while the corresponding soluble pb levels were less than 7 µg l fig 2a this observation suggested particulate pb was likely a remnant of disturbances associated with pipe extraction transport and installation water was also directly sampled from the lsl after 16 18 h overnight and 65 h over the weekend of stagnation fig 3 b during the conditioning period total pb levels in samples collected after 16 18 h of stagnation averaged 142 45 µg l soluble pb levels averaged 126 32 µg l and were statistically different than total pb levels u 1101 p 0 096 indicating a significant but relatively small percentage 11 on average of particulate pb total pb levels in stagnant samples collected after 65 h of stagnation averaged 153 30 µg l during this same time soluble pb levels averaged 146 24 µg l and were not statistically different from total pb u 178 p 0 21 statistically there was no difference between mean pb levels after 16 18 h 142 45 µg l and 65 h 153 30 µg l indicating pb levels had already reached equilibrium at 16 18 h u 632 p 0 125 soluble pb levels in stagnant samples from the lsl represent the highest soluble pb level the hps would measure in a drinking water sample this observation would apply to any home with an lsl pb was measured in stagnant water directly from the lsl after the lsl was connected to the hps fig 2b overall average pb concentration during this time was 181 115 for total pb and 151 75 for soluble pb lead concentrations in the lsl during the entirety of this study were highly variable lead levels of water in direct contact with the lsl after it was added to the hps between april and july 2017 normal use and reduced normal use protocol were relatively consistent during this period total and soluble pb concentrations averaged 155 66 µg l and 132 37 µg l respectively including a spike of 395 µg l on june 15 2017 and combining overnight and over weekend samples pb was dominantly in the soluble form 89 of total pb on average and the overnight and over weekend samples were indistinguishable fig 2b unfortunately direct lsl data was sparsely collected between july 11 2017 and february 2018 during this period only five days of lsl samples were collected fig 2b routine direct lsl stagnant water sampling restarted in february 2018 surprisingly pb levels were initially elevated in february to april 2018 to an average total and soluble pb concentration of 345 90 µg l and 263 39 µg l respectively for the first 80 sampling days during this period soluble pb accounted for 82 of the total pb on average in a short timeframe approximately two weeks pb levels rapidly dropped and remained in a narrow range may 2018 to the study end to an average total and soluble pb concentration of 111 58 µg l and 98 52 µg l respectively during this period soluble pb accounted for 92 of the total pb on average the reason s for the erratic lsl pb release behavior could not be precisely identified initially and the data gap further complicated interpretation however after close examination a relationship between ph and soluble pb became apparent soluble pb increased with decreasing ph which was consistent with the predicted solubility trend of pb ii carbonate geochemistry figure s2 the reported ph values were measured directly from the lsl after stagnation pb sample therefore do not necessarily reflect the consistency of the ph control system but rather more accurately reflect equilibrium ph conditions at the time of soluble pb sampling the ph over the entire study period averaged 7 7 0 3 table s1 3 2 stagnation profile sampling directly from lsl a series of samples collected from the lsl over time resulted in a pb concentration profile that increased logarithmically as stagnation time increased fig 3 with pb levels increasing most rapidly over the first two hours of stagnation the pb increase turned more gradual between 2 and 7 h of stagnation pb concentrations leveled off between 7 and 18 5 h of stagnation thereby reaching an apparent equilibrium maximum concentration of approximately 164 µg l a radial molecular diffusion model was fitted to the experimental pb profile data to predict the concentration of pb leached from a pipe over time fig 3 the model assumed that the pb concentration was constant along the pipe axis sufficient oxidant was present to drive pb oxidation and molecular diffusion was the rate limiting step model details can be found elsewhere lytle and schock 2000 crank 1975 kuch and wagner 1983 schlünder 1975 and are summarized in section s7 the theoretical curve was fitted to the measured profile data using the solver routine incorporated in microsoft excel redmond washington to minimize the sum of squared residuals between actual and diffusion model predicted pb levels a regression analysis of the best fit model gave an r2 value of 0 935 fig 3 the model fit showed that 55 of the maximum equilibrium pb concentration eventually released from the lsl was already present in the water after only 2 h of stagnation pb concentrations in the lsl rapidly increased to elevated levels these observations reinforced previous findings e g doré et al 2018 regarding the limitation of tap flushing programs designed to minimize pb exposure from lsls unless flushing occurs regularly throughout a given day 3 3 sequential profile sampling faucets 1 2 3 and 4 were 578 in 14 6 m or approximately 1 86 l of water 510 in 13 0 m or 1 64 l 409 in 10 4 m or 1 32 l and 294 in 7 5 m or 0 95 l away from the lsl respectively sequential pb profiles of water collected at each faucet characteristically displayed an asymmetric distribution described by a relatively rapid increase in pb concentration to a peak followed by a tailing of pb reflective of longitudinal dispersion fig 4 peak pb concentrations appeared reasonably close to where expected within the sequential pb profile based on the measured distance and corresponding water volume between the faucet and lsl fig 4 peak pb concentrations in the profiles were considerably lower than direct lsl total pb stagnation samples 144 155 µg l collected within 2 weeks of the profiles and the difference increased as the distance between the faucet and lsl increased the maximum pb concentrations in profiles from faucets 1 2 3 and 4 from farthest to closest to lsl were 26 30 40 and 60 µg l respectively fig 4 peak pb profile concentrations measured from faucets 1 2 3 and 4 were only 17 21 28 and 42 of the soluble pb levels measured directly from the lsl during the same time period these observations demonstrated that maximum pb levels measured in sequential profiles taken at a faucet will be lower than pb levels of water directly in contact with the lsl unless particle pb release is important because of longitudinal dispersion effects and the difference becomes greater as the distance from the lsl increases as a result associations between peak pb concentration and solubility controlling minerals on an lsl surface cannot be gained from sequential profiles unless a sampling port in a home is directly near the lsl like it was in the hps factors not considered in this work including sequential sample volume and sample flowrate will likely further impact the peak pb sample concentration in theory given that the majority of the pb originates from the lsl the total mass of pb across the profile should be similar to the total mass of pb within the smaller volume of water in direct contact with the lsl during the timeframe when profile sampling was performed the total mass of pb released directly from the lsl averaged 38 µg the calculation was based on the lsl pipe volume and pb concentration measured directly from the lsl in comparison the total accumulated mass of pb in water in the profile from faucets 1 2 3 and 4 was calculated at 27 27 32 and 38 µg respectively fig 4 expressed in terms of mass balances faucets 1 2 3 and 4 saw 69 70 83 and 99 respectively of the original pb mass built up on the lsl pb recovery decreased as faucet distance from the lsl increased this is because faucets with the greatest distance from the lsl had a pb concentration dispersion tail that extended beyond the full sequential series volume and dispersion of pb beyond the lsl volume boundary during stagnation additional sequential samples would have improved the balances sequential profile data were also used to calculate equivalent first draw 1 l samples and average pb concentrations across all sequential samples at each faucet equivalent first draw samples from faucets 1 2 3 and 4 from farthest to closest to lsl were 2 3 2 1 2 2 and 9 7 µg l respectively faucet 4 had the highest equivalent first draw pb concentration because it was closest to the lsl and therefore capable of capturing direct pb concentrations from the lsl when compared to the respective peak pb concentrations pb in first draw samples were 11 14 18 and 6 times lower for faucets 1 2 3 and 4 respectively the results were variable within the hps greater than observations calculated from profiles reported by others del toral et al 2013 triantafyllidou et al 2015 sandvig et al 2008 cartier et al 2011 and impacted by distance between the sampling location and lsl and other factors not considered here such as sequential sample volume average pb concentrations in profiles from faucets 1 2 3 and 4 were 8 5 9 8 12 7 and 16 8 µg l respectively 3 4 first draw rdt and manual composite sampling comparisons first draw rdt and manual composite samples collected from the designated kitchen faucet i e faucet 3 were compared under the following water use scenarios 1 whole house normal use 120 gpd 2 whole house reduced normal use 60 gpd 3 single faucet daily minimum use 1 4 gpd all days 4 corrected single faucet minimum use 1 4 gpd on sampling days 5 single faucet minimum use 2x 2 8 gpd on sampling days and 6 single faucet minimum use 2x and toilet 6 6 gpd on sampling days figs 2 6 7 and section s4 all three sampling approaches were performed within 24 h of each other and all data is summarized in table s2 on non sampling days the water was used according to the normal use protocol when normal use was being evaluated or reduced normal use protocol on all other flow evaluation periods except daily minimum use where all days were operated under minimum use conditions under the normal whole house water usage pattern fig 5 first draw sampling resulted in the smallest average total pb concentration of 2 9 2 9 µg l n 14 range of 0 7 12 8 µg l although there was one spike at 12 8 µg l fig 5 rdt sampling resulted in the greatest average total pb concentration of 4 9 3 4 µg l n 14 range of 2 2 14 3 µg l and the highest single observed concentration of 14 3 µg l for samples during normal use manual composite sampling produced an average total pb concentration of 3 7 1 1 µg l n 13 and the tightest range least variability in results for samples during normal whole house use sample comparisons were statistically different h 12 1 p 0 002 dunn s pairwise comparison found the first draw sample to be different from both the rdt and manual composite samples during normal use a statistically significant increase in first draw u 90 5 p 0 01 and manual composite samples u 88 p 0 012 to average pb of 4 6 3 1 µg l n 26 range of 2 0 14 3 µg l and 7 9 8 7 µg l n 27 range of 2 0 44 6 µg l respectively was observed after reducing the daily water usage by 50 whole house use the pb concentration of rdt samples during this period averaged 6 5 8 4 µg l n 27 range of 2 0 45 8 µg l and the increase from normal use was not statistically significant mann whitney rank sum test u 148 5 p 0 461 of note the release of pb from the lsl increased between the sampling periods from an average of 150 to 182 µg l see table s2 likely due to more contact time between the water and the pb scale with increased release possibly due to water quality changes e g ph near the lsl wall consequently this increased pb release from the lsl may have influenced the pb increase observed in tap samples along with any dispersion issues the three samples were statistically different h 16 6 p 0 001 from each other during reduced normal use with the first draw sample being the lowest and the composite sample the highest pb concentrations in samples collected using all three sampling approaches increased when a daily minimum use schedule only the kitchen faucet used on all days was adopted the average first draw sample increased to 9 8 5 5 µg l n 9 range of 3 8 18 2 µg l rdt increased to 18 0 5 2 µg l n 12 range of 10 9 µg l 30 4 µg l and manual composite increased to 23 5 6 6 µg l n 11 range of 10 6 34 µg l first draw u 11 p 0 001 rdt u 15 p 0 001 and manual composite samples u 22 p 0 001 all had statistically significant increases in pb compared to reduced normal use samples the increase could not strictly be attributed to the change in water use pattern however because the pb release from the lsl increased on average to 245 µg l from 182 µg l during the daily minimum use sampling period when reduced normal use samples were compared to minimum use i e only the kitchen faucet only on sampling days tuesday and thursday pb concentrations increased significantly for rdt u 15 p 0 001 and manual composite samples u 22 p 0 001 rdt and manual composite samples averaged 18 5 5 9 µg l n 10 range of 7 7 28 6 µg l and 19 1 3 0 µg l n 9 range of 13 9 21 8 µg l respectively there was no statistical difference between the two sampling approaches u 36 p 0 487 during minimum use the role of lsl contributions could not be considered because direct lsl samples were not collected during this time although first draw samples could not be compared to other sampling approaches during this period because they reflected the reduced flow use the day prior to minimum use conditions they were used to illustrate changes in pb release from lsl first draw samples statistically increased u 11 p 0 001 to an average 12 8 3 0 µg l n 9 range of 8 4 16 9 µg l when daily minimum use samples were compared to minimum use samples only on sampling days no statistical difference was found for first draw u 27 5 p 0 269 rdt u 54 p 0 972 or manual composite samples u 29 p 0 128 doubling the minimum daily use to

255 µg l on average rdt and manual composite samples averaged 28 7 7 6 µg l n 10 range of 16 0 41 8 µg l and 31 4 10 5 µg l n 8 range of 17 3 48 9 µg l respectively there was not a statistical difference between the two sampling approaches u 32 p 0 505 first draw samples could not be compared to other sampling approaches during this period because they reflected the reduced flow use the day prior to minimum use conditions first draw samples did not statistically change u 27 p 0 251 and averaged 11 4 3 8 µg l n 9 range of 8 4 20 6 µg l during the period when toilet flushing was added to minimum flow conditions to bring the total daily flow to 6 6 gpd pb concentrations significantly decreased for rdt u 41 p 0 063 but not manual composite samples u 55 p 0 771 rdt and manual composite samples averaged 20 9 9 1 µg l n 15 range of 8 2 35 1 µg l and 32 8 17 7 µg l n 15 range of 9 2 73 4 µg l respectively there was a statistical difference between the two sampling approaches u 68 p 0 068 the increase could not strictly be attributed to the change in water use pattern because the pb release from the lsl increased on average to 347 µg l during the sampling period although first draw samples could not be compared to other sampling approaches during this period because they reflected the reduced flow use the day prior to minimum use conditions they were used to assess changes in pb release from lsl first draw samples did not statistically change u 49 5 p 0 296 first draw samples averaged 11 8 2 8 µg l n 15 range of 9 3 20 8 µg l the first draw sampling protocol was corrected i e samples were collected on the day following reduced usage on april 10 2018 so that samples were collected the morning following minimum use with three toilet flushes the corrected method continued throughout the rest of the study so first draw samples could be compared to manual composite and rdt samples see fig 5 there was a statistically significant decrease in pb from the incorrect first draw sampling approach to the corrected one u 7 p 0 001 however the decrease in pb was likely caused by the lsl which saw the average pb release decrease to 126 µg l the average concentrations of rdt and manual composite samples decreased to 15 5 6 5 µg l n 10 range of 6 5 28 2 µg l and 11 5 3 7 µg l n 10 range of 5 3 18 8 µg l respectively a statistically significant difference between the three samples kruskal wallis test h 12 2 p 0 002 was noted and further pairwise comparison clarified that the difference was between the first draw sample and the rdt sample after returning to reduced normal use pb levels in first draw samples decreased to an average of 6 4 1 8 µg l n 31 range of 2 8 11 3 µg l and the decrease was statistically significant u 52 p 0 002 there was also a statistically significant pb concentration decrease in rdt u 23 p 0 001 and manual composite samples u 54 p 0 002 which averaged 5 9 3 6 µg l n 31 range of 2 15 4 µg l and 7 4 3 1 µg l n 31 range of 2 16 5 µg l respectively there was a statistically significant difference between the three sample types kruskal wallis test h 6 68 p 0 035 and further pairwise comparisons using a dunn s test showed that the difference occurred between rdt and composite samples during this time the direct lsl samples showed pb release only slightly decreased to an average of 114 0 51 8 µg l n 18 range of 81 316 µg l indicating that the change of pb levels in water samples was attributed to water use change after water usage returned to minimum use only on sampling days the first draw samples remained low with an average of 6 8 1 3 µg l n 6 range of 5 5 8 7 µg l and the change was not statistically significant u 81 p 0 635 there were statistically significant pb increases in rdt u 41 5 p 0 001 and manual composite samples u 41 5 p 0 001 to averages of 14 6 4 1 µg l n 16 range of 11 5 25 1 µg l and 13 1 2 8 µg l n 16 range of 8 8 18 6 µg l respectively there was a statistically significant difference between the three samples h 15 1 p 0 001 and pairwise comparisons yielded a significant difference between the first draw sample compared to both rdt and manual composite samples pb release from the lsl was within the same ranges as the previous reduced normal use period indicating that the change of pb levels in water samples was attributed to water use change 3 5 manual composite sample sequence the 60 ml side sample of water was collected and poured off into the manual composite sample bottle after a glass of water was taken in preceding data analysis throughout most of the study multiple manual composite samples were collected to observe any impact the collection sequence might have on results results through multiple water usage phases 9 31 samples per usage period were compared figure s3 there were no kruskal wallis statistical differences between the sample sequence during minimum use and toilet h 3 774 p 0 151 reduced normal use h 1 297 p 0 523 and during minimum use for the first h 3 261 p 0 196 or second occurrence h 4 350 p 0 114 a statistical difference was observed after minimum use was doubled h 6 504 p 0 039 further pairwise comparison during this period showed the difference occurred when composite sample 2 was lower than composite samples 1 and 3 figure s3 4 discussion the overarching conclusion from this work is that a single pb level representing the hps did not exist a wide range of pb values were measured in water depending on sampling approach water usage sampling tap water quality presence of pb particles and other factors not specified in this work there was also inherent temporal variability within each sampling approach for similar reasons lead release from the primary source of pb the lsl increased rapidly with stagnation time and plateaued after 7 18 5 h of stagnation consistent with the solubility of pb ii carbonate minerals schock et al 1996 approximately 55 of the equilibrium pb concentration was reached within 2 h of stagnation soluble pb was the dominant form of pb released from the lsl accounting for an average of 89 2 10 3 of total pb in water more importantly pb released from the lsl had a large direct impact on all samples measured at the hps kitchen tap exposure based manual composite samples were particularly sensitive subtle ph changes particularly between ph 7 5 8 likely associated with inconsistent operation of the ph feed system or chemical changes within the lsl during stagnation likely had an important impact on the pb levels of water directly in contact with the lsl thus measuring water pb levels from an lsl following stagnation is important to understanding corrosion control mechanisms and effectiveness as well as pb solubility and pipe scale relationships service lines connecting the home to the water main are not easily accessible by the homeowner and drinking water taps are usually not close enough to the service line to collect a representative sample taps are typically installed many feet past the service line and water movement through the plumbing creates diffusion features that impact measured pb lytle et al 2019 therefore it is impossible to collect a tap sample that represents the pb concentrations of water directly in contact with an lsl water usage greatly impacted total pb levels in all water sampling approaches although the degree of sensitivity was greater in manual composite and rdt samples the lowest and highest mean total pb levels of first draw rdt and manual composite samples differed by factors of 1 5 5 8 and 8 9 respectively the average manual composite and rdt samples were equal to or greater than first draw samples throughout the study fig 6 the differences grew larger as water usage decreased likely due to water quality issues as water ages including axial differences in water quality with the water at and within the pb scale being the most important measured pb in rdt samples ranged between 0 9 2 6 average 1 8 times greater than corresponding first draw samples measured pb in manual composite samples ranged between 1 2 2 8 average 1 9 times greater than corresponding first draw samples on average manual composite and rdt samples were similar throughout the study fig 5 which was consistent with what riblet et al 2019 found when comparing rdt samples with a proportional composite sampling method manual composite rdt and first draw samples were greater than 15 µg l epa s action level for pb in 36 34 and 5 of samples fig 6 lead in tap samples were mostly soluble with the average soluble pb being 85 1 10 6 for manual composite 90 8 10 6 for rdt and 86 1 18 2 for first draw samples the sampling approaches most reflective of exposure manual composite and rdt were most impacted by water usage patterns riblet et al 2019 lastly pb measured directly from the lsl ranged between 8 and 40 average 13 times greater than corresponding manual composite samples between 8 and 30 average 14 times greater than rdt samples and between 15 and 52 average 24 times greater than first draw samples 5 conclusions pb levels in water samples collected directly from the lsl increased to the maximum equilibrium concentration after 7 18 5 h of stagnation pb levels increased most rapidly early in the stagnation profile after only 2 h approximately 55 of the equilibrium pb concentration was reached lead released from the lsl during this work was dominantly in the soluble form measured soluble pb levels were consistent with pb levels predicted by pb ii carbonate mineral hydrocerussite and cerussite solubility throughout the study sequential sample profiles accurately identified the location of the lsl based on pb peak position maximum profile pb concentrations were a fraction of the equilibrium pb concentration measured directly from the lsl the fractions decreased as the plumbing distance between the faucet and lsl increased due to dispersion effects as a result conclusions regarding pb solubility associated with lsl pipe scale minerals cannot be directly drawn from sequential profiles water usage greatly impacted total pb levels across all sampling methods although the sensitivity was greatest in manual composite and rdt samples manual composite and rdt samples were equal to or greater than first draw samples throughout the study pb differences between the sample grew larger as water usage decreased demonstrating the impact of water age on water quality pb levels for manual composite and rdt samples were not statistically different on average provided enough samples are collected rdt samples resembled pb exposure sampling ie composite sampling strategies different water sampling approaches produced different pb results the comparisons clearly demonstrated the importance of selecting the appropriate sampling method to answer the desired question for example based on this work sequential sampling is useful to identify pb plumbing sources including lsls and assess corrosion control treatment effectiveness manual composite sampling provides a reasonable estimate of exposure whereas rdt samples if collected in statistically appropriate numbers may also provide exposure insights water samples collected directly from the lsl provides total pb release details and pb solubility information notice the information in this article has been reviewed in

collected by multiple sampling approaches from a model home plumbing system hps that included an old pb service line lsl as a function of daily water usage specifically flushed direct lsl sequential profile random daytime rdt first draw and manual composite samples were compared and daily water usage rates ranged from 1 4 to 120 gallons day 5 3 454 2 l day pb levels in water collected directly from the lsl reached equilibrium after 7 15 5 h of stagnation and approximately 55 of the equilibrium pb concentration was reached after 2 h sequential sampling accurately identified the lsl however the peak profile pb concentrations were a fraction of the pb measured directly from the lsl daily water usage patterns greatly impacted total pb levels in all water sampling approaches although manual composite and rdt samples were more sensitive to changes manual composite and rdt samples were equal to or greater than first draw samples throughout the study and differences grew larger as water

stability of corrosion by products or other solids enmeshed in pipe scale layers and can help remove loose pb particles out of the pipe brown and cornwell 2015 ansi awwa 2017 the release of particulate pb was attributed in part to low water usage in flint homes which led the state of michigan and epa to promote the flush for flint program epa 2016 that encouraged residents to use repeated flushing as a means to remove pb particles from household plumbing and improve the effectiveness of corrosion control treatment by preventing the loss of orthophosphate and disinfectant residuals in homes water usage patterns also impact mass transfer factors including the rate pb ions diffuse into the water from pb sources and then transport pb ions through plumbing burkhardt et al 2020 a critical need still exists to identify differences in the results and interpretation of pb sampling approaches in drinking water and to better define appropriate sampling purposes the objective of this work was to compare drinking water tap sampling approaches and associated pb concentrations in water samples collected from a model home plumbing system hps that contained an lsl direct lsl

modeling 3 results 3 1 flushed and stagnation sampling directly from lsl during conditioning and after installation to hps excluding three elevated pb samples collected within the first two weeks of conditioning flushed total pb levels averaged 5 4 2 3 µg l between september 28 2016 and november 8 2016 fig 2 a during this time soluble pb averaged 3 7 2 0 µg l and was statistically different from total pb u 94 p 0 001 albeit a very small concentration this indicated particulate pb uptake as water passed through the lsl likely through a scouring mechanism three elevated total pb flushed samples as high as 85 µg l near the beginning of the conditioning period were observed while the corresponding soluble pb levels were less than 7 µg l fig 2a this observation suggested particulate pb was likely a remnant of disturbances associated with pipe extraction transport and installation water was also directly sampled from the lsl after 16 18 h overnight and 65 h over the weekend of stagnation fig 3 b during the conditioning period total pb levels in samples collected after 16 18 h of stagnation averaged 142 45 µg l soluble pb levels averaged 126 32 µg l and were statistically different than total pb levels u 1101 p 0 096 indicating a significant but relatively small percentage 11 on average of particulate pb total pb levels in stagnant samples collected after 65 h of stagnation averaged 153 30 µg l during this same time soluble pb levels averaged 146 24 µg l and were not statistically different from total pb u 178 p 0 21 statistically there was no difference between mean pb levels after 16 18 h 142 45 µg l and 65 h 153 30 µg l indicating pb levels had already reached equilibrium at 16 18 h u 632 p 0 125 soluble pb levels in stagnant samples from the lsl represent the highest soluble pb level the hps would measure in a drinking water sample this observation would apply to any home with an lsl pb was measured in stagnant water directly from the lsl after the lsl was connected to the hps fig 2b overall average pb concentration during this time was 181 115 for total pb and 151 75 for soluble pb lead concentrations in the lsl during the entirety of this study were highly variable lead levels of water in direct contact with the lsl after it was added to the hps between april and july 2017 normal use and reduced normal use protocol were relatively consistent during this period total and soluble pb concentrations averaged 155 66 µg l and 132 37 µg l respectively including a spike of 395 µg l on june 15 2017 and combining overnight and over weekend samples pb was dominantly in the soluble form 89 of total pb on average and the overnight and over weekend samples were indistinguishable fig 2b unfortunately direct lsl data was sparsely collected between july 11 2017 and february 2018 during this period only five days of lsl samples were collected fig 2b routine direct lsl stagnant water sampling restarted in february 2018 surprisingly pb levels were initially elevated in february to april 2018 to an average total and soluble pb concentration of 345 90 µg l and 263 39 µg l respectively for the first 80 sampling days during this period soluble pb accounted for 82 of the total pb on average in a short timeframe approximately two weeks pb levels rapidly dropped and remained in a narrow range may 2018 to the study end to an average total and soluble pb concentration of 111 58 µg l and 98 52 µg l respectively during this period soluble pb accounted for 92 of the total pb on average the reason s for the erratic lsl pb release behavior could not be precisely identified initially and the data gap further complicated interpretation however after close examination a relationship between ph and soluble pb became apparent soluble pb increased with decreasing ph which was consistent with the predicted solubility trend of pb ii carbonate geochemistry figure s2 the reported ph values were measured directly from the lsl after stagnation pb sample therefore do not necessarily reflect the consistency of the ph control system but rather more accurately reflect equilibrium ph conditions at the time of soluble pb sampling the ph over the entire study period averaged 7 7 0 3 table s1 3 2 stagnation profile sampling directly from lsl a series of samples collected from the lsl over time resulted in a pb concentration profile that increased logarithmically as stagnation time increased fig 3 with pb levels increasing most rapidly over the first two hours of stagnation the pb increase turned more gradual between 2 and 7 h of stagnation pb concentrations leveled off between 7 and 18 5 h of stagnation thereby reaching an apparent equilibrium maximum concentration of approximately 164 µg l a radial molecular diffusion model was fitted to the experimental pb profile data to predict the concentration of pb leached from a pipe over time fig 3 the model assumed that the pb concentration was constant along the pipe axis sufficient oxidant was present to drive pb oxidation and molecular diffusion was the rate limiting step model details can be found elsewhere lytle and schock 2000 crank 1975 kuch and wagner 1983 schlünder 1975 and are summarized in section s7 the theoretical curve was fitted to the measured profile data using the solver routine incorporated in microsoft excel redmond washington to minimize the sum of squared residuals between actual and diffusion model predicted pb levels a regression analysis of the best fit model gave an r2 value of 0 935 fig 3 the model fit showed that 55 of the maximum equilibrium pb concentration eventually released from the lsl was already present in the water after only 2 h of stagnation pb concentrations in the lsl rapidly increased to elevated levels these observations reinforced previous findings e g doré et al 2018 regarding the limitation of tap flushing programs designed to minimize pb exposure from lsls unless flushing occurs regularly throughout a given day 3 3 sequential profile sampling faucets 1 2 3 and 4 were 578 in 14 6 m or approximately 1 86 l of water 510 in 13 0 m or 1 64 l 409 in 10 4 m or 1 32 l and 294 in 7 5 m or 0 95 l away from the lsl respectively sequential pb profiles of water collected at each faucet characteristically displayed an asymmetric distribution described by a relatively rapid increase in pb concentration to a peak followed by a tailing of pb reflective of longitudinal dispersion fig 4 peak pb concentrations appeared reasonably close to where expected within the sequential pb profile based on the measured distance and corresponding water volume between the faucet and lsl fig 4 peak pb concentrations in the profiles were considerably lower than direct lsl total pb stagnation samples 144 155 µg l collected within 2 weeks of the profiles and the difference increased as the distance between the faucet and lsl increased the maximum pb concentrations in profiles from faucets 1 2 3 and 4 from farthest to closest to lsl were 26 30 40 and 60 µg l respectively fig 4 peak pb profile concentrations measured from faucets 1 2 3 and 4 were only 17 21 28 and 42 of the soluble pb levels measured directly from the lsl during the same time period these observations demonstrated that maximum pb levels measured in sequential profiles taken at a faucet will be lower than pb levels of water directly in contact with the lsl unless particle pb release is important because of longitudinal dispersion effects and the difference becomes greater as the distance from the lsl increases as a result associations between peak pb concentration and solubility controlling minerals on an lsl surface cannot be gained from sequential profiles unless a sampling port in a home is directly near the lsl like it was in the hps factors not considered in this work including sequential sample volume and sample flowrate will likely further impact the peak pb sample concentration in theory given that the majority of the pb originates from the lsl the total mass of pb across the profile should be similar to the total mass of pb within the smaller volume of water in direct contact with the lsl during the timeframe when profile sampling was performed the total mass of pb released directly from the lsl averaged 38 µg the calculation was based on the lsl pipe volume and pb concentration measured directly from the lsl in comparison the total accumulated mass of pb in water in the profile from faucets 1 2 3 and 4 was calculated at 27 27 32 and 38 µg respectively fig 4 expressed in terms of mass balances faucets 1 2 3 and 4 saw 69 70 83 and 99 respectively of the original pb mass built up on the lsl pb recovery decreased as faucet distance from the lsl increased this is because faucets with the greatest distance from the lsl had a pb concentration dispersion tail that extended beyond the full sequential series volume and dispersion of pb beyond the lsl volume boundary during stagnation additional sequential samples would have improved the balances sequential profile data were also used to calculate equivalent first draw 1 l samples and average pb concentrations across all sequential samples at each faucet equivalent first draw samples from faucets 1 2 3 and 4 from farthest to closest to lsl were 2 3 2 1 2 2 and 9 7 µg l respectively faucet 4 had the highest equivalent first draw pb concentration because it was closest to the lsl and therefore capable of capturing direct pb concentrations from the lsl when compared to the respective peak pb concentrations pb in first draw samples were 11 14 18 and 6 times lower for faucets 1 2 3 and 4 respectively the results were variable within the hps greater than observations calculated from profiles reported by others del toral et al 2013 triantafyllidou et al 2015 sandvig et al 2008 cartier et al 2011 and impacted by distance between the sampling location and lsl and other factors not considered here such as sequential sample volume average pb concentrations in profiles from faucets 1 2 3 and 4 were 8 5 9 8 12 7 and 16 8 µg l respectively 3 4 first draw rdt and manual composite sampling comparisons first draw rdt and manual composite samples collected from the designated kitchen faucet i e faucet 3 were compared under the following water use scenarios 1 whole house normal use 120 gpd 2 whole house reduced normal use 60 gpd 3 single faucet daily minimum use 1 4 gpd all days 4 corrected single faucet minimum use 1 4 gpd on sampling days 5 single faucet minimum use 2x 2 8 gpd on sampling days and 6 single faucet minimum use 2x and toilet 6 6 gpd on sampling days figs 2 6 7 and section s4 all three sampling approaches were performed within 24 h of each other and all data is summarized in table s2 on non sampling days the water was used according to the normal use protocol when normal use was being evaluated or reduced normal use protocol on all other flow evaluation periods except daily minimum use where all days were operated under minimum use conditions under the normal whole house water usage pattern fig 5 first draw sampling resulted in the smallest average total pb concentration of 2 9 2 9 µg l n 14 range of 0 7 12 8 µg l although there was one spike at 12 8 µg l fig 5 rdt sampling resulted in the greatest average total pb concentration of 4 9 3 4 µg l n 14 range of 2 2 14 3 µg l and the highest single observed concentration of 14 3 µg l for samples during normal use manual composite sampling produced an average total pb concentration of 3 7 1 1 µg l n 13 and the tightest range least variability in results for samples during normal whole house use sample comparisons were statistically different h 12 1 p 0 002 dunn s pairwise comparison found the first draw sample to be

samples during this period averaged 6 5 8 4 µg l n 27 range of 2 0 45 8 µg l and the increase from normal use was not statistically significant mann whitney rank sum test u 148 5 p 0 461 of note the release of pb from the lsl increased between the sampling periods from an average of 150 to 182 µg l see table s2 likely due to more contact time between the water and the pb scale with increased release possibly due to water quality changes e g ph near the lsl wall consequently this increased pb release from the lsl may have influenced the pb increase observed in tap samples along with any dispersion issues the three samples were statistically different h 16 6 p 0 001 from each other during reduced normal use with the first draw sample being the lowest and the composite sample the highest pb concentrations in samples collected using all three sampling approaches increased when a daily minimum use schedule only the kitchen faucet used on all days was adopted the average first

strictly be attributed to the change in water use pattern however because the pb release from the lsl increased on average to 245 µg l from 182 µg l during the daily minimum use sampling period when reduced normal use samples were compared to minimum use i e only the kitchen faucet only on sampling days tuesday and thursday pb concentrations increased significantly for rdt u 15 p 0 001 and manual

release from lsl first draw samples did not statistically change u 49 5 p 0 296 first draw samples averaged 11 8 2 8 µg l n 15 range of 9 3 20 8 µg l the first draw sampling protocol was corrected i e samples were collected on the day following reduced usage on april 10 2018 so that samples were collected the morning following minimum use with three toilet flushes the corrected method continued throughout the rest of the study so first draw samples could be compared to manual composite and rdt samples see fig 5 there was a statistically significant decrease in pb from the incorrect first draw sampling approach to the corrected one u 7 p 0 001 however the decrease in pb was likely caused by the lsl which saw the average pb release decrease to 126 µg l the average concentrations of rdt and manual composite samples decreased to 15 5 6 5 µg l n 10 range of 6 5 28 2 µg l and 11 5 3 7 µg l n 10 range of 5 3 18 8 µg l respectively a statistically significant difference between the three samples kruskal wallis test h 12 2 p 0 002 was noted and further pairwise comparison clarified that the difference was between the first draw sample and the rdt sample after returning to reduced normal use pb levels in first draw samples decreased to an average of 6 4 1 8 µg l n 31 range of 2 8 11 3 µg l and the decrease was statistically significant u 52 p 0 002 there was also a statistically significant pb concentration decrease in rdt u 23 p 0 001 and manual composite samples u 54 p 0 002 which averaged 5 9 3 6 µg l n 31 range of 2 15 4 µg l and 7 4 3 1 µg l n 31 range of 2 16 5 µg l respectively there was a statistically significant difference between the three sample types kruskal wallis test h 6 68 p 0 035 and further pairwise comparisons using a dunn s test showed that the difference occurred between rdt and composite samples during this time the direct lsl samples showed pb release only slightly decreased to an average of 114 0 51 8 µg l n 18 range of 81 316 µg l indicating that the change of pb levels in water samples was attributed to water use change after water usage returned to minimum use only on sampling days the first draw samples remained low with an average of 6 8 1 3 µg l n 6 range of 5 5 8 7 µg l and the change was not statistically significant u 81 p 0 635 there were statistically significant pb increases in rdt u 41 5 p 0 001 and manual composite samples u 41 5 p 0 001 to averages of 14 6 4 1 µg l n 16 range of 11 5 25 1 µg l and 13 1 2 8 µg l n 16 range of 8 8 18 6 µg l respectively there was a statistically significant difference between the three samples h 15 1 p 0 001 and pairwise comparisons yielded a significant difference between the first draw sample compared to both rdt and manual composite samples pb release from the lsl was within the same ranges as the previous reduced normal use period indicating that the change of pb levels in water samples was attributed to water use change 3 5 manual composite sample sequence the 60 ml side sample of water was collected and poured off into the manual composite sample bottle after a glass of water was taken in preceding data analysis throughout most of the study multiple manual composite samples were collected to observe any impact the collection sequence might have on results results through multiple water usage phases 9 31 samples per usage period were compared figure s3 there were no kruskal wallis statistical differences between the sample sequence during minimum use and toilet h 3 774 p 0 151 reduced normal use h 1 297 p 0 523 and during minimum use for the first h 3 261 p 0 196 or second occurrence h 4 350 p 0 114 a statistical difference was observed after minimum use was doubled h 6 504 p 0 039 further pairwise comparison during this period showed the difference occurred when composite sample 2 was lower than composite samples 1 and 3 figure s3 4 discussion the overarching conclusion from this work is that a single pb level representing the hps did not exist a wide range of pb values were measured in water depending on sampling approach water usage sampling tap water quality presence of pb particles and other factors not specified in this work there was also inherent temporal variability within each sampling approach for similar reasons lead release from the primary source of pb the lsl increased rapidly with stagnation time and plateaued after 7 18 5 h of stagnation consistent with the solubility of pb ii carbonate minerals schock et al 1996 approximately 55 of the equilibrium pb concentration was reached within 2 h of stagnation soluble pb was the dominant form of pb released from the lsl accounting for an average of 89 2 10 3 of total pb in water more importantly pb released from the lsl had a large direct impact on all samples measured at the hps kitchen tap exposure based manual composite samples were particularly sensitive subtle ph changes particularly between ph 7 5 8 likely associated with inconsistent operation of the ph feed system or chemical changes within the lsl during stagnation likely had an important impact on the pb levels of water directly in contact with the lsl thus measuring water pb levels from an lsl following stagnation is important to understanding corrosion control mechanisms and effectiveness as well as pb solubility and pipe scale relationships service lines connecting the home to the water main are not easily accessible by the homeowner and drinking water taps are usually not close enough to the service line to collect a representative sample taps are typically installed many feet past the service line and water movement through the plumbing creates diffusion features that impact measured pb lytle et al 2019 therefore it is impossible to collect a tap sample that represents the pb concentrations of water directly in contact with an lsl water usage greatly impacted total pb levels in all water sampling approaches although the degree of sensitivity was greater in manual composite and rdt samples the lowest and highest mean total pb levels of first draw rdt and manual composite samples differed by factors of 1 5 5 8 and 8 9 respectively the average manual composite and rdt samples were equal to or greater than first draw samples throughout the study fig 6 the differences grew larger as water usage decreased likely due to water quality issues as water ages including axial differences in water quality with the water at and within the pb scale being the most important measured pb in rdt samples ranged between 0 9 2 6 average 1 8 times greater than corresponding first draw samples measured pb in manual composite samples ranged between 1 2 2 8 average 1 9 times greater than corresponding first draw samples on average manual composite and rdt samples were similar throughout the study fig 5 which was consistent with what riblet et al 2019 found when comparing rdt samples with a proportional composite sampling method manual composite rdt and first draw samples were greater than 15 µg l epa s action level for pb in 36 34 and 5 of samples fig 6 lead in tap samples were mostly soluble with the average soluble pb being 85 1 10 6 for manual composite 90 8 10 6 for rdt and 86 1 18 2 for first draw samples the sampling approaches most reflective of exposure manual composite and rdt were most impacted by water usage patterns riblet et al 2019 lastly pb measured directly from the lsl ranged between 8 and 40 average 13 times greater than corresponding manual composite samples between 8 and 30 average 14 times greater than rdt samples and between 15 and 52 average 24 times greater than first draw samples 5 conclusions pb levels in water samples collected directly from the lsl increased to the maximum equilibrium concentration after 7 18 5 h of stagnation pb levels increased most rapidly early in the stagnation profile after only 2 h approximately 55 of the equilibrium pb concentration was reached lead released from the lsl during this work was dominantly in the soluble form measured soluble pb levels were consistent with pb levels predicted by pb ii carbonate mineral hydrocerussite and cerussite solubility throughout the study sequential sample profiles accurately identified the location of the lsl based on pb peak position maximum profile pb concentrations were a fraction of the equilibrium pb concentration measured directly from the lsl the fractions decreased as the plumbing distance between the faucet and lsl increased due to dispersion effects as a result conclusions regarding pb solubility associated with lsl pipe scale minerals cannot be directly drawn from sequential profiles water usage greatly impacted total pb levels across all sampling methods although the sensitivity was greatest in manual composite and rdt samples manual composite and rdt samples were equal to or greater than first draw samples throughout the study pb differences between the sample grew larger as water usage decreased demonstrating the impact of water age on water quality pb levels for manual composite and rdt samples were not statistically different on average provided enough samples are collected rdt samples resembled pb exposure sampling ie composite sampling strategies different water sampling approaches produced different pb results the comparisons clearly demonstrated the importance of selecting the appropriate sampling method to answer the desired question for example based on this work sequential sampling is useful to identify pb plumbing sources including lsls and assess corrosion control treatment effectiveness manual composite sampling provides a reasonable estimate of exposure whereas rdt samples if collected in statistically appropriate numbers may also provide exposure insights water samples collected directly from the lsl provides total pb release details and pb solubility information notice the information in this article has been reviewed in

17026,efficient control of pathogenic bacteria specifically legionella pneumophila is one of the main concerns when operating industrial cooling towers common practices to limit proliferation involves use of disinfectants leading to formation of disinfection by product and increase in water corrosiveness a disinfectant free legionella control method would make the industry more environmentally friendly a pilot scale cooling tower 1 m3 h operated with demineralized water was used to investigate the potential of high ph conditioning as a disinfectant free alternative for control of l pneumophila and other pathogens one control experiment was performed under standard full scale operation involving sodium hypochlorite dosage thereafter 3 alkaline phs of the cooling water were tested 9 0 9 4 and 9 6 the tests lasted between 25 and 35 days the cooling water from the basins were analysed for total cell count by flow cytometry l pneumophila concentration by plate count and occasional qpcr analyses targeting the mip gene bacterial and eukaryotic community analyses with 16s and 18s rrna gene amplicon sequencing relative abundance of eukaryotic to prokaryotic dna by qpcr of the 16s and 18s rrna gene the l pneumophila analyses showed considerable growth at ph 9 0 and ph 9 4 but was maintained below detection limit 100 cfu l at ph 9 6 without disinfection interestingly the results correlated with the overall abundance of protozoa in the water samples but not directly with the relative abundance of specific reported protozoan hosts of legionella the pathogenicity based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing of the cooling water dna decreased with increasing ph with a strong decline between ph 9 0 and ph 9 4 from 7 1 to 1 6 of relative abundance of pathogenic genera respectively a strong shift in microbiome was observed between each tested ph and reproducibility of the experiment at ph 9 6 was confirmed with a duplicate test lasting 80 days high ph conditioning 9 6 is therefore considered as an efficient disinfectant free cooling tower operation for control of pathogenicity including l pneumophila graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords protozoa microbiome interaction pathogenicity pca sustainability 1 introduction evaporative cooling towers are prone to the growth of legionella pneumophila a bacterial pathogen which induces a severe form of pneumonia named legionellosis when inhaled prussin ii et al 2017 ricketts et al 2012 together with other artificial water systems such as shower plumbing swimming pools or wastewater treatment plants they represent important sources of outbreaks due to the formation of aerosols spreading to the surrounding environment bartram et al 2007 evaporative cooling towers are the most often confirmed sources of legionellosis outbreaks and can contaminate large numbers of people as their aerosols can spread over several kilometres paschke et al 2019 number of cases of legionellosis in the european union has increased over the last decade causing at least 450 yearly death beauté 2017 and is expected to worsen due to increasing number of cooling towers and climate change paschke et al 2019 current methods to control pathogen growth and ensure safety of people consists in continuous or shock dosage of disinfectants often oxidative such as sodium hypochlorite chlorine dioxide or bromine bartram et al 2007 despite the biocides outbreaks of l pneumophila still occur due to an inappropriate balance in the complex chemical conditioning and delayed response caused by sparse and indirect plate count monitoring bentham 2000 in the netherlands l pneumophila plate count is the standard monitoring method with a detection limit of 100 cfu l while the drinking water act requires response actions to be taken when the concentration exceeds 100 cfu l the environmental protection act that applies to evaporative cooling towers does not specify any threshold national academies of sciences 2020 the industrial areas can therefore implement their own risk management plan often using a 104 cfu l threshold according to technical guidelines escmid 2017 growth of l pneumophila in water systems has been linked to presence of protist organisms past studies have shown that this pathogenic species performs intracellular replication within the vacuoles of amoebas and ciliated protozoan cells where it obtains required nutrients for growth and later evades the hosts via host cell lysis lau and ashbolt 2009 wadowsky et al 1988 protozoan species such as vermamoeba acanthamoeba and naegleria have been reported to constitute reservoirs allowing proliferation of l pneumophila in nutrient poor waters such as process water or drinking water wadowsky et al 1988 in addition this interaction provides protection of the pathogen towards sudden changes in environmental conditions and chlorine due the ability of the host to switch to a cyst form kilvington and price 1990 past research has been focusing on complementary or alternative methods to disinfection for cooling tower operation by altering system conditions in order to prevent pathogen growth and also prevent formation of disinfection by products that are discharged in the environment as l pneumophila grows at temperature between 20 and 45 c kusnetsov et al 1997 showed that a recirculating water temperature below 20 c allowed to maintain l pneumophila concentration below 1000 cfu l however operating with a cooling water temperature kept below 20 c is unlikely in most industrial sites alternatively application of alkaline ph has been suggested in past studies brouse et al 2017 states et al 1987 and applied on some industrial sites but no thorough assessment of the effect of alkaline ph conditioning on the overall cooling tower microbiome and pathogen presence has been previously described it has been reported from laboratory studies that l pneumophila can grow in a ph range of 5 5 to 9 2 wadowsky et al 1988 but there is still a lack of literature available above that range in general a strong knowledge gap remains on the survival ability of l pneumophila and other pathogens at alkaline ph i e above 9 0 in this pilot cooling tower study demineralized water at elevated ph was used as cooling water with the aim of controlling growth of l pneumophila and other potential pathogens without involving use of disinfectants more precisely the goals of this investigation were to i identify an optimal ph above which l pneumophila growth is prevented ii characterize the changes in overall microbiome caused by the increase in alkalinity with focus on potential pathogenic genera and iii discuss advantages and disadvantages of this approach in term of industrial applicability the use of a pilot scale facility was preferred to a laboratory scale set up as it allowed to accurately control operational parameters without excluding the impact of environmental conditions linked to external temperatures precipitations and air quality which are crucial factors in the microbiome dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 cooling tower installation 2 1 1 pilot description one pilot scale evaporative cooling system was built in a mobile container located in terneuzen netherlands at the time of the study suspended materials were initially removed from the inlet water by a candle filter the packing fill of the cooling tower was composed of hdpe pall rings the system was operated with a basin volume of 1 m3 and a recirculation flow of 1 m3 h an automatic valve allowed the refill of the basin heating was performed by a secondary water loop warmed up by a water boiler and recirculating through 6 steel based heat exchangers mounted in series cooling efficiency was controlled by automatic adjustment of the blower speed the water temperatures were maintained at 25 c in the cold section of the cooling system and simultaneously at 35 c in the hot section of the same system when maximal conductivity was reached a valve triggered the discharge of concentrated cooling water 2 1 2 online monitoring ph orbisint cps11d endress hauser switzerland conductivity condumax cls21d endress hauser switzerland temperatures thermophant t ttr31 endress hauser switzerland and free chlorine concentration analyzer ami codes ii cc swan switzerland were monitored online 2 1 3 conditionings conditionings and corresponding physical parameters are described in table 1 conditions were tested consecutively the control condition c simulated the conventional full scale operation of cooling tower with a conductivity of 3500 µs cm corresponding to a cycle of concentration of 5 of the feed surface water dosage of antiscalant and corrosion inhibitors were applied manually sulphuric acid for ph control at 7 5 and sodium hypochlorite for disinfection brenntag switzerland were added automatically the conductivity was maintained via discharge of concentrated cooling water and automatic refill with fresh surface water in all alkaline conditions ph 9 0 ph 9 4 ph 9 6 a and ph 9 6 b the high purity of the demineralized feed water resulted in a negligible increase in conductivity no discharge was thus applied in the first tested alkaline condition ph 9 0 was reached naturally and sodium silicate was dosed as corrosion inhibitor in the other tested conditions ph was increased by manual addition of sodium hydroxide brenntag switzerland to ph 9 4 or sodium hydroxide combined to sodium bicarbonate brenntag switzerland to ph 9 6 in ph 9 6 b 120 g of sodium chloride esco germany was added to the basin of 1 m3 to approach the composition of reverse osmosis permeate the comparison of ph 9 6 a and ph 9 6 b showed negligible impact of sodium chloride on the growth of l pneumophila and overall microbiology ph 9 6 a and ph 9 6 b were therefore considered as duplicate tests in this study in general conditions were tested for 25 to 35 days ph 9 0 was prematurely stopped after 21 days due to the high l pneumophila cell count ph 9 6 b was operated for 80 days as a long term validation experiment the cooling system was emptied and a subsequent two step chemical cleaning was performed between each experiment the first cleaning step involved the recirculation of demineralized water and sodium hypochlorite at a concentration of 30 ppm active chlorine for one hour which was then discharged the second cleaning step involved the recirculation of demineralized water with sulfuric acid dosage to ph 2 for one hour chemical solutions were flushed away with fresh demineralized water before the next experiment 2 2 experimental analyses 2 2 1 sampling water samples from the cold channel of the recirculation line were collected in sterile glass bottles and kept at 4 c until analyses flow cytometry plate count and qpcr measurements were performed within 24 h from the sampling time for l pneumophila quantification aqualab zuid laboratory followed the standard nen en iso iec 17025 2017 for 16s and 18s rrna sequencing analyses 400 ml of water was filtered through 0 22 µm pore size and 33 mm diameter sterile pvdf syringe filters merck germany and the filter membranes containing the biomass were kept at 20 c for later dna extraction biological duplicates were analysed at the end of each testing period 2 2 2 total cell count samples were diluted by a factor 10 control c or 100 ph 9 0 ph 9 4 ph 9 6 a and ph 9 6 b with ultrapure water prior to the flow cytometry measurements preparation of the stock solution of sybr green i and staining protocol are described elsewhere pinel et al 2020 analyses were performed on a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer bd biosciences belgium with a flow rate of 66 µl min on 50 µl of sample the fluorescence intensity was collected at fl1 533 30 nm and fl3 670 nm with a threshold of 700 on fl1 the applied gating strategy was based on a previous paper prest et al 2013 2 2 3 legionella pneumophila quantification l pneumophila was quantified by both indirect and direct methods with plate count and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr water samples were analysed by aqualab zuid laboratory werkendam netherlands 2 2 3 1 l pneumophila plate count enumeration of colony forming units of legionella was based on the protocol described in the standard iso 11731 2017 in short 1 ml of the water samples was spread on gvpc glycine vancomycin polymyxin cycloheximide agar plates the plates were subsequently incubated at 36 c after 10 days of incubation the plates were examined for colonies matching the legionella species colonies l pneumophila colonies were then identified by malditof ms matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry analysis according to the formerly developed method dilger et al 2016 used at aqualab zuid measurements were performed every 3 days in average 2 2 3 2 quantitative pcr qpcr quantification of the number of gene copies of l pneumophila was performed following the method described in nen 6254 2012 targeting the mip gene macrophage infectivity potentiator surface protein the forward primer lpneuf 5 ccgatgccacatcattagc 3 reverse primer lpneur 5 ccaattgagcgccactcatag 3 and probe lpneup 5 6 carboxyfluorescein fam tgcctttagccattgcttccg bhq1 3 were used for the analysis taq polymerase was activated at 95 c for 3 min and was followed by 43 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 20 s and annealing extension at 60 c for 60 s 2 2 4 dna extraction and sequencing the membrane filters containing the biomass collected from the water samples were recovered from the syringe filter units merck germany for further processing the genomic dna was extracted using the dneasy ultraclean microbial kit qiagen netherlands the company s standard method was followed during the extraction with an additional lysis step the lysis step consisted of 5 min of heating at 65 c and 5 min of bead beating on a mini beadbeater 24 biospec usa for cell disruption of the collected biomass the quality of the extracted dna was assessed by gel electrophoresis and size check 465 bp after qpcr amplification samples were sent to novogene ltd hongkong china for amplicon sequencing of the v4 region position 528 706 of the 18s rrna gene and the v3 4 region position 341 806 of the 16s rrna gene on an illumina paired end platform the raw 18s rrna gene sequences were processed by novogene ltd hongkong china using qiime software chimeric sequences were detected with uchime and removed otus were generated based on 97 similarities between the representative sequences using uparse potential protozoan hosts for l pneumophila were identified based on a previous study boamah et al 2017 the raw 16s rrna gene sequences were processed with the software mothur v 1 40 5 for quality filtering alignment chimera check and taxonomic classification generation of operational taxonomic units otus were performed based on 97 similarities between the representative sequences after removal of singletons the alignment and taxonomic classifications were performed using the silva database potentially pathogenic bacterial genera were identified based on the list available in the drinking water quality guidelines who 2011 the main representative otu sequences were compared to the refseq ncbi database using the basic local alignment search tool blast for species identification results from the duplicate samples are shown in figures s1 s2 and s3 the doi of the raw sequencing data is available in supplementary material 2 2 5 beta diversity analysis diversity analyses were performed on the bacterial otus generated after the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and their relative abundances in the samples beta diversity measurement was assessed with principal component analysis pca in mothur v 1 40 5 using the thetayc distance matrix the spatial separations visualized in the pca provide information on the similarity between samples 2 2 6 abundance of prokaryotes and eukaryotes qpcr was performed to determine the absolute abundance of prokaryotes and eukaryotes by quantifying the number of copies of the 16s and 18s genes respectively the 16s dna standards were commercially obtained a product template for the 18s dna was initially created by pcr to be used as standard the template was based on the dna extracted from the alkaline test ph 9 6 b the dreamtaq green pcr master mix thermoscientific usa was combined to the forward primer euk1f 5 acc tgg ttg atcctg cca gt 3 reverse primer euk563r 5 acc aga ctt gccctcc 3 and ph 9 6 b dna extract according to manufacturer s specifications pcr was performed with the following settings 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 c 40 s at 55 c and 40 s at 72 c the size of the amplified dna fragments was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis amplified dna was purified following the monarch dna gel extraction kit biolabs uk a final dna concentration of 10 7 ng l was measured with a qubit fluorometer invitrogen usa serial dilution from 10 3 ng dna μl to 10 8 ng dna μl were used to generate the standard curves qpcr reaction mix were composed of 0 2 μl of each primer at a concentration of 50 μm 10 µl of iqtm sybr green supermix bio rad usa 7 6 μl of nuclease free water sigma aldrich uk and 2 μl of the extracted dna from the cooling water samples the primer sequences thermal profiles and qpcr efficiencies are described in table s1 3 results 3 1 total cell counts total bacterial cell concentration in the cooling water was measured by flow cytometry throughout the testing periods fig 1 shows the cell number reached at the end of each experiment averaged over the last 5 days the control c subjected to chlorine disinfection had the lowest bacterial cell number with 6 6 1 5 107 cells l chlorine disinfection applied in the control experiment was efficient in maintaining a low cell count the alkaline conditions without biocide dosage reached 3 2 0 5 109 cells l at ph 9 0 1 7 0 1 1010 cells l at ph 9 4 1 4 0 4 1010 cells l and 5 2 0 4 109 cells l at ph 9 6 a and b respectively 3 2 impact of increasing ph on l pneumophila growth the l pneumophila plate count results for the 5 pilot tests are also shown in fig 1 the control test c performed under the conventional full scale operating conditions at ph 7 5 with sodium hypochlorite dosage maintained a l pneumophila concentration below the detection limit of 100 cfu l during the entire 27 days of operation tests at ph 9 0 and ph 9 4 exceeded the tolerated limit of 103 cfu l set on the industrial site with 3 0 1 4 105 and 3 8 1 0 103 cfu l respectively at the end of the experiments qpcr measurements confirmed the presence of l pneumophila with values reaching up to 4 4 105 and 950 gene copies l at ph 9 0 and ph 9 4 respectively demineralized water at ph 9 0 seems to constitute a suitable environment for the growth of l pneumophila in cooling towers the ability of the pathogen to also grow at ph 9 4 was unexpected and therefore indicates that ph 9 4 is not alkaline enough to prevent proliferation the duplicates at ph 9 6 both maintained l pneumophila at very low or undetectable levels during the duration of the experiments i e 34 and 80 days respectively ph 9 6 a reached 200 cfu l on day 19 and 100 cfu l on day 21 while ph 9 6 b reached 100 cfu l on days 14 and 35 in the other plate count analyses 87 the concentration was below quantification limit 100 cfu l while all qpcr measurements were below quantification 375 gene copies l the results demonstrate that a ph of or above 9 6 constitutes an efficient conditioning for the control of l pneumophila in open recirculating cooling tower alternatively to biocide dosage 3 3 relative abundance of 18s eukaryotic to 16s prokaryotic gene copies the absolute quantification of the 18s and 16s gene copies by qpcr allowed an estimation of the proportion of eukaryotic dna to prokaryotic dna in the samples the ratio of 18s to 16s gene copies is displayed in fig 2 all samples contained a substantially lower amount of eukaryotic gene copies compared to prokaryotic gene copies between 1 log and 3 log fewer control c at ph 7 5 and tests at ph 9 4 and ph 9 6 a and b display a ratio of 18s 16s gene copies of 1 7 0 3 10 3 0 9 0 2 10 3 1 4 0 5 10 3 and 3 5 2 2 10 3 respectively at ph 9 0 however the ratio strongly diverges from the other samples with 5 7 3 5 10 2 indicating a relatively higher concentration of eukaryotic dna per prokaryotic dna with more than 1 log difference when compared to the other tested conditions the greater relative fraction of eukaryotic dna at ph 9 0 may suggest a higher availability of potential hosts for l pneumophila to multiply intracellularly 3 4 presence of potential protozoan hosts of l pneumophila identification of the eukaryotic community members was performed with 18s rrna gene sequencing of the dna extracted from the cooling water samples to assess the presence of potential hosts fig 3 a shows the relative abundances of the main eukaryotic kingdoms protista and chromista kingdoms accounted for the majority of the reads in the control c and at ph 9 0 and ph 9 4 with 43 10 62 5 and 58 8 respectively the duplicate tests at ph 9 6 show only 2 1 and 3 1 of protista and chromista abundances with dominance of the kingdom fungi the combination of the results from figs 2 and 3a therefore suggests a limited availability of hosts for l pneumophila at ph 9 6 due to the low occurrence of protists the composition and structure of the protist communities diverged strongly fig 3b between the tested conditions the test at ph 9 0 with the highest l pneumophila concentration and eukaryotic to prokaryotic dna ratio was largely dominated by the genera spumella from the phylum ochrophyta and vorticella from the phylum ciliophora these genera were also identified in the other tested conditions in lower abundances the duplicate tests at ph 9 6 show high similarity with each other regarding the protist community structures dominated by spumella phytophthora and halophytophthora halophytophthora is a reclassified genus previously assigned to phytophthora but regrouping marine species cooke et al 2000 as the only difference in the operation of the duplicate tests was the dosage of nacl the higher salt concentration in ph 9 6 b likely justifies the increase in relative abundance of halophytophthora the protist organisms present in the water samples were then compared to experimentally defined hosts and potential hosts of l pneumophila boamah et al 2017 their presence among the protist community of each test can be visualized in table 2 the control condition showed a negligible abundance of known hosts representing only 0 1 of the total eukaryotic reads a similarly low number was obtained at ph 9 0 with 0 2 despite the high concentration of l pneumophila measured suggesting the presence of non identified legionella hosts the two commonly found l pneumophila hosts echinamoeba exudans and vermamoeba vermiformis added up to 59 of the protist community and 33 of the whole eukaryotic community at ph 9 4 they also constituted an important fraction of the protists at ph 9 6 5 and 6 respectively but representing only 0 1 and 0 2 of the eukaryotic communities due to the low abundance of protists at this ph 3 5 presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria under different alkaline ph the abundance of potentially pathogenic bacterial genera based on the drinking water quality guideline who 2011 are listed in fig 4 the control c at ph 7 5 and test at ph 9 0 show a greatly higher total relative abundance of potential pathogens 7 1 0 9 and 5 7 0 3 of the total reads compared to the tests at ph 9 4 and ph 9 6 1 6 0 1 1 3 0 1 and 0 2 0 1 pseudomonas and enterobacter are the most abundant in the control test representing 4 2 0 1 and 1 8 0 3 respectively while bulkhoderia and legionella are dominant at ph 9 0 with 1 5 0 6 and 1 4 0 1 with also considerable abundance of enterobacter 1 3 0 8 the increase from ph 9 0 to ph 9 4 therefore considerably reduced the potential pathogenicity of the cooling water based on the results from the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing 3 6 overall bacterial community analyses fig 5 shows the relative abundance of the main bacterial genera in the cooling water samples variations in microbial community structure can be observed between the different tests with a switch in the main bacterial members at the phylum level the main difference originated from the promotion of bacteroidetes at alkaline ph while it accounted for 3 1 of the relative abundance in control c it reached 38 6 and 62 1 at ph 9 6 the remaining abundance was mainly represented by alpha and gammaproteobacteria at the genus level sphingobium was dominating in the control c at 44 8 but was present in negligible abundance at alkaline ph with less than 0 5 ph 9 0 and ph 9 4 show a more distributed relative abundance among genera with the main members being sediminibacterium at ph 9 0 22 4 and sphingopyxis and flavobacterium at ph 9 4 28 6 and 16 6 respectively the duplicates at ph 9 6 however display similarity in main community members the genus mongoliitalea from the family cyclobacteriaceae dominated both cooling waters with 35 5 and 60 1 although a contained also large abundances of phenylobacterium 21 6 and aliihoeflea 13 3 genera the blast of the otu representative sequence corresponding to the mongoliitalea genus resulted in 99 56 similarity in identity with the species mongoliitalea lutea a facultative alkaliphilic and halotolerant bacterial species collected from haloalkaline lakes the other 26 main otus whose genera are displayed in fig 5 were also compared to the database among those the representative sequences of the members labelled with the symbol showed over 99 similarity with sequences of known alkaliphilic or alkalitolerant species i e with optimum ph 9 0 or optimum ph 9 0 but able to grow at higher values the sum of the relative abundances of these otus was calculated for each experimental test while confirmed alkalitolerant organisms accounted for only 9 of the relative abundance of the main members in control c their abundance increased with increasing ph 28 at ph 9 0 56 at ph 9 4 69 and 78 at ph 9 6 for a and b respectively as expected the higher fraction of identified alkaliphilic bacteria at ph 9 4 and 9 6 implies that neutrophilic bacteria were outcompeted the principal component analysis in fig 6 represents the similarities between samples taking into account the members of the communities and their relative abundances the bacterial communities at alkaline ph all diverge from the control c at ph 7 5 among the tested conditions samples from ph 9 6 a and ph 9 6 b form a close cluster on the chart validating the reproducibility of the result for the conditioning at ph 9 6 4 discussion 4 1 cooling tower operation at ph 9 6 efficiently prevents growth of l pneumophila previous research based on a survey of 40 cooling towers operated in a ph ranging from 6 9 to 9 1 reported higher l pneumophila densities at ph between 8 4 and 9 1 yamamoto et al 1992 an earlier laboratory controlled ph batch experiment on cooling water samples showed however a better correlation of the pathogen growth with neutral ph values states et al 1987 these disparities in results point out the significant impact of operational conditions water sources and surrounding environment on the growth of l pneumophila in full scale cooling systems according to the available literature l pneumophila has been shown to grow at ph up to 9 2 but was not able to multiply from ph 10 brouse et al 2017 ohno et al 2003 wadowsky et al 1988 an important lack of information remained about the survival of the pathogen within the ph range from 9 2 to 10 our study explored this gap and revealed that l pneumophila can survive and grow at ph 9 4 although at a much lower concentration than at ph 9 0 most importantly l pneumophila was unable to grow at ph 9 6 multiplication of legionella in engineered water systems requires presence of host protozoan cells lau and ashbolt 2009 wadowsky et al 1988 the amount and nature of nutrients in cooling water is generally too limited for l pneumophila multiplication as a free living organism since it requires a complex medium to grow including compounds like amino acids as carbon and energy source sauer et al 2005 tesh and miller 1981 tesh et al 1983 or fatty acids fonseca and swanson 2014 the intracellular components of some amoebas such as acanthamoeba vermamoeba and naegleria sp jjemba et al 2015 lau and ashbolt 2009 molofsky and swanson 2004 and ciliated protozoa caicedo et al 2018 fields et al 1984 therefore constitute an appropriate reservoir for the growth of the pathogen when encountering extreme conditions such as chlorine disinfection protozoa go through a mechanism of encystment to protect themselves from the hostile environment kilvington and price 1990 contrarily to their vegetative trophozoite form cysts of protozoa are in a dormant state and do not proliferate but their reinforced cell wall constitutes a strong protection for the intracellular pathogens our study reflects a positive correlation between the abundance in protozoa figs 2 and 3a and l pneumophila counts fig 1 as was also reported in the cooling tower survey by yamamoto et al 1992 the dominance of protozoa at ph 9 0 and 9 4 and the higher eukaryotic to prokaryotic dna ratio at ph 9 0 suggest the presence of unicellular trophozoite reservoirs to sustain the observed l pneumophila growth in these two tested conditions in the duplicate test runs at ph 9 6 a poor abundance of protists was observed concomitant with a good control of l pneumophila growth the relative abundance of potential hosts fig 3b in our samples based on a suggested list derived from laboratory experiments and environmental analyses boamah et al 2017 did however not show a clear correlation at ph 9 0 the l pneumophila counts were substantial but previously reported hosts were present only in minor abundance contrarily to ph 9 4 table 2 spumella flagellate and vorticella ciliate the main genera at ph 9 0 have not been reported as hosts but the limited knowledge available on the specificity of l pneumophila for intracellular replication guerrieri et al 2005 as well as the non exhaustive list of cultivated natural hosts cannot exclude their involvement in the experiments at ph 9 6 the fraction of the protist abundance of reported hosts 5 2 and 6 6 represented a negligible fraction of the total abundance of eukaryotes in fact the eukaryotic communities were mainly represented by fungi our study revealed a substantial impact of the ph increase from 9 4 to 9 6 on the limitation of protists and a direct correlation with the inhibition of l pneumophila growth 4 2 increased ph leads to a strong bacterial community shift with lower pathogenicity a strong shift in bacterial community was observed between the control experiment at ph 7 5 with chlorine disinfection and each of the tested alkaline ph conditions with no disinfection proteobacteria dominated the control c with sphingobium sp a recurrent organism in drinking water and cooling systems subjected to chlorination due to their oligotrophic nature and ability to grow in biofilm mode shaw et al 2015 vaz moreira et al 2011 paranjape et al 2020 pseudomonas is also a common genus encountered in cooling systems under disinfection paranjape et al 2020 bacterial community composition and relatively low total cell count in the control experiment therefore reproduced the environment of a full scale system under standard operation regarding alkaline conditions the abundance of bacteroidetes was previously shown to positively correlate with increasing ph ganzert et al 2014 lauber et al 2009 as it is the case in our study mongoliitalea lutea cyclobacteriaceae bacteroidete is a facultative alkaliphile able to develop at ph between 6 5 and 12 0 with an optimum at ph 9 0 yang et al 2012 however it was in our study only present in negligible abundance at ph 9 4 while it was the dominant bacterium at ph 9 6 our data suggests that the ph increase from 7 5 c to 9 6 gradually limited the growth of neutrophiles and promoted alkalitolerant and alkaliphilic species such as mongoliitalea lutea driving ph away from neutral value requires bacteria to adjust their proton motive force to maintain a cytoplasmic ph in the neutral range krulwich et al 2011 in too alkaline conditions the proton concentration in the surrounding water is not sufficient and causes the cell to decay while alkaliphile organisms rely on alternative membrane processes such as additional antiporters and coupled membrane transporters using sodium motive force padan et al 2005 most pathogenic bacteria show optimum growth at physiological ph which allows them to infect and proliferate within the body kim and ndegwa 2018 but will decay when facing extreme conditions the decrease in relative abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria that we observed correlated with this assumption with a strong decline from 7 1 to 1 6 between ph 7 5 and ph 9 4 limitations remain regarding the use of amplicon sequencing for the assessment of pathogenicity related to the limited resolution of the technique the varying gene copy number per organism and the lack of data available on pathogenic microorganisms to accurately assess the levels of pathogens alternative methods should be applied such as qpcr analyses of the known species which will provide absolute concentrations for the comparison of tested conditions yet the observed loss of overall potential pathogenicity of the water at elevated ph based on abundance of genera suggests an extra advantage of alkaline cooling tower conditioning 4 3 implications for industry in the presented study the pilot cooling tower was operated at different alkaline phs and demineralized water was selected as feed water the suggested conditioning does not require use of disinfectant and maintains a simpler chemistry compared to standard practice with the use of less chemicals while controlling the pathogenicity of the water it also anticipates a potential increase in regulations which could be expected in the coming years regarding the discharge of disinfection by products to the environment the use of demineralized water has several advantages the very low content in minerals prevents scaling formation on the surface of the cooling unit thus no dosage of antiscalant often contributing to a higher nutrient content of the water is required the limited concentration in organic compounds considerably restricts the formation of biofilm and therefore the proliferation of protozoa and associated bacteria last but not least the high water quality allows to operate the cooling tower with almost zero discharge thus maintaining a stable cooling water chemistry which ensue limited dosage of base naoh for alkaline ph control however important parts of the process i e pumps spray nozzles and heat exchangers will be prone to corrosion due to the nature of the water corrosion is a major drawback shortening the lifetime of the exchangers leading to system deficiencies and providing space for microbial communities to grow this phenomenon needs to addressed with alternative material choices or addition of inhibitors effective at high ph and not contributing to the nutrient and mineral content of the water for cooling towers already operating with other water sources than demineralized water such as surface water or ground water the choice for demineralized water is not always possible economic feasibility needs to be assessed for each specific case considering that demineralized water can cost between 0 5 and 1 euros higher per m3 than surface water if the original water source is kept removal of divalent ions calcium magnesium from the feed water is necessary to lower the hardness and switch to alkaline ph without a substantial increase in scaling potential hensley 1985 matson and harris 1979 additionally their removal might minimize biofilm formation due to the essential role ca2 and mg2 play in biofilm integrity e g with cross linkage das et al 2014 guvensen and demir 2012 corrosiveness is also a major challenge with softened water especially due to the high chloride concentration and needs to be addressed to avoid deterioration of the heat exchangers finally attention should to be paid to the pre existence of biofilm in the system and a deep cleaning would be required to avoid contamination when converting to alkaline conditioning 4 4 recommendations for further research past studies suggested that the infection of protozoa by legionella mainly occurs in biofilms abdel nour et al 2013 murga et al 2001 which provides a more stable environment to multiply e g on the wall of the cooling tower basins or packing fill surface although a biofilm is not expected to have formed in significant amount during the experimental periods and with the high water quality used this phenomena can contribute to l pneumophila proliferation further research investigating biofilm development and composition in terms of bacterial and eukaryotic communities at alkaline ph would help understand the biological interactions the biofouling potential and potential for legionella to thrive inside an alkaline biofilm overall the operation of cooling towers at ph equal or above 9 6 without disinfectant dosage represents an attractive alternative to the conventional practices the comparison of these results to the microbiome of full scale cooling towers operating at high ph on the long term is important to validate the industrial applicability 5 conclusions the investigation of alkaline conditioning in a pilot scale cooling tower 1 m3 h operated with demineralized water as feed water and without addition of disinfectant for the control of legionella pneumophila and other potentially pathogenic genera showed that growth of l pneumophila is prevented in cooling towers maintaining a ph 9 6 without biocide dosage l pneumophila is however still able to grow at ph up to 9 4 the overall suspected pathogenicity of the cooling water microbial community declines with increasing alkalinity divergence of the alkaline operating ph from physiological ph and dominance of the bacterial community by alkaliphilic microorganisms suggests reduced health risks to the operators and surrounding population when in contact with aerosols operating at ph 9 6 is a more sustainable and simpler cooling tower conditioning than dosing disinfection chemicals it anticipates potential future regulations further restricting discharge of disinfection by products nonetheless this alternative

17026,efficient control of pathogenic bacteria specifically legionella pneumophila is one of the main concerns when operating industrial cooling towers common practices to limit proliferation involves use of disinfectants leading to formation of disinfection by product and increase in water corrosiveness a disinfectant free legionella control method would make the industry more environmentally friendly a pilot scale cooling tower 1 m3 h operated with demineralized water was used to investigate the potential of high ph conditioning as a disinfectant free alternative for control of l pneumophila and other pathogens one control experiment was performed under standard full scale operation involving sodium hypochlorite dosage thereafter 3 alkaline phs of the cooling water were tested 9 0 9 4 and 9 6 the tests lasted between 25 and 35 days the cooling water from the basins were analysed for total cell count by flow cytometry l pneumophila concentration by plate count and occasional qpcr analyses targeting the mip gene bacterial and eukaryotic community analyses with 16s and 18s rrna gene amplicon sequencing relative abundance of eukaryotic to prokaryotic dna by qpcr of the 16s and 18s rrna gene the l pneumophila analyses showed considerable growth at ph 9 0 and ph 9 4 but was maintained below detection limit 100 cfu l at ph 9 6 without disinfection interestingly the results correlated with the overall abundance of protozoa in the water samples but not directly with the relative abundance of specific reported protozoan hosts of legionella the pathogenicity based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing of the cooling water dna decreased with increasing ph with a strong decline between ph 9 0 and ph 9 4 from 7 1 to 1 6 of relative abundance of pathogenic genera respectively a strong shift in microbiome was observed between each tested ph and reproducibility of the experiment at ph 9 6 was confirmed with a duplicate test lasting 80 days high ph conditioning 9 6 is therefore considered as an efficient disinfectant free cooling tower operation for control of pathogenicity including l pneumophila graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords protozoa microbiome interaction pathogenicity pca sustainability 1 introduction evaporative cooling towers are prone to the growth of legionella pneumophila a bacterial pathogen which induces a severe form of pneumonia named legionellosis when inhaled prussin ii et al 2017 ricketts et al 2012 together with other artificial water systems such as shower plumbing swimming pools or wastewater treatment plants they represent important sources of outbreaks due to the formation of aerosols spreading to the surrounding environment bartram et al 2007 evaporative cooling towers are the most often confirmed sources of legionellosis outbreaks and can contaminate large numbers of people as their aerosols can spread over several kilometres paschke et al 2019 number of cases of legionellosis in the european union has increased over the last decade causing at least 450 yearly death beauté 2017 and is expected to worsen due to increasing number of cooling towers and climate change paschke et al 2019 current methods to control pathogen growth and ensure safety of people consists in continuous or shock dosage of disinfectants often oxidative such as sodium hypochlorite chlorine dioxide or bromine bartram et al 2007 despite the biocides outbreaks of l pneumophila still occur due to an inappropriate balance in the complex chemical conditioning and delayed response caused by sparse and indirect plate count monitoring bentham 2000 in the netherlands l pneumophila plate count is the standard monitoring method with a detection limit of 100 cfu l while the drinking water act requires response actions to be taken when the concentration exceeds 100 cfu l the environmental protection act that applies to evaporative cooling towers does not specify any threshold national academies of sciences 2020 the industrial areas can therefore implement their own risk management plan often using a 104 cfu l threshold according to technical guidelines escmid 2017 growth of l pneumophila in water systems has been linked to presence of protist organisms past studies have shown that this pathogenic species performs intracellular replication within the vacuoles of amoebas and ciliated protozoan cells where it obtains required nutrients for growth and later evades the hosts via host cell lysis lau and ashbolt 2009 wadowsky et al 1988 protozoan species such as vermamoeba acanthamoeba and naegleria have been reported to constitute reservoirs allowing proliferation of l pneumophila in nutrient poor waters such as process water or drinking water wadowsky et al 1988 in addition this interaction provides protection of the pathogen towards sudden changes in environmental conditions and chlorine due the ability of the host to switch to a cyst form kilvington and price 1990 past research has been focusing on complementary or alternative methods to disinfection for cooling tower operation by altering system conditions in order to prevent pathogen growth and also prevent formation of disinfection by products that are discharged in the environment as l pneumophila grows at temperature between 20 and 45 c kusnetsov et al 1997 showed that a recirculating water temperature below 20 c allowed to maintain l pneumophila concentration below 1000 cfu l however operating with a cooling water temperature kept below 20 c is unlikely in most industrial sites alternatively application of alkaline ph has been suggested in past studies brouse et al 2017 states et al 1987 and applied on some industrial sites but no thorough assessment of the effect of alkaline ph conditioning on the overall cooling tower microbiome and pathogen presence has been previously described it has been reported from laboratory studies that l pneumophila can grow in a ph range of 5 5 to 9 2 wadowsky et al 1988 but there is still a lack of literature available above that range in general a strong knowledge gap remains on the survival ability of l pneumophila and other pathogens at alkaline ph i e above 9 0 in this pilot cooling tower study demineralized water at elevated ph was used as cooling water with the aim of controlling growth of l pneumophila and other potential pathogens without involving use of disinfectants more precisely the goals of this investigation were to i identify an optimal ph above which l pneumophila growth is prevented ii characterize the changes in overall microbiome caused by the increase in alkalinity with focus on potential pathogenic genera and iii discuss advantages and disadvantages of this approach in term of industrial applicability the use of a pilot scale facility was preferred to a laboratory scale set up as it allowed to accurately control operational parameters without excluding the impact of environmental conditions linked to external temperatures precipitations and air quality which are crucial factors in the microbiome dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 cooling tower installation 2 1 1 pilot description one pilot scale evaporative cooling system was built in a mobile container located in terneuzen netherlands at the time of the study suspended materials were initially removed from the inlet water by a candle filter the packing fill of the cooling tower was composed of hdpe pall rings the system was operated with a basin volume of 1 m3 and a recirculation flow of 1 m3 h an automatic valve allowed the refill of the basin heating was performed by a secondary water loop warmed up by a water boiler and recirculating through 6 steel based heat exchangers mounted in series cooling efficiency was controlled by automatic adjustment of the blower speed the water temperatures were maintained at 25 c in the cold section of the cooling system and simultaneously at 35 c in the hot section of the same system when maximal conductivity was reached a valve triggered the discharge of concentrated cooling water 2 1 2 online monitoring ph orbisint cps11d endress hauser switzerland conductivity condumax cls21d endress hauser switzerland temperatures thermophant t ttr31 endress hauser switzerland and free chlorine concentration analyzer ami codes ii cc swan switzerland were monitored online 2 1 3 conditionings conditionings and corresponding physical parameters are described in table 1 conditions were tested consecutively the control condition c simulated the conventional full scale operation of cooling tower with a conductivity of 3500 µs cm corresponding to a cycle of concentration of 5 of the feed surface water dosage of antiscalant and corrosion inhibitors were applied manually sulphuric acid for ph control at 7 5 and sodium hypochlorite for disinfection brenntag switzerland were added automatically the conductivity was maintained via discharge of concentrated cooling water and automatic refill with fresh surface water in all alkaline conditions ph 9 0 ph 9 4 ph 9 6 a and ph 9 6 b the high purity of the demineralized feed water resulted in a negligible increase in conductivity no discharge was thus applied in the first tested alkaline condition ph 9 0 was reached naturally and sodium silicate was dosed as corrosion inhibitor in the other tested conditions ph was increased by manual addition of sodium hydroxide brenntag switzerland to ph 9 4 or sodium hydroxide combined to sodium bicarbonate brenntag switzerland to ph 9 6 in ph 9 6 b 120 g of sodium chloride esco germany was added to the basin of 1 m3 to approach the composition of reverse osmosis permeate the comparison of ph 9 6 a and ph 9 6 b showed negligible impact of sodium chloride on the growth of l pneumophila and overall microbiology ph 9 6 a and ph 9 6 b were therefore considered as duplicate tests in this study in general conditions were tested for 25 to 35 days ph 9 0 was prematurely stopped after 21 days due to the high l pneumophila cell count ph 9 6 b was operated for 80 days as a long term validation experiment the cooling system was emptied and a subsequent two step chemical cleaning was performed between each experiment the first cleaning step involved the recirculation of demineralized water and sodium hypochlorite at a concentration of 30 ppm active chlorine for one hour which was then discharged the second cleaning step involved the recirculation of demineralized water with sulfuric acid dosage to ph 2 for one hour chemical solutions were flushed away with fresh demineralized water before the next experiment 2 2 experimental analyses 2 2 1 sampling water samples from the cold channel of the recirculation line were collected in sterile glass bottles and kept at 4 c until analyses flow cytometry plate count and qpcr measurements were performed within 24 h from the sampling time for l pneumophila quantification aqualab zuid laboratory followed the standard nen en iso iec 17025 2017 for 16s and 18s rrna sequencing analyses 400 ml of water was filtered through 0 22 µm pore size and 33 mm diameter sterile pvdf syringe filters merck germany and the filter membranes containing the biomass were kept at 20 c for later dna extraction biological duplicates were analysed at the end of each testing period 2 2 2 total cell count samples were diluted by a factor 10 control c or 100 ph 9 0 ph 9 4 ph 9 6 a and ph 9 6 b with ultrapure water prior to the flow cytometry measurements preparation of the stock solution of sybr green i and staining protocol are described elsewhere pinel et al 2020 analyses were performed on a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer bd biosciences belgium with a flow rate of 66 µl min on 50 µl of sample the fluorescence intensity was collected at fl1 533 30 nm and fl3 670 nm with a threshold of 700 on fl1 the applied gating strategy was based on a previous paper prest et al 2013 2 2 3 legionella pneumophila quantification l pneumophila was quantified by both indirect and direct methods with plate count and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr water samples were analysed by aqualab zuid laboratory werkendam netherlands 2 2 3 1 l pneumophila plate count enumeration of colony forming units of legionella was based on the protocol described in the standard iso 11731 2017 in short 1 ml of the water samples was spread on gvpc glycine vancomycin polymyxin cycloheximide agar plates the plates were subsequently incubated at 36 c after 10 days of incubation the plates were examined for colonies matching the legionella species colonies l pneumophila colonies were then identified by malditof ms matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry analysis according to the formerly developed method dilger et al 2016 used at aqualab zuid measurements were performed every 3 days in average 2 2 3 2 quantitative pcr qpcr quantification

lpneuf 5 ccgatgccacatcattagc 3 reverse primer lpneur 5 ccaattgagcgccactcatag 3 and probe lpneup 5 6 carboxyfluorescein fam tgcctttagccattgcttccg bhq1 3 were used for the analysis taq polymerase was activated at 95 c for 3 min and was followed by 43 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 20 s and annealing extension at 60 c for 60 s 2 2 4 dna extraction and sequencing the membrane filters containing the biomass collected from the water samples were recovered from the syringe filter units merck germany for further processing the genomic dna was extracted using the dneasy ultraclean microbial kit qiagen netherlands the company s standard method was followed during the extraction with an additional lysis step the lysis step consisted of 5 min of heating at 65 c and 5 min of bead beating on a mini beadbeater 24 biospec usa for cell disruption of the collected biomass the quality of the extracted dna was assessed by gel electrophoresis and size check 465 bp after qpcr amplification samples were sent to novogene ltd hongkong china for amplicon sequencing of the v4 region position 528 706 of the 18s rrna gene and the v3 4 region position 341 806 of the 16s rrna gene on an illumina paired

similarities between the representative sequences using uparse potential protozoan hosts for l pneumophila were identified based on a previous study boamah et al 2017 the raw 16s rrna gene sequences were processed with the software mothur v 1 40 5 for quality filtering alignment chimera check and taxonomic classification generation of operational taxonomic units otus were performed based on 97 similarities between the representative sequences after removal of singletons the alignment and taxonomic classifications were performed using the silva database potentially pathogenic bacterial genera were identified based on the list available in the drinking water quality guidelines who 2011 the main representative otu sequences were compared to the refseq ncbi database using the basic local alignment search tool blast for species identification results from the duplicate samples are shown in figures s1 s2 and s3 the doi of the raw sequencing data is available in supplementary material 2 2 5 beta diversity analysis diversity analyses were performed on the bacterial otus generated after the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and their relative abundances in the samples beta diversity measurement was assessed with principal component analysis pca in mothur v 1 40 5 using the thetayc distance matrix the spatial separations visualized in the pca provide information on the similarity between samples 2 2 6 abundance of prokaryotes and eukaryotes qpcr was performed to determine the absolute abundance of prokaryotes and eukaryotes by quantifying the number of copies of the 16s and 18s genes respectively the 16s dna standards were commercially obtained a product template for the 18s dna was initially created by pcr to be used as standard the template was based on the dna extracted from the alkaline test ph 9 6 b the dreamtaq green pcr master mix thermoscientific usa was combined to the forward primer euk1f 5 acc tgg ttg atcctg cca gt 3 reverse primer euk563r 5 acc aga ctt gccctcc 3 and ph 9 6 b dna extract according to manufacturer s specifications pcr was performed with the following settings 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 c 40 s at 55 c and 40 s at 72 c the size of the amplified dna fragments was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis amplified dna was purified following the monarch dna gel extraction kit biolabs uk a final dna concentration of 10 7 ng l was measured with a qubit fluorometer invitrogen usa serial dilution from 10 3 ng dna μl to 10 8 ng dna μl were used to generate the standard curves qpcr reaction mix were composed of 0 2 μl of each primer at a concentration of 50 μm 10 µl of iqtm sybr green supermix bio rad usa 7 6 μl of nuclease free water sigma aldrich uk and 2 μl of the extracted dna from the cooling water samples the primer sequences thermal profiles and qpcr efficiencies are described in table s1 3 results 3 1 total cell counts total bacterial cell concentration in the cooling water was measured by flow cytometry throughout the testing periods fig 1 shows the cell number reached at the end of each experiment averaged over the last 5 days the control c subjected to chlorine disinfection had the lowest bacterial cell number with 6 6 1 5 107 cells l chlorine disinfection applied in the control experiment was efficient in maintaining a low cell count the alkaline conditions without biocide dosage reached 3 2 0 5 109 cells l at ph 9 0 1 7 0 1 1010 cells l at ph 9 4 1 4 0 4 1010 cells l and 5 2 0 4 109 cells l at ph 9 6 a and b respectively 3 2 impact of increasing ph on l pneumophila growth the l pneumophila plate count results for the 5 pilot tests are also shown in fig 1 the control test c performed under the conventional full scale operating conditions at ph 7 5 with sodium hypochlorite dosage maintained a l pneumophila concentration below the detection limit of 100 cfu l during the entire 27 days of operation tests at ph 9 0 and ph 9 4 exceeded the tolerated limit of 103 cfu l set on the industrial site with 3 0 1 4 105 and 3 8 1 0 103 cfu l respectively at the end of the experiments qpcr measurements confirmed the presence of l pneumophila with values reaching up to 4 4 105 and 950 gene copies l at ph 9 0 and ph 9 4 respectively demineralized water at ph 9 0 seems to constitute a suitable environment for the growth of l pneumophila in cooling towers the ability of the pathogen to also grow at ph 9 4 was unexpected and therefore indicates that ph 9 4 is not alkaline enough to prevent proliferation the duplicates at ph 9 6 both maintained l pneumophila at very low or undetectable levels during the duration of the experiments i e 34 and 80 days respectively ph 9 6 a reached 200 cfu l on day 19 and 100 cfu l on day 21 while ph 9 6 b reached 100 cfu l on days 14 and 35 in the other plate count analyses 87 the concentration was below quantification limit 100 cfu l while all qpcr measurements were below quantification 375 gene copies l the results demonstrate that a ph of or above 9 6 constitutes an efficient conditioning for the control of l pneumophila in open recirculating cooling tower alternatively to biocide dosage 3 3 relative abundance of 18s eukaryotic to 16s prokaryotic gene copies the absolute quantification of the 18s and 16s gene copies by qpcr allowed an estimation of the proportion of eukaryotic dna to prokaryotic dna in the samples the ratio of 18s to 16s gene copies is displayed in fig 2 all samples contained a substantially lower amount of eukaryotic gene copies compared to prokaryotic gene copies between 1 log and 3 log fewer control c at ph 7 5 and tests at ph 9 4 and ph 9 6 a and b display a ratio of 18s 16s gene copies of 1 7 0 3 10 3 0 9 0 2 10 3 1 4 0 5 10 3 and 3 5 2 2 10 3 respectively at ph 9 0 however the ratio strongly diverges from the other samples with 5 7 3 5 10 2 indicating a relatively higher concentration of eukaryotic dna per prokaryotic dna with more than 1 log difference when compared to the other tested conditions the greater relative fraction of eukaryotic dna at ph 9 0 may suggest a higher availability of potential hosts for l pneumophila to multiply intracellularly 3 4 presence of potential protozoan hosts of l pneumophila identification of the eukaryotic community members was performed with 18s rrna gene sequencing of the dna extracted from the cooling water samples to assess the presence of potential hosts fig 3 a shows the relative abundances of the main eukaryotic kingdoms protista and chromista kingdoms accounted for the majority of the reads in the control c and at ph 9 0 and ph 9 4 with 43 10 62 5 and 58 8 respectively the duplicate tests at ph 9 6 show only 2 1 and 3 1 of protista and chromista abundances with dominance of the kingdom fungi the combination of the results from figs 2 and 3a therefore suggests a limited availability of hosts for l pneumophila at ph 9 6 due to the low occurrence of protists the composition and structure of the protist communities diverged strongly fig 3b between the tested conditions the test at ph 9 0 with the highest l pneumophila concentration and eukaryotic to prokaryotic dna ratio was largely dominated by the genera spumella from the phylum ochrophyta and vorticella from the phylum ciliophora these genera were also identified in the other tested conditions in lower abundances the duplicate tests at ph 9 6 show high similarity with each other regarding the protist community structures dominated by spumella phytophthora and halophytophthora halophytophthora is a reclassified genus previously assigned to phytophthora but regrouping marine species cooke et al 2000 as the only difference in the operation of the duplicate tests was the dosage of nacl the higher salt concentration in ph 9 6 b likely justifies the increase in relative abundance of halophytophthora the protist organisms present in the water samples were then compared to experimentally defined hosts and potential hosts of l pneumophila boamah et al 2017 their presence among the protist community of each test can be visualized in table 2 the control condition showed a negligible abundance of known hosts representing only 0 1 of the total eukaryotic reads a similarly low number was obtained at ph 9 0 with 0 2 despite the high concentration of l pneumophila measured suggesting the presence of non identified legionella hosts the two commonly found l pneumophila hosts echinamoeba exudans and vermamoeba vermiformis added up to 59 of the protist community and 33 of the whole eukaryotic community at ph 9 4 they also constituted an important fraction of the protists at ph 9 6 5 and 6 respectively but representing only 0 1 and 0 2 of the eukaryotic communities due to the low abundance of protists at this ph 3 5 presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria under different alkaline ph the abundance of potentially pathogenic bacterial genera based on the drinking water quality guideline who 2011 are listed in fig 4 the control c at ph 7 5 and test at ph 9 0 show a greatly higher total relative abundance of potential pathogens 7 1 0 9 and 5 7 0 3 of the total reads compared to the tests at ph 9 4 and ph 9 6 1 6 0 1 1 3 0 1 and 0 2 0 1 pseudomonas and enterobacter are the most abundant in the control test representing 4 2 0 1 and 1 8 0 3 respectively while bulkhoderia and legionella are dominant at ph 9 0 with 1 5 0 6 and 1 4 0 1 with also considerable abundance of enterobacter 1 3 0 8 the increase from ph 9 0 to ph 9 4 therefore considerably reduced the potential pathogenicity of the cooling water based on the results from the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing 3 6 overall bacterial community analyses fig 5 shows the relative abundance of the main bacterial genera in the cooling water samples variations in microbial community structure can be observed between the different tests with a switch in the main bacterial members at the phylum level the main difference originated from the promotion of bacteroidetes at alkaline ph while it accounted for 3 1 of the relative abundance in control c it reached 38 6 and 62 1 at ph 9 6 the remaining abundance was mainly represented by alpha and gammaproteobacteria at the genus level sphingobium was dominating in the control c at 44 8 but was present in negligible abundance at alkaline ph with less than 0 5 ph 9 0 and ph 9 4 show a more distributed relative abundance among genera with the main members being sediminibacterium at ph 9 0 22 4 and sphingopyxis and flavobacterium at ph 9 4 28 6 and 16 6 respectively the duplicates at ph 9 6 however display similarity in main community members the genus mongoliitalea from the family cyclobacteriaceae dominated both cooling waters with 35 5 and 60 1 although a contained also large abundances of phenylobacterium 21 6 and aliihoeflea 13 3 genera the blast of the otu representative sequence corresponding to the mongoliitalea genus resulted in 99 56 similarity in identity with the species mongoliitalea lutea a facultative alkaliphilic and halotolerant bacterial species collected from haloalkaline lakes the other 26 main otus whose genera are displayed in fig 5 were also compared to the database among those the representative sequences of the members labelled with the symbol showed over 99 similarity with sequences of known alkaliphilic or alkalitolerant species i e with optimum ph 9 0 or optimum ph 9 0 but able to grow at higher values the sum of the relative abundances of these otus was calculated for each experimental test while confirmed alkalitolerant organisms accounted for only 9 of the relative abundance of the main members in control c their abundance increased with increasing ph 28 at ph 9 0 56 at ph 9 4 69 and 78 at ph 9 6 for a and b respectively as expected the higher fraction of identified alkaliphilic bacteria at ph 9 4 and 9 6 implies that neutrophilic bacteria were outcompeted the principal component analysis in fig 6 represents the similarities between samples taking into account the members of the communities and their relative abundances the bacterial communities at alkaline ph all diverge from the control c at ph 7 5 among the tested conditions samples from ph 9 6 a and ph 9 6 b form a close cluster on the chart validating the reproducibility of the result for the conditioning at ph 9 6 4 discussion 4 1 cooling tower operation at ph 9 6 efficiently prevents growth of l pneumophila previous research based on a survey of 40 cooling towers operated in a ph ranging from 6 9 to 9 1 reported higher l pneumophila densities at ph between 8 4 and 9 1 yamamoto et al 1992 an earlier laboratory controlled ph batch experiment on cooling water samples showed however a better correlation of the pathogen growth with neutral ph values states et al 1987 these disparities in results point out the significant impact of operational conditions water sources and surrounding environment on the growth of l pneumophila in full scale cooling systems according to the available literature l pneumophila has been shown to grow at ph up to 9 2 but was not able to multiply from ph 10 brouse et al 2017 ohno et al 2003 wadowsky et al 1988 an important lack of information remained about the survival of the pathogen within the ph range from 9 2 to 10 our study explored this gap and revealed that l pneumophila can survive and grow at ph 9 4 although at a much lower concentration than at ph 9 0 most importantly l pneumophila was unable to grow at ph 9 6 multiplication of legionella in engineered water systems requires presence of host protozoan cells lau and ashbolt 2009 wadowsky et al 1988 the amount and nature of nutrients in cooling water is generally too limited for l pneumophila multiplication as a free living organism since it requires a complex medium to grow including compounds like amino acids as carbon and energy source sauer et al 2005 tesh and miller 1981 tesh et al 1983 or fatty acids fonseca and swanson 2014 the intracellular components of some amoebas such as acanthamoeba vermamoeba and naegleria sp jjemba et al 2015 lau and ashbolt 2009 molofsky and swanson 2004 and ciliated protozoa caicedo et al 2018 fields et al 1984 therefore constitute an appropriate reservoir for the growth of the pathogen when encountering extreme conditions such as chlorine disinfection protozoa go through a mechanism of encystment to protect themselves from the hostile environment kilvington and price 1990 contrarily to their vegetative trophozoite form cysts of protozoa are in a dormant state and do not proliferate but their reinforced cell wall constitutes a strong protection for the intracellular pathogens our study reflects a positive correlation between the abundance in protozoa figs 2 and 3a and l pneumophila counts fig 1 as was also reported in the cooling tower survey by yamamoto et al 1992 the dominance of protozoa at ph 9 0 and 9 4 and the higher eukaryotic to prokaryotic dna ratio at ph 9 0 suggest the presence of unicellular trophozoite reservoirs to sustain the observed l pneumophila growth in these two tested conditions in the duplicate test runs at ph 9 6 a poor abundance of protists was observed concomitant with a good control of l pneumophila growth the relative abundance of potential hosts fig 3b in our samples based on a suggested list derived from laboratory experiments and environmental analyses boamah et al 2017 did however not show a clear correlation at ph 9 0 the l pneumophila counts were substantial but previously reported hosts were present only in minor abundance contrarily to ph 9 4 table 2 spumella flagellate and vorticella ciliate the main genera at ph 9 0 have not been reported as hosts but the limited knowledge available on the specificity of l pneumophila for intracellular replication guerrieri et al 2005 as well as the non exhaustive list of cultivated natural hosts cannot exclude their involvement in the experiments at ph 9 6 the fraction of the protist abundance of reported hosts 5 2 and 6 6 represented a negligible fraction of the total abundance of eukaryotes in fact the eukaryotic communities were mainly represented by fungi our study revealed a substantial impact of the ph increase from 9 4 to 9 6 on the limitation of protists and a direct correlation with the inhibition of l pneumophila growth 4 2 increased ph leads to a strong bacterial community shift with lower pathogenicity a strong shift in bacterial community was observed between the control experiment at ph 7 5 with chlorine disinfection and each of the tested alkaline ph conditions with no disinfection proteobacteria dominated the control c with sphingobium sp a recurrent organism in drinking water and cooling systems subjected to chlorination due to their oligotrophic nature and ability to grow in biofilm mode shaw et al 2015 vaz moreira et al 2011 paranjape et al 2020 pseudomonas is also a common genus encountered in cooling systems under disinfection paranjape et al 2020 bacterial community composition and relatively low total cell count in the control experiment therefore reproduced the environment of a full scale system under standard operation regarding alkaline conditions the abundance of bacteroidetes was previously shown to positively correlate with increasing ph ganzert et al 2014 lauber et al 2009 as it is the case in our study mongoliitalea lutea cyclobacteriaceae bacteroidete is a facultative alkaliphile able to develop at ph between 6 5 and 12 0 with an optimum at ph 9 0 yang et al 2012 however it was in our study only present in negligible abundance at ph 9 4 while it was the dominant bacterium at ph 9 6 our data suggests that the ph increase from 7 5 c to 9 6 gradually limited the growth of neutrophiles and promoted alkalitolerant and alkaliphilic species such as mongoliitalea lutea driving ph away from neutral value requires bacteria to adjust their proton motive force to maintain a cytoplasmic ph in the neutral range krulwich et al 2011 in too alkaline conditions the proton concentration in the surrounding water is not sufficient and causes the cell to decay while alkaliphile organisms rely on alternative membrane processes such as additional antiporters and coupled membrane transporters using sodium motive force padan et al 2005 most pathogenic bacteria show optimum growth at physiological ph which allows them to infect and proliferate within the body kim and ndegwa 2018 but will decay when facing extreme conditions the decrease in relative abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria that we observed correlated with this assumption with a strong decline from 7 1 to 1 6 between ph 7 5 and ph 9 4 limitations remain regarding the use of amplicon sequencing for the assessment of pathogenicity related to the limited resolution of the technique the varying gene copy number per organism and the lack of data available on pathogenic microorganisms to accurately assess the levels of pathogens alternative methods should be applied such as qpcr analyses of the known species which will provide absolute concentrations for the comparison of tested conditions yet the observed loss of overall potential pathogenicity of the water at elevated ph based on abundance of genera suggests an extra advantage of alkaline cooling tower conditioning 4 3 implications for industry in the presented study the pilot cooling tower was operated at different alkaline phs and demineralized water was selected as feed water the suggested conditioning does not require use of disinfectant and maintains a simpler chemistry compared to standard practice with the use of less chemicals while controlling the pathogenicity of the water it also anticipates a potential increase in regulations which could be expected in the coming years regarding the discharge of disinfection by products to the environment the use of demineralized water has several advantages the very low content in minerals prevents scaling formation on the surface of the cooling unit thus no dosage of antiscalant often contributing to a higher nutrient content of the water is required the limited concentration in organic compounds considerably restricts the formation of biofilm and therefore the proliferation of protozoa and associated bacteria last but not least the high water quality allows to operate the cooling tower with almost zero discharge thus maintaining a stable cooling water chemistry which ensue limited dosage of base naoh for alkaline ph control however important parts of the process i e pumps spray nozzles and heat exchangers will be prone to corrosion due to the nature of the water corrosion is a major drawback shortening the lifetime of the exchangers leading to system deficiencies and providing space for microbial communities to grow this phenomenon needs to addressed with alternative material choices or addition of inhibitors effective at high ph and not contributing to the nutrient and mineral content of the water for cooling towers already operating with other water sources than demineralized water such as surface water or ground water the choice for demineralized water is not always possible economic feasibility needs to be assessed for each specific case considering that demineralized water can cost between 0 5 and 1 euros higher per m3 than surface water if the original water source is kept removal of divalent ions calcium magnesium from the feed water is necessary to lower the hardness and switch to alkaline ph without a substantial increase in scaling potential hensley 1985 matson and harris 1979 additionally their removal might minimize biofilm formation due to the essential role ca2 and mg2 play in biofilm integrity e g with cross linkage das et al 2014 guvensen and demir 2012 corrosiveness is also a major challenge with softened water especially due to the high chloride concentration and needs to be addressed to avoid deterioration of the heat exchangers finally attention should to be paid to the pre existence of biofilm in the system and a deep cleaning would be required to avoid contamination when converting to alkaline conditioning 4 4 recommendations for further research past studies suggested that the infection of protozoa by legionella mainly occurs in biofilms abdel nour et al 2013 murga et al 2001 which provides a more stable environment to multiply e g on the wall of the cooling tower basins or packing fill surface although a biofilm is not expected to have formed in significant amount during the experimental periods and with the high water quality used this phenomena can contribute to l pneumophila proliferation further research investigating biofilm development and composition in terms of bacterial and eukaryotic communities at alkaline ph would help understand the biological interactions the biofouling potential and potential for legionella to thrive inside an alkaline biofilm overall the operation of cooling towers at ph equal or above 9 6 without disinfectant dosage represents an attractive alternative to the conventional practices the comparison of these results to the microbiome of full scale cooling towers operating at high ph on the long term is important to validate the industrial applicability 5 conclusions the investigation of alkaline conditioning in a pilot scale cooling tower 1 m3 h operated with demineralized water as feed water and without addition of disinfectant for the control of legionella pneumophila and other potentially pathogenic genera showed that growth of l pneumophila is prevented in cooling towers maintaining a ph 9 6 without biocide dosage l pneumophila is however still able to grow at ph up to 9 4 the overall suspected pathogenicity of the cooling water microbial community declines with increasing alkalinity divergence of the alkaline operating ph from physiological ph and dominance of the bacterial community by alkaliphilic microorganisms suggests reduced health risks to the operators and surrounding population when in contact with aerosols operating at ph 9 6 is a more sustainable and simpler cooling tower conditioning than dosing disinfection chemicals it anticipates potential future regulations further restricting discharge of disinfection by products nonetheless this alternative

17027,to control microbial proliferation and nitrification within distribution systems utilities practicing secondary disinfection chloramination often discontinue their ammonia feed and provide a short free chlorine disinfection period fclp commonly referred to as a chlorine burn however the success and practicality of this approach is often criticized because of the return to nitrification yet previous studies conducted in full scale distribution systems do not contain the sampling frequency to determine how quickly nitrification can return in this research a total of 15 hydrants distributed across hydraulically modeled water ages were sampled for 21 sampling events over a period spanning two annual fclps 2018 and 2019 to investigate the water quality planktonic community and using a new sampling technique established biofilm community impacts within a single distribution system pressure zone hydrants measured elevated nitrite only 10 weeks after the end of the fclp and live cell counts in the bulk and scour samples statistically significantly increased within two weeks after the fclp ended and chloramine disinfection resumed indicating limited impacts from a fclp furthermore the fclp significantly increased iron concentrations during the period of free chlorine disinfection creating a consumer water quality concern microbial fingerprint analysis using flow cytometry revealed that beta diversity did not significantly change for sampling locations that experienced even periodic low total chlorine concentrations only locations that maintained high chlorine residuals throughout both chloramine and free chlorine disinfection periods demonstrated significant changes in bulk water microbial community even for these locations microbial communities of the scoured biofilms remained similar over the course of the study graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine burn microbial community nitrification distribution system drinking water 1 0 introduction the utility use of chloramines as a disinfectant has increased over the last 20 years the awwa disinfectant survey noted approximately a 20 increase in utilities using chloramine disinfectants in the u s between 1998 and 2007 awwa disinfection systems committee 2018a 2018b many switching in response to the stage 1 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproducts rule d dbpr most of the utilities currently applying chloramines are surface water systems concerned with minimizing disinfection by products dbps and distribution system maintenance seidel et al 2005a the use of chloramines however introduces ammonia into the distribution system through residual ammonia at the point of entry and by chloramine decomposition within the distribution system which can lead to areas of nitrification within a distribution system the excess ammonia in the distribution system can promote the growth of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms aom leading to nitrification occurrences within the distribution system as ammonia is oxidized to nitrite and nitrite is further oxidized to nitrate nitrification is typically marked by decreases in chloramine residuals and increased microbial activity odell et al 1996 skadsen 1993 wilczak et al 1996 and can lead to increased corrosion zhang et al 2009 even though the maximum contaminant concentrations mcls for both nitrite and nitrate are regulated at the point of entry into the distribution system and not at the tap nitrification within a distribution can increase the potential consumption of both contaminants creating a public health concern the link between nitrate consumption and an increased risk to certain cancers is not confirmed but a great public health concern is the reduction in chloramine disinfectant within the distribution system national research council 2006 nitrification is not specifically defined by regulations and the onset is not consistently evaluated ranging from threshold concentrations of nitrite greater than 0 025 mg l n fleming et al 2008 to some considering changes in nitrite and nitrate between 0 05 0 5 mg l n wilczak et al 1996 a common strategy to diminish nitrification within chloraminated systems is a temporary annual conversion to free chlorine seidel et al 2005a skadsen 1993 this periodic conversion is often referred to as breakpoint chlorination or as a chlorine burn but will subsequently be referred to as the free chlorine period fclp the goals of a fclp are to oxidize free ammonia in the distribution system temporarily removing it as an electron donor to deactivate nitrifiers within the distribution system and to oxidize nitrite to reduce chloramine degradation american water works association 2013 according to a study which included 106 utilities currently using chloramines as a secondary disinfectant in 2005 23 of these utilities used a periodic conversion to free chlorine as one method to control nitrification within the distribution system seidel et al 2005a the survey results reported by seidel et al 2005 also note the most popular months to switch disinfectants are september march and august typically it is the areas with low to no total chlorine residual that experience nitrification however in an analysis of nitrification potential within several distribution systems fleming et al 2008 suggest that controlling free ammonia concentrations may control nitrification in areas that nitrify despite maintaining total chlorine residuals around 2 mg l cl2 the success and practicality of this approach is often criticized due to ineffectiveness in disrupting biofilms and cell concentrations rosenfeldt et al 2009 vikesland et al 2006 rapid return to nitrification after the conversion carrico et al 2008 rosenfeldt et al 2009 wang et al 2014 and increased dbp concentrations carrico et al 2008 in addition to water quality issues the public s ability to discern taste and odor changes in their water as a result of changing disinfectants are challenging to overcome mackey et al 2001 numerous bench scale and pilot studies have investigated disinfection switching and nitrification control such as fleming et al 2005 lee et al 2011 pressman et al 2012 schrantz et al 2013 srinivasan et al 2008 allowing in particular for in depth analyses of biofilm reactions to disinfectant applications however distribution system characteristics can greatly influence nitrification system design sizes pressure zones water age and hydraulic residence times pipe materials and routine distribution system operation and maintenance are difficult to replicate in a laboratory increasing the importance of large scale distribution system investigations of nitrification several previous distribution system based studies have investigated the impacts of a temporary fclp on a distribution system carrico et al 2008 rosenfeldt et al 2009 wang et al 2014 however sampling frequency sampling source consistency and lack of distribution system water age knowledge were all barriers to creating a comprehensive understanding of the impacts given the limited literature in full scale systems dedicated to understanding the impacts of disinfectant switching and recognizing the complexities within a large distribution system this research investigates the water quality planktonic community and established biofilm community impacts related to switching from chloramine disinfection to a temporary six week fclp by 1 restricting the study to a single pressure zone within one distribution system 2 using hydraulically modeled water age to aid in hydrant selection 3 sampling at a higher frequency for over a year and 4 keeping all sampling points consistent all are hydrants this research uses flow cytometry to classify microbial communities based on the individual phenotypic fingerprint of the community and relate changes in these classifications to water quality parameters to understand the risk posed and the operational conditions of community changes cell count proliferation and biological management the study also pilots a novel technique of using both low velocity and high velocity sampling methods to probe both planktonic and established biofilm communities the overall goal of this research is to assess the fclp effects on a large distribution system by analyzing both bulk water quality and established biofilms to 1 determine differences in cell count concentrations and microbial community shifts and correlations with nitrification parameters 2 determine whether the impact of the chlorine burn on the nitrification is sustained once normal operations resume and 3 investigate geographical distribution and temporal effects of overall water quality within the distribution system 2 0 methodology 2 1 site selection the washington aqueduct wad practices a temporary conversion from chloramines to free chlorine disinfection for six weeks the fclps included in the study were the march 26 may 06 2018 and the march 25 may05 2019 periods sampling occurred at hydrants spaced throughout the third high 3h pressure and distribution zone within the dc water system this area contains numerous unlined cast iron mains and areas with high water age using the hydraulic model of the system a water age category of 1 24 hours 2 24 48 hours or 3 48 hours was assigned to all the 1606 hydrants within the 3rd high pressure zone hydrants were selected based on water age category distribution water main characteristics unlined or lined cast iron and spatial distribution within the pressure zone a total of 15 hydrants were selected and monitored fig 1 and see supplemental materials table s1 for details regarding each hydrant unlined cast iron is the prevalent pipe type within the dc water distribution system therefore most hydrants included in the study are associated with this pipe classification in addition to the 15 hydrants grab samples from the point of entry for the two treatment plants were collected and analyzed each sampling event occurred over four consecutive days with the first day focused on the poe and then the hydrants sampled per age distribution 2 2 sample collection the study began two weeks prior to the fclp and performed flushing and sampling collection weekly for11 weeks the first week of sampling was removed from all analysis due to large iron spikes occurring when a hydrant has not been routinely flushed one extended flushing event during the first week for all hydrants was monitored for stabilization of water quality due to the removal of accumulated debris and resulted in more consistent water quality data during the study the study still measures this as week 1 of sampling since it marks the start of the study the sampling interval increased to every 2 weeks for june after which it occurred monthly until the 2019 fclp in april 2019 a total of 21 sampling events were included in this study a table of sample event weeks and corresponding dates is located in supplemental materials table s2 at each hydrant two types of samples were collected the first sample is what we refer to as the bulk water sample for this sample the hydrant was fully opened but flow was restricted to a low flow condition at approximately 0 28 0 45 l s using a hydrant tap and the hydrant was flushed for 8 min before collecting a microbial sample in a sterilized 250 ml container with sodium thiosulphate for microbiological analyses of planktonic microbial communities as well as 500 ml for water quality parameter analyses after the bulk samples were collected the hydrant was shut and a hydrant diffuser was attached to allow for maximum velocity flow after attaching the diffuser the hydrant was opened completely to scour the attached biofilms through high velocity forces on the pipes both microbial samples in sterilized 250 ml containers with sodium thiosulphate as well as 500 ml samples for water quality parameter analyses were collected after approximately 30 seconds of high velocity flow once the hydrant was fully open following standard operating procedures the duration of the flush was based off of previous flushing studies conducted by the water quality division where samples collected between 30 sec and 1 min of flushing contained higher concentration of cells than those of longer durations less than 30 seconds results in more debris and not higher cell counts both bulk and scoured samples were measured for physio chemical parameters to ensure the consistency between both sample types if inconsistencies were present it could be concluded that different water packets were being delivered to the hydrant thus influencing the results bulk and scoured water samples were analyzed for nitrite free chlorine total chlorine free ammonia and monochloramine using the hach sl1000 as well as temperature ph and orp using specific probes attached to the unit iron and nitrate were determined using the hach dr900 all samples with iron concentrations exceeding 1 mg l underwent filtration through a 0 45 µm membrane filter prior to water quality analysis of dissolved concentrations for the other parameters to eliminate interference microbial samples were analyzed by flow cytometry bd accuri c6 becton dickinson franklin lakes usa for total and live cell counts as well as phenotypic fingerprinting information associated with the microbial community of the sample based on the cell morphology box plots of the entire dataset for total chlorine temperature and orp were analyzed comparing bulk to scour samples only iron total cells and live cells presented a statistically significant difference between sampling strategies increasing confidence in the method fig 2 it is therefore assumed that the scour samples represent material buildup on the pipe walls near the hydrant the scour sampling technique needs further exploration but can prove a useful tool to sample inside the distribution system without needing to install coupons or remove sections of pipe more research is needed to understand the differences between these near hydrant communities and biofilm communities in main distribution lines throughout the distribution system 2 3 flow cytometric analysis from each 110 ml hydrant sample 198 µl were pipetted into sterile 96 well plates to differentiate between damaged and intact bacterial cells samples were stained with 2 µl working solution containing 98 0 22 m filtered dimethyl sulfoxide and 1 of each stock solution of nucleic acid binding stains sybr green i 10 000 x concentrate in dimethyl sulfoxide and propidium iodide 40 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide the stained samples were incubated in the dark for 13 min at 35 c flow cytometric analysis was performed using a c6 accuri flow cytometer bd biosciences equipped with a 20 mw 488 nm laser four florescence detectors fl1 530 30 nm fl2 585 40 nm fl3 670 nm and fl4 675 25 nm and two scatter detectors forward scatter fsc and side scatter ssc bd csampler plus software was used to process the data and standardize the measurements for each sample the software also allowed for a quality control check of the instrument using bd cs t ruo beads to ensure performance the analysis software was set to measure all particles within 100 µl of the 200 µl sample at a fast fluidics rate of 66 µl min a precalibrated polygon gate was applied on a density plot of the green fluorescence fl1 530 30 nm vs red fluorescence fl3 670 nm detectors for each sample to distinguish the threshold between instrument noise or water sample background and bacterial signals with the gate applied the flow cytometer software was able to quantify bacterial cell concentrations for each sample all samples were collected prepared and analyzed within 8 h 2 4 phenotypic fingerprints of bacterial communities to translate flow cytometric data into phenotypic fingerprints of bacterial communities we followed the methodology described in props monsieurs mysara clement boon 2016 this method allows the user to distinguish communities based on phenotypic characteristics such as morphology and nucleic acid content by measuring florescent and scatter detector signal heights when flow cytometric analysis is performed six bivariate density plots are produced fl1 vs fl3 fl1 vs ssc fl1 vs fsc fl3 vs ssc fl3 vs fsc and ssc vs fsc phenotypic fingerprinting discretizes the microbial communities in equal size bins and assigns each bin a density associated with the probability of one cell having the specific phenotypic characteristics in the defined space props et al 2016 similar to sequencing data phenotypic fingerprint data contains the relative abundances of all species making it suitable for alpha and beta diversity metrics and calculations phenotypic fingerprints represent the inter cell variability of cell properties that occur at the community level data were processed under flow cytometry standard format and imported into r version 3 4 4 r development core team using the phenoflow package props et al 2016 to isolate bacterial cell signals an electronic polygon gate was overlain on each of the six flow cytometric bivariate density plots to remove background noise and keep signals produced by bacteria all data bulk and scour were processed together the height values of each bivariate density plot were logarithmically transformed and normalized to the 0 1 interval a 128 128 binning grid was superimposed over each of the six flow cytometric bivariate density plots from which signal height values were calculated for each bin the bin signal heights were extracted from these six datasets and were concatenated to create a multivariate dataset 2 5 statistical analysis all analyses were performed using r version 3 4 4 r development core team the multivariate dispersion of hydrant phenotypic fingerprints was examined via principle coordinate analysis pcoa using a bray curtis dissimilarity index which was calculated using the vegan package oksanen et al 2019 to explore relationships between the ordination scores and in situ water quality parameters correlations were calculated and biplots were overlain on the pcoa using the envfit and vectorfit functions in the vegan package the vectorfit function calculates the direction within the ordination space for which each water quality parameter changes most rapidly and has the maximal correlation with the ordination using a canonical correspondence analysis this is a common method of presenting environmental variables in ordination space using linear constraints paliy and shankar 2016 wang et al 2012 only those parameters with the strongest correlations r 0 25 and p 0 001 using this method were plotted on the biplot with a scaled representation so the strongest predictors are drawn longer in the pcoa biplot than the weakest statistical differences between multivariate positions between disinfectant feed bulk and scour samples and hydrants were tested using permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova using the adonis function in the vegan package using a bray curtis dissimilarity index pairwise permanova was performed using the pairwiseadonis package martinez arbizu 2019 to reduce the chances of obtaining false positive results p values for pairwise comparisons

treatment plants varied little in terms of disinfectant concentrations nitrite and intact cells entering the distribution system full set of water quality data for poes presented in the supplemental materials figures s2 s3 disinfectant levels at the points of entry poe for both water treatment plants wtp remained above 3 mg l total cl2 for the duration of the study period and intact cells and nitrite remained near zero for the entirety of the study only free ammonia and nitrate contained notable concentration variations free ammonia fluctuated between 0 and 0 4 mg l with mean concentrations during chloramine disinfection of 0 14 and 0 10 mg l n for poe1 and poe2 respectively poe1 mean 0 12 median 0 10 max 0 34 mg l n poe2 mean 0 08 median 0 10 max 0 23 mg l n previous research have suggested minimizing ammonia nitrogen to 0 15 mg l implying that the periods of higher free ammonia could be problematic skadsen 1993 the free ammonia concentrations typically peaked in the weeks post fclp in week 8 at poe2 and in week 13 for poe1 when the ammonia feed was restarted at the treatment plants this increase is important when interpreting the nitrite concentration data within the distribution system nitrate concentrations naturally varied over time and between wtps due to fluctuations in the source water however despite this variation the two wtps supplied similar nitrate concentrations at the poe of 2 7 mg l n on average 3 2 bulk water quality this study tracked the water quality at 15 hydrants over a 58 week period therefore it is useful to first determine if there are system wide trends that appear at all hydrants to facilitate this analysis we compiled all hydrant data and analyzed by disinfectant type the first week of sampling was removed from the entire dataset due to water quality anomalies that can occur when opening a hydrant that has not received frequent flushing removing transition weeks from the analysis nitrite total cell counts and live intact cell counts are statistically significantly higher during chloramine disinfection fig 3 with only iron greater during the fclp an increase in iron concentrations is expected during the fclp given the prevalence of older cast iron pipes in the distribution system and the increase in oxidation reduction potential orp when switching from chloramines to free chlorine when individual hydrants are compared those with high average iron concentrations during the chloramine disinfection period are the same ones that experience large increases during the free chlorine period signifying that both chloramine and free chlorine are involved in corrosion at the pipe surface for example hydrant h1 4 a hydrant in the lowest age category of the study had average iron concentrations of 2 8 mg l during the chloraminated period and 4 6 mg l during the free chlorine period see figures s4 s8 in the supplemental materials document for plots of all bulk water quality for all the hydrants included in the study this same hydrant had among the highest average counts of live cells during both secondary disinfectant periods free chlorine period 10938 average counts μl chloraminated period 13738 average counts μl these increased cell counts are not related to total chlorine concentrations alone as this hydrant while receiving fluctuating concentrations maintained an average residual of 1 4 mg l total chlorine during chloramination when implemented during this time of year the effectiveness of the fclp to reduce nitrification within the distribution system must look at the lag time for cell counts to rebound and nitrite production to begin post conversion from fclp back to chloramine nitrification onset is defined here when concentrations exceed 0 025 mg l n within the study area the same threshold used by fleming et al 2008 looking at the data on a weekly basis fig 4 the lag between the free chlorine period ending after week 8 and the onset of nitrification in week 18 is 10 weeks using a sampling method that removed collection inconsistencies due to various sampling locations within the distribution system as observed in carrico et al 2008 sampling location variations present in rosenfeldt et al 2009 and the sampling infrequency associated with most previous studies carrico et al 2008 rosenfeldt et al 2009 wang et al 2014 this study demonstrates that the speed to nitrification onset post fclp is much quicker than previously observed also noticeable is the clear increasing trend in iron during the free chlorine period previous research has suggested that iron pipes may contribute to the chlorine demand of the system facilitating nitrification by reducing chlorine residuals odell et al 1996 however we are observing iron release during the free chlorine period and not in tandem with chloramine decay and ammonia release it is conceivable that locations that practice shorter fclp might avoid negative impacts of increased iron aside from aesthetic concerns iron corrosion has shown to promote microbial growth providing nutrients in an otherwise limiting environment morton et al 2005 increases in iron could expedite nitrifier activity after returning to chloramine disinfection since the elevated concentrations are sustained for two weeks after the ammonia feed is restarted at the wtps during week 9 demonstrated increases in total cells and nitrite do not occur until several weeks later week 18 and correlate more directly with decreasing free ammonia than sustained iron concentrations once the ammonia feed was restarted at the wtp increased free ammonia concentrations are measured and remain elevated above 0 2 mg l until after week 18 when nitrite increases this sustained increase in free ammonia could assist in initiating nitrification activity due to the availability of the ammonia as presented by yang et al 2007 and observed during this research it is important to note that the free chlorine period began in late march when distributed water temperature was still near 10 c close to the minimum temperature experienced throughout the year and finished with temperatures hovering around 20 c distribution water temperatures peaked to a high of near 30 c in august 2018 temperature fluctuations can impact the kinetic parameters of nitrification according to the arrhenius equation significantly lowering nitrifier growth at 20 c than 30 c zhang et al 2009 reduced nitrification activity is observed in this study around the same time as water temperatures decrease nitrification within the system ends by the 38th week of sampling 26 30 november and is most closely associated to the decreasing temperatures as the distribution system water temperatures fall below 20 c analyzing the data by hydrant over time there are several important occurrences with regards to chlorine residual concentrations and nitrite concentrations see supplemental materials figure s4 8 for full set of data comparing fluctuations in residual chlorine and nitrite concentrations those hydrants across the pressure zone regardless of modeled water age that experience decreases in chlorine residual demonstrate corresponding increases in nitrite the weeks immediately after the fclp were the most susceptible to decreased total chlorine concentrations corresponding with the the highest water temperatures and highest free ammonia concentrations within the system subsetting the data to look only at the months of june july and august when nitrite is greatest in the system average nitrite concentrations are statistically significantly higher p 0 001 in the oldest water age group 50 hours than the lower two classifications all three age groups contain hydrants that record maximum concentrations exceeding 0 4 mg l n nitrite during this time water quality information for hydrant h2 3 is presented in fig 5 as an interesting example since after sustaining a period of increased free ammonia small decreases in total chlorine corresponded with increases in nitrite in this case the total chlorine decreased from approximately 3 mg l to 2 mg l a concentration considered acceptable by most utility standards american water works association 2013 the usepa surface water treatment rule requires that utilities maintain a disinfectant residual of at least 0 2 mg l and detectable levels in 95 of the distribution system samples monitored monthly swtr 40 cfr 141 74 a more recent standard by a consortium of states recommends a residual of 1 0 mg l at distant points of the distribution system during chloramination glumrb 2012 this increase of nitrite to 0 15 mg l n for h2 3 exceeds the fleming et al 2008 0 025 mg l n definition of nitrification onset a noticeable response in nitrite concentrations when total chlorine concentrations remain above at 2 0 mg l water main pipe type varied throughout the distribution system and is reflected in the mains feeding the hydrants included in our study using the same subset of data for june july and august no significant difference in nitrite concentrations wilcoxon p 0 8 or free ammonia wilcoxon p 0 5 by pipe lining are present as this study was conducted in an operational distribution system many factors could not be controlled for example while pressure zone 3h primarily receives water from poe1 often poe2 also provides water to the area the hydraulic model from which the approximate water ages for the hydrants were based assumes zero flow from poe2 however after august 2018 sporadic pumping from poe2 to the area began and continued throughout the remainder of the study this could reduce the theoretical water age of several hydrants closest to poe2 thereby decreasing the chances of chloramine decay and nitrification additionally the hydrants sampled in this work have characteristics that do not change over time such as location within the distribution system age of associated main characteristic water use of the neighborhood however these characteristics can play a role as explanatory variables after statistical testing a linear regression focused on the post fclp was determined most appropriate for the dataset regression results are contained in table 1 the individual parameter coefficient magnitudes and directions can help illustrate a complete picture of influences on nitrification within a complicated water matrix and distribution system individual hydrant effects were controlled for in the model reducing the influence of one hydrant on the outcomes while linear regression is a useful tool regression using water quality parameters are difficult to interpret since statistical significance can indicate onset of nitrification or occur as a result of ongoing nitrification for example ph is negatively correlated to increasing nitrite however while highly statistically significant this correlation is also directly related to occurrences of nitrification the decreasing chlorine concentrations are more likely creating an environment for nitrification thus decreasing the ph as a result and potentially amplifying the relationship the coefficient for total chlorine suggests that for every 1 mg l decrease in chlorine concentrations nitrite could increase by 0 056 exceeding the threshold of nitrification while this will depend on other water quality variables the high statistical significance of the relationship does suggest that even at higher chlorine residuals like those presented in fig 5 for h2 3 decreases in residual chloramine concentrations can cause significant increases in nitrite if other conditions are favorable parameters with statistically significant positive relationships include water temperature nitrate and ammonia while increasing nitrate which varied at the poe over time can occur as a direct result of nitrification and not be attributable to the cause of nitrification ammonia and water temperature are more directly related to conditions preceding the onset of nitrification water temperature is likely to have a direct effect on nitrification and was also highly significant 0 006 p 0 000 and matches expected concentrations when one estimates nitrite concentrations in relation to 10 c increases in temperature the regression analysis results for free ammonia at the poe indicate that a 1 mg l increase in ammonia correlates to a 0 111 mg l increase in nitrite large magnitudes of free ammonia are not expected in the distribution system but even 0 3 mg l n increases in free ammonia are correlated to nitrite increases of 0 03 mg l n this signals that controlling free ammonia at the treatment plant is extremely important supporting the conclusions of fleming et al 2008 two variables that were included and surprisingly did not have a significant effect on nitrification were the time since the end of the fclp and the percent of the daily flow from poe1 on the day of sampling it was hypothesized that when the percent of flow to 3h pressure zone from poe1 changed it would significantly impact actual water age within the zone however this contribution rarely decreases below 80 percent and was not statistically significant as it relates to nitrite concentrations it was also hypothesized that the lag time weeks from when the fclp ended would have a significant correlation with nitrification but was not statistically significant and therefore was less important than other parameters like temperature the impact of temperature and the timing of fclps requires more investigation september august and march are the most common months for fclp conversions seidel et al 2005b yet depending on geographical location of the utility the impacts of conducting a fclp conversion in march could have drastically different impacts on nitrification trends within the distribution system the results of the linear regression confirm the bulk water quality trends discussed earlier in the manuscript 3 3 microbial analysis and discussion to understand the effectiveness of the scour sampling method from a microbial perspective beta diversity distance matrices computed from the flow cytometer phenotypic fingerprinting were compared using the non parametric permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova statistical test this test compared bulk beta diversity to scour beta diversity of all collected samples and demonstrated that the communities are significantly different p 0 001 this means that the community composition of viable planktonic cells presents different microbial properties than the viable cell composition of the scoured sample however additional research using metagenomics or qpcr analysis to probe the content of each community is needed to understand the health and water quality impacts this difference might create the interpretation of microbial community changes due to disinfectant switching was assisted by pcoa beta diversity plots of the analyzed samples separation between datapoints was calculated using a bray curtis distance metric and can either indicate closely related community structures little to no separation between markers or different community structures larger separation between markers a change from data markers being close to increased separation represent a shift or change in measured phenotypic communities in fig 6 the pcoa beta diversity plot includes all the bulk and scour samples collected starting with the second week of the study together both axis explain 72 1 of the data variability using the standard quandrant numbering system we can look at the data as it falls in each quandrant with quadrant i in the top right of the graph moving counter clockwise the fclp community fingerprints are widely spread in quadrant i even though a large number of fclp community fingerprints are also clustered near centerplot the more spreadout distribution represents more differences in the phenotypic community than when the data is closer together a tight cluster is plotted in the second and third quadrant with a higher density of chloramination associated microbial phenotypic communities located in quadrant iii the plotted fingerprints had high statistical correlation with nine measured water quality parameters represented in the overlain biplot the pcoa fingerprints from the fclp are positively correlated with orp as the first quandrant of the graph contains most of the fclp community results as well as the orp vector presenting a convenient check on the analysis as this is an expected relationship similarly communities present during the fclp are negatively correlated with ammonia and the percent viable counts of cells confirming expected outcomes total chlorine tcl2 while significant p 0001 is not correlated with the microbial communities associated with a specific secondary disinfection feed as the vector is located in the fourth quandrant directly opposing the nitrate live cell count and iron vectors nitrite live cells and iron are more strongly associated with chloramine microbial communities than communities analyzed under fclp conditions logically the negative relationship of nitrite levels to fclp microbial communities is what we expect since nitrite levels were below detection limits during the fclp pairwise permanova indicated a significantly different relationship between the phenotypic fingerprints from the chloramine and the fclp feeds f 41 2 p 0 001 suggesting different community structures are present during the different secondary disinfection periods this result requires quantitative assessment using genetic evaluations of the communities similarly lined and unlined hydrants presented significantly different community relationships f 4 44 p 0 001 even though no statistical significance was determined for nitrite concentrations by pipe lining materials for entire dataset wilcoxon p 0 78 this indicates that the communities may vary but may not correlate to the presence of nitrifiers permanova also revealed significantly different relationships between age groups h 1 and h 2 p 0 0015 and age groups h 1 and h 3 p 0 0015 but no significant difference between age groups h 2 and h 3 p 0 407 suggesting that similar community groups are present once water exceeds a certain residence time within the distribution system sorting the files and re running the bray curtis analysis for only bulk and scour samples collected during chloramination and again for those collected during the fclp alters the bray curtis distance matrix slightly comparing permanova p values confirmed that there is more significant difference between the bulk and scour samples during the fclp p 0 001 than during chloramination p 0 05 however it is important to note that permanova comparison of bulk beta diversity to scour beta diversity for all collected samples demonstrated that the communities are significantly different p 0 001 this means that the community composition of viable planktonic cells presents different microbial properties than the viable cell composition of the scoured sample however additional research using metagenomics or qpcr analysis to probe the content of each community is needed to understand the health and water quality impacts this difference might create the increased dissimilarity between the bulk and scour samples during the fclp indicates a shift in the microbial seeding release of the biofilms during free chlorine disinfection and that planktonic communities sampled in bulk water samples might not represent established pipe biofilm communities subsetting and re analyzing the data using only scour samples permanova analysis suggests that the scour samples collected during fclp are different than those during chloramination supporting the interpretation that easily scoured biofilm community composition changes during fclp disinfection while the analysis of all scour samples collected throughout the 3h study area demonstrates a statistically significant difference in microbial communities during the two disinfection periods biofilm penetration and community alteration expected during the fclp might not be occurring on a distribution system level further investigation of quantified microbial community member changes as a result of disinfection switching are required the results from this study are useful in presenting a method of sampling near hydrant biofilms given the statistical differences in phenotypic community groupings of the scour samples to further investigate the microbial behavior over time a subset of four case study hydrants across the three water age categories h1 4 h2 4 h3 1 and h3 5 and two reference hydrants h1 2 and h2 2 were selected based on the bulk water characteristics see figure s9 and s10 in the supplemental materials for the bulk water characteristics of selected reference and case study hydrants respectively the case study hydrants all had periods of low chlorine that correspond to increases in cells counts as well as peaks in nitrite within weeks of the fclp ending whereas the reference hydrants sustained high disinfectant residual throughout and did not result in nitrification or elevated cell counts permanova revealed the microbial fingerprints between the reference and case study hydrants were statistically different padj 0 001 using shading to highlight the spread of community data points by disinfectant and sample type fig 7 presents a clear difference in reference hydrants and case study hydrants the microbial communities of the reference hydrants experience a distinct shift between chloramine disinfection and fclp depicted as a clear separation of microbial fingerprints furthermore the planktonic communities analyzed from the bulk samples change more than the scour communities potentially suggesting that the fclp is not drastically changing the microbial dynamics of established pipe biofilms in the case study hydrants those that experienced decreases in total chlorine there is no apparent difference in microbial communities regardless of sample type or disinfection period hydrant h3 5 received the highest average free chlorine concentrations of the case study hydrants 1 92 mg l tcl2 yet still experienced no distinct shifts in contrast the two reference hydrants h1 2 and h2 2 received 3 2 and 2 9 mg l tcl2 respectively on average during the fclp and similar average concentrations over the entire study 3 2 and 2 1 mg l tcl2 respectively this suggests that the disinfectant concentrations during the free chlorine conversion are critical to changing microbial community dynamics a free chlorine conversion is not expected to deactivate all microorganisms within the distribution system but a significant shift in communities is expected as microorganisms are disinfected by the excess free chlorine residual krishna et al 2014 lee et al 2018 wang et al 2009 previous studies have demonstrated that nitrifiers quickly recover post fclp conversion often within a short time frame wang et al 2014 the similarities between the scour microbial fingerprints collected during the two disinfection periods suggests that the fclp might effectively change the planktonic community and release different microorganisms from attached biofilms into the bulk water stream but biofilm composition itself is not as drastically changed as bulk water composition during the fclp conversion previous research by lee et al 2018 demonstrated that free chlorine led to more biofilm sloughing than chloramines which is one reason why bulk microbial communities in the reference hydrants changed more drastically if sufficient disinfectant residuals are not sustained even planktonic microbiological communities will remain similar throughout the year regardless of the presence of a free chlorine period more research is needed regarding the link between free chlorine residuals during the fclp and the changing microbial communities in attached pipe biofilms 4 0 conclusions sampling a distinct set of hydrants frequently for over one year allowed for more in depth analysis regarding the effectiveness of using a periodic free chlorine conversion for utilities practicing secondary disinfection chloramination than previous studies several key relationships regarding nitrification emerged from this study first when looking at the full dataset the direct relationship between water temperature and nitrite increases suggests that a systematic study of the timing of the free chlorine disinfectant switch to essentially delay the onset of nitrification and potentially reduce the maximum nitrite production within the system is required the results from this study demonstrated that nitrification post fclp conversion occurred almost two months sooner than the previous studies however it is important to note that this may be due to the timing of the conversion the fclp conversion occurred during a period set far in advance initiated when water temperatures are far below those conducive to nitrification and not planned in response to changing water quality conditions the fclp ends when water temperatures are beginning to exceed 20 c the impact of the timing and the water temperature changes was captured in the regression analysis holding more statistical significance than the time lag post fclp as the microbial analysis demonstrated that at many hydrants the microbial communities did not significantly change the timing of the fclp conversion may be the key factor ensuring success in mitigating nitrification this is further supported by the regression analysis results where temperature and total chlorine residual concentrations were both highly significant determinants for nitrification the regression analysis also highlighted the correlation with poe ammonia concentrations future studies analyzing pipe biofilm changes along a continuous section of pipe will help highlight the ecology of the distribution changes from the poe to various sections of the distribution system finally this research demonstrated the effectiveness of using different sampling strategies a low flow bulk sample and a high velocity scour sample to help probe near hydrant pipe biofilms using beta diversity plots the changes to phenotypic microbial community dynamics demonstrated a greater change in community composition during the fclp more research investigating other low impact methods of pipe biofilm sampling are needed as physically scraping biofilms from pipe sections within a distribution system is not a practical proposition for most utilities the use of the scour sample paired with flow cytometry beta diversity plots by this study will act as a tool in future research to track changing community dynamics and determine meaningful samples to further analyze using genetic sequencing techniques more research

17027,to control microbial proliferation and nitrification within distribution systems utilities practicing secondary disinfection chloramination often discontinue their ammonia feed and provide a short free chlorine disinfection period fclp commonly referred to as a chlorine burn however the success and practicality of this approach is often criticized because of the return to nitrification yet previous studies conducted in full scale distribution systems do not contain the sampling frequency to determine how quickly nitrification can return in this research a total of 15 hydrants distributed across hydraulically modeled water ages were sampled for 21 sampling events over a period spanning two annual fclps 2018 and 2019 to investigate the water quality planktonic community and using a new sampling technique established biofilm community impacts within a single distribution system pressure zone hydrants measured elevated nitrite only 10 weeks after the end of the fclp and live cell counts in the bulk and scour samples statistically significantly increased within two weeks after the fclp ended and chloramine disinfection resumed indicating limited impacts from a fclp furthermore the fclp significantly increased iron concentrations during the period of free chlorine disinfection creating a consumer water quality concern microbial fingerprint analysis using flow cytometry revealed that beta diversity did not significantly change for sampling locations that experienced even periodic low total chlorine concentrations only locations that maintained high chlorine residuals throughout both chloramine and free chlorine disinfection periods demonstrated significant changes in bulk water microbial community even for these locations microbial communities of the scoured biofilms remained similar over the course of the study graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine burn microbial community nitrification distribution system drinking water 1 0 introduction the utility use of chloramines as a disinfectant has increased over the last 20 years the awwa disinfectant survey noted approximately a 20 increase in utilities using chloramine disinfectants in the u s between 1998 and 2007 awwa disinfection systems committee 2018a 2018b many switching in response to the stage 1 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproducts rule d dbpr most of the utilities currently applying chloramines are surface water systems concerned with minimizing disinfection by products dbps and distribution system maintenance seidel et al 2005a the use of chloramines however introduces ammonia into the distribution system through residual ammonia at the point of entry and by chloramine decomposition within the distribution system which can lead to areas of nitrification within a distribution system the excess ammonia in the distribution system can promote the growth of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms aom leading to nitrification occurrences within the distribution system as ammonia is oxidized to nitrite and nitrite is further oxidized to nitrate nitrification is typically marked by decreases in chloramine residuals and increased microbial activity odell et al 1996 skadsen 1993 wilczak et al 1996 and can lead to increased corrosion zhang et al 2009 even though the maximum contaminant concentrations mcls for both nitrite and nitrate are regulated at the point of entry into the distribution system and not at the tap nitrification within a distribution can increase the potential consumption of both contaminants creating a public health concern the link between nitrate consumption and an increased risk to certain cancers is not confirmed but a great public health concern is the reduction in chloramine disinfectant within the distribution system national research council 2006 nitrification is not specifically defined by regulations and the onset is not consistently evaluated ranging from threshold concentrations of nitrite greater than 0 025 mg l n fleming et al 2008 to some considering changes in nitrite and nitrate between 0 05 0 5 mg l n wilczak et al 1996 a common strategy to diminish nitrification within chloraminated systems is a temporary annual conversion to free chlorine seidel et al 2005a skadsen 1993 this periodic conversion is often referred to as breakpoint chlorination or as a chlorine burn but will subsequently be referred to as the free chlorine period fclp the goals of a fclp are to oxidize free ammonia in the distribution system temporarily removing it as an electron donor to deactivate nitrifiers within the distribution system and to oxidize nitrite to reduce chloramine degradation american water works association 2013 according to a study which included 106 utilities currently using chloramines as a secondary disinfectant in 2005 23 of these utilities used a periodic conversion to free chlorine as one method to control nitrification within the distribution system seidel et al 2005a the survey results reported by seidel et al 2005 also note the most popular months to switch disinfectants are september march and august typically it is the areas with low to no total chlorine residual that experience nitrification however in an analysis of nitrification potential within several distribution systems fleming et al 2008 suggest that controlling free ammonia concentrations may control nitrification in areas that nitrify despite maintaining total chlorine residuals around 2 mg l cl2 the success and practicality of this approach is often criticized due to ineffectiveness in disrupting biofilms and cell concentrations rosenfeldt et al 2009 vikesland et al 2006 rapid return to nitrification after the conversion carrico et al 2008 rosenfeldt et al 2009 wang et al 2014 and increased dbp concentrations carrico et al 2008 in addition to water quality issues the public s ability to discern taste and odor changes in their water as a result of changing disinfectants are challenging to overcome mackey et al 2001 numerous bench scale and pilot studies have investigated disinfection switching and nitrification control such as fleming et al 2005 lee et al 2011 pressman et al 2012 schrantz et al 2013 srinivasan et al 2008 allowing in particular for in depth analyses of biofilm reactions to disinfectant applications however distribution system characteristics can greatly influence nitrification system design sizes pressure zones water age and hydraulic residence times pipe materials and routine distribution system operation and maintenance are difficult to replicate in a laboratory increasing the importance of large scale distribution system investigations of nitrification several previous distribution system based studies have investigated the impacts of a temporary fclp on a distribution system carrico et al 2008 rosenfeldt et al 2009 wang et al 2014 however sampling frequency sampling source consistency and lack of distribution system water age knowledge were all barriers to creating a comprehensive understanding of the impacts given the limited literature in full scale systems dedicated to understanding the impacts of disinfectant switching and recognizing the complexities within a large distribution system this research investigates the water quality planktonic community and established biofilm community impacts related to switching from chloramine disinfection to a temporary six week fclp by 1 restricting the study to a single pressure zone within one distribution system 2 using hydraulically modeled water age to aid in hydrant selection 3 sampling at a higher frequency for over a year and 4 keeping all sampling points consistent all are hydrants this research uses flow cytometry to classify microbial communities based on the individual phenotypic fingerprint of the community and relate changes in these classifications to water quality parameters to understand the risk posed and the operational conditions of community changes cell count proliferation and biological management the study also pilots a novel technique of using both low velocity and high velocity sampling methods to probe both planktonic and established biofilm communities the overall goal of this research is to assess the fclp effects on a large distribution system by analyzing both bulk water quality and established biofilms to 1 determine differences in cell count concentrations and microbial community shifts and correlations with nitrification parameters 2 determine whether the impact of the chlorine burn on the nitrification is sustained once normal operations resume and 3 investigate geographical distribution and temporal effects of overall water quality within the distribution system 2 0 methodology 2 1 site selection the washington aqueduct wad practices a temporary conversion from chloramines to free chlorine disinfection for six weeks the fclps included in the study were the march 26 may 06 2018 and the march 25 may05 2019 periods sampling occurred at hydrants spaced throughout the third high 3h pressure and distribution zone within the dc water system this area contains numerous unlined cast iron mains and areas with high water age using the hydraulic model of the system a water age category of 1 24 hours 2 24 48 hours or 3 48 hours was assigned to all the 1606 hydrants within the 3rd high pressure zone hydrants were selected based on water age category distribution water main characteristics unlined or lined cast iron and spatial distribution within the pressure zone a total of 15 hydrants were selected and monitored fig 1 and see supplemental materials table s1 for details regarding each hydrant unlined cast iron is the prevalent pipe type within the dc water distribution system therefore most hydrants included in the study are associated with this pipe classification in addition to the 15 hydrants grab samples from the point of entry for the two treatment plants were collected and analyzed each sampling event occurred over four consecutive days with the first day focused on the poe and then the hydrants sampled per age distribution 2 2 sample collection the study began two weeks prior to the fclp and performed flushing and sampling collection weekly for11 weeks the first week of sampling was removed from all analysis due to large iron spikes occurring when a hydrant has not been routinely flushed one extended flushing event during the first week for all hydrants was monitored for stabilization of water quality due to the removal of accumulated debris and resulted in more consistent water quality data during the study the study still measures this as week 1 of sampling since it marks the start of the study the sampling interval increased to every 2 weeks for june after which it occurred monthly until the 2019 fclp in april 2019 a total of 21 sampling events were included in this study a table of sample event weeks and corresponding dates is located in supplemental materials table s2 at each hydrant two types of samples were collected the first sample is what we refer to as the bulk water sample for this sample the hydrant was fully opened but flow was restricted to a low flow condition at approximately 0 28 0 45 l s using a hydrant tap and the hydrant was flushed for 8 min before collecting a microbial sample in a sterilized 250 ml container with sodium thiosulphate for microbiological analyses of planktonic microbial communities as well as 500 ml for water quality parameter analyses after the bulk samples were collected the hydrant was shut and a hydrant diffuser was attached to allow for maximum velocity flow after attaching the diffuser the hydrant was opened completely to scour the attached biofilms through high velocity forces on the pipes both microbial samples in sterilized 250 ml containers with sodium thiosulphate as well as 500 ml samples for water quality parameter analyses were collected after approximately 30 seconds of high velocity flow once the hydrant was fully open following standard operating procedures the duration of the flush was based off of previous flushing studies conducted by the water quality division where samples collected between 30 sec and 1 min of flushing contained higher concentration of cells than those of longer durations less than 30 seconds results in more debris and not higher cell counts both bulk and scoured samples were measured for physio chemical parameters to ensure the consistency between both sample types if inconsistencies were present it could be concluded that different water packets were being delivered to the hydrant thus influencing the results bulk and scoured water samples were analyzed for nitrite free chlorine total chlorine free ammonia and monochloramine using the hach sl1000 as well as temperature ph and orp using specific probes attached to the unit iron and nitrate were determined using the hach dr900 all samples with iron concentrations exceeding 1 mg l underwent filtration through a 0 45 µm membrane filter prior to water quality analysis of dissolved concentrations for the other parameters to eliminate interference microbial samples were analyzed by flow cytometry bd accuri c6 becton dickinson franklin lakes usa for total and live cell counts as well as phenotypic fingerprinting information associated with the microbial community of the sample based on the cell morphology box plots of the entire dataset for total chlorine temperature and orp were analyzed comparing bulk to scour samples only iron total cells and live cells presented a statistically significant difference between sampling strategies increasing confidence in the method fig 2 it is therefore assumed that the scour samples represent material buildup on the pipe walls near the hydrant the scour sampling technique needs further exploration but can prove a useful tool to sample inside the distribution system without needing to install coupons or remove sections of pipe more research is needed to understand the differences between these near hydrant communities and biofilm communities in main distribution lines throughout the distribution system 2 3 flow cytometric analysis from each 110 ml hydrant sample 198 µl were pipetted into sterile 96 well plates to differentiate between damaged and intact bacterial cells samples were stained with 2 µl working solution containing 98 0 22 m filtered dimethyl sulfoxide and 1 of each stock solution of nucleic acid binding stains sybr green i 10 000 x concentrate in dimethyl sulfoxide and propidium iodide 40 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide the stained samples were incubated in the dark for 13 min at 35 c flow cytometric analysis was performed using a c6 accuri flow cytometer bd biosciences equipped with a 20 mw 488 nm laser four florescence detectors fl1 530 30 nm fl2 585 40 nm fl3 670 nm and fl4 675 25 nm and two scatter detectors forward scatter fsc and side scatter ssc bd csampler plus software was used to process the data and standardize the measurements for each sample the software also allowed for a quality control check of the instrument using bd cs t ruo beads to ensure performance the analysis software was set to measure all particles within 100 µl of the 200 µl sample at a fast fluidics rate of 66 µl min a precalibrated polygon gate was applied on a density plot of the green fluorescence fl1 530 30 nm vs red fluorescence fl3 670 nm detectors for each sample to distinguish the threshold between instrument noise or water sample background and bacterial signals with the gate applied the flow cytometer software was able to quantify bacterial cell concentrations for each sample all samples were collected prepared and analyzed within 8 h 2 4 phenotypic fingerprints of bacterial communities to translate flow cytometric data into phenotypic fingerprints of bacterial communities we followed the methodology described in props monsieurs mysara clement boon 2016 this method allows the user to distinguish communities based on phenotypic characteristics such as morphology and nucleic acid content by measuring florescent and scatter detector signal heights when flow cytometric analysis is performed six bivariate density plots are produced fl1 vs fl3 fl1 vs ssc fl1 vs fsc fl3 vs ssc fl3 vs fsc and ssc vs fsc phenotypic fingerprinting discretizes the microbial communities in equal size bins and assigns each bin a density associated with the probability of one cell having the specific phenotypic characteristics in the defined space props et al 2016 similar to sequencing data phenotypic fingerprint data contains the relative abundances of all species making it suitable for alpha and beta diversity metrics and calculations phenotypic fingerprints represent the inter cell variability of cell properties that occur at the community level data were processed under flow cytometry standard format and imported into r version 3 4 4 r development core team using the phenoflow package props et al 2016 to isolate bacterial cell signals an electronic polygon gate was overlain on each of the six flow cytometric bivariate density plots to remove background noise and keep signals produced by bacteria all data bulk and scour were processed together the height values of each bivariate density plot were logarithmically transformed and normalized to the 0 1 interval a 128 128 binning grid was superimposed over each of the six flow cytometric bivariate density plots from which signal height values were calculated for each bin the bin signal heights were extracted from these six datasets and were concatenated to create a multivariate dataset 2 5 statistical analysis all analyses were performed using r version 3 4 4 r development core team the multivariate dispersion of hydrant phenotypic fingerprints was examined via principle coordinate analysis pcoa using a bray curtis dissimilarity index which was calculated using the vegan package oksanen et al 2019 to explore relationships between the ordination scores and in situ water quality parameters correlations were calculated and biplots were overlain on the pcoa using the envfit and vectorfit functions in the vegan package the vectorfit function calculates the direction within the ordination space for which each water quality parameter changes most rapidly and has the maximal correlation with the ordination using a canonical correspondence analysis this is a common method of presenting environmental variables in ordination space using linear constraints paliy and shankar 2016 wang et al 2012 only those parameters with the strongest correlations r 0 25 and p 0 001 using this method were plotted on the biplot with a scaled representation so the strongest predictors are drawn longer in the pcoa biplot than the weakest statistical differences between multivariate positions between disinfectant feed bulk and scour samples and hydrants were tested using permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova using the adonis function in the vegan package using a bray curtis dissimilarity index pairwise permanova was performed using the pairwiseadonis package martinez arbizu 2019 to reduce the chances of obtaining false positive results p values for pairwise comparisons were adjusted using a false discovery rate fdr correction graphics were prepared using the ggplot2 package wickham 2016 3 0 results and discussion 3 1 point of entry water quality the two water treatment plants varied little in terms of disinfectant concentrations nitrite and intact cells entering the distribution system full set of water quality data for poes presented in the supplemental materials figures s2 s3 disinfectant levels at the points of entry poe for both water treatment plants wtp remained above 3 mg l total cl2 for the duration of the study period and intact cells and nitrite remained near zero for the entirety of the study only free ammonia and nitrate contained notable concentration variations free ammonia fluctuated between 0 and 0 4 mg l with mean concentrations during chloramine disinfection of 0 14 and 0 10 mg l n for poe1 and poe2 respectively poe1 mean 0 12 median 0 10 max 0 34 mg l n poe2 mean 0 08 median 0 10 max 0 23 mg l n previous research have suggested minimizing ammonia nitrogen to 0 15 mg l implying that the periods of higher free ammonia could be problematic skadsen 1993 the free ammonia concentrations typically peaked in the weeks post fclp in week 8 at poe2 and in week 13 for poe1 when the ammonia feed was restarted at the treatment plants this increase is important when interpreting the nitrite concentration data within the distribution system nitrate concentrations naturally varied over time and between wtps due to fluctuations in the source water however despite this variation the two wtps supplied similar nitrate concentrations at the poe of 2 7 mg l n on average 3 2 bulk water quality this study tracked the water quality at 15 hydrants over a 58 week period therefore it is useful to first determine if there are system wide trends that appear at all hydrants to facilitate this analysis we compiled all hydrant data and analyzed by disinfectant type the first week of sampling was removed from the entire dataset due to water quality anomalies that can occur when opening a hydrant that has not received frequent flushing removing transition weeks from the analysis nitrite total cell counts and live intact cell counts are statistically significantly higher during chloramine disinfection fig 3 with only iron greater during the fclp an increase in iron concentrations is expected during the fclp given the prevalence of older cast iron pipes in the distribution system and the increase in oxidation reduction potential orp when switching from chloramines to free chlorine when individual hydrants are compared those with high average iron concentrations during the chloramine disinfection period are the same ones that experience large increases during the free chlorine period signifying that both chloramine and free chlorine are involved in corrosion at the pipe surface for example hydrant h1 4 a hydrant in the lowest age category of the study had average iron concentrations of 2 8 mg l during the chloraminated period and 4 6 mg l during the free chlorine period see figures s4 s8 in the supplemental materials document for plots of all bulk water quality for all the hydrants included in the study this same hydrant had among the highest average counts of live cells during both secondary disinfectant periods free chlorine period 10938 average counts μl chloraminated period 13738 average counts μl these increased cell counts are not related to total chlorine concentrations alone as this hydrant while receiving fluctuating concentrations maintained an average residual of 1 4 mg l total chlorine during chloramination when implemented during this time of year the effectiveness of the fclp to reduce nitrification within the distribution system must look at the lag time for cell counts to rebound and nitrite production to begin post conversion from fclp back to chloramine nitrification onset is defined here when concentrations exceed 0 025 mg l n within the study area the same threshold used by fleming et al 2008 looking at the data on a weekly basis fig 4 the lag between the free chlorine period ending after week 8 and the onset of nitrification in week 18 is 10 weeks using a sampling method that removed collection inconsistencies due to various sampling locations within the distribution system as observed in carrico et al 2008 sampling location variations present in rosenfeldt et al 2009 and the sampling infrequency associated with most previous studies carrico et al 2008 rosenfeldt et al 2009 wang et al 2014 this study demonstrates that the speed to nitrification onset post fclp is much quicker than previously observed also noticeable is the clear increasing trend in iron during the free chlorine period previous research has suggested that iron pipes may contribute to the chlorine demand of the system facilitating nitrification by reducing chlorine residuals odell et al 1996 however we are observing iron release during the free chlorine period and not in tandem with chloramine decay and ammonia release it is conceivable that locations that practice shorter fclp might avoid negative impacts of increased iron aside from aesthetic concerns iron corrosion has shown to promote microbial growth providing nutrients in an otherwise limiting environment morton et al 2005 increases in iron could expedite nitrifier activity after returning to chloramine disinfection since the elevated concentrations are sustained for two weeks after the ammonia feed is restarted at the wtps during week 9 demonstrated increases in total cells and nitrite do not occur until several weeks later week 18 and correlate more directly with decreasing free ammonia than sustained iron concentrations once the ammonia feed was restarted at the wtp increased free ammonia concentrations are measured and remain elevated above 0 2 mg l until after week 18 when nitrite increases this sustained increase in free ammonia could assist in initiating nitrification activity due to the availability of the ammonia as presented by yang et al 2007 and observed during this research it is important to note that the free chlorine period began in late march when distributed water temperature was still near 10 c close to the minimum temperature experienced throughout the year and finished with temperatures hovering around 20 c distribution water temperatures peaked to a high of near 30 c in august 2018 temperature fluctuations can impact the kinetic parameters of nitrification according to the arrhenius equation significantly lowering nitrifier growth at 20 c than 30 c zhang et al 2009 reduced nitrification activity is observed in this study around the same time as water temperatures decrease nitrification within the system ends by the 38th week of sampling 26 30 november and is most closely associated to the decreasing temperatures as the distribution system water temperatures fall below 20 c analyzing the data by hydrant over time there are several important occurrences with regards to chlorine residual concentrations and nitrite concentrations see supplemental materials figure s4 8 for full set of data comparing fluctuations in residual chlorine and nitrite concentrations those hydrants across the pressure zone regardless of modeled water age that experience decreases in chlorine residual demonstrate corresponding increases in nitrite the weeks immediately after the fclp were the most susceptible to decreased total chlorine concentrations corresponding with the the highest water temperatures and highest free ammonia concentrations within the system subsetting the data to look only at the months of june july and august when nitrite is greatest in the system average nitrite concentrations are statistically significantly higher p 0 001 in the oldest water age group 50 hours than the lower two classifications all three age groups contain hydrants that record maximum concentrations exceeding 0 4 mg l n nitrite during this time water quality information for hydrant h2 3 is presented in fig 5 as an interesting example since after sustaining a period of increased free ammonia small decreases in total chlorine corresponded with increases in nitrite in this case the total chlorine decreased from approximately 3 mg l to 2 mg l a concentration considered acceptable by most utility standards american water works association 2013 the usepa surface water treatment rule requires that utilities maintain a disinfectant residual of at least 0 2 mg l and detectable levels in 95 of the distribution system samples monitored monthly swtr 40 cfr 141 74 a more recent standard by a consortium of states recommends a residual of 1 0 mg l at distant points of the distribution system during chloramination glumrb 2012 this increase of nitrite to 0 15 mg l n for h2 3 exceeds the fleming et al 2008 0 025 mg l n definition of nitrification onset a noticeable response in nitrite concentrations when total chlorine concentrations remain above at 2 0 mg l water main pipe type varied throughout the distribution system and is reflected in the mains feeding the hydrants included in our study using the same subset of data for june july and august no significant difference in nitrite concentrations wilcoxon p 0 8 or free ammonia wilcoxon p 0 5 by pipe lining are present as this study was conducted in an operational distribution system many factors could not be controlled for example while pressure zone 3h primarily receives water from poe1 often poe2 also provides water to the area the hydraulic model from which the approximate water ages for the hydrants were based assumes zero flow from poe2 however after august 2018 sporadic pumping from poe2 to the area began and continued throughout the remainder of the study this could reduce the theoretical water age of several hydrants closest to poe2 thereby decreasing the chances of chloramine decay and nitrification additionally the hydrants sampled in this work have characteristics that do not change over time such as location within the distribution system age of associated main characteristic water use of the neighborhood however these characteristics can play a role as explanatory variables after statistical testing a linear regression focused on the post fclp was determined most appropriate for the dataset regression results are contained in table 1 the individual parameter coefficient magnitudes and directions can help illustrate a complete picture of influences on nitrification within a complicated water matrix and distribution system individual hydrant effects were controlled for in the model reducing the influence of one hydrant on the outcomes while linear regression is a useful tool regression using water quality parameters are difficult to interpret since statistical significance can indicate onset of nitrification or occur as a result of ongoing nitrification for example ph is negatively correlated to increasing nitrite however while highly statistically significant this correlation is also directly related to occurrences of nitrification the decreasing chlorine concentrations are more likely creating an environment for nitrification thus decreasing the ph as a result and potentially amplifying the relationship the coefficient for total chlorine suggests that for every 1 mg l decrease in chlorine concentrations nitrite could increase by 0 056 exceeding the threshold of nitrification while this will depend on other water quality variables the high statistical significance of the relationship does suggest that even at higher chlorine residuals like those presented in fig 5 for h2 3 decreases in residual chloramine concentrations can cause significant increases in nitrite if other conditions are favorable parameters with statistically significant positive relationships include water temperature nitrate and ammonia while increasing nitrate which varied at the poe over time can occur as a direct result of nitrification and not be attributable to the cause of nitrification ammonia and water temperature are more directly related to conditions preceding the onset of nitrification water temperature is likely to have a direct effect on nitrification and was also highly significant 0 006 p 0 000 and matches expected concentrations when one estimates nitrite concentrations in relation to 10 c increases in temperature the regression analysis results for free ammonia at the poe indicate that a 1 mg l increase in ammonia correlates to a 0 111 mg l increase in nitrite large magnitudes of free ammonia are not expected in the distribution system but even 0 3 mg l n increases in free ammonia are correlated to nitrite increases of 0 03 mg l n this signals that controlling free ammonia at the treatment plant is extremely important supporting the conclusions of fleming et al 2008 two variables that were included and surprisingly did not have a significant effect on nitrification were the time since the end of the fclp and the percent of the daily flow from poe1 on the day of sampling it was hypothesized that when the percent of flow to 3h pressure zone from poe1 changed it would significantly impact actual water age within the zone however this contribution rarely decreases below 80 percent and was not statistically significant as it relates to nitrite concentrations it was also hypothesized that the lag time weeks from when the fclp ended would have a significant correlation with nitrification but was not statistically significant and therefore was less important than other parameters like temperature the impact of temperature and the timing of fclps requires more investigation september august and march are the most common months for fclp conversions seidel et al 2005b yet depending on geographical location of the utility the impacts of conducting a fclp conversion in march could have drastically different impacts on nitrification trends within the distribution system the results of the linear regression confirm the bulk water quality trends discussed earlier in the manuscript 3 3 microbial analysis and discussion to understand the effectiveness of the scour sampling method from a microbial perspective beta diversity distance matrices computed from the flow cytometer phenotypic fingerprinting were compared using the non parametric permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova statistical test this test compared bulk beta diversity to scour beta diversity of all collected samples and demonstrated that the communities are significantly different p 0 001 this means that the community composition of viable planktonic cells presents different microbial properties than the viable cell composition of the scoured sample however additional research using metagenomics or qpcr analysis to probe the content of each community is needed to understand the health and water quality impacts this difference might create the interpretation of microbial community changes due to disinfectant switching was assisted by pcoa beta diversity plots of the analyzed samples separation between datapoints was calculated using a bray curtis distance metric and can either indicate closely related community structures little to no separation between markers or different community structures larger separation between markers a change from data markers being close to increased separation represent a shift or change in measured phenotypic communities in fig 6 the pcoa beta diversity plot includes all the bulk and scour samples collected starting with the second week of the study together both axis explain 72 1 of the data variability using the standard quandrant numbering system we can look at the data as it falls in each quandrant with quadrant i in the top right of the graph moving counter clockwise the fclp community fingerprints are widely spread in quadrant i even though a large number of fclp community fingerprints are also clustered near centerplot the more spreadout distribution represents more differences in the phenotypic community than when the data is closer together a tight cluster is plotted in the second and third quadrant with a higher density of chloramination associated microbial phenotypic communities located in quadrant iii the plotted fingerprints had high statistical correlation with nine measured water quality parameters represented in the overlain biplot the pcoa fingerprints from the fclp are positively correlated with orp as the first quandrant of the graph contains most of the fclp community results as well as the orp vector presenting a convenient check on the analysis as this is an expected relationship similarly communities present during the fclp are negatively correlated with ammonia and the percent viable counts of cells confirming expected outcomes total chlorine tcl2 while significant p 0001 is not correlated with the microbial communities associated with a specific secondary disinfection feed as the vector is located in the fourth quandrant directly opposing the nitrate live cell count and iron vectors nitrite live cells and iron are more strongly associated with chloramine microbial communities than communities analyzed under fclp conditions logically the negative relationship of nitrite levels to fclp microbial communities is what we expect since nitrite levels were below detection limits during the fclp pairwise permanova indicated a significantly different relationship between the phenotypic fingerprints from the chloramine and the fclp feeds f 41 2 p 0 001 suggesting different community structures are present during the different secondary disinfection periods this result requires quantitative assessment using genetic evaluations of the communities similarly lined and unlined hydrants presented significantly different community relationships f 4 44 p 0 001 even though no statistical significance was determined for nitrite concentrations by pipe lining materials for entire dataset wilcoxon p 0 78 this indicates that the communities may vary but may not correlate to the presence of nitrifiers permanova also revealed significantly different relationships between age groups h 1 and h 2 p 0 0015 and age groups h 1 and h 3 p 0 0015 but no significant difference between age groups h 2 and h 3 p 0 407 suggesting that similar community groups are present once water exceeds a certain residence time within the distribution system sorting the files and re running the bray curtis analysis for only bulk and scour samples collected during chloramination and again for those collected during the fclp alters the bray curtis distance matrix slightly comparing permanova p values confirmed that there is more significant difference between the bulk and scour samples during the fclp p 0 001 than during chloramination p 0 05 however it is important to note that permanova comparison of bulk beta diversity to scour beta diversity for all collected samples demonstrated that the communities are significantly different p 0 001 this means that the community composition of viable planktonic cells presents different microbial properties than the viable cell composition of the scoured sample however additional research using metagenomics or qpcr analysis to probe the content of each community is needed to understand the health and water quality impacts this difference might create the increased dissimilarity between the bulk and scour samples during the fclp indicates a shift in the microbial seeding release of the biofilms during free chlorine disinfection and that planktonic communities sampled in bulk water samples might not represent established pipe biofilm communities subsetting and re analyzing the data using only scour samples permanova analysis suggests that the scour samples collected during fclp are different than those during chloramination supporting the interpretation that easily scoured biofilm community composition changes during fclp disinfection while the analysis of all scour samples collected throughout the 3h study area demonstrates a statistically significant difference in microbial communities during the two disinfection periods biofilm penetration and community alteration expected during the fclp might not be occurring on a distribution system level further investigation of quantified microbial community member changes as a result of disinfection switching are required the results from this study are useful in presenting a method of sampling near hydrant biofilms given the statistical differences in phenotypic community groupings of the scour samples to further investigate the microbial behavior over time a subset of four case study hydrants across the three water age categories h1 4 h2 4 h3 1 and h3 5 and two reference hydrants h1 2 and h2 2 were selected based on the bulk water characteristics see figure s9 and s10 in the supplemental materials for the bulk water characteristics of selected reference and case study hydrants respectively the case study hydrants all had periods of low chlorine that correspond to increases in cells counts as well as peaks in nitrite within weeks of the fclp ending whereas the reference hydrants sustained high disinfectant residual throughout and did not result in nitrification or elevated cell counts permanova revealed the microbial fingerprints between the reference and case study hydrants were statistically different padj 0 001 using shading to highlight the spread of community data points by disinfectant and sample type fig 7 presents a clear difference in reference hydrants and case study hydrants the microbial communities of the reference hydrants experience a distinct shift between chloramine disinfection and fclp depicted as a clear separation of microbial fingerprints furthermore the planktonic communities analyzed from the bulk samples change more than the scour communities potentially suggesting that the fclp is not drastically changing the microbial dynamics of established pipe biofilms in the case study hydrants those that experienced decreases in total chlorine there is no apparent difference in microbial communities regardless of sample type or disinfection period hydrant h3 5 received the highest average free chlorine concentrations of the case study hydrants 1 92 mg l tcl2 yet still experienced no distinct shifts in contrast the two reference hydrants h1 2 and h2 2 received 3 2 and 2 9 mg l tcl2 respectively on average during the fclp and similar average concentrations over the entire study 3 2 and 2 1 mg l tcl2 respectively this suggests that the disinfectant concentrations during the free chlorine conversion are critical to changing microbial community dynamics a free chlorine conversion is not expected to deactivate all microorganisms within the distribution system but a significant shift in communities is expected as microorganisms are disinfected by the excess free chlorine residual krishna et al 2014 lee et al 2018 wang et al 2009 previous studies have demonstrated that nitrifiers quickly recover post fclp conversion often within a short time frame wang et al 2014 the similarities between the scour microbial fingerprints collected during the two disinfection periods suggests that the fclp might effectively change the planktonic community and release different microorganisms from attached biofilms into the bulk water stream but biofilm composition itself is not as drastically changed as bulk water composition during the fclp conversion previous research by lee et al 2018 demonstrated that free chlorine led to more biofilm sloughing than chloramines which is one reason why bulk microbial communities in the reference hydrants changed more drastically if sufficient disinfectant residuals are not sustained even planktonic microbiological communities will remain similar throughout the year regardless of the presence of a free chlorine period more research is needed regarding the link between free chlorine residuals during the fclp and the changing microbial communities in attached pipe biofilms 4 0 conclusions sampling a distinct set of hydrants frequently for over one year allowed for more in depth analysis regarding the effectiveness of using a periodic free chlorine conversion for utilities practicing secondary disinfection chloramination than previous studies several key relationships regarding nitrification emerged from this study first when looking at the full dataset the direct relationship between water temperature and nitrite increases suggests that a systematic study of the timing of the free chlorine disinfectant switch to essentially delay the onset of nitrification and potentially reduce the maximum nitrite production within the system is required the results from this study demonstrated that nitrification post fclp conversion occurred almost two months sooner than the previous studies however it is important to note that this may be due to the timing of the conversion the fclp conversion occurred during a period set far in advance initiated when water temperatures are far below those conducive to nitrification and not planned in response to changing water quality conditions the fclp ends when water temperatures are beginning to exceed 20 c the impact of the timing and the water temperature changes was captured in the regression analysis holding more statistical significance than the time lag post fclp as the microbial analysis demonstrated that at many hydrants the microbial communities did not significantly change the timing of the fclp conversion may be the key factor ensuring success in mitigating nitrification this is further supported by the regression analysis results where temperature and total chlorine residual concentrations were both highly significant determinants for nitrification the regression analysis also highlighted the correlation with poe ammonia concentrations future studies analyzing pipe biofilm changes along a continuous section of pipe will help highlight the ecology of the distribution changes from the poe to various sections of the distribution system finally this research demonstrated the effectiveness of using different sampling strategies a low flow bulk sample and a high velocity scour sample to help probe near hydrant pipe biofilms using beta diversity plots the changes to phenotypic microbial community dynamics demonstrated a greater change in community composition during the fclp more research investigating other low impact methods of pipe biofilm sampling are needed as physically scraping biofilms from pipe sections within a distribution system is not a practical proposition for most utilities the use of the scour sample paired with flow cytometry beta diversity plots by this study will act as a tool in future research to track changing community dynamics and determine meaningful samples to further analyze using genetic sequencing techniques more research

17028,although photo driven advanced oxidation processes aops have been developed to treat wastewater few studies have investigated the feasibility of aops to simultaneously remove antibiotic resistant bacteria arb antibiotic resistance genes args and micropollutants mps this study employed a modified photo fenton process using ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds to chelate iron iii thus maintaining the reaction ph in a neutral range simultaneous removal of arb and associated extracellular e args and intracellular args i args was assessed by bacterial cell culture qpcr and atomic force microscopy the removal of five mps was also evaluated by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry a low dose comprising 0 1 mm fe iii 0 2 mm edds and 0 3 mm hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was found to be effective for decreasing arb by 6 log within 30 min and e args by 6 log within 10 min no arb regrowth occurred after 48 h suggesting that the proposed process is an effective disinfectant against arb moreover five recalcitrant mps carbamazepine diclofenac sulfamethoxazole mecoprop and benzotriazole at an initial concentration of 10 μg l each were 99 removed after 30 min treatment in ultrapure water the modified photo fenton process was also validated using synthetic wastewater and real secondary wastewater effluent as matrices and results suggest the dosage should be

introduction the use of reclaimed wastewater is being considered as a strategic solution in many water scarce countries or regions however the presence of biological hazards e g pathogens and

ecological environmental applications in terms of biological risk antibiotic resistance is a severe global threat for public health causing around 700 000 deaths per year o neill et al 2014 antibiotic resistance can transfer and spread within the community in hospitals agricultural settings wastewater treatment plants wwtps and other associated environments such as soils guo et al 2020 there is evidence that antibiotic resistance can transfer to humans from arb and args present in contaminated water posing another challenge to mitigation of waterborne disease barancheshme and munir 2018 disinfection is an important step for inactivating and removing pathogens from the wastewater influent chlorination ultraviolet radiation uv and ozonation o3 have been widely used as disinfection processes in water and wastewater treatment plants nevertheless some waterborne bacteria are resistant to common disinfectants necessitating higher disinfectant doses potentially causing increased production of carcinogenic disinfection by products dbp le roux et al 2017 park et al 2016 previous studies also suggest that bacteria in disinfected water or wastewater can regrow in distribution pipes or storage tanks before reuse thus deteriorating water quality and posing potential microbial risks huang et al 2016 lee and deininger 2000 power et al 1997 zhang and digiano 2002 more importantly these disinfection processes may have resulted in inadequate elimination of pathogens arb and args from treated water or wastewater which may pose aquatic and community health risks chang et al 2015 sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 moreover these processes can help to discharge the plasmid or chromosomal dna which harbor args into the aquatic system allowing uptake by other bacteria through horizontal gene transfer wang et al 2019b studies also indicate that the bacterial transformation process frequently occurs in the presence of free dna suggesting that the dna in water could pose a threat to the aquatic environment and community moradigaravand and engelstädter 2014 woegerbauer et al 2020 in terms of chemical risk pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps are consumed on a large scale and are excreted to various environments as micropollutants walters et al 2010 due to persistent input and bioaccumulation through the food chain the potential threat of micropollutants to environmental and human health has raised significant concern although conventional wwtps effectively remove various organic compounds micropollutants include a diverse array of compounds with persistent properties and not all are biodegradable rogowska et al 2020 it is concerning that large amounts of micropollutants continue be discharged into aqueous environments thus posing a threat to ecology for example our recent studies lu et al 2018 wang et al 2019b wang et al 2019c have proven that several micropollutants e g triclosan and carbamazepine promote the spread of antibiotic resistance in water thus efficient treatment methods should be established to manage a broad spectrum of micropollutants importantly it would be more economically viable to develop a one stop solution i e a single unit rather than multiple units to simultaneously remove both biological and chemical hazards from contaminated water thus providing safe water for reuse or recycle the photo fenton process has proved an efficient advanced oxidation process aop for the treatment and purification of water and wastewater at acidic ph the conventional photo fenton process is very effective leading to high degradation rates giannakis et al 2016 however the removal efficiency is often limited at neutral ph due to the low solubility and poor stability of fe iii that affects the decomposition of h2o2 and slows down or blocks the generation rate of hydroxyl radical ho cuervo lumbaque et al 2019 huang et al 2012 an aminopolycarboxylic acid complex apca containing iron has been proposed to address this shortcoming enhancing the solubility of fe iii fe ii and establishing the photo fenton reaction at neutral ph dong et al 2019b in addition numerous complexing or chelating agents such as oxalic acid nogueira et al 2017 citric acid ruales lonfat et al 2016 villegas guzman et al 2017 ascorbic acid villegas guzman et al 2017 tartaric acid villegas guzman et al 2017 ethylenediamine n n

2017 as compared with other complexing or chelating agents edds is a highly biodegradable non hazardous and sustainable ecofriendly metal chelate cuervo lumbaque et al 2019 furthermore fe iii edds demonstrates higher efficiency as compared with other complexing agents like edta oxalate and citrate due to lower redox potentials of the fe iii fe ii complex half wave potential e1 2 of 0 069v nhe huang et al 2012 for example garcía fernández et al 2019 studied photo fenton inactivation of non resistant escherichia coli and e faecalis in which 6 log reduction was achieved with 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm of fe iii edds h2o2 with an energy requirement of 3 5 kj l and 11 9 kj l respectively in addition huang et al 2013 reported 99 bisphenol a degradation could be achieved using higher doses of 1 mm fe iii edds and 5 mm h2o2 during 6 h treatment although these previous studies have investigated bacterial inactivation or mp removal separately there is little research on using the photo fenton process for simultaneous removal of both biological and chemical hazards fiorentino et al 2019 thus in this study we employed a modified photo fenton technique for the removal of arb args and mps from various water matrices we used β lactam and tetracycline resistant e coli as a biological hazard model respectively harboring bla tem 1 and teta which are commonly detected args in various water systems shi et al 2013 culture based enumeration was used to detect regrowth of resistant bacterial strains in addition based on findings from the swiss federal office for the environment foen foen 2017 we selected five mps as indicators of chemical hazards comprising carbamazepine cbz diclofenac dcf sulfamethoxazole smx mecoprop mcp and benzotriazole bta as shown in table s1 supporting information si the removal efficiency of arb args and mps was systematically studied using fe iii edds and or h2o2 in the presence of solar simulated light in order to reveal underlying mechanisms chemical scavengers were used to confirm reactive species in the arb and mp experiments in addition the efficiency of this modified photo fenton process was investigated in various water matrices this study will contribute to the development and design of a one stop process for simultaneously removing both biological and chemical hazards 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and treatments in this study β lactam and tetracycline resistant e coli dh5α was used as an antibiotic resistant bacterium chang et al 2017 e coli dh5α was prepared according to the previous study ahmed et al 2020 with details in si text 1 all the solar fenton tests were carried out in 250 ml cell culture flasks the water matrices were spiked with 10 µg l of each micropollutant and or 106 cfu ml of bacterial cells the fe iii edds complex was freshly prepared by adding required volume of iron iii sulfate and edds solution into a 1 5 ml tube before switching on the simulated solar ss light both the arb and mps were homogenized in the flasks for 10 30 min in the dark with the required volume of fe iii edds after that h2o2 was added to 0 3 mm and the simulated solar light was turned on the photo fenton dose was 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm and the ratio of fe iii edds was 1 2 determined as optimal from previously reported data garcía fernández et al 2019 the simulated solar light used in this study was generated by a pls sxe300 system beijing perfectlight technology co ltd china using a 138 xenon lamp 200 800 nm 300w with an average light intensity of 130 mw cm2 during the photo driven experiments the lamp was fixed 12 cm above the water surface the ph remained neutral during the treatment period at various times during the treatment process 1 ml samples were collected for arb and mps analysis while 50 ml was collected for the extraction of intracellular dna after sampling 10 sodium thiosulphate was used to quench the reaction for arb enumeration 100 µl of diluted samples were plated onto selective lb agar the bacterial regrowth and recovery analyses were also conducted according to the procedure described in si text 2 the efficiency of this modified photo fenton process was validated in three aqueous matrices e g ultrapure water upw synthetic wastewater sww and real wastewater effluent rww the list of chemicals and the sww recipe are shown in si text 3 the rww was collected from a full scale wastewater treatment plant brisbane australia with detailed effluent characteristics in table s2 after collection the effluent was autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min then cooled and stored at 4 c before bacterial inactivation experiments 2 2 atomic force microscopy afm the surface topography and amplitude of the antibiotic resistant bacterial cells were characterized by afm the afm samples were prepared based on a previous study medeot et al 2020 briefly 10 μl aliquots of photo fenton treated untreated e coli suspension were dropped on the mica surface then 10 minutes vacuum drying was applied using a harrick pdc001 plasma drying unit after drying each sample was washed three times with upw and the vacuum dryer used for final drying all samples were imaged in ac mode in air using asylum research cypher afm oxford instruments ca silicon cantilevers were used to scan the cell with a resonance frequency of 75 khz and spring constant of 3 5 n m the afm images was scanned at moderate speed 0 5 to 1 hz with 256 pixels per line scan a topographical image represented by height and amplitude and a phase image were obtained simultaneously from each scan 2 3 quantification of args the bacterial cell suspension was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 c qiagen dneasy powerwater kit germany was used to extract dna from the cells to quantify i args the purity and concentration of dna were measured according to our previous study ahmed et al 2020 for the e arg experiment water matrices were spiked with plasmid dna 108 copies µl and samples were directly analysed by qpcr before and during treatment samples were collected and analysed by rt pcr without further processing the details of dna extraction and quantification are described in si text 4 and si text 5 respectively the standard curve of each of the studied genes is shown in fig s1 the length of each targeted primer is shown in table s3 si 2 4 analytical methods stock solutions containing 1 mg ml of smx cbz bta dcf and mcp were prepared and stored at 20 c prior to use working standards were prepared at 10 μg l for each micropollutant for lc ms analysis five standard concentrations of 0 625 1 25 2 5 5 and 10 µg l for each micropollutant were freshly prepared from the stock solution quality control was performed by analysis of a blank sample a calibration curve was generated by plotting the peak area of each micropollutant against the concentration peak area measurements were simultaneously determined by multiquant software the lc ms detection limit for each mp was 0 625 µg l the mp degradation performance of the modified photo fenton process in upw and sww was evaluated using a shimadzu liquid chromatography system connected to a mass spectrometer ab sciex tripletof 5600 via an electrospray ionization esi interface chromatographic separation was carried out using a phenomenex kinetex biphenyl 50 2 1 mm c18 analytical column the solvents used as the mobile phase were milliq water acidified with 0 1 formic acid mobile phase a and methanol meoh with 0 1 formic acid mobile phase b the elution gradient progressed from 30 b 0 3 min to 100 b 2 min and was maintained at 100 for 5 7 min before returning to 30 b the total run time was 8 min for each ionization mode the sample injection volume was 10 µl and the flow rate was 0 4 ml min 1 the mass spectrometer was operated in positive product ion scan mode to measure smx cbz and bta precursors at mass to charge ratio m z 254 06 237 10 and 120 13 respectively fragment ions at m z 156 0 194 10 and 39 02 were used for the quantitation of smx cbz and bta respectively in negative scan mode precursors at m z 294 02 and 213 03 were selected to measure dcf and mcp respectively fragment ions at m z 250 85 and 140 03 were used to quantify dcf and mcp respectively the molecular ions were monitored in single ion monitoring mode and the analytical data were acquired by multiquant software 2 5 identification of reactive species six scavengers including isopropanol ipa sodium azide sa ascorbic acid aa triethanolamine tea potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 and catalase were used to identify the free radicals and reactive oxygen species ros generated during the modified photo fenton process the corresponding reactive species were hydroxyl radicals ho singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide radical anion o2 hole h electron e and h2o2 respectively while tea ipa sa and aa were dosed at a concentration of 1 mm k2cr2o7 was dosed at much lower concentrations 25 µm or 0 025 mm additionally bovine catalase at 3000 u was used to scavenge h2o2 scavenger concentrations were based on preliminary experimental data to maximize the scavenging effect and minimize the bactericidal effect scavenger efficacy was assessed by viable cell count on selective agar plates and degradation of the five mps in addition electron paramagnetic resonance epr bruker elexsyse500 billerica ma was employed to detect radicals with detailed protocol in si text 6 3 results and discussion 3 1 arb inactivation in upw in order to evaluate the arb inactivation efficiency of the modified photo fenton treatments in upw the abundance of e coli was quantified as shown in fig 1 minor arb inactivation 0 10 log was observed in the dark control 15 minutes this may be attributed to the physiological osmolarity of upw where osmotic stress affects bacterial cells under the irradiation of solar simulated light without adding any reactants arb decreased by 1 61 log possibly due to regulation of the photolyase enzyme under visible light sinha and häder 2002 the photosensitization of porphyrins in the presence of d aminolevulinic acid could lead to 1o2 generation and subsequently to intracellular lesions thus decreasing the cell viability szocs et al 1999 the inactivation efficiency of fe iii 0 1 mm in the presence of light was slightly higher 3 25 log than the action of simulated solar light alone 1 60 log during 60 min treatment fig 1 the higher inactivation may be due to intracellular fenton reactions which generate ho radicals during respiration and bacterial oxidation of carbon moncayo lasso et al 2008 in the presence of h2o2 and light the efficiency increased to 2 71 log arb inactivation after 60 min the combination of both fe iii and h2o2 under solar light further increased the inactivation of arb with approximately 5 45 log reduction after 1 hour treatment in the presence of solar irradiation h2o2 can accelerate the oxidation of fe iii edds to fe ii edds huang et al 2013 it was reported that photocatalytic performance also enhanced with increasing the concentration of fe iii edds at 1 2 molar ratio garcía fernández et al 2019 in the present study a 6 36 log reduction in arb occurred after 30 min treatment with fe iii edds h2o2 at 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm under solar irradiation which was significantly higher than the inactivation efficiency 3 87 log reduction after 1 hour with fe iii edds in the absence of h2o2 the same ratio and dose were used for fe ii in place of fe iii but a relatively lower bacterial removal efficiency 2 31 log reduction was observed after 1 hour treatment the fe iii edds system was more efficient at inactivating arb than the conventional photo fenton process which requires a higher reagent dosage and a longer contact time our previous study found that a higher concentration of both fe ii 0 5 mm and h2o2 10 mm was required to complete arb inactivation using the same contact time 30 min ahmed et al 2020 giannakis et al 2018b also observed a longer contact time was required 1 hour for a 6 log reduction in streptomycin resistant e coli at the dose of 0 18 mm of fe ii and 0 6 mm of h2o2 in addition 6 log reduction of colistin resistant e coli s115 6 log was achieved at approximately 90 min and ph 6 1 6 2 giannakis et al 2018a while a 5 log reduction in clarithromycin and sulfamethoxazole resistant enterococcus faecalis was observed after 140 min of solar fenton exposure at ph 4 karaolia et al 2014 although edds enhances the solar disinfection process very few studies have focused on the use of the fe iii edds complex in 2019 a study reported 6 log inactivation in non resistant e coli under solar irradiation at lower doses of reagents 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm of fe iii edds h2o2 garcía fernández et al 2019 however the accumulated uv energy quv was higher 3 5 kj l than that used in the current study 1 2 kj l in addition it should be noted that the ph ranged from 7 40 0 05 to 6 89 0 10 during 30 min treatment this near neutral operating ph is another advantage as compared with conventional fenton processes which often require acidic conditions karaolia et al 2014 in the current study the complexing agent edds maintained the ph in a neutral range a lower energy was required for the fe iii edds tests than for the fe ii edds complex at respective ratios 1 1 and 1 2 miralles cuevas et al 2019 under the simulated solar irradiation these differences were more obvious for example miralles cuevas et al 2019 observed lower energy 1 4 kj l was required for 1 2 fe iii edds as compared with 1 1 fe iii edds 3 kj l for the degradation of contaminants it was also suggested that increasing the concentration of edds in fe iii edds complex led to higher ho generation but consumed more h2o2 the optimal iron doses generate more ros which under solar illumination penetrate cells leading to supplementary intracellular oxidation of fe ii to fe iii imlay 2003 therefore the present modified photo fenton process increased arb inactivation and required less h2o2 to investigate morphological changes in multi drug resistant e coli under modified photo fenton treatment topographical and cross sectional images were generated by atomic force microscopy afm fig 2 before starting the treatment the cells of resistant bacteria were typically rod shaped with relatively smooth surface however a significant number of bacterial cells began to deform after treatment with increasing treatment time cells were badly damaged and flattened with perforations appearing on the cell surface fig 2c until finally cells were fully lysed fig 2d the cross sectional profiles showed a significant change in the average height of the cells decreasing from 210 50 nm for the control fig 2a to 25 15 nm for cells with 30 min treatment fig 2d while the cell length decreased from 3 0 0 5 µm control to 1 4 1 µm with treatment in addition the size of perforations increased with increasing treatment time the largest hole had a diameter of 1 µm and depth of 50 nm afm results showed that the smooth surface and 3 d structure of e coli cells were damaged during the modified photo fenton treatment eventually resulting in bacterial cell lysis collectively these data show that the photo fenton dose of 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm of fe iii edds h2o2 is promising for a reduction in ampicillin and tetracycline resistant e coli after 30 min treatment 3 2 inactivation and regrowth activity of arb the inactivation efficiency of this modified photo fenton process was validated using upw sww and rww matrices fig 3 under the dose of 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm of fe iii edds h2o2 the modified process achieved 4 34 and 3 13 log arb removal after 1 hour treatment in sww and rww respectively while it reach limit of detection 6 36 log in upw after 30 min treatment a lower disinfection efficiency was observed in sww and rww compared to upw this was attributed to the presence of dissolved organic matter dom and or the higher alkalinity of sww and rww because the radicals generated from photooxidation are not selective janssen et al 2014 they likely react with dom or inorganic substances serna galvis et al 2019 thus decreasing the activity against arb in addition the alkaline matrix in sww and rww contains bicarbonates which might also play a role in sensitizing and quenching radicals buxton and elliot 1986 thus the dosage of fe iii edds h2o2 at 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm was ineffective for inactivating arb in sww and rww fig 3 when the dosage of fenton reagents was doubled to 0 2 0 4 0 6 mm of fe iii edds h2o2 6 36 log reduction of arb was observed in sww the decreasing trend was relatively higher than that obtained in upw in addition arb regrowth was assessed to determine the microbial risk from the use of treated wastewater fig 4 the regrowth activity of resistant bacteria declined with increasing treatment time in the control test the initial concentration of arb was 1 70 108 cfu ml and 2 108 cfu ml in three matrices after 24 hour and 48 hour incubation respectively however no arb regrowth was detected on agar plates 0 cfu ml for upw and swd after 30 min treatment it was found that after 20 min of treatment time bacterial growth 1 34 108 cfu ml occurred on selective agar after 24 h incubation and bacterial abundance noticeably increased 1 97 108 cfu ml after 48 h incubation with treatment resistant bacteria might enter a viable but nonculturable vbnc state and after 48 incubation the inactivated cells might regain viability via repair mechanisms the afm images also confirmed the bacterial cell was completely damaged after 30 min treatment the damaged cell was unable to repair and no growth occurred on selective agar after 5 day incubation data not shown this result confirmed that the proposed photo fenton process under conditions of fe iii edds h2o2 of 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm and contact time of 30 min efficiently disinfected arb containing water and prevented the regrowth of arb in upw however it should be noted that for the sww matrix 1 90 108 cfu ml of arb regrew after 48 h incubation even after 30 min treatment thus double the concentration of reagents 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm was required to prevent the reactivation of arb from sww fig 4 the modified photo fenton treatment tested in the current study was more successful than the conventional fenton process for preventing arb regrowth for example higher doses of fe ii 0 5 mm and h2o2 10 mm are required to prevent the regrowth of ampicillin and tetracycline resistant e coli when using the photo fenton without edds ahmed et al 2020 in addition another study completely prevent the reactivation of antibiotic resistant e coli but required 6 h treatment with a dose of 0 18 mm of fe ii and 0 6 mm of h2o2 giannakis et al 2018b the more efficient suppression in the current study may be attributed to the addition of edds which stabilizes fe iii 3 3 degradation of args in various water matrices 3 3 1 degradation of e args during inactivation arb lose membrane integrity and release e args as a secondary pollutant subsequently enhancing the spread of resistance genes within bacterial communities wang et al 2016 to date aops or tertiary treatment processes have focused on the inactivation of non resistant bacteria and a few arb but the degradation of args has been overlooked fiorentino et al 2015 giannakis et al 2018a giannakis et al 2018b karaolia et al 2014 mackuľak et al 2015 to assess the removal efficiency of e args by the edds modified solar fenton process qpcr was employed to quantify the removal efficiency of e args in various water matrices the removal efficiency for extracellular teta and bla tem 1 genes showed a similar decreasing trend over time as shown in fig 5 a and b under the default conditions of fe iii edds h2o2 at 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm bla tem 1 rapidly reached the limit of detection i e 6 0 log reduction in both upw and sww matrices after 5 min treatment while it took 10 min to reach the detection limit of teta in three water matrices after 10 min treatment both genes were undetectable as compared with upw the arg removal efficiency in rww was considerably lower which was most likely due to the high turbidity of wastewater as suggested by uslu et al 2016 water turbidity is a major factor influencing the degradation of plasmid dna overall the degradation efficiency for bla tem 1 was higher than that for the teta gene the higher degradation of bla tem 1 might be due to the higher t t bases 1 5 times as compare to teta ahmed et al 2020 a previous study also reported that the bla tem gene was the least tolerant compared to other genes teta mpha and sul1 destiani and templeton 2019 interestingly the present study achieved higher e arg degradation than previous studies which used higher doses of reagents ahmed et al 2020 for example our previous study recorded 4 85 log reduction of e teta and 5 80 log reduction of e bla tem 1 after 10 min treatment at 0 178 mm of fe ii and 0 55 mm of h2o2 ahmed et al 2020 in addition a low removal efficiency 0 4 log was reported for the degradation of plasmid args meca and teta with 20 mg l cl2 zhang et al 2019 whereas a higher dose of sodium hypochlorite solution naocl 376 mg min 1l 1 resulted in 4 log reduction in e arg at ph of 8 yoon et al 2017 therefore the current study shows that the modified photo fenton process is more efficient for the degradation of e args than chlorination and other photo fenton processes likely due to the increased generation of radicals from the fe iii edds complex in the presence of h2o2 and solar irradiation 3 3 2 degradation of i args the i arg removal efficiency of the fe iii edds process is shown fig 6 both i args were degraded 1 0 log in upw whereas only minor degradation occurred in sww and rww 0 12 log after 30 min treatment enhanced i arg degradation was observed with increasing treatment time where 3 79 log reduction of teta and 2 19 log reduction of bla tem 1 were achieved after 1 hour treatment in upw fig 6a and b the degradation efficiency reached a maximum of 4 18 log reduction in teta and 4 14 log reduction in bla tem 1 after 3 hour treatment however the current study achieved a higher i arg degradation efficiency than the conventional photo fenton process ahmed et al 2020 and other disinfection processes yoon et al 2017 specifically only 1 0 log 90 of i arg removal was observed after 1 hour treatment in our previous study with 0 5 mm fe ii and 10 mm h2o2 ahmed et al 2020 while 4 5 log removal of i args was observed after 1 hour treatment with 10 mg l naclo ahmed et al 2020 yoon et al 2017 reported that a higher chlorine dose of 20 mg l was needed to degrade 4 0 log of i args in addition 2 9 log removal of meca and 1 6 log removal of ampc were achieved with uv254 irradiation at 120 mj cm2 mckinney and pruden 2012 3 4 degradation of micropollutants in various water matrices this study further explored the removal efficiency for five mps using the modified photo fenton process with different water matrices initially two control tests hydrolysis and photolysis were carried out in upw by adding only fe iii edds complex at neutral ph no hydrolysis was detected for the mps but only 2 sorption of diclofenac and mecoprop was observed in addition the photolysis efficiency against mps was also evaluated under simulated solar light as illustrated in fig s2 cbz smx and bta were very stable against photolysis in contrast around 70 dcf and 10 mcp was reduced after 30 min solar irradiation fast decomposition of diclofenac by solar irradiation suggests that dcf was readily photodegradable consistent with previous studies alharbi et al 2017 pérez estrada et al 2005 fig 7 shows the degradation of five mps in respective water matrices with the default dose of fe iii edds h2o2 at 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm five mps were efficiently removed from upw during treatment fig 7a degradation of approximately 98 5 cbz 98 3 dcf 96 6 smx 96 3 mcp and 99 2 bta was observed after 10 min treatment with almost complete degradation at 30 min after achieving higher mp degradation efficiency from upw the same doses were used for simultaneous arb inactivation and mp degradation in upw matrix fig 7b slightly lower mp degradation was observed after 30 min with 98 7 degradation of cbz 99 2 dcf 99 8 smx 99 7 mcp and 100 0 bta reaching the detection limit for arb data not shown in fig 7b however mp removal was not as efficient in sww as in upw approximately 80 9 mcp and 88 4 dcf were degraded while removal efficiencies for cbz smx and bta were lower than 30 during 30 min treatment fig 7c these data indicate that the reagents may have been consumed degrading dom in sww thus producing insufficient radicals to effectively degrade mps devi et al 2013 therefore each reagent concentration was doubled fe iii edds h2o2 of 0 2 0 4 0 6 mm to enhance removal efficiency with the result that degradation improved to 96 9 mcp 97 1 dcf 55 1 cbz 40 1 smx and 45 1 bta fig 7d these results suggest that the fe iii edds h2o2 dosage should be optimized to treat respective water streams taking into account the concentration of organic matter in the matrix the possible intermediates and products of these five mps were not identified in this study which warrant further studies the mp removal efficiencies are consistent with results in literature miralles cuevas et al 2014a miralles cuevas et al 2014b for example dong et al 2019a studied the degradation of three pharmaceutical micropollutants cbz crotamiton and ibuprofen in wastewater effluent using feiii nta complex the authors achieved mp degradation efficiencies of more than 92 with a combination of 0 178 mm feiii nta 1 1 4 54 mm h2o2 uva intensity of 4 05 mw cm2 and 120 min treatment a recent report also documented that 80 degradation of more than 45 mps could be achieved in real wastewater after 15 min treatment using 0 88 mm of h2o2 and 1 mm of fe iii edds in lab scale raceway pond reactors soriano molina et al 2019 in addition a previous study demonstrated that edds mediated solar fenton treatment significantly reduced the toxicity of contaminated wastewater cuervo lumbaque et al 2019 together with the previously reported data our results further confirm that the solar fenton process combined with edds may be a viable option for tertiary treatment of water containing low concentrations of pharmaceuticals it should be noted that the application of homogeneous organic chelating agents e g edds in this study may result in increased cod concentration in final treated effluent further studies should explore heterogenous systems to avoid the release of chelates in final effluent 3 5 identification of dominant reactive species in the removal of arb and mps during the modified photo fenton process the iron chelate is photolyzed under solar light and fe iii is reduced to fe ii then fe ii can further react with either edds or h2o2 the efficiency of this process mainly depends on radical species of fe iii fe ii generated during the decomplexation of fe iii edds it has been reported that several rs contribute to mp destruction garcía fernández et al 2019 miralles cuevas et al 2014b soriano molina et al 2018 but there is no information for arb inactivation six scavengers were used to confirm and distinguish the active radicals or ros involved in degrading each mp and arb in the absence of scavengers a 6 36 log reduction in arb occurred after 30 min treatment fig 8 a and five mps were degraded with 97 removal efficiency after 10 min treatment fig 8b f triethanolamine which quenches h significantly decreased the degradation of mps and the inactivation of arb thereby suggesting that h plays a dominant role in these processes the second highest scavenging activity was observed for isopropanol 1 mm which targets ho radicals in solution it has been widely stated that ho radical plays the dominant role in mp degradation in most of the fenton photo fenton and the modified fenton related systems huang et al 2013 wang et al 2019a wu et al 2014 xie et al 2020 however in this study we observed that h plays the dominant role while the ho radical is the secondary ros in addition k2cr2o7 used for quenching e had a limited effect on arb and mp removal but lower than the o2 for arb and cbz ascorbic acid also used for quenching o2 had a limited effect on arb inactivation but it significantly decreased mp degradation huang et al 2013 also estimated that 80 of the ho radicals generated were dependent on the presence of o2 while the remaining 20 of ho radicals were generated without o2 in the fe iii edds system huang et al 2013 similar behaviour observed in the current study also confirmed that o2 helped to generate oh radicals this radical may also be generated by the reaction of flavins with oxygen which further react with each other and finally form h2o2 imlay 2003 this may be beneficial for enhancing arb inactivation in the fenton or photo fenton processes h2o2 plays a key role in generating various ros arb were inactivated by h2o2 alone and also inactivated 2 71 log in the presence of solar light during 1 h treatment fig 1 to confirm the activity of h2o2 we added bovine catalase to the system and observed a significant decrease in the degradation of arb fig 8a and mps fig 8b f the scavenging effect of bovine catalase was stronger for arb than for mps the catalase results confirm that h2o2 was playing an important role in the fe edds h2o2 reaction considering the fe iii edds chelate achieved 6 36 log reduction in arb during 30 min treatment while 0 59 log arb removal efficiency was observed for the conventional fenton process after one hour treatment fig 1 it can be concluded that the presence of solar irradiation stimulates more ros generation in addition the fe iii edds complex with h2o2 may also enhance the generation of extracellular ros thus increasing the degradation of bacterial cells and mps collectively these scavenger experiments showed that efficient arb and mp degradation was a result of the combined effect of various radicals including h ho 1o2 o2 and h2o2 in photocatalytic processes the catalytic reaction is initiated with the adsorption of photons with energy above the semiconductor s band gap thus producing charge carriers electron and holes e h on the metal surface a fraction of these species can be trapped in presence of oxidant like oxygen or h2o2 and generating ros such as ho o2 and 1o2 in modified photo fenton process the hole h and hydroxyl radical ho were recognized as the dominant reactive species to degrade arb and mps fig 8a f using 1 hydroxy 3 carboxy 2 2 5 5 tetramethylpyrrolidine cph and 5 tert butoxycarbonyl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide bmpo to further confirm the generation of hole and oh radicals the epr spectra were profiled before and during solar irradiation as shown in fig s3 a a and b a no characteristic epr signals were detected in the presence of trapping agents cph and bmpo and complex fe3 edds in addition no characteristic peaks were recorded in the absence of light fig s3 a b and b b by the addition of h2o2 and light we clearly observed a three line and four line spectra with intensity ratio of 1 1 1 fig s3 a c and 1 2 2 1 fig s3 b c which is the characteristic spectrum for the adduct of cph h jia et al 2014 and bmpo oh respectively together with scavenger testing it can be confirmed that both electron hole h and hydroxyl radical oh play important roles in inactivating arb and degrading mps however the higher photoinduced holes and electrons could help to generate more ros to degrade organic pollutants the superficial holes also readily and directly oxidize organic pollutants palominos et al 2008 therefore the generated holes finally help to generate ros especially oh radical theoretically a chemical bond is formed between edds and fe iii ion by transferring the charge between the ligand and the metal xie et al 2020 in the presence of simulated solar light the electrons e excited on the metal surface will jump from the valence band to conduction band after that holes h will be generated in the valence band forming e h pairs nosaka and nosaka 2017 the generated holes can degrade hazards directly by reacting with organic matter and indirectly by generating various ros the radical ho can also be generated in water in the presence of holes h2o h h ho yan et al 2012 further epr studies will confirm whether other radicals e g 1o2 and o2 are involved in the edds modified photo fenton process 3 6 possible mechanisms for arg degradation the degradation of plasmid pwh1266 was evaluated during the studied treatment process by using afm images and qpcr data before the treatment the naked dna i e extracellular dna shows a circular form of dna molecules with the size ranging from 1600 to 2000 nm fig 9 a the changing topography was observed under different treatment time a bright band of dna persisted throughout the treatment process and aggregated dna formed lumps with an average diameter of 100 400 nm fig 9b however the dna was eventually degraded into tiny pieces after 10 min treatment fig 9c it has been documented that genes could be affected or damaged by the generated ros bjelland and seeberg 2003 cadet et al 2010 cadet and wagner 2014 depending on ros levels low levels of ros perform important cellular functions such as serving as cellular messengers in redox signalling reactions and effecting important defence responses to invading pathogens by the immune system chatterjee and walker 2017 however excessive ros could cause serious oxidative base lesions and 2 deoxyribose modifications bjelland and seeberg 2003 cadet et al 2010 chatterjee and walker 2017 the most conspicuous ros in dna degradation include ho 1o2 o2 and h2o2 chatterjee and walker 2017 which were also generated in our modified photo fenton process amongst these ros the radical oh is most reactive which is able to damage dna proteins and lipids dizdaroglu et al 1991 this radical could react with dna bases by i adding to their double bonds ii abstracting hydrogen atoms from their methyl groups and iii attacking the sugar residue in their immediate vicinity breen and murphy 1995 the generated radical oh from the modified photo fenton process could also induce an imidazole ring opening in guanine and adenine to form the fragmented purine structure formamidopyrimidine chatterjee and walker 2017 in contrast 1o2 o2 and h2o2 show a relatively low reactivity with the nucleobases and 2 deoxyribose moiety cadet et al 2012 the known reaction mediated by o2 involves the addition of c5 of highly oxidizing guanine radical gua h that arises from deprotonation of the guanine radical cation misiaszek et al 2004 in addition h2o2 is also able to undergo electrophilic addition to n1 of adenine thus giving rise to the formation of adenine n1 oxide but with a very low efficiency cadet and wagner 2014 therefore h2o2 is likely involved in the formation of various ros by fenton type reactions which also accelerate the dna degradation under the edds modified photo fenton process 4 conclusions the edds modified photo fenton process was developed to simultaneously remove arb args and mps from various water matrices at neutral ph the results demonstrated that the relative concentration of arb e arg and mps decreased to the limit of detection within 30 15 and 10 min treatment respectively with 0 1 mm fe iii 0 2 mm edds and 0 3 mm h2o2 in upw this process did not allow bacterial regrowth with 2 days incubation almost 4 0 log removal of i arg was achieved with similar reagent doses but a comparatively longer contact time 2 hour was required the removal efficiency of mps was higher in upw as compared with other matrices doubling the concentration of treatment reagents was required to remove mps from sww the high pollutant removal efficiency demonstrated in the current study is associated with the production of various ros like ho 1o2 o2 and h2o2 by the modified photo fenton process the oh radical is the dominant reactive species for both the degradation of arb and mp collectively the present study confirmed that the edds modified photo fenton process efficiently removes arb args and mps

17028,although photo driven advanced oxidation processes aops have been developed to treat wastewater few studies have investigated the feasibility of aops to simultaneously remove antibiotic resistant bacteria arb antibiotic resistance genes args and micropollutants mps this study employed a modified photo fenton process using ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds to chelate iron iii thus maintaining the reaction ph in a neutral range simultaneous removal of arb and associated extracellular e args and intracellular args i args was assessed by bacterial cell culture qpcr and atomic force microscopy the removal of five mps was also evaluated by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry a low dose comprising 0 1 mm fe iii 0 2 mm edds and 0 3 mm hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was found to be effective for decreasing arb by 6 log within 30 min and e args by 6 log within 10 min no arb regrowth occurred after 48 h suggesting that the proposed process is an effective disinfectant against arb moreover five recalcitrant mps carbamazepine diclofenac sulfamethoxazole mecoprop and benzotriazole at an initial concentration of 10 μg l each were 99 removed after 30 min treatment in ultrapure water the modified photo fenton process was also validated using synthetic wastewater and real secondary wastewater effluent as matrices and results suggest the dosage should be doubled to ensure equivalent removal performance collectively this study demonstrated that the modified process is an optimistic one stop solution to simultaneously mitigate both chemical and biological hazards graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance ar antibiotic resistance gene arg micropollutants mps modified photo fenton atomic force microscopy afm 1 introduction the use of reclaimed wastewater is being considered as a strategic solution in many water scarce countries or regions however the presence of biological hazards e g pathogens and antibiotic resistance and chemical hazards e g micropollutants in source water reclaimed wastewater landscaping water and finished drinking water is an emerging challenge for public health and ecological environmental applications in terms of biological risk antibiotic resistance is a severe global threat for public health causing around 700 000 deaths per year o neill et al 2014 antibiotic resistance can transfer and spread within the community in hospitals agricultural settings wastewater treatment plants wwtps and other associated environments such as soils guo et al 2020 there is evidence that antibiotic resistance can transfer to humans from arb and args present in contaminated water posing another challenge to mitigation of waterborne disease barancheshme and munir 2018 disinfection is an important step for inactivating and removing pathogens from the wastewater influent chlorination ultraviolet radiation uv and ozonation o3 have been widely used as disinfection processes in water and wastewater treatment plants nevertheless some waterborne bacteria are resistant to common disinfectants necessitating higher disinfectant doses potentially causing increased production of carcinogenic disinfection by products dbp le roux et al 2017 park et al 2016 previous studies also suggest that bacteria in disinfected water or wastewater can regrow in distribution pipes or storage tanks before reuse thus deteriorating water quality and posing potential microbial risks huang et al 2016 lee and deininger 2000 power et al 1997 zhang and digiano 2002 more importantly these disinfection processes may have resulted in inadequate elimination of pathogens arb and args from treated water or wastewater which may pose aquatic and community health risks chang et al 2015 sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 moreover these processes can help to discharge the plasmid or chromosomal dna which harbor args into the aquatic system allowing uptake by other bacteria through horizontal gene transfer wang et al 2019b studies also indicate that the bacterial transformation process frequently occurs in the presence of free dna suggesting that the dna in water could pose a threat to the aquatic environment and community moradigaravand and engelstädter 2014 woegerbauer et al 2020 in terms of chemical risk pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps are consumed on a large scale and are excreted to various environments as micropollutants walters et al 2010 due to persistent input and bioaccumulation through the food chain the potential threat of micropollutants to environmental and human health has raised significant concern although conventional wwtps effectively remove various organic compounds micropollutants include a diverse array of compounds with persistent properties and not all are biodegradable rogowska et al 2020 it is concerning that large amounts of micropollutants continue be discharged into aqueous environments thus posing a threat to ecology for example our recent studies lu et al 2018 wang et al 2019b wang et al 2019c have proven that several micropollutants e g triclosan and carbamazepine promote the spread of antibiotic resistance in water thus efficient treatment methods should be established to manage a broad spectrum of micropollutants importantly it would be more economically viable to develop a one stop solution i e a single unit rather than multiple units to simultaneously remove both biological and chemical hazards from contaminated water thus providing safe water for reuse or recycle the photo fenton process has proved an efficient advanced oxidation process aop for the treatment and purification of water and wastewater at acidic ph the conventional photo fenton process is very effective leading to high degradation rates giannakis et al 2016 however the removal efficiency is often limited at neutral ph due to the low solubility and poor stability of fe iii that affects the decomposition of h2o2 and slows down or blocks the generation rate of hydroxyl radical ho cuervo lumbaque et al 2019 huang et al 2012 an aminopolycarboxylic acid complex apca containing iron has been proposed to address this shortcoming enhancing the solubility of fe iii fe ii and establishing the photo fenton reaction at neutral ph dong et al 2019b in addition numerous complexing or chelating agents such as oxalic acid nogueira et al 2017 citric acid ruales lonfat et al 2016 villegas guzman et al 2017 ascorbic acid villegas guzman et al 2017 tartaric acid villegas guzman et al 2017 ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta de luca et al 2014 and nitrilotriacetic acid nta dong et al 2019a have been trialled to enhance the photo fenton process miralles cuevas et al 2019 however the efficacy of complexing agents depends on the chelate physiochemical characteristics such as the stability type of functional groups and radical scavenging capability clarizia et al 2017 as compared with other complexing or chelating agents edds is a highly biodegradable non hazardous and sustainable ecofriendly metal chelate cuervo lumbaque et al 2019 furthermore fe iii edds demonstrates higher efficiency as compared with other complexing agents like edta oxalate and citrate due to lower redox potentials of the fe iii fe ii complex half wave potential e1 2 of 0 069v nhe huang et al 2012 for example garcía fernández et al 2019 studied photo fenton inactivation of non resistant escherichia coli and e faecalis in which 6 log reduction was achieved with 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm of fe iii edds h2o2 with an energy requirement of 3 5 kj l and 11 9 kj l respectively in addition huang et al 2013 reported 99 bisphenol a degradation could be achieved using higher doses of 1 mm fe iii edds and 5 mm h2o2 during 6 h treatment although these previous studies have investigated bacterial inactivation or mp removal separately there is little research on using the photo fenton process for simultaneous removal of both biological and chemical hazards fiorentino et al 2019 thus in this study we employed a modified photo fenton technique for the removal of arb args and mps from various water matrices we used β lactam and tetracycline resistant e coli as a biological hazard model respectively harboring bla tem 1 and teta which are commonly detected args in various water systems shi et al 2013 culture based enumeration was used to detect regrowth of resistant bacterial strains in addition based on findings from the swiss federal office for the environment foen foen 2017 we selected five mps as indicators of chemical hazards comprising carbamazepine cbz diclofenac dcf sulfamethoxazole smx mecoprop mcp and benzotriazole bta as shown in table s1 supporting information si the removal efficiency of arb args and mps was systematically studied using fe iii edds and or h2o2 in the presence of solar simulated light in order to reveal underlying mechanisms chemical scavengers were used to confirm reactive species in the arb and mp experiments in addition the efficiency of this modified photo fenton process was investigated in various water matrices this study will contribute to the development and design of a one stop process for simultaneously removing both biological and chemical hazards 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and treatments in this study β lactam and tetracycline resistant e coli dh5α was used as an antibiotic resistant bacterium chang et al 2017 e coli dh5α was prepared according to the previous study ahmed et al 2020 with details in si text 1 all the solar fenton tests were carried out in 250 ml cell culture flasks the water matrices were spiked with 10 µg l of each micropollutant and or 106 cfu ml of bacterial cells the fe iii edds complex was freshly prepared by adding required volume of iron iii sulfate and edds solution into a 1 5 ml tube before switching on the simulated solar ss light both the arb and mps were homogenized in the flasks for 10 30 min in the dark with the required volume of fe iii edds after that h2o2 was added to 0 3 mm and the simulated solar light was turned on the photo fenton dose was 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm and the ratio of fe iii edds was 1 2 determined as optimal from previously reported data garcía fernández et al 2019 the simulated solar light used in this study was generated by a pls sxe300 system beijing perfectlight technology co ltd china using a 138 xenon lamp 200 800 nm 300w with an average light intensity of 130 mw cm2 during the photo driven experiments the lamp was fixed 12 cm above the water surface the ph remained neutral during the treatment period at various times during the treatment process 1 ml samples were collected for arb and mps analysis while 50 ml was collected for the extraction of intracellular dna after sampling 10 sodium thiosulphate was used to quench the reaction for arb enumeration 100 µl of diluted samples were plated onto selective lb agar the bacterial regrowth and recovery analyses were also conducted according to the procedure described in si text 2 the efficiency of this modified photo fenton process was validated in three aqueous matrices e g ultrapure water upw synthetic wastewater sww and real wastewater effluent rww the list of chemicals and the sww recipe are shown in si text 3 the rww was collected from a full scale wastewater treatment plant brisbane australia with detailed effluent characteristics in table s2 after collection the effluent was autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min then cooled and stored at 4 c before bacterial inactivation experiments 2 2 atomic force microscopy afm the surface topography and amplitude of the antibiotic resistant bacterial cells were characterized by afm the afm samples were prepared based on a previous study medeot et al 2020 briefly 10 μl aliquots of photo fenton treated untreated e coli suspension were dropped on the mica surface then 10 minutes vacuum drying was applied using a harrick pdc001 plasma drying unit after drying each sample was washed three times with upw and the vacuum dryer used for final drying all samples were imaged in ac mode in air using asylum research cypher afm oxford instruments ca silicon cantilevers were used to scan the cell with a resonance frequency of 75 khz and spring constant of 3 5 n m the afm images was scanned at moderate speed 0 5 to 1 hz with 256 pixels per line scan a topographical image represented by height and amplitude and a phase image were obtained simultaneously from each scan 2 3 quantification of args the bacterial cell suspension was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 c qiagen dneasy powerwater kit germany was used to extract dna from the cells to quantify i args the purity and concentration of dna were measured according to our previous study ahmed et al 2020 for the e arg experiment water matrices were spiked with plasmid dna 108 copies µl and samples were directly analysed by qpcr before and during treatment samples were collected and analysed by rt pcr without further processing the details of dna extraction and quantification are described in si text 4 and si text 5 respectively the standard curve of each of the studied genes is shown in fig s1 the length of each targeted primer is shown in table s3 si 2 4 analytical methods stock solutions containing 1 mg ml of smx cbz bta dcf and mcp were prepared and stored at 20 c prior to use working standards were prepared at 10 μg l for each micropollutant for lc ms analysis five standard concentrations of 0 625 1 25 2 5 5 and 10 µg l for each micropollutant were freshly prepared from the stock solution quality control was performed by analysis of a blank sample a calibration curve was generated by plotting the peak area of each micropollutant against the concentration peak area measurements were simultaneously determined by multiquant software the lc ms detection limit for each mp was 0 625 µg l the mp degradation performance of the modified photo fenton process in upw and sww was evaluated using a shimadzu liquid chromatography system connected to a mass spectrometer ab sciex tripletof 5600 via an electrospray ionization esi interface chromatographic separation was carried out using a phenomenex kinetex biphenyl 50 2 1 mm c18 analytical column the solvents used as the mobile phase were milliq water acidified with 0 1 formic acid mobile phase a and methanol meoh with 0 1 formic acid mobile phase b the elution gradient progressed from 30 b 0 3 min to 100 b 2 min and was maintained at 100 for 5 7 min before returning to 30 b the total run time was 8 min for each ionization mode the sample injection volume was 10 µl and the flow rate was 0 4 ml min 1 the mass spectrometer was operated in positive product ion scan mode to measure smx cbz and bta precursors at mass to charge ratio m z 254 06 237 10 and 120 13 respectively fragment ions at m z 156 0 194 10 and 39 02 were used for the quantitation of smx cbz and bta respectively in negative scan mode precursors at m z 294 02 and 213 03 were selected to measure dcf and mcp respectively fragment ions at m z 250 85 and 140 03 were used to quantify dcf and mcp respectively the molecular ions were monitored in single ion monitoring mode and the analytical data were acquired by multiquant software 2 5 identification of reactive species six scavengers including isopropanol ipa sodium azide sa ascorbic acid aa triethanolamine tea potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 and catalase were used to identify the free radicals and reactive oxygen species ros generated during the modified photo fenton process the corresponding reactive species were hydroxyl radicals ho singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide radical anion o2 hole h electron e and h2o2 respectively while tea ipa sa and aa were dosed at a concentration of 1 mm k2cr2o7 was dosed at much lower concentrations 25 µm or 0 025 mm additionally bovine catalase at 3000 u was used to scavenge h2o2 scavenger concentrations were based on preliminary experimental data to maximize the scavenging effect and minimize the bactericidal effect scavenger efficacy was assessed by viable cell count on selective agar plates and degradation of the five mps in addition electron paramagnetic resonance epr bruker elexsyse500 billerica ma was employed to detect radicals with detailed protocol in si text 6 3 results and discussion 3 1 arb inactivation in upw in order to evaluate the arb inactivation efficiency of the modified photo fenton treatments in upw the abundance of e coli was quantified as shown in fig 1 minor arb inactivation 0 10 log was observed in the dark control 15 minutes this may be attributed to the physiological osmolarity of upw where osmotic stress affects bacterial cells under the irradiation of solar simulated light without adding any reactants arb decreased by 1 61 log possibly due to regulation of the photolyase enzyme under visible light sinha and häder 2002 the photosensitization of porphyrins in the presence of d aminolevulinic acid could lead to 1o2 generation and subsequently to intracellular lesions thus decreasing the cell viability szocs et al 1999 the inactivation efficiency of fe iii 0 1 mm in the presence of light was slightly higher 3 25 log than the action of simulated solar light alone 1 60 log during 60 min treatment fig 1 the higher inactivation may be due to intracellular fenton reactions which generate ho radicals during respiration and bacterial oxidation of carbon moncayo lasso et al 2008 in the presence of h2o2 and light the efficiency increased to 2 71 log arb inactivation after 60 min the combination of both fe iii and h2o2 under solar light further increased the inactivation of arb with approximately 5 45 log reduction after 1 hour treatment in the presence of solar irradiation h2o2 can accelerate the oxidation of fe iii edds to fe ii edds huang et al 2013 it was reported that photocatalytic performance also enhanced with increasing the concentration of fe iii edds at 1 2 molar ratio garcía fernández et al 2019 in the present study a 6 36 log reduction in arb occurred after 30 min treatment with fe iii edds h2o2 at 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm under solar irradiation which was significantly higher than the inactivation efficiency 3 87 log reduction after 1 hour with fe iii edds in the absence of h2o2 the same ratio and dose were used for fe ii in place of fe iii but a relatively lower bacterial removal efficiency 2 31 log reduction was observed after 1 hour treatment the fe iii edds system was more efficient at inactivating arb than the conventional photo fenton process which requires a higher reagent dosage and a longer contact time our previous study found that a higher concentration of both fe ii 0 5 mm and h2o2 10 mm was required to complete arb inactivation using the same contact time 30 min ahmed et al 2020 giannakis et al 2018b also observed a longer contact time was required 1 hour for a 6 log reduction in streptomycin resistant e coli at the dose of 0 18 mm of fe ii and 0 6 mm of h2o2 in addition 6 log reduction of colistin resistant e coli s115 6 log was achieved at approximately 90 min and ph 6 1 6 2 giannakis et al 2018a while a 5 log reduction in clarithromycin and sulfamethoxazole resistant enterococcus faecalis was observed after 140 min of solar fenton exposure at ph 4 karaolia et al 2014 although edds enhances the solar disinfection process very few studies have focused on the use of the fe iii edds complex in 2019 a study reported 6 log inactivation in non resistant e coli under solar irradiation at lower doses of reagents 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm of fe iii edds h2o2 garcía fernández et al 2019 however the accumulated uv energy quv was higher 3 5 kj l than that used in the current study 1 2 kj l in addition it should be noted that the ph ranged from 7 40 0 05 to 6 89 0 10 during 30 min treatment this near neutral operating ph is another advantage as compared with conventional fenton processes which often require acidic conditions karaolia et al 2014 in the current study the complexing agent edds maintained the ph in a neutral range a lower energy was required for the fe iii edds tests than for the fe ii edds complex at respective ratios 1 1 and 1 2 miralles cuevas et al 2019 under the simulated solar irradiation these differences were more obvious for example miralles cuevas et al 2019 observed lower energy 1 4 kj l was required for 1 2 fe iii edds as compared with 1 1 fe iii edds 3 kj l for the degradation of contaminants it was also suggested that increasing the concentration of edds in fe iii edds complex led to higher ho generation but consumed more h2o2 the optimal iron doses generate more ros which under solar illumination penetrate cells leading to supplementary intracellular oxidation of fe ii to fe iii imlay 2003 therefore the present modified photo fenton process increased arb inactivation and required less h2o2 to investigate morphological changes in multi drug resistant e coli under modified photo fenton treatment topographical and cross sectional images were generated by atomic force microscopy afm fig 2 before starting the treatment the cells of resistant bacteria were typically rod shaped with relatively smooth surface however a significant number of bacterial cells began to deform after treatment with increasing treatment time cells were badly damaged and flattened with perforations appearing on the cell surface fig 2c until finally cells were fully lysed fig 2d the cross sectional profiles showed a significant change in the average height of the cells decreasing from 210 50 nm for the control fig 2a to 25 15 nm for cells with 30 min treatment fig 2d while the cell length decreased from 3 0 0 5 µm control to 1 4 1 µm with treatment in addition the size of perforations increased with increasing treatment time the largest hole had a diameter of 1 µm and depth of 50 nm afm results showed that the smooth surface and 3 d structure of e coli cells were damaged during the modified photo fenton treatment eventually resulting in bacterial cell lysis collectively these data show that the photo fenton dose of 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm of fe iii edds h2o2 is promising for a reduction in ampicillin and tetracycline resistant e coli after 30 min treatment 3 2 inactivation and regrowth activity of arb the inactivation efficiency of this modified photo fenton process was validated using upw sww and rww matrices fig 3 under the dose of 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm of fe iii edds h2o2 the modified process achieved 4 34 and 3 13 log arb removal after 1 hour treatment in sww and rww respectively while it reach limit of detection 6 36 log in upw after 30 min treatment a lower disinfection efficiency was observed in sww and rww compared to upw this was attributed to the presence of dissolved organic matter dom and or the higher alkalinity of sww and rww because the radicals generated from photooxidation are not selective janssen et al 2014 they likely react with dom or inorganic substances serna galvis et al 2019 thus decreasing the activity against arb in addition the alkaline matrix in sww and rww contains bicarbonates which might also play a role in sensitizing and quenching radicals buxton and elliot 1986 thus the dosage of fe iii edds h2o2 at 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm was ineffective for inactivating arb in sww and rww fig 3 when the dosage of fenton reagents was doubled to 0 2 0 4 0 6 mm of fe iii edds h2o2 6 36 log reduction of arb was observed in sww the decreasing trend was relatively higher than that obtained in upw in addition arb regrowth was assessed to determine the microbial risk from the use of treated wastewater fig 4 the regrowth activity of resistant bacteria declined with increasing treatment time in the control test the initial concentration of arb was 1 70 108 cfu ml and 2 108 cfu ml in three matrices after 24 hour and 48 hour incubation respectively however no arb regrowth was detected on agar plates 0 cfu ml for upw and swd after 30 min treatment it was found that after 20 min of treatment time bacterial growth 1 34 108 cfu ml occurred on selective agar after 24 h incubation and bacterial abundance noticeably increased 1 97 108 cfu ml after 48 h incubation with treatment resistant bacteria might enter a viable but nonculturable vbnc state and after 48 incubation the inactivated cells might regain viability via repair mechanisms the afm images also confirmed the bacterial cell was completely damaged after 30 min treatment the damaged cell was unable to repair and no growth occurred on selective agar after 5 day incubation data not shown this result confirmed that the proposed photo fenton process under conditions of fe iii edds h2o2 of 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm and contact time of 30 min efficiently disinfected arb containing water and prevented the regrowth of arb in upw however it should be noted that for the sww matrix 1 90 108 cfu ml of arb regrew after 48 h incubation even after 30 min treatment thus double the concentration of reagents 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm was required to prevent the reactivation of arb from sww fig 4 the modified photo fenton treatment tested in the current study was more successful than the conventional fenton process for preventing arb regrowth for example higher doses of fe ii 0 5 mm and h2o2 10 mm are required to prevent the regrowth of ampicillin and tetracycline resistant e coli when using the photo fenton without edds ahmed et al 2020 in addition another study completely prevent the reactivation of antibiotic resistant e coli but required 6 h treatment with a dose of 0 18 mm of fe ii and 0 6 mm of h2o2 giannakis et al 2018b the more efficient suppression in the current study may be attributed to the addition of edds which stabilizes fe iii 3 3 degradation of args in various water matrices 3 3 1 degradation of e args during inactivation arb lose membrane integrity and release e args as a secondary pollutant subsequently enhancing the spread of resistance genes within bacterial communities wang et al 2016 to date aops or tertiary treatment processes have focused on the inactivation of non resistant bacteria and a few arb but the degradation of args has been overlooked fiorentino et al 2015 giannakis et al 2018a giannakis et al 2018b karaolia et al 2014 mackuľak et al 2015 to assess the removal efficiency of e args by the edds modified solar fenton process qpcr was employed to quantify the removal efficiency of e args in various water matrices the removal efficiency for extracellular teta and bla tem 1 genes showed a similar decreasing trend over time as shown in fig 5 a and b under the default conditions of fe iii edds h2o2 at 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm bla tem 1 rapidly reached the limit of detection i e 6 0 log reduction in both upw and sww matrices after 5 min treatment while it took 10 min to reach the detection limit of teta in three water matrices after 10 min treatment both genes were undetectable as compared with upw the arg removal efficiency in rww was considerably lower which was most likely due to the high turbidity of wastewater as suggested by uslu et al 2016 water turbidity is a major factor influencing the degradation of plasmid dna overall the degradation efficiency for bla tem 1 was higher than that for the teta gene the higher degradation of bla tem 1 might be due to the higher t t bases 1 5 times as compare to teta ahmed et al 2020 a previous study also reported that the bla tem gene was the least tolerant compared to other genes teta mpha and sul1 destiani and templeton 2019 interestingly the present study achieved higher e arg degradation than previous studies which used higher doses of reagents ahmed et al 2020 for example our previous study recorded 4 85 log reduction of e teta and 5 80 log reduction of e bla tem 1 after 10 min treatment at 0 178 mm of fe ii and 0 55 mm of h2o2 ahmed et al 2020 in addition a low removal efficiency 0 4 log was reported for the degradation of plasmid args meca and teta with 20 mg l cl2 zhang et al 2019 whereas a higher dose of sodium hypochlorite solution naocl 376 mg min 1l 1 resulted in 4 log reduction in e arg at ph of 8 yoon et al 2017 therefore the current study shows that the modified photo fenton process is more efficient for the degradation of e args than chlorination and other photo fenton processes likely due to the increased generation of radicals from the fe iii edds complex in the presence of h2o2 and solar irradiation 3 3 2 degradation of i args the i arg removal efficiency of the fe iii edds process is shown fig 6 both i args were degraded 1 0 log in upw whereas only minor degradation occurred in sww and rww 0 12 log after 30 min treatment enhanced i arg degradation was observed with increasing treatment time where 3 79 log reduction of teta and 2 19 log reduction of bla tem 1 were achieved after 1 hour treatment in upw fig 6a and b the degradation efficiency reached a maximum of 4 18 log reduction in teta and 4 14 log reduction in bla tem 1 after 3 hour treatment however the current study achieved a higher i arg degradation efficiency than the conventional photo fenton process ahmed et al 2020 and other disinfection processes yoon et al 2017 specifically only 1 0 log 90 of i arg removal was observed after 1 hour treatment in our previous study with 0 5 mm fe ii and 10 mm h2o2 ahmed et al 2020 while 4 5 log removal of i args was observed after 1 hour treatment with 10 mg l naclo ahmed et al 2020 yoon et al 2017 reported that a higher chlorine dose of 20 mg l was needed to degrade 4 0 log of i args in addition 2 9 log removal of meca and 1 6 log removal of ampc were achieved with uv254 irradiation at 120 mj cm2 mckinney and pruden 2012 3 4 degradation of micropollutants in various water matrices this study further explored the removal efficiency for five mps using the modified photo fenton process with different water matrices initially two control tests hydrolysis and photolysis were carried out in upw by adding only fe iii edds complex at neutral ph no hydrolysis was detected for the mps but only 2 sorption of diclofenac and mecoprop was observed in addition the photolysis efficiency against mps was also evaluated under simulated solar light as illustrated in fig s2 cbz smx and bta were very stable against photolysis in contrast around 70 dcf and 10 mcp was reduced after 30 min solar irradiation fast decomposition of diclofenac by solar irradiation suggests that dcf was readily photodegradable consistent with previous studies alharbi et al 2017 pérez estrada et al 2005 fig 7 shows the degradation of five mps in respective water matrices with the default dose of fe iii edds h2o2 at 0 1 0 2 0 3 mm five mps were efficiently removed from upw during treatment fig 7a degradation of approximately 98 5 cbz 98 3 dcf 96 6 smx 96 3 mcp and 99 2 bta was observed after 10 min treatment with almost complete degradation at 30 min after achieving higher mp degradation efficiency from upw the same doses were used for simultaneous arb inactivation and mp degradation in upw matrix fig 7b slightly lower mp degradation was observed after 30 min with 98 7 degradation of cbz 99 2 dcf 99 8 smx 99 7 mcp and 100 0 bta reaching the detection limit for arb data not shown in fig 7b however mp removal was not as efficient in sww as in upw approximately 80 9 mcp and 88 4 dcf were degraded while removal efficiencies for cbz smx and bta were lower than 30 during 30 min treatment fig 7c these data indicate that the reagents may have been consumed degrading dom in sww thus producing insufficient radicals to effectively degrade mps devi et al 2013 therefore each reagent concentration was doubled fe iii edds h2o2 of 0 2 0 4 0 6 mm to enhance removal efficiency with the result that degradation improved to 96 9 mcp 97 1 dcf 55 1 cbz 40 1 smx and 45 1 bta fig 7d these results suggest that the fe iii edds h2o2 dosage should be optimized to treat respective water streams taking into account the concentration of organic matter in the matrix the possible intermediates and products of these five mps were not identified in this study which warrant further studies the mp removal efficiencies are consistent with results in literature miralles cuevas et al 2014a miralles cuevas et al 2014b for example dong et al 2019a studied the degradation of three pharmaceutical micropollutants cbz crotamiton and ibuprofen in wastewater effluent using feiii nta complex the authors achieved mp degradation efficiencies of more than 92 with a combination of 0 178 mm feiii nta 1 1 4 54 mm h2o2 uva intensity of 4 05 mw cm2 and 120 min treatment a recent report also documented that 80 degradation of more than 45 mps could be achieved in real wastewater after 15 min treatment using 0 88 mm of h2o2 and 1 mm of fe iii edds in lab scale raceway pond reactors soriano molina et al 2019 in addition a previous study demonstrated that edds mediated solar fenton treatment significantly reduced the toxicity of contaminated wastewater cuervo lumbaque et al 2019 together with the previously reported data our results further confirm that the solar fenton process combined with edds may be a viable option for tertiary treatment of water containing low concentrations of pharmaceuticals it should be noted that the application of homogeneous organic chelating agents e g edds in this study may result in increased cod concentration in final treated effluent further studies should explore heterogenous systems to avoid the release of chelates in final effluent 3 5 identification of dominant reactive species in the removal of arb and mps during the modified photo fenton process the iron chelate is photolyzed under solar light and fe iii is reduced to fe ii then fe ii can further react with either edds or h2o2 the efficiency of this process mainly depends on radical species of fe iii fe ii generated during the decomplexation of fe iii edds it has been reported that several rs contribute to mp destruction garcía fernández et al 2019 miralles cuevas et al 2014b soriano molina et al 2018 but there is no information for arb inactivation six scavengers were used to confirm and distinguish the active radicals or ros involved in degrading each mp and arb in the absence of scavengers a 6 36 log reduction in arb occurred after 30 min treatment fig 8 a and five mps were degraded with 97 removal efficiency after 10 min treatment fig 8b f triethanolamine which quenches h significantly decreased the degradation of mps and the inactivation of arb thereby suggesting that h plays a dominant role in these processes the second highest scavenging activity was observed for isopropanol 1 mm which targets ho radicals in solution it has been widely stated that ho radical plays the dominant role in mp degradation in most of the fenton photo fenton and the modified fenton related systems huang et al 2013 wang et al 2019a wu et al 2014 xie et al 2020 however in this study we observed that h plays the dominant role while the ho radical is the secondary ros in addition k2cr2o7 used for quenching e had a limited effect on arb and mp removal but lower than the o2 for arb and cbz ascorbic acid also used for quenching o2 had a limited effect on arb inactivation but it significantly decreased mp degradation huang et al 2013 also estimated that 80 of the ho radicals generated were dependent on the presence of o2 while the remaining 20 of ho radicals were generated without o2 in the fe iii edds system huang et al 2013 similar behaviour observed in the current study also confirmed that o2 helped to generate oh radicals this radical may also be generated by the reaction of flavins with oxygen which further react with each other and finally form h2o2 imlay 2003 this may be beneficial for enhancing arb inactivation in the fenton or photo fenton processes h2o2 plays a key role in generating various ros arb were inactivated by h2o2 alone and also inactivated 2 71 log in the presence of solar light during 1 h treatment fig 1 to confirm the activity of h2o2 we added bovine catalase to the system and observed a significant decrease in the degradation of arb fig 8a and mps fig 8b f the scavenging effect of bovine catalase was stronger for arb than for mps the catalase results confirm that h2o2 was playing an important role in the fe edds h2o2 reaction considering the fe iii edds chelate achieved 6 36 log reduction in arb during 30 min treatment while 0 59 log arb removal efficiency was observed for the conventional fenton process after one hour treatment fig 1 it can be concluded that the presence of solar irradiation stimulates more ros generation in addition the fe iii edds complex with h2o2 may also enhance the generation of extracellular ros thus increasing the degradation of bacterial cells and mps collectively these scavenger experiments showed that efficient arb and mp degradation was a result of the combined effect of various radicals including h ho 1o2 o2 and h2o2 in photocatalytic processes the catalytic reaction is initiated with the adsorption of photons with energy above the semiconductor s band gap thus producing charge carriers electron and holes e h on the metal surface a fraction of these species can be trapped in presence of oxidant like oxygen or h2o2 and generating ros such as ho o2 and 1o2 in modified photo fenton process the hole h and hydroxyl radical ho were recognized as the dominant reactive species to degrade arb and mps fig 8a f using 1 hydroxy 3 carboxy 2 2 5 5 tetramethylpyrrolidine cph and 5 tert butoxycarbonyl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide bmpo to further confirm the generation of hole and oh radicals the epr spectra were profiled before and during solar irradiation as shown in fig s3 a a and b a no characteristic epr signals were detected in the presence of trapping agents cph and bmpo and complex fe3 edds in addition no characteristic peaks were recorded in the absence of light fig s3 a b and b b by the addition of h2o2 and light we clearly observed a three line and four line spectra with intensity ratio of 1 1 1 fig s3 a c and 1 2 2 1 fig s3 b c which is the characteristic spectrum for the adduct of cph h jia et al 2014 and bmpo oh respectively together with scavenger testing it can be confirmed that both electron hole h and hydroxyl radical oh play important roles in inactivating arb and degrading mps however the higher photoinduced holes and electrons could help to generate more ros to degrade organic pollutants the superficial holes also readily and directly oxidize organic pollutants palominos et al 2008 therefore the generated holes finally help to generate ros especially oh radical theoretically a chemical bond is formed between edds and fe iii ion by transferring the charge between the ligand and the metal xie et al 2020 in the presence of simulated solar light the electrons e excited on the metal surface will jump from the valence band to conduction band after that holes h will be generated in the valence band forming e h pairs nosaka and nosaka 2017 the generated holes can degrade hazards directly by reacting with organic matter and indirectly by generating various ros the radical ho can also be generated in water in the presence of holes h2o h h ho yan et al 2012 further epr studies will confirm whether other radicals e g 1o2 and o2 are involved in the edds modified photo fenton process 3 6 possible mechanisms for arg degradation the degradation of plasmid pwh1266 was evaluated during the studied treatment process by using afm images and qpcr data before the treatment the naked dna i e extracellular dna shows a circular form of dna molecules with the size ranging from 1600 to 2000 nm fig 9 a the changing topography was observed under different treatment time a bright band of dna persisted throughout the treatment process and aggregated dna formed lumps with an average diameter of 100 400 nm fig 9b however the dna was eventually degraded into tiny pieces after 10 min treatment fig 9c it has been documented that genes could be affected or damaged by the generated ros bjelland and seeberg 2003 cadet et al 2010 cadet and wagner 2014 depending on ros levels low levels of ros perform important cellular functions such as serving as cellular messengers in redox signalling reactions and effecting important defence responses to invading pathogens by the immune system chatterjee and walker 2017 however excessive ros could cause serious oxidative base lesions and 2 deoxyribose modifications bjelland and seeberg 2003 cadet et al 2010 chatterjee and walker 2017 the most conspicuous ros in dna degradation include ho 1o2 o2 and h2o2 chatterjee and walker 2017 which were also generated in our modified photo fenton process amongst these ros the radical oh is most reactive which is able to damage dna proteins and lipids dizdaroglu et al 1991 this radical could react with dna bases by i adding to their double bonds ii abstracting hydrogen atoms from their methyl groups and iii attacking the sugar residue in their immediate vicinity breen and murphy 1995 the generated radical oh from the modified photo fenton process could also induce an imidazole ring opening in guanine and adenine to form the fragmented purine structure formamidopyrimidine chatterjee and walker 2017 in contrast 1o2 o2 and h2o2 show a relatively low reactivity with the nucleobases and 2 deoxyribose moiety cadet et al 2012 the known reaction mediated by o2 involves the addition of c5 of highly oxidizing guanine radical gua h that arises from deprotonation of the guanine radical cation misiaszek et al 2004 in addition h2o2 is also able to undergo electrophilic addition to n1 of adenine thus giving rise to the formation of adenine n1 oxide but with a very low efficiency cadet and wagner 2014 therefore h2o2 is likely involved in the formation of various ros by fenton type reactions which also accelerate the dna degradation under the edds modified photo fenton process 4 conclusions the edds modified photo fenton process was developed to simultaneously remove arb args and mps from various water matrices at neutral ph the results demonstrated that the relative concentration of arb e arg and mps decreased to the limit of detection within 30 15 and 10 min treatment respectively with 0 1 mm fe iii 0 2 mm edds and 0 3 mm h2o2 in upw this process did not allow bacterial regrowth with 2 days incubation almost 4 0 log removal of i arg was achieved with similar reagent doses but a comparatively longer contact time 2 hour was required the removal efficiency of mps was higher in upw as compared with other matrices doubling the concentration of treatment reagents was required to remove mps from sww the high pollutant removal efficiency demonstrated in the current study is associated with the production of various ros like ho 1o2 o2 and h2o2 by the modified photo fenton process the oh radical is the dominant reactive species for both the degradation of arb and mp collectively the present study confirmed that the edds modified photo fenton process efficiently removes arb args and mps

17029,the impact of hco3 on the photodegradation of β blockers was investigated under simulated sunlight irradiation the results show that in the presence of hco3 the photodegradation rates increase significantly for sotalol sot whereas no effects on the degradation of carvedilol and arotinolol are observed using quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance spectra and degradation product determination we demonstrate that carbonate radical co3 is formed by direct oxidation of hco3 by triplet excited sot 3sot and plays a significant role in sot photodegradation competition kinetics experiments show that the three β blockers all have high second order rate constants 107 108 m 1 s 1 for the reaction with co3 however only 3sot has a higher reduction potential that can oxidize hco3 to produce co3 thus enhanced sot removal rates in the presence of hco3 were observed in addition the results show that seawater dom could increase hco3 induced photodegradation of sot whereas srnom mainly behaves as a co3 quencher and decreases the removal rate of sot the results underscore the role of hco3 in limiting the persistence of organic pollutants like sot in sunlit natural waters and especially in marine and coastal waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords β blockers photodegradation bicarbonate carbonate radical degradation products mechanisms 1 introduction β blockers belong to a group of pharmaceuticals used for the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and angina arrhythmias and myocardial infarction yi et al 2020 xu et al 2019 maszkowska et al 2014a among them sotalol sot metoprolol met carvedilol car atenolol ate and arotinolol aro are commonly used β blockers all over the world tang et al 2020 wang et al 2018a zawadzka et al 2018 it is reported that the consumption of met has been increasing year after year in china with annual consumption being 28 tons and 64 tons in 2011 and 2015 respectively maszkowska et al 2014a in germany the annual consumption of β blockers is estimated to be 100 250 tons with met and ate among the top two cleuvers 2005 in the usa β blockers are among the top 200 prescription pharmaceuticals maszkowska et al 2014b as a consequence of the high volume of usage β blockers are widely detected in surface waters worldwide in the range of ng l 1 to μg l 1 cleuvers 2005 alder et al 2010 gaw et al 2014 for example the concentrations of sot met and ate in rivers vary between 3 ng l 1 and 2 2 μg l 1 in europe and north america alder et al 2010 ate and met were detected in marine and coastal waters with concentrations up to 293 and 142 ng l 1 respectively gaw et al 2014 β blockers have been found to be harmful to different aquatic organisms such as green algae fish and invertebrates maszkowska et al 2014b khan et al 2018 santos et al 2010 however little is known about the processes controlling their fates in natural waters many studies point to the importance of photodegradation processes in the fate of organic pollutants in surface waters parker et al 2016 de laurentiis et al 2014 klimm et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the photochemical processes can be substantially impacted by the constituents of surface waters wang et al 2020 vione et al 2014 lin et al 2013 among them hco3 co3 2 are ubiquitous anions in natural waters with concentrations ranging from 0 4 to 4 4 mm lin et al 2013 huang and mabury 2000 in the ph range 7 8 which is quite common in surface water hco3 accounts for 85 97 5 of the inorganic carbon species de laurentiis et al 2014 previous studies have shown that hco3 plays important roles in the photochemical degradation of many organic pollutants for example the photodegradation of 5 fluorouracil lin et al 2013 4 chlorophenol vione et al 2009a and acetaminophen bai et al 2018 can be enhanced in the presence of nahco3 while inhibition was observed in the photodegradation of bromoxynil kochany 1992 however the exact mechanism has not been revealed therefore it is important to know the effects of hco3 on the environmental photodegradation of β blockers and to explore the mechanism in addition dissolved organic matter dom is also involved in phototransformation of organic pollutants in sunlit surface waters wang et al 2020 vione et al 2014 lin et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 on the one hand dom can act as a photosensitizer in the degradation of organic pollutants through the photochemical production of various reactive intermediates ris such as excited triplet states of dom 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh vione et al 2014 mcneill and canonica 2016 on the other hand dom can also inhibit photodegradation of organic pollutants by filtering of photochemically active light scavenging ris and limiting the net oxidation upon back reduction of the transformation intermediates of pollutants wang et al 2020 wenk et al 2011 dom derived from various sources e g freshwaters and seawaters has peculiar composition which may affect photosensitized degradation of organic pollutants wang et al 2019 2020 zhang et al 2018 however information on the possible effects of dom derived from freshwaters and seawaters on β blockers phototransformation is lacking in natural waters the reaction of hco3 co3 2 with oh is considered to be a major source of carbonate radical co3 vione et al 2009b buxton et al 1988 previous studies also showed that co3 can be produced through the reaction of hco3 co3 2 with 3dom yan et al 2019 eq 1 4 1 oh co32 oh co3 k1 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 2 oh hco3 h2o co3 k 2 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 3 3dom co3 2 dom co3 k 3 1 105 m 1 s 1 4 3dom hco3 h dom co3 k 4 9 6 103 m 1 s 1 it has been demonstrated that co3 is a powerful oxidant in the degradation of organic pollutants such as electron rich aromatic anilines and phenols and sulfur containing compounds vione et al 2014 huang and mabury 2000 yan et al 2019 meanwhile dom is the main scavenger of co3 in natural waters and its quenching effects vary depending upon the source and composition of dom vione et al 2014 hao et al 2020 carena et al 2017 therefore it is important to specify the effects of dom derived from freshwaters and seawaters on the photodegradation of β blockers in the presence of hco3 the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of hco3 and dom on the phototransformation of β blockers steady state photochemical experiments were performed for β blockers in the presence of hco3 freshwater and seawater dom were adopted to further probe the role of the dom source in the photodegradation of β blockers in pure water containing hco3 scavenging experiments were conducted to explore the roles of reactive intermediates such as co3 3dom oh and 1o2 in photodegradation co3 and oh were characterized via electron paramagnetic resonance spectra the second order rate constants of the selected β blockers with co3 were determined transformation products of β blockers were detected to elucidate the likely degradation pathways the relationship between reduction potentials of excited state β blockers and co3 formation was evaluated to acquire a better understanding of the photodegradation mechanism of β blockers in the presence of hco3 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and dom samples sources and purities of the chemicals used in this study are described in the

go round photochemical reactor xujiang electromechanical plant china with quartz tubes containing the reaction solutions a 1000 w xenon lamp with 290 nm cut off filters was used as the light source because its emission spectrum is close to that of sunlight fig s1 xenon light sources have been widely applied to simulate sunlight to investigate the photodegradation of organic pollutants scholes et al 2019 zeng and arnold 2013 the electrical energy efficiency in the system was calculated as the electrical energy per order e eo detailed in the sm a water cooling system was used to ensure a temperature of around 25 c for the irradiated solutions solutions of each β blocker 10 μm were prepared in pure water or nahco3 solutions de laurentiis et al 2014 lin et al 2013 yan et al 2019 and solutions ph was adjusted to 8 with h2so4 or naoh to eliminate the interference of ph in addition the effect of ph 6 9 on the photodegradation of sot was further investigated in the absence and presence of 2 mm hco3 the effects of the dom source on β blockers photodegradation in the presence and absence of nahco3 were investigated by addition of freshwater dom srnom and seawater dom sw dom respectively the photodegradation of β blockers was also investigated in synthetic seawater or freshwater the recipe of which is described in the sm dark controls wrapped in aluminum foil were conducted under the same irradiation conditions to clarify the contributions of co3 3dom 1o2 and oh in the photodegradation of β blockers scavenging experiments were performed using indole 50 μm as quencher of co3 larson and zepp 1988 dabco 5 mm as a quencher of 1o2 and co3 neta et al 1988 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 isoprene 10 mm as a quencher of 3dom and excited triplet states β blockers wang et al 2018b and 2 propanol ipa 100 mm as a quencher of oh and triplet states rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 benzene 3 mm was used as a probe to explore oh produced during the sot 10 μm or 100 μm photodegradation by detecting the formation of phenol huang et al 2020 chen et al 2019 the ground state 3o2 is a quencher of triplet excited species such as 3dom and pollutants triplets ryan et al 2011 erickson et al 2018 the energy transfer from excited triplet states to 3o2 leads to formation of 1o2 therefore a n2 sparging deoxygenation experiment was used to evaluate the importance of excited triplet states and 1o2 zeng and arnold 2013 2 3 determining the reaction rate constants of β blockers with co3 second order rate constants for the reaction of β blockers with co3 were measured

solutions consisting of 10 μm of a single β blocker and 10 μm ipu 250 mm na2co3 and 3 mm h2o2 were prepared the ph values of all solutions were measured to be around 11 5 the ph of direct photolysis solutions for β blockers was adjusted to 11 5 using 0 1 m h2so4 or naoh the mixture was photolyzed in a merry go round reactor equipped with a 500 w medium pressure mercury lamp surrounded by 290 nm cut off filters compared to co3 the contribution of oh was neglected in this system detailed in the sm the following equation could be used to estimate the rate of reaction of a single β blocker with

ipu respectively the measured pseudo first order degradation rate constants of β blockers were corrected by subtracting the direct photolysis rate constants of β blockers in the presence of h2o2 there is competition for lamp irradiance between h2o2 and β blockers thus the direct photolysis rate constants of β blockers were corrected for light screening by h2o2 the light screening factors and total light screening coefficients of h2o2 were calculated in the sm 2 4 epr measurements electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurements were carried out on a jes fa200 electron paramagnetic resonance

compositions and the exact masses of the molecular ions and their fragments were determined with the help of compound discoverer 2 1 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of hco3 on photodegradation of β blockers the results of the photodegradation of each β blocker sot car and aro in pure water and in 2 mm nahco3 solutions at ph 8 are shown in fig 1 a and the data obeyed pseudo first order kinetics for met and ate there was no observable degradation in either water type suggesting these two β blockers cannot undergo direct photolysis this may be due to the lack of absorbance overlap of met and ate in pure water with simulated sunlight in the 290 nm range therefore met and ate were omitted from these studies as shown in fig 1a the addition of nahco3 had almost negligible effects on the degradation of car and aro but significantly enhanced the photodegradation rate constants k obs of sot therefore sot was selected as a model compound to be employed to explore the mechanisms of hco3 in photodegradation enhancement to know whether other hco3 concentrations have similar effects on sot photodegradation further experiments were performed with varying hco3 concentrations 0 2 mm 0 5 mm 1 mm 5 mm 10 mm the results demonstrated that the photodegradation rates of sot increased with increasing hco3 concentration in the range of 0 2 5 mm when the concentration of hco3 was further increased to 10 mm a significant enhancement effect on sot photodegradation was also observed but the rate was slightly reduced compared with 5 mm hco3 fig 1b the solutions ph was adjusted to 8 prior to irradiation thus the change in solution ph because of hco3 addition was ruled out as a possible explanation for this substantial rate enhancement the photodegradation rates of sot in the ph range of natural waters ph 6 9 were subsequently investigated in pure water the direct photolysis rates of sot increased as ph increased from 6 to 9 fig 1c when 2 mm hco3 was added to the photolytic solution the photodegradation rate of sot was significantly faster than that of pure water at the same ph these results further indicate that hco3 indeed was involved in the photochemical transformation of sot 3 2 effects of dom on sot degradation in the presence and absence of hco3 dom extracted from seawater sw dom and freshwater srnom exhibits different effects on photodegradation of sot in the presence and absence of nahco3 at ph 8 no losses of sot were observed in the dark in different matrices indicating that other processes were insignificant relative to photodegradation fig s2 as seen in fig 2 compared to the photolysis of sot in pure water 0 29 0 01 h 1 sot degraded slightly faster in sw dom solutions but more slowly in srnom solutions leresche et al also reported that suwannee river fulvic acid strongly inhibited the photodegradation of sot while a slight enhancement effect for pony lake fulvic acid on sot degradation was observed with respect to pure water addition of sw dom further enhanced the degradation of sot in the presence of nahco3 1 08 0 17 h 1 which was 3 3 times faster than the degradation measured in sw dom solutions without nahco3 fig 2 nevertheless interesting results were observed when srnom was added to solutions containing nahco3 the photodegradation rate constant of sot slightly increased in the presence of srnom and nahco3 mixtures 0 32 0 03 h 1 compared to solutions with srnom alone but significantly decreased nearly 2 7 times compared to solutions with nahco3 alone fig 2 the results suggest that in the presence of srnom the enhancement of nahco3 on sot photodegradation was significantly offset this is may be due to the fact that srnom contains a high percentage of antioxidations moieties e g phenolic moieties wenk et al 2011 which act as co3 quenchers yan et al 2019 resulting in little contribution of nahco3 to the photodegradation of sot in the presence of srnom 3 3 sot photodegradation in synthetic seawater or freshwater due to the presence of hco3 in natural water bodies to evaluate the relative importance of direct and indirect photolysis of sot in natural waters other experiments were performed in synthetic seawater or freshwater with and without hco3 at ph 8 as shown in fig 3 the photodegradation rate constants of sot in seawater and freshwater were 0 32 0 01 h 1 and 0 25 0 01 h 1 respectively which are close to that in pure water indicating that sot degraded primary by direct photodegradation in seawater and freshwater when dom was added to seawater and freshwater samples the observed dom effect was consistent with that in pure water containing dom that is sw dom slightly promoted the photodegradation of sot while srnom inhibited the photodegradation different from adding dom when 2 mm hco3 was added to seawater or freshwater the photodegradation rates of sot significantly increased moreover the promotion effects were observed even when adding dom to seawater or freshwater containing 2 mm hco3 these results indicate that hco3 potentially plays a key role in the photodegradation of sot in natural water environments leresche et al 2016 found that in lake water a substantial increase in the phototransformation rate constants of sot with respect to pure water was observed we hypothesized that hco3 might contribute to substantially enhance the photodegradation of sot in the lake water ph 8 3 alkalinity 3 93 mm leresche et al 2016 since dom is not the main factor promoting the photodegradation 3 4 roles of co3 3dom 1o2 and oh in sot photodegradation a series of quencher experiments were conducted to determine the role of co3 3dom 1o2 and oh in sot photodegradation in the presence of pure water with and without sw dom and of a nahco3 solution with and without sw dom fig 4 in the presence of sot alone the addition of isoprene an excited triplet quencher decreased sot photodegradation rates while deoxygenation significantly increased the rate of transformation of sot fig 4a the results suggest that the direct photolysis of sot proceeds through an excited triplet state and 1o2 is not important if 1o2 were so important the direct photolysis of sot should be inhibited in the absence of o2 which is not the case here however the addition of dabco a 1o2 quencher significantly inhibited the photodegradation of sot fig 4a this result could suggest that sot may undergo self sensitied photo oxidation via a pathway involving 1o2 as an alternative dabco quenching the excited triplet state of sot is also a possible explanation for this result when added to a solution of sot ipa a quencher of oh or excited triplet states slightly slowed down the loss of sot indicating that oh may play a minor role in sot photodegradation to further confirm that oh was formed benzene was added into the photolytic solutions as a probe the results showed that phenol was formed during the photodegradation of 3 mm benzene and sot with concentration of 10 μm or 100 μm fig s3 indicating that although oh induced self sensitization process is not as important as other pathways it also involved in the direct photolysis of sot a possibility to account for oh formation might imply the reaction between 3sot and o2 via electron transfer which has been proved to account for the self sensitized photo oxidation of hydroxylated polyhalogenated diphenyl ethers zhang et al 2015 such a process would yield o2 h2o2 through o2 dismutation and finally oh upon h2o2 photolysis we hypothesized that co3 was responsible for the enhancement of sot photodegradation in the presence of nahco3 to investigate the co3 pathway we conducted experiments in the presence of dabco 1 7 107 m 1 s 1 and indole 4 1 106 m 1 s 1 respectively both known quenchers of co3 neta et al 1988 the addition of dabco or indole significantly decreased the photodegradation rate of sot fig 4b these results suggest that a co3 mediated process might account for sot photodegradation in nahco3 systems previous studies have demonstrated that hco3 can react with oh to generate co3 vione et al 2014 huang et al 2018 thus in the presence of sot and nahco3 co3 may be formed due to the reaction of hco3 with oh produced in sot self sensitized photo oxidation process upon addition of ipa the rate of loss was almost unchanged for sot in the presence of nahco3 fig 4b indicating that oh plays a minor role in the formation of co3 in contrast in the presence of isoprene the degradation of sot in a nahco3 system slowed down dramatically fig 4b experiments without oxygen were also performed to distinguish the contribution of 3sot and 1o2 in sot photodegradation in the presence of nahco3 the results showed that deoxygenation significantly increased the photodegradtion rate constant of sot by a factor of 21 fig 4b indicating the importance of 3sot mediated photodegradation thus co3 formation via hco3 scavenging of 3sot is expected to dominate in the sot nahco3 system under simulated sunlight liu et al 2018 have also reported that in addition to oh the triplet state of oxcarbazepine oxc also contributed to co3 formation which played a positive role in oxc degradation in uv and uv h2o2 processes while many previous studies have reported that co3 could be generated through one electron oxidation of hco3 by 3dom or 3dom proxies e g quinones and aromatic ketones under simulated sunlight yan et al 2019 canonica et al 2005 few studies have shown that co3 is produced by direct oxidation of hco3 by organic pollutants triplet species during their photodegradation in the presence of nahco3 and that it plays a significant role in organic pollutants degradation quenching experiments were also performend to evaluate the impact of dom alone on sot photodegradation since srnom mainly exhibits an inhibitory effect on sot degradation the quenching experiments were conducted in the presence of sw dom fig 4c the addition of isoprene and dabco significantly suppressed the photodegradation rates of sot fig 4c implying that 3sw dom and 1o2 seemed to dominate indirect photodegradation in sw dom solutions when added to a solution of sot and sw dom ipa slowed down slightly the loss of sot fig 4c indicating that a small contribution of oh to the indirect photodegradation of sot was operational 3 5 photodegradation mechanism epr spectra coupled with dmpo as the spin trapping agent were applied to identify the radicals generated in the sot hco3 system a control sample of sot and dmpo only in pure water at ph 8 was exposed to the simulated sunlight fig 5 a shows absence of signals in the dark control when sot dmpo was exposed to light for 15 min a four line signal ah an 14 89 g g 2 00421 was observed which is the typical spectrum of dmpooh however after light exposure for 20 min a spectrum with an intensity ratio of characteristic peaks being 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 was observed fig 5a and fig s4 this signal can be assigned to the stable paramagnetic radical 5 5 dimethyl 2 oxopyrroline n oxyl dmpox which may be formed via the oxidation of dmpo huang and huang 2009 fontmorin et al 2016 upon addition of hco3 to a solution of sot and dmpo no obvious signal was observed in the absence of light fig 5b however irradiation of such a solution for 5 min gave epr spectra containing a strong dmpooh adduct signal superimposed upon a weak signal with an 15 83 ah 22 73 and g 2 00366 these hyperfine splitting constants are close to the values reported for dmpooco2 adduct wolcott et al 1994 the dmpooco2 adduct signal became more intense than the dmpooh signal with increasing irradiation time up to 30 min fig 5b and fig s4 however in the absence of sot hco3 alone in pure water no signal was observed fig s5 therefore these results show the formation of co3 from sot hco3 under simulated sunlight the contribution from co3 mediated oxidation was related to the second order rate constants of the β blockers with co3 k co3 β blocker therefore the k co3 β blocker values were determined sot 1 6 0 2 107 m 1 s 1 car 1 9 0 2 107 m 1 s 1 aro 1 4 0 2 108 m 1 s 1 previous study has reported that the rate constant for reation of sot with co3 is 22 17 107 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 5 8 4 wols et al 2014 this value is slight higher than that determined in this study which may be due to the different experimental conditions such as ph although k co3 β blocker values of car and aro were relatively high the removal rates of these two β blockers ascribed to co3 oxidation were negligible relative to sot to account for these differences it is possible to hypothesize that the reduction potentials of the triplet excited car and aro are insufficient to oxidize hco3 to form co3 resulting in no enhancement of the degradation of these two β blockers in the presence of nahco3 relative to pure water previous studies have reported that the one electron reduction potential of co3 is 1 59 v rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 if the one electron reduction potentials of triplet excited β blockers are high enough co3 will be formed upon direct oxidation of hco3 by these triplet species in the photolysis solutions and co3 mediated photosensitized oxidation of β blockers will thus occur therefore we calculated the triplet excited reduction potentials 3 e red of the three studied β blockers table 1 the 3 e red value for 3sot is higher than the one electron reduction potential of co3 but the same is not true for 3car and 3aro our results indicate that for organic pollutants with high 3 e red that are readily oxidized by co3 the hco3 induced oxidation process has an important impact on the direct photolysis in natural waters 3 6 phototransformation intermediates to obtain further insight into the mechanism by which hco3 enhances photodegradation of β blockers phototransformation products were identified in pure water dp1 and nahco3 solutions with and without dom dp1 and dp2 table s3 the photodegradation pathways of sot in the presence of nahco3 and dom are shown in fig 6 the products were identified by analysis of the ms and ms2 spectra and by comparison with the fragmentation pathways of the parent compound fig s7 s12 the product dp1 with m h ion at m z 255 1158 was observed in all matrices as seen from table s3 and fig s7 s12 five products ions at m z 231 0690 176 1307 134 0614 133 0760 and 118 0653 were both observed in the ms2 spectra of dp1 and sot the product dp1 was proposed to form through the loss of h2o from sot which was also observed in the chlorination process of sot khalit and tay 2017 in the presence of dom sw dom or srnom a new degradation product dp2 with m h ion at m z 213 0691 was observed under simulated sunlight fig s9 s12 the dp2 is formed by the loss of the isopropyl group from dp1 3dom was proposed to react with dp1 via an electron transfer mechanism to form dp2 which was also verified for the reaction of 3dom with other amine compounds dp2 was also identified in the presence of nahco3 alone previous studies reported that co3 mediated oxidation of amine compounds could also proceed via an electron transfer mechanism chen et al 2012 2013 arnold 2014 therefore our results further demonstrated that co3 was responsible for the enhancement of photodegradation of sot when nahco3 was present in solutions with and without dom under simulated sunlight 4 conclusion in this study co3 was produced in the sot nahco3 system under simulated sunlight and had large effects on sot degradation as seen by epr and quenching experiments the relatively high reduction potential of 3sot is sufficient to oxidize hco3 to generate co3 and this radical is highly reactive towards sot with a second order rate constant of 1 6 0 2 107 m 1 s 1 moreover dom derived from seawater and freshwater exhibits different roles in hco3 induced photodegradation of sot seawater dom was found to produce a slight enhancement of sot degradation in the presence of hco3 whereas freshwater dom slowed down the transformation of sot our results indicate that in the phototransformation of organic pollutans like sot in natural waters there is a non negligible contribution of co3 produced from triplet excited pollutants and hco3 co3 2 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17029,the impact of hco3 on the photodegradation of β blockers was investigated under simulated sunlight irradiation the results show that in the presence of hco3 the photodegradation rates increase significantly for sotalol sot whereas no effects on the degradation of carvedilol and arotinolol are observed using quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance spectra and degradation product determination we demonstrate that carbonate radical co3 is formed by direct oxidation of hco3 by triplet excited sot 3sot and plays a significant role in sot photodegradation competition kinetics experiments show that the three β blockers all have high second order rate constants 107 108 m 1 s 1 for the reaction with co3 however only 3sot has a higher reduction potential that can oxidize hco3 to produce co3 thus enhanced sot removal rates in the presence of hco3 were observed in addition the results show that seawater dom could increase hco3 induced photodegradation of sot whereas srnom mainly behaves as a co3 quencher and decreases the removal rate of sot the results underscore the role of hco3 in limiting the persistence of organic pollutants like sot in sunlit natural waters and especially in marine and coastal waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords β blockers photodegradation bicarbonate carbonate radical degradation products mechanisms 1 introduction β blockers belong to a group of pharmaceuticals used for the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and angina arrhythmias and myocardial infarction yi et al 2020 xu et al 2019 maszkowska et al 2014a among them sotalol sot metoprolol met carvedilol car atenolol ate and arotinolol aro are commonly used β blockers all over the world tang et al 2020 wang et al 2018a zawadzka et al 2018 it is reported that the consumption of met has been increasing year after year in china with annual consumption being 28 tons and 64 tons in 2011 and 2015 respectively maszkowska et al 2014a in germany the annual consumption of β blockers is estimated to be 100 250 tons with met and ate among the top two cleuvers 2005 in the usa β blockers are among the top 200 prescription pharmaceuticals maszkowska et al 2014b as a consequence of the high volume of usage β blockers are widely detected in surface waters worldwide in the range of ng l 1 to μg l 1 cleuvers 2005 alder et al 2010 gaw et al 2014 for example the concentrations of sot met and ate in rivers vary between 3 ng l 1 and 2 2 μg l 1 in europe and north america alder et al 2010 ate and met were detected in marine and coastal waters with concentrations up to 293 and 142 ng l 1 respectively gaw et al 2014 β blockers have been found to be harmful to different aquatic organisms such as green algae fish and invertebrates maszkowska et al 2014b khan et al 2018 santos et al 2010 however little is known about the processes controlling their fates in natural waters many studies point to the importance of photodegradation processes in the fate of organic pollutants in surface waters parker et al 2016 de laurentiis et al 2014 klimm et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the photochemical processes can be substantially impacted by the constituents of surface waters wang et al 2020 vione et al 2014 lin et al 2013 among them hco3 co3 2 are ubiquitous anions in natural waters with concentrations ranging from 0 4 to 4 4 mm lin et al 2013 huang and mabury 2000 in the ph range 7 8 which is quite common in surface water hco3 accounts for 85 97 5 of the inorganic carbon species de laurentiis et al 2014 previous studies have shown that hco3 plays important roles in the photochemical degradation of many organic pollutants for example the photodegradation of 5 fluorouracil lin et al 2013 4 chlorophenol vione et al 2009a and acetaminophen bai et al 2018 can be enhanced in the presence of nahco3 while inhibition was observed in the photodegradation of bromoxynil kochany 1992 however the exact mechanism has not been revealed therefore it is important to know the effects of hco3 on the environmental photodegradation of β blockers and to explore the mechanism in addition dissolved organic matter dom is also involved in phototransformation of organic pollutants in sunlit surface waters wang et al 2020 vione et al 2014 lin et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 on the one hand dom can act as a photosensitizer in the degradation of organic pollutants through the photochemical production of various reactive intermediates ris such as excited triplet states of dom 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh vione et al 2014 mcneill and canonica 2016 on the other hand dom can also inhibit photodegradation of organic pollutants by filtering of photochemically active light scavenging ris and limiting the net oxidation upon back reduction of the transformation intermediates of pollutants wang et al 2020 wenk et al 2011 dom derived from various sources e g freshwaters and seawaters has peculiar composition which may affect photosensitized degradation of organic pollutants wang et al 2019 2020 zhang et al 2018 however information on the possible effects of dom derived from freshwaters and seawaters on β blockers phototransformation is lacking in natural waters the reaction of hco3 co3 2 with oh is considered to be a major source of carbonate radical co3 vione et al 2009b buxton et al 1988 previous studies also showed that co3 can be produced through the reaction of hco3 co3 2 with 3dom yan et al 2019 eq 1 4 1 oh co32 oh co3 k1 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 2 oh hco3 h2o co3 k 2 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 3 3dom co3 2 dom co3 k 3 1 105 m 1 s 1 4 3dom hco3 h dom co3 k 4 9 6 103 m 1 s 1 it has been demonstrated that co3 is a powerful oxidant in the degradation of organic pollutants such as electron rich aromatic anilines and phenols and sulfur containing compounds vione et al 2014 huang and mabury 2000 yan et al 2019 meanwhile dom is the main scavenger of co3 in natural waters and its quenching effects vary depending upon the source and composition of dom vione et al 2014 hao et al 2020 carena et al 2017 therefore it is important to specify the effects of dom derived from freshwaters and seawaters on the photodegradation of β blockers in the presence of hco3 the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of hco3 and dom on the phototransformation of β blockers steady state photochemical experiments were performed for β blockers in the presence of hco3 freshwater and seawater dom were adopted to further probe the role of the dom source in the photodegradation of β blockers in pure water containing hco3 scavenging experiments were conducted to explore the roles of reactive intermediates such as co3 3dom oh and 1o2 in photodegradation co3 and oh were characterized via electron paramagnetic resonance spectra the second order rate constants of the selected β blockers with co3 were determined transformation products of β blockers were detected to elucidate the likely degradation pathways the relationship between reduction potentials of excited state β blockers and co3 formation was evaluated to acquire a better understanding of the photodegradation mechanism of β blockers in the presence of hco3 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and dom samples sources and purities of the chemicals used in this study are described in the

go round photochemical reactor xujiang electromechanical plant china with quartz tubes containing the reaction solutions a 1000 w xenon lamp with 290 nm cut off filters was used as the light source because its emission spectrum is close to that of sunlight fig s1 xenon light sources have been widely applied to simulate sunlight to investigate the photodegradation of organic pollutants scholes et al 2019 zeng and arnold 2013 the electrical energy efficiency in the system was calculated as the electrical energy per order e eo detailed in the sm a water cooling system was used to ensure a temperature of around 25 c for the irradiated solutions solutions of each β blocker 10 μm were prepared in pure water or nahco3 solutions de laurentiis et al 2014 lin et al 2013 yan et al 2019 and solutions ph was adjusted to 8 with h2so4 or naoh to eliminate the interference of ph in addition the effect of ph 6 9 on the photodegradation of sot was further investigated in the absence and presence of 2 mm hco3 the effects of the dom source on β blockers photodegradation in the presence and absence of nahco3 were investigated by addition of freshwater dom srnom and seawater dom sw dom respectively the photodegradation of β blockers was also investigated in synthetic seawater or freshwater the recipe of which is described in the sm dark controls wrapped in aluminum foil were conducted under the same irradiation conditions to clarify the contributions of co3 3dom 1o2 and oh in the photodegradation of β blockers scavenging experiments were performed using indole 50 μm as quencher of co3 larson and zepp 1988 dabco 5 mm as a quencher of 1o2 and co3 neta et al 1988 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 isoprene 10 mm as a quencher of 3dom and excited triplet states β blockers wang et al 2018b and 2 propanol ipa 100 mm as a quencher of oh and triplet states rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 benzene 3 mm was used as a probe to explore oh produced during the sot 10 μm or 100 μm photodegradation by detecting the formation of phenol huang et al 2020 chen et al 2019 the ground state 3o2 is a quencher of triplet excited species such as 3dom and pollutants triplets ryan et al 2011 erickson et al 2018 the energy transfer from excited triplet states to 3o2 leads to formation of 1o2 therefore a n2 sparging deoxygenation experiment was used to evaluate the importance of excited triplet states and 1o2 zeng and arnold 2013 2 3 determining the reaction rate constants of β blockers with co3 second order rate constants for the reaction of β blockers with co3 were measured using photosensitizer based competition kinetics methods jasper and sedlak 2013 lian et al 2017 isoproturon ipu k co3 ipu 3 107 m 1 s 1 was used as the reference compound jasper and sedlak 2013 solutions consisting of 10 μm of a single β blocker and 10 μm ipu 250 mm na2co3 and 3 mm h2o2 were prepared the ph values of all solutions were measured to be around 11 5 the ph of direct photolysis solutions for β blockers was adjusted to 11 5 using 0 1 m h2so4 or naoh the mixture was photolyzed in a merry go round reactor equipped with a 500 w medium pressure mercury lamp surrounded by 290 nm cut off filters compared to co3 the contribution of oh was neglected in this system detailed in the sm the following equation could be used to estimate the rate of reaction of a single β blocker with co3 k co3 β blocker jasper and sedlak 2013 5 k c o 3 β b l o c ker ln β b l o c ker t β b l o c ker 0 ln i p u t i p u 0 k c o 3 i p u where β blocker and ipu are the concentrations of β blocker and ipu respectively the measured pseudo first order degradation rate constants of β blockers were corrected by subtracting the direct photolysis rate constants of β blockers in the presence of h2o2 there is competition for lamp irradiance between h2o2 and β blockers thus the direct photolysis rate constants of β blockers were corrected for light screening by h2o2 the light screening factors and total light screening coefficients of h2o2 were calculated in the sm 2 4 epr measurements electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurements were carried out on a jes fa200 electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer jeol japan 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was selected as the spin trap to capture co3 and oh by generating dmpooco2 and dmpooh adducts respectively wolcott et al 1994 zamora and villamena 2012 he et al 2014 li et al 2014 radicals were generated by irradiating samples containing 100 μm sot 100 mm nahco3 and 100 mm dmpo with a 300 w xenon lamp with 290 nm cut off filters at

compositions and the exact masses of the molecular ions and their fragments were determined with the help of compound discoverer 2 1 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of hco3 on photodegradation of β blockers the results of the photodegradation of each β blocker sot car and aro in pure water and in 2 mm nahco3 solutions at ph 8 are shown in fig 1 a and the data obeyed pseudo first order kinetics for met and ate there was no observable degradation in either water type suggesting these two β blockers cannot undergo direct photolysis this may be due to the lack of absorbance overlap of met and ate in pure water with simulated sunlight in the 290 nm range therefore met and ate were omitted from these studies as shown in fig 1a the addition of nahco3 had almost negligible effects on the degradation of car and aro but significantly enhanced the photodegradation rate constants k obs of sot therefore sot was selected as a model compound to be employed to explore the mechanisms of hco3 in photodegradation enhancement to know whether other hco3 concentrations have similar effects on sot photodegradation further experiments were performed with varying hco3 concentrations 0 2 mm 0 5 mm 1 mm 5 mm 10 mm the results demonstrated that the photodegradation rates of sot increased with increasing hco3 concentration in the range of 0 2 5 mm when the concentration of hco3 was further increased to 10 mm a significant enhancement effect on sot photodegradation was also observed but the rate was slightly reduced compared with 5 mm hco3 fig 1b the solutions ph was adjusted to 8 prior to irradiation thus the change in solution ph because of hco3 addition was ruled out as a possible explanation for this substantial rate enhancement the photodegradation rates of sot in the ph range of natural waters ph 6 9 were subsequently investigated in pure water the direct photolysis rates of sot increased as ph increased from 6 to 9 fig 1c when 2 mm hco3 was added to the photolytic solution the photodegradation rate of sot was significantly faster than that of pure water at the same ph these results further indicate that hco3 indeed was involved in the photochemical transformation of sot 3 2 effects of dom on sot degradation in the presence and absence of hco3 dom extracted from seawater sw dom and freshwater srnom exhibits different effects on photodegradation of sot in the presence and absence of nahco3 at ph 8 no losses of sot were observed in the dark in different matrices indicating that other processes were insignificant relative to photodegradation fig s2 as seen in fig 2 compared to the photolysis of sot in pure water 0 29 0 01 h 1 sot degraded slightly faster in sw dom solutions but more slowly in srnom solutions leresche et al also reported that suwannee river fulvic acid strongly inhibited the photodegradation of sot while a slight enhancement effect for pony lake fulvic acid on sot degradation was observed with respect to pure water addition of sw dom further enhanced the degradation of sot in the presence of nahco3 1 08 0 17 h 1 which was 3 3 times faster than the degradation measured in sw dom solutions without nahco3 fig 2 nevertheless interesting results were observed when srnom was added to solutions containing nahco3 the photodegradation rate constant of sot slightly increased in the presence of srnom and nahco3 mixtures 0 32 0 03 h 1 compared to solutions with srnom alone but significantly decreased nearly 2 7 times compared to solutions with nahco3 alone fig 2 the results suggest that in the presence of srnom the enhancement of nahco3 on sot photodegradation was significantly offset this is may be due to the fact that srnom contains a high percentage of antioxidations moieties e g phenolic moieties wenk et al 2011 which act as co3 quenchers yan et al 2019 resulting in little contribution of nahco3 to the photodegradation of sot in the presence of srnom 3 3 sot photodegradation in synthetic seawater or freshwater due to the presence of hco3 in natural water bodies to evaluate the relative importance of direct and indirect photolysis of sot in natural waters other experiments were performed in synthetic seawater or freshwater with and without hco3 at ph 8 as shown in fig 3 the photodegradation rate constants of sot in seawater and freshwater were 0 32 0 01 h 1 and 0 25 0 01 h 1 respectively which are close to that in pure water indicating that sot degraded primary by direct photodegradation in seawater and freshwater when dom was added to seawater and freshwater samples the observed dom effect was consistent with that in pure water containing dom that is sw dom slightly promoted the photodegradation of sot while srnom inhibited the photodegradation different from adding dom when 2 mm hco3 was added to seawater or freshwater the photodegradation rates of sot significantly increased moreover the promotion effects were observed even when adding dom to seawater or freshwater containing 2 mm hco3 these results indicate that hco3 potentially plays a key role in the photodegradation of sot in natural water environments leresche et al 2016 found that in lake water a substantial increase in the phototransformation rate constants of sot with respect to pure water was observed we hypothesized that hco3 might contribute to substantially enhance the photodegradation of sot in the lake water ph 8 3 alkalinity 3 93 mm leresche et al 2016 since dom is not the main factor promoting the photodegradation 3 4 roles of co3 3dom 1o2 and oh in sot photodegradation a series of quencher experiments were conducted to determine the role of co3 3dom 1o2 and oh in sot photodegradation in the presence of pure water with and without sw dom and of a nahco3 solution with and without sw dom fig 4 in the presence of sot alone the addition of isoprene an excited triplet quencher decreased sot photodegradation rates while deoxygenation significantly increased the rate of transformation of sot fig 4a the results suggest that the direct photolysis of sot proceeds through an excited triplet state and 1o2 is not important if 1o2 were so important the direct photolysis of sot should be inhibited in the absence of o2 which is not the case here however the addition of dabco a 1o2 quencher significantly inhibited the photodegradation of sot fig 4a this result could suggest that sot may undergo self sensitied photo oxidation via a pathway involving 1o2 as an alternative dabco quenching the excited triplet state of sot is also a possible explanation for this result when added to a solution of sot ipa a quencher of oh or excited triplet states slightly slowed down the loss of sot indicating that oh may play a minor role in sot photodegradation to further confirm that oh was formed benzene was added into the photolytic solutions as a probe the results showed that phenol was formed during the photodegradation of 3 mm benzene and sot with concentration of 10 μm or 100 μm fig s3 indicating that although oh induced self sensitization process is not as important as other pathways it also involved in the direct photolysis of sot a possibility to account for oh formation might imply the reaction between 3sot and o2 via electron transfer which has been proved to account for the self sensitized photo oxidation of hydroxylated polyhalogenated diphenyl ethers zhang et al 2015 such a process would yield o2 h2o2 through o2 dismutation and finally oh upon h2o2 photolysis we hypothesized that co3 was responsible for the enhancement of sot photodegradation in the presence of nahco3 to investigate the co3 pathway we conducted experiments in the presence of dabco 1 7 107 m 1 s 1 and indole 4 1 106 m 1 s 1 respectively both known quenchers of co3 neta et al 1988 the addition of dabco or indole significantly decreased the photodegradation rate of sot fig 4b these results suggest that a co3 mediated process might account for sot photodegradation in nahco3 systems previous studies have demonstrated that hco3 can react with oh to generate co3 vione et al 2014 huang et al 2018 thus in the presence of sot and nahco3 co3 may be formed due to the reaction of hco3 with oh produced in sot self sensitized photo oxidation process upon addition of ipa the rate of loss was almost unchanged for sot in the presence of nahco3 fig 4b indicating that oh plays a minor role in the formation of co3 in contrast in the presence of isoprene the degradation of sot in a nahco3 system slowed down dramatically fig 4b experiments without oxygen were also performed to distinguish the contribution of 3sot and 1o2 in sot photodegradation in the presence of nahco3 the results showed that deoxygenation significantly increased the photodegradtion rate constant of sot by a factor of 21 fig 4b indicating the importance of 3sot mediated photodegradation thus co3 formation via hco3 scavenging of 3sot is expected to dominate in the sot nahco3 system under simulated sunlight liu et al 2018 have also reported that in addition to oh the triplet state of oxcarbazepine oxc also contributed to co3 formation which played a positive role in oxc degradation in uv and uv h2o2 processes while many previous studies have reported that co3 could be generated through one electron oxidation of hco3 by 3dom or 3dom proxies e g quinones and aromatic ketones under simulated sunlight yan et al 2019 canonica et al 2005 few studies have shown that co3 is produced by direct oxidation of hco3 by organic pollutants triplet species during their photodegradation in the presence of nahco3 and that it plays a significant role in organic pollutants degradation quenching experiments were also performend to evaluate the impact of dom alone on sot photodegradation since srnom mainly exhibits an inhibitory effect on sot degradation the quenching experiments were conducted in the presence of sw dom fig 4c the addition of isoprene and dabco significantly suppressed the photodegradation rates of sot fig 4c implying that 3sw dom and 1o2 seemed to dominate indirect photodegradation in sw dom solutions when added to a solution of sot and sw dom ipa slowed down slightly the loss of sot fig 4c indicating that a small contribution of oh to the indirect photodegradation of sot was operational 3 5 photodegradation mechanism epr spectra coupled with dmpo as the spin trapping agent were applied to identify the radicals generated in the sot hco3 system a control sample of sot and dmpo only in pure water at ph 8 was exposed to the simulated sunlight fig 5 a shows absence of signals in the dark control when sot dmpo was exposed to light for 15 min a four line signal ah an 14 89 g g 2 00421 was observed which is the typical spectrum of dmpooh however after light exposure for 20 min a spectrum with an intensity ratio of characteristic peaks being 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 was observed fig 5a and fig s4 this signal can be assigned to the stable paramagnetic radical 5 5 dimethyl 2 oxopyrroline n oxyl dmpox which may be formed via the oxidation of dmpo huang and huang 2009 fontmorin et al 2016 upon addition of hco3 to a solution of sot and dmpo no obvious signal was observed in the absence of light fig 5b however irradiation of such a solution for 5 min gave epr spectra containing a strong dmpooh adduct signal superimposed upon a weak signal with an 15 83 ah 22 73 and g 2 00366 these hyperfine splitting constants are close to the values reported for dmpooco2 adduct wolcott et al 1994 the dmpooco2 adduct signal became more intense than the dmpooh signal with increasing irradiation time up to 30 min fig 5b and fig s4 however in the absence of sot hco3 alone in pure water no signal was observed fig s5 therefore these results show the formation of co3 from sot hco3 under simulated sunlight the contribution from co3 mediated oxidation was related to the second order rate constants of the β blockers with co3 k co3 β blocker therefore the k co3 β blocker values were determined sot 1 6 0 2 107 m 1 s 1 car 1 9 0 2 107 m 1 s 1 aro 1 4 0 2 108 m 1 s 1 previous study has reported that the rate constant for reation of sot with co3 is 22 17 107 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 5 8 4 wols et al 2014 this value is slight higher than that determined in this study which may be due to the different experimental conditions such as ph although k co3 β blocker values of car and aro were relatively high the removal rates of these two β blockers ascribed to co3 oxidation were negligible relative to sot to account for these differences it is possible to hypothesize that the reduction potentials of the triplet excited car and aro are insufficient to oxidize hco3 to form co3 resulting in no enhancement of the degradation of these two β blockers in the presence of nahco3 relative to pure water previous studies have reported that the one electron reduction potential of co3 is 1 59 v rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 if the one electron reduction potentials of triplet excited β blockers are high enough co3 will be formed upon direct oxidation of hco3 by these triplet species in the photolysis solutions and co3 mediated photosensitized oxidation of β blockers will thus occur therefore we calculated the triplet excited reduction potentials 3 e red of the three studied β blockers table 1 the 3 e red value for 3sot is higher than the one electron reduction potential of co3 but the same is not true for 3car and 3aro our results indicate that for organic pollutants with high 3 e red that are readily oxidized by co3 the hco3 induced oxidation process has an important impact on the direct photolysis in natural waters 3 6 phototransformation intermediates to obtain further insight into the mechanism by which hco3 enhances photodegradation of β blockers phototransformation products were identified in pure water dp1 and nahco3 solutions with and without dom dp1 and dp2 table s3 the photodegradation pathways of sot in the presence of nahco3 and dom are shown in fig 6 the products were identified by analysis of the ms and ms2 spectra and by comparison with the fragmentation pathways of the parent compound fig s7 s12 the product dp1 with m h ion at m z 255 1158 was observed in all matrices as seen from table s3 and fig s7 s12 five products ions at m z 231 0690 176 1307 134 0614 133 0760 and 118 0653 were both observed in the ms2 spectra of dp1 and sot the product dp1 was proposed to form through the loss of h2o from sot which was also observed in the chlorination process of sot khalit and tay 2017 in the presence of dom sw dom or srnom a new degradation product dp2 with m h ion at m z 213 0691 was observed under simulated sunlight fig s9 s12 the dp2 is formed by the loss of the isopropyl group from dp1 3dom was proposed to react with dp1 via an electron transfer mechanism to form dp2 which was also verified for the reaction of 3dom with other amine compounds dp2 was also identified in the presence of nahco3 alone previous studies reported that co3 mediated oxidation of amine compounds could also proceed via an electron transfer mechanism chen et al 2012 2013 arnold 2014 therefore our results further demonstrated that co3 was responsible for the enhancement of photodegradation of sot when nahco3 was present in solutions with and without dom under simulated sunlight 4 conclusion in this study co3 was produced in the sot nahco3 system under simulated sunlight and had large effects on sot degradation as seen by epr and quenching experiments the relatively high reduction potential of 3sot is sufficient to oxidize hco3 to generate co3 and this radical is highly reactive towards sot with a second order rate constant of 1 6 0 2 107 m 1 s 1 moreover dom derived from seawater and freshwater exhibits different roles in hco3 induced photodegradation of sot seawater dom was found to produce a slight enhancement of sot degradation in the presence of hco3 whereas freshwater dom slowed down the transformation of sot our results indicate that in the phototransformation of organic pollutans like sot in natural waters there is a non negligible contribution of co3 produced from triplet excited pollutants and hco3 co3 2 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
