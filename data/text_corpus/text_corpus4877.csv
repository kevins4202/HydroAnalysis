24385,the northeast united states atlantis model neusv2 is an end to end ecosystem model that can simulate biogeochemical ecological fishery management and socio economic processes within marine ecosystems as a major update to the original model neusv2 includes changes to the model s functional group definitions and forcing data neusv2 is the first atlantis model to use a satellite ocean color derived phytoplankton size class model that was tuned specifically for the region to force marine primary production additionally physical ocean variables currents temperature and salinity were updated using a high resolution global ocean reanalysis despite its coarse resolution neusv2 was capable of reproducing the broad spatial patterns seen in the physical and biological forcing sources with the exception of some circulation features neusv2 produced plausible zooplankton and planktivore biomass a stable lower trophic food web and recent trends in zooplankton biomass neusv2 meets calibration criteria for the persistence and long term stability of functional group biomass given the success of this new atlantis forcing approach we detail the observations and challenges regarding spatial scale related processes data assimilation and biological calibration we also discuss possible tradeoffs with model scope calibration and the availability of feedback mechanisms this neusv2 hindcast is well suited for exploring ecosystem level sensitivity to lower trophic processes and for testing alternative biogeochemical forcing further developments will improve model performance for

an end to end ecosystem model that can simulate biogeochemical ecological fishery management and socio economic processes within marine ecosystems fulton et al 2011 regional atlantis models have been used around the world to better understand a variety of regional ecosystem processes 100s 10 000s km2 involving fisheries management strategies kaplan et al 2020 nilsen et al 2020 the effects of local stressors ihde and townsend 2017 as well as regional impacts of climate change hodgson et al 2018 ortega cisneros et al 2018 atlantis hindcasts allow analyses of historical patterns and the effects of environmental drivers on marine ecosystems atlantis multi decadal projections can provide valuable strategic management tools and have been used to simulate potential outcomes of ecosystem based management strategies and the response of regional ecosystems to climate change bossier et al 2021 hansen et al 2019 ortega cisneros et al 2018 a hindcast that reproduces contemporary ecosystem conditions well is critical for building confidence in atlantis projections cheung et al 2016 the original northeast united states atlantis model neusv1 was developed to be used as tool for scenario testing and resource management throughout short term projections with a focus on higher trophic level htl processes link et al 2010 neusv1 has undergone significant change since its original publication thus designating a second iteration of the model neusv2 neusv2 resolves ecosystem processes within large 100s 10 000 km2 polygons boxes spanning the continental shelf from cape hatteras through the gulf of maine fig 1 link et al 2010 these boxes are delineated based on a variety of factors including habitat types bathymetry hydrography and fisheries management areas neusv2 simulates the growth reproduction migrations and trophic interactions of functional groups that encompass benthic and pelagic species from plankton to whales major changes since neusv1 link et al 2011 2010 include a new code base functional group definitions appendix c and new physical and biological forcing as part of this contribution neusv2 s physical ocean forcing horizontal advection temperature and salinity source was updated to the high resolution 8 3km copernicus marine service s glorys12v1 global reanalysis model cmems 2018 with vertical advection derived from nasa s eccov4 model ecco consortium 2015 furthermore neusv2 forces phytoplankton biomass with an ocean color derived phytoplankton size class model turner et al 2021 this biological forcing aims to reduce calibration needs improve the realism of lower trophic level dynamics and more accurately reflect observed trends in plankton dynamics together these new forcing changes sought to improve the biological stability of the hindcast model and allow the neusv2 hindcast to be regularly updated using continually updated forcing data neusv2 is the first atlantis model to be forced by satellite ocean color data a full description of neusv2 is beyond the scope of this work and rather we describe and evaluate here neusv2 s new forcing here we present three main objectives 1 describe overall model performance for grazing functional groups with regards to minimum performance standards 2 evaluate the ability for the neusv2 box geometry to adequately capture expected spatial and seasonal patterns observed in its original forcing sources 3 determine whether zooplankton functional groups respond to primary producer forcing through analyses of biomass time series seasonality trophic interactions and comparisons to observations we conclude with a description and interpretation of the decisions made when parameterizing neusv2 and integrating the new forcing sources 2 model description 2 1 specifications the neusv2 domain functionally identical to neusv1 contours the continental shelf to a depth of 500 m from cape hatteras through the gulf of maine fig 1 each of the 30 polygons or boxes 22 dynamic 2 islands and 6 boundary boxes contain up to four vertical layers defined by the depth bins 0 50 m 50 120 m 120 300 m and 300 500 m the deepest layer is only present in boundary boxes along the shelf break the maximum depth is uniform within a box i e flat bottoms despite true bathymetry lying above or below dynamic boxes simulate all physical chemical and biological processes boundary boxes are only used to transfer chemical and physical properties into dynamic boxes and islands possess no internal processes see appendix a supplmentary material for documentation of parameter files and model implementation neusv1 s functional groups were redefined in neusv2 to improve the model s applicability to regional fisheries by splitting out all managed and environmentally important species into their own groups neusv2 simulates 89 biological functional groups supplmentary material appendix c these represent apex predators marine mammals pelagic and benthic fish invertebrates plankton and detritus of these 59 are age structured vertebrates 4 are age structured invertebrates 23 are biomass pooled invertebrates and 3 are detrital pools model output includes biomass for all groups abundance only vertebrates at each boxes and layer and realized diets and consumption for each functional group and time step the model was run at a 24 hour time step and output every 5 days generally atlantis models have four forcing categories audzijonyte et al 2017 state variables fluxes tracer variables and time series inputs state variables are uniform throughout a box layer and include temperature salinity and vertical advection fluxes occur between the layers of two adjacent boxes faces and include horizontal advection tracer variables are optional state variables that when forced overwrite the values calculated by atlantis i e how neusv2 phytoplankton forcing is implemented time series inputs drive additional processes e g solar radiation and fisheries catch and do not overwrite any existing variables neusv2 hindcast simulation runs from 1998 to 2018 with a 33 year spin up period a repeated climatological year was generated using the mean day of year value from each forced variable s source data this climatological year was repeated annually from what would be 1964 until the annually varying forcing data starts 1993 for physics and 1998 for phytoplankton a climatology was used instead of repeating a chosen year from the forcing data to avoid outlier conditions in any particular year from creating an unreasonable equilibrium in biological groups this spin up duration is comparable to that used in other atlantis models bossier et al 2018 the spin up period ends in 1998 when all forced variables are based on their original data source i e not climatology a spin up period in atlantis allows for biological processes to reach steady state and for them to respond to the inter annual variability in the forcing 2 2 physical forcing 2 2 1 temperature and salinity within the atlantis framework there are several ways to influence functional group processes based on environmental conditions particularly temperature and ph presently in neusv2 temperature influences growth rates clearance rates and mortality of only invertebrates using a q10 temperature coefficient this functionality is planned to be incorporated and calibrated for higher trophic levels htls in further updates sensitivity to salinity is possible in atlantis models but is not yet included for any functional groups in neusv2 glorys12v1 has been used in the northeast u s continental shelf for a variety of applications including regional temperature trends bastille et al 2021 marine heat waves schlegel et al 2021 and bottom temperature forecasting cai et al 2021 daily temperature salinity and horizontal advection were obtained from glorys12v1 global ocean reanalysis cmems 2018 this product has a gridded 8 km horizontal resolution up to 50 fixed vertical depth bins and extends from 1993 to 2018 a horizontal spatial mapping was used to assign the center point of each glorys12v1 grid cell to an atlantis box within each glorys12v1 cell depth bins were assigned a corresponding neusv2 depth layer glorys12v1 depth bins extending deeper than corresponding neusv2 boxes were excluded within each atlantis box layer combination a weighted mean by cell area was taken for all glorys12v1 cells within a given box i e horizontal aggregation then a weighted mean of all glorys12v1 layers corresponding to each neusv2 layer was calculated i e vertical aggregation using the proportion that each glorys12v1 layer occupies a neusv2 layer as weights the result was a single value per box layer and day 2 2 2 horizontal advection in atlantis horizontal transport acts orthogonally to the vertical plane between two boxes i e faces the neusv2 faces are defined as rhumb lines between two box vertices for all glorys12v1 cells intersecting a neusv2 face a mean east west u and north south v component of horizontal advection was computed at each glorys12v1 depth bin then as above glorys12v1 depth bins were mapped to neusv2 layers and a weighted mean was used to aggregate vertically ensuring a single flux per face per day for each glorys12v1 cell the magnitude of the horizontal velocity v z for a layer z was defined as v z u z 2 v z 2 with an associated flux angle θ defined as θ t a n 1 v u the relative angle ψ between the face and the velocity vector was calculated as ψ t a n 1 s i n θ φ c o s θ φ where φ is the angle of the face the cross sectional area of the face a was calculated as a l δ z where l is the length of the face and δ z is the depth of the neusv2 layer finally the flux relative to each face f was calculated as f c o s ψ π 2 a v z where the sign is dependent on the user defined directionality of each atlantis face 2 2 3 vertical advection atlantis requires vertical advection as part of its physical forcing routines since daily vertical advection is not provided by glorys12v1 output vertical advection was obtained from nasa s eccov4 ecco consortium 2015 eccov4 has a similar horizontal resolution to neusv2 1 and provides vertical advection on a monthly interval in general atlantis boxes possess uniform vertical advection throughout so only seasonality and larger scale spatial patterns are relevant all neusv2 boxes were mapped to eccov4 cells using spatial overlap or if eccov4 cell center points lay within 25 km of a box edge the same vertical assignment and aggregation methods used for glorys12v1 state variables were used for each box layer a daily interpolation of vertical advection was generated from monthly values using a kernel regression smoother a normal distribution kernel and a bandwidth of 15 days horizontal and vertical advection arrays were then run through a separate atlantis program hydroconstruct this program performs mass balance and hyperdiffusion corrections on horizontal advection it also translates box level vertical velocities into actual box layer exchanges and reconciles horizontal and vertical flows audzijonyte et al 2017 2 4 biological forcing generally atlantis possesses a primary production sub model that utilizes biological parameterization physical forcing trophic interactions and biogeochemical processes to simulate phytoplankton growth and mortality when using this sub model phytoplankton biomass is heavily influenced by parameter choice and requires extensive calibration given that the primary scope of neusv2 is simulating higher trophic levels on regional scales upscaling a higher resolution model to replicate large scale patterns is sufficient forcing phytoplankton biomass was anticipated to establish a baseline level of primary production provide bottom up controls on higher trophic levels and drive seasonal patterns in zooplankton these effects were thought to create a stable simulated food web ensure a correct scale of system wide energy input and allow for a unidirectional bottom up calibration strategy atlantis biological forcing only operates on functional group biomass so phytoplankton biomass was chosen over net primary production as the focal metric neusv2 phytoplankton size classes derived from ocean color remote sensing were mapped to neusv2 s phytoplankton functional groups diatoms dinoflagellates and picophytoplankton daily ocean color data 1998 2018 were obtained from the european space agency s ocean color climate change initiative oc cci version 4 2 sathyendranath et al 2020 which provides global estimates of chlorophyll a concentration at a 4 km2 horizontal resolution sathyendranath et al 2019 additional daily sea surface temperature sst data needed to estimate the phytoplankton size class include the 4 km nighttime noaa advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr pathfinder avhrr pathfinder version 5 3 2018 casey et al 2010 and the group for high resolution sea surface temperature ghrsst multiscale ultrahigh resolution mur version 4 1 level 4 data chin et al 2017 jpl mur measures 2015 the avhrr pathfinder data are used as the sst source until 2002 and mur in subsequent years comparisons to in situ measurements show a relatively low bias in the phytoplankton size class estimates with a bias of 0 04 and 0 08 mg chl a m 3 for micro and combined pico and nano phytoplankton respectively turner et al 2021 neusv2 uses the phytoplankton size class model to estimate the amount of chlorophyll a chl a associated with the micro 20 μm nano 2 20 μm and picophytoplankton 2 μm size classes turner et al 2021 an 8 day moving average was used to reduce data gaps caused by cloud cover after which each box had only 7 to 14 days of missing data per year on average a cubic spline function was used to temporally interpolate time series within each box at each time step the median of all pixels within each neusv2 box was used for each phytoplankton variable the median was chosen to avoid the overrepresentation of dynamics of small portions of a box i e preventing high local primary production from extending across the entire region as boxes are intended to represent larger scale patterns the phytoplankton size class data are a near surface two dimensional product that provides chl a in each cell aggregated over the first optical depth with primary production estimates integrated over the euphotic depth whereas neusv2 can simulate phytoplankton in each of the vertical layers the euphotic depth derived from the morel and berthon 1989 model showed that the median daily euphotic depth across all neusv2 boxes was 41 2 m thus all forced phytoplankton biomass was assigned to the fixed depth neusv2 surface layer 0 50m satellite phytoplankton size class estimates were then transformed into neusv2 s predetermined phytoplankton functional groups the satellite derived microphytoplankton was assumed to be a combination of diatoms and dinoflagellates to differentiate these functional groups we estimated the diatom fraction from the global hirata et al 2011 phytoplankton functional type model derived from the same oc cci data as the turner et al 2021 data the remainder of microphytoplankton were assigned to dinoflagellates this proportion was calculated as a day of year median of each 4km cell from 1998 to 2019 and applied across all years diatom proportions differed by box as well as seasonally with a mean of 0 89 0 07 sd the sum of the satellite derived nano and picophytoplankton were assigned to the neusv2 picophytoplankton functional group this picophytoplankton group in neusv2 is actually a small phytoplankton group distinguished primarily by their smaller size slower sinking rate and higher consumption by microzooplankton the neusv2 chlorophyll to nitrogen conversion factor of 7 was used to convert the chlorophyll units from mg m 3 of chl a to the atlantis required units of mg n m 3 and was derived from a chl a carbon range of 27 67 riemann et al 1989 with a redfield c n of 7 3 analysis the following analyses are aligned with the three main objectives of the paper first we assess neusv2 s performance relative to our calibration criteria second we quantify the bias in hydrographic and satellite forcing datasets after upscaling to the neusv2 box structure lastly we analyze the spatial patterns of zooplankton herbivorous benthos and planktivorous fish groups to ensure these groups are responding realistically to forced primary producers additional work regarding further calibration of higher trophic levels a comprehensive model skill assessment and sensitivity analyses are ongoing and outside the scope of this study 3 1 calibration criteria we used two minimum performance standards to evaluate biomass time series of functional groups based on guidelines suggested by kaplan and marshall 2016 the first criteria persistence was that no functional groups go extinct during the hindcast by maintaining a domain wide biomass above 10 of the starting biomass this criterion ensures that simulated diets are roughly balanced and that recruitment and growth parameterizations can sustain each population the second criterion stability was that no functional group s domain wide biomass time series possessed a relative rate of change of 5 per year or greater over the last 20 years of the simulation ensuring a baseline level of time series stability and that no functional groups are exhibiting extreme population growth both calibration criteria thresholds were based on analyses of noaa s stock smart assessment database noaa fisheries 2022 biomass time series were obtained for all neusv2 species available in noaa s stock smart stock assessment database noaa fisheries 2022 the minimum of each species biomass relativized to the earliest year was used as the threshold for persistence where the median across all species was 14 of initial biomass stock smart species relativized biomass from 1998 to 2018 after a linear regression showed a median slope across species of 4 per year 3 2 upscaling assessment for the glorys12v1 temperature and salinity as well as the satellite phytoplankton biomass a mean daily bias was calculated to determine whether neusv2 forcing was representative of the original high resolution forcing source for each neusv2 box layer and day the box wide neusv2 value was subtracted from each forcing product cell s value the mean of all cell level biases were calculated to obtain a daily mean bias for each neusv2 box and layer for each box variable temperature salinity and phytoplankton biomass a two way anova was performed bias box season to determine whether significant differences in mean bias were present in atlantis horizontal advection acts across all box faces simultaneously at each time step and represents the net flux of all transport across the faces adjoining any two boxes even though phytoplankton are forced in neusv2 they are not influenced by circulation but circulation still determines the flow of nutrients to characterize broad circulation patterns net transport was aggregated over all faces adjoining each pair of boxes then converted to a mean daily flow speed v for each layer of each box pair whereby v t l z where t is the net transport between boxes l is the total length of all faces that adjoin the boxes and z is the depth of that given layer then semi quantitative comparisons of specific circulation features were used to determine the translation of the upscaled circulation a daily mean bias in flow speed was also calculated on each neusv2 face using similar methods to that described for box wide variables instead only glorys12v1 cells that intersect each neusv2 face were used in calculations a two way anova was used bias face season to identify spatial and temporal differences in flow bias 3 3 spatiotemporal patterns in output neusv2 box variable outputs were aggregated over the northeast fishery science center s ecological production units epus fig 1 bastille et al 2021 the mid atlantic bight mab georges bank gb and the gulf of maine gom these regional assignments allowed for comparisons to regional reports and a more intuitive interpretation of regional oceanographic and ecological patterns most further references to biomass outputs will be presented as aggregations by epu to account for differences in epu size pelagic group biomass was standardized by box volume and epibenthic biomass was standardized by box area in some cases the 5 day output was temporally aggregated as seasonal means and defined as winter january march spring april june summer july september and fall october december further analyses of neusv2 s functional groups were constrained to only functional groups interacting with forced phytoplankton zooplankton benthos and planktivores neusv2 has three zooplankton size classes microzooplankton mesozooplankton and macrozooplankton benthos and planktivore are aggregated categories that are composed of 9 and 7 true neusv2 functional groups respectively table 1 and are combined for illustrative purposes only time series decomposition was used to isolate seasonality in functional group biomass output this method allows for a clearer understanding of when seasonal events occur and the relative timing of groups seasonal cycles a multiple seasonal trend decomposition using loess mstl algorithm was applied to monthly and epu aggregated biomass of each functional group output using the mstl function from the r package forecast v8 13 hyndman and khandakar 2008 this function uses loess smoothing to extract repeating seasonal cycles from the time series a standardized seasonality index was constructed as the monthly mean seasonality divided by the time series standard deviation to compare seasonal cycles of groups with different intra annual variances the coastal and ocean plankton ecology production and observation database copepod moriarty and o brien 2013 provides total carbon mass mg c m 3 as a gridded monthly product aggregated over several years of data and was used as a reference point for evaluating neusv2 zooplankton the copepod grid was mapped to the neusv2 epus and a seasonal mean concentration was calculated the mean seasonal neusv2 zooplankton concentration was calculated from the sum of all three neusv2 zooplankton size classes and converted to carbon using atlantis redfield ratio then the ratio of copepod to neusv2 biomass concentration was calculated copepod is a multi year aggregated product and does not provide zooplankton size distributions so neusv2 values within an order of magnitude were considered similar 3 4 forced phytoplankton interactions to determine how much primary producer biomass transferred to pelagic and benthic food webs the consumed biomass c of each phytoplankton group p by each grazer g was calculated as c g p p g p e g where eg is the total consumed biomass of each predator and pg p is the mean proportion of each predator s diet that constitutes phytoplankton group p then the proportion of each phytoplankton group biomass consumed pp was calculated p p g c g p b p where bp is the total biomass of phytoplankton group p the relative contribution of each grazer to the consumption of phytoplankton p gg p was calculated g g p c g p g c g p c p and g were calculated on each 5 day time step the phytoplankton deposition to sediments is not tracked explicitly within atlantis outputs to estimate it a theoretical passive deposition flux was calculated for each phytoplankton group in atlantis the biomass flux of sinking phytoplankton fp from one box layer to the one below is calculated as f p c p w p a where wp is the sinking velocity of phytoplankton and a is the horizontal area of the box thus the proportion of each phytoplankton sinking from any given pelagic layer dbox p can be calculated as d b o x p f p c p v w p z b o x where v is the box volume and zbox is the depth of the pelagic layer 4 results 4 1 upscaling assessment 4 1 1 physical forcing neusv2 was able to reproduce many of the region s broad circulation characteristics observed in glorys12v1 figure 2 given that neusv2 uses only 151 faces to define circulation it was not expected that neusv2 could reproduce small scale circulation patterns but rather the general circulation patterns of the region additionally verifying broad circulation patterns ensures that nutrients detrital pools and passively transported functional groups behave realistically in the mid atlantic bight mab cross shelf faces correctly showed a southwestern surface flow figure 2 label 1 of 2 to 6 cm s 1 which was consistent with observations lentz 2008 surface horizontal fluxes were most variable in spring 1 58 cm s 1 sd and least in summer 1 44 cm s 1 sd large northward flows in the southern mab while not offshore enough to be caused by the gulf stream frankignoul et al 2001 were cause by strong northward flow components where the gulf stream separates from the coastline in those few glorys cells bias in mean flow speed figure s1 did not vary by season anova p 0 46 but differed between faces anova p 0 001 flow bias was generally higher in the southern mab faces and around nantucket shoals and low throughout the gulf of maine gom neusv2 correctly captured the anti cyclonic surface circulation in georges bank gb figure 2 label 4 pettigrew et al 2005 but not the cyclonic flows in the gom figure 2 label 5 gom surface and slope water correctly flowed northwest through the scotian shelf and the northeast channel nec figure 2 label 3 and southwest within the great south channel figure 2 label 2 brooks 1985 in the nec a deep water counter current is present zhang et al 2019 which was not possible to reproduce given the resolution of neusv2 but could explain the southeast flow in neusv2 s bottom nec box layer overall the dominant flows in and out of the neusv2 domain were adequately captured ensuring that planktonic functional groups and nutrients were not being flushed from the system the influence of circulation on phytoplankton is already captured in the satellite data so any further discrepancies in neusv2 s circulation should not strongly influence lower trophic level dynamics the box geometry of neusv2 allowed for a better approximation of the glorys12v1 temperature figure 3 and salinity figure 4 patterns than it does for circulation as boxes are based largely on bathymetric features the expectation was that neusv2 s box geometry and the upscaling process did not inhibit its ability to resolve seasonal patterns and spatial patterns at scales at or larger than its boxes neusv2 s surface layer 0 50m resolved the cross shelf temperature gradient in the mab spring and fall in glorys12v1 as well as the latitudinal temperature gradient in all seasons figure 3 strong latitudinal gradients in the mab and shelf break boxes resulted in divergent patterns of bias where bias was higher in the south and lower in the north of each box in contrast central gom and northern gb boxes had a narrower temperature distribution resulting lower bias boxes in the gom had similar temperature bias but significant differences between boxes were present overall anova p 0 001 the southern mab boxes had more negative temperature biases neusv2 correctly reproduced the lower spatial variation in salinity from glorys12v1 figures 4 as well as the decreasing salinity gradient from offshore to inshore mean box wide mean salinity bias was small 0 02 to 0 005 and differed between boxes figure 5 anova p 0 001 as with temperature salinity bias was lowest in the gom and gb boxes with significantly more negative bias in the southern mab at all depth levels patterns of within box bias were mainly driven by cross shelf gradients as opposed to latitudinal gradients with temperature overall temperature and salinity bias was sufficiently low for the purpose of reproducing the large scale processes necessary for neusv2 4 1 2 biological forcing neusv2 boxes resolved much of the spatial and seasonal variation in surface chl a in the satellite data figure 6 furthermore neusv2 correctly reproduced higher chl a within nearshore boxes and within gb and lower chl a offshore and in the central gom the elevated chl a observed over nantucket shoals and over gb was dampened in neusv2 since those features were split by multiple boxes and spatially averaged with lower chl a areas figure 6 generally upscaling resulted in a damping of the intensity of elevated chl a regions all neusv2 phytoplankton size classes showed similar overall patterns as total chl a with higher concentrations nearshore and over gb as in the satellite data the mean seasonal concentration of diatoms was about 9 times higher than dinoflagellates and the ratio of diatoms to picophytoplankton varied seasonally with a maximum of 7 5 in winter and a minimum of 7 10 in summer analyses of bias in size class chl a concentration showed the presence of significant box differences anova p 0 001 patterns in phytoplankton size class bias figure 7 showed similar levels of bias in offshore and deeper water boxes the spatial heterogeneity in concentration within nearshore boxes resulted in significant differences in bias 4 2 spatial and temporal patterns 4 2 1 phytoplankton and zooplankton the seasonality of the satellite phytoplankton data was not affected by the upscaling process diatoms were the dominant phytoplankton group in gb and the gom but were in equal proportion to picophytoplankton in the mab figure 8 table 1 diatoms bloomed in spring in all regions and fall in the mab dinoflagellate blooms occurred in spring and fall in all regions picophytoplankton blooms occurred in summer and fall in gb and the gom while blooms occurred in spring and fall in the mab zooplankton composition differed between the three regions where micro meso and macrozooplankton were relatively prominent in gb the mab and the gom respectively but all zooplankton groups maintained robust fractions in all regions figure 8 table 1 both meso and macrozooplankton required 10 to 20 model years to reach a stable biomass with mesozooplankton stabilized at a mean biomass between 1 9 and 3 1 starting biomass and macrozooplankton stabilized at 4 times starting biomass due to data limitations zooplankton initial conditions are uncertain and may not necessarily represent the target biomass for contemporary conditions microzooplankton were strongly coupled to picophytoplankton through diet interactions resulting in an indirect coupling of macro and mesozooplankton to picophytoplankton through their diet interactions microzooplankton biomass peaks in the fall in all epus just after picophytoplankton blooms figure 9 neusv2 zooplankton were comparable to that in the copepod dataset winter concentrations in neusv2 were higher 1 4 to 1 7 times than copepod with a more similarity 1 to 1 9 times in the other seasons similarity between copepod and neusv2 zooplankton did not consistently relate to ecological production unit epu figure s2 where no single epu provided a better estimate of copepod across seasons neusv2 zooplankton have a predefined vertical and horizontal distributions so discrepancies were not caused by behavior but possibly due to the poor sampling coverage the copepod during those months n 1 121 in winter compared to n 2 481 in spring copepod may also underestimate microzooplankton due to larger mesh size selectivity from this assessment neusv2 provided a reasonable approximation well within an order of magnitude of zooplankton biomass the seasonal decomposition of biomass time series for each functional group showed a clear succession of zooplankton groups within a year figure 9 in all epus a bloom of microzooplankton occured after a rise in picophytoplankton and mesozooplankton responded to either the micro zooplankton blooms gb and mab or the fall diatom bloom gom figure 8 in all regions zooplankton groups appeared less responsive to the spring phytoplankton blooms either due to top down control by planktivores in the spring or the strong coupling between microzooplankton and picophytoplankton 4 2 2 planktivores and benthos planktivore species spatial distribution was directly specified figure s3 but community composition emerges in part from the spatial distributions and abundance of predators and prey the majority of neusv2 s planktivore biomass was attributable to atlantic herring clupea harengus atlantic menhaden brevoortia tyrannus atlantic mackerel scomber scombrus and butterfish peprilus triacanthus table 1 the mean annual biomass for these dominant planktivore species after spin up was within 0 5 to 2 times available assessment data with the exception of butterfish 5 4 times higher in neusv2 planktivores primarily consumed diatoms and zooplankton planktivore consumption uses a hollings type ii functional response with an availability parameter for each prey such that trophic interactions are higher with increased spatial overlap with prey as such elevated mesozooplankton biomass in the gom were likely the result of lower planktivores biomass compared to other regions figure 8 additionally neusv2 planktivore species spawning using a bevorton holt parameterization occurs on predetermined dates each year so seasonal cycles in biomass are not emergent properties the benthos functional groups exhibited negligible seasonal patterns and showed a steady increase in biomass within the mab and a decrease in gb figure 8 gom benthos biomass stabilized early in the simulation on a domain wide scale benthos species biomass fell within the 5 annual threshold thus passing the stability criteria for epibenthic filter feeders ocean quahogs artica islandica atlantic sea scallops placopecten magellanicus and atlantic surfclam spisula solidissima the post spin up neusv2 biomass was within 0 5 to 3 8 times assessment data benthos species in neusv2 despite being large consumers of deposited phytoplankton did not show the seasonal responsiveness as seen in zooplankton likely due to the temporal lag between surface production and deposition 4 3 grazing the average daily consumption cp of diatoms dinoflagellates and picophytoplankton by all grazers was 5 9 9 and 15 6 respectively unconsumed phytoplankton either remained in the surface layer until they are overwritten by the next time step s forcing sank or mixed into deeper pelagic layers deposited into the sediment layer or lysed and are converted into detrital pools neusv2 does not classify deposited phytoplankton as detritus until they are consumed but still may appear as a dominant food source in the sediments thus consumption of phytoplankton by in sediment benthos in neusv2 should be considered detritivory i e consuming dead plant matter rather than grazing on live phytoplankton a box level mean of 0 5 of diatoms and 0 3 of dinoflagellates are deposited dbox p from the deepest pelagic layer at each time step picophytoplankton are not parameterized to sink in neusv2 due to their small size these deposition rates were low enough to ensure minimal accumulation of inactive phytoplankton in the benthos in most boxes much of the benthic invertebrate diets consisted of deposited phytoplankton which constituted 92 of consumption of phytoplankton live and dead on average benthic grazers consumed 90 of the passively deposited diatoms in the pelagic food web 56 of diatoms consumption was performed by zooplankton and 43 by planktivores table 2 nearly all pelagic picophytoplankton consumption was performed by microzooplankton which was the intentional result of gape size limitations of planktivore groups and a simplified lower trophic food web the amount of grazing attributable to each function group was consistent over time with only slight seasonal fluctuations 5 discussion to our knowledge neusv2 is the first atlantis model to successfully force primary production with ocean color data as such we feel a description of the observations and hurdles involved in these new methods would be beneficial to other modelers these lessons learned can be found in the supplementary material 5 1 model performance all neusv2 phytoplankton zooplankton planktivore and benthic functional groups met our baseline calibration criteria of persistence and time series stability with the exception of sea scallops which had a relative increase of 7 per year since phytoplankton were forced it was critical that zooplankton and planktivore groups mirrored observed behavior in order to ensure that primary production was distributed throughout the simulated food web temporal analyses of northeast shelf zooplankton communities suggest a shift in community composition occurring around 2010 morse et al 2017 and while individual zooplankton species are not resolved a breakpoint analysis of neusv2 total zooplankton biomass time series shows a change in time series slope in 2013 the general agreement between neusv2 and copepod s total zooplankton carbon mass indicates that neusv2 was capable of reproducing a plausible zooplankton population biomass however copepod does not possess the spatial or temporal resolution required to perform a statistical comparison a potential source of error in zooplankton biomass may result from the error inherent in the phytoplankton forcing turner et al 2021 describe a correlation coefficient absolute bias between in situ and modeled of 0 7 0 04 for micro phytoplankton concentrations and 0 58 0 08 for nano and pico phytoplankton this bias represents about 10 of typical diatom and picophytoplankton concentrations in neusv2 suggesting low impact of model results due to their small size and pelagic distribution the planktivores simulated in neusv2 are not as well sampled compared to demersal species in regional trawl surveys resulting in a high degree of uncertainty regarding population level biomass however planktivore species assessment biomass estimates from the noaa stock smart database show that neusv2 values well within an order of magnitude of assessment as additional aspects of higher trophic level calibration are outside the scope of this study we deem planktivores to be at an acceptable level possible causes for discrepancies with assessment data are the inclusion of juveniles in neusv2 species biomass as well as errors derived from growth and recruitment parameters anecdotally we observed that during calibration there was a strong coupling between macrozooplankton biomass and the equilibrium biomass for herring and mackerel despite some inconsistencies between simulated planktivores and assessments it is clear that the forced primary production is being transferred into higher trophic levels in the pelagic food web through zooplankton and not entirely dependent on benthic grazers i e some alternative stable state 5 2 model configuration one eventual goal of neusv2 is to develop ecosystem level projections under different climate and management scenarios thus it is important that neusv2 reproduces ecosystem processes on the spatial and temporal scales relevant for this goal a notable tradeoff in atlantis model design is between the scope of the simulated processes and the scale that those processes can be practically resolved link et al 2010 this tradeoff is evident in neusv2 s box definitions and the translation of forcing data atlantis models generally define box geometry based on bathymetry with partial consideration of regional habitat types biological communities fisheries independent survey strata and fisheries management areas as such neusv2 is intentionally not designed to capture fine details of physical processes and its box geometry has been left relatively unchanged since neusv1 circulation was particularly difficult to capture due neusv2 s relatively few number of faces and neusv2 captured circulation best when faces were arranged perpendicular to major currents one method for improving neusv2 s ability to capture more circulation features would be to increase the number of simulated boxes yet this would result in a large increase in run time audzijonyte et al 2017 thus it is unlikely that any slight increase in box count with no other changes would improve neusv2 s ability to simulate higher trophic levels and improve its applicability to management additionally neusv2 s simulated food web is less reliant on horizontal advection than other atlantis models with dynamic primary production since forced phytoplankton are not influenced by nutrient fluxes and other state variables temperature and salinity the coarse vertical resolution of neusv2 also had unexpected consequences on biological processes single layer boxes result in equal access to phytoplankton for both pelagic and epibenthic grazers to prevent the forced phytoplankton from subsidizing the epibenthos the clearance rates and availability of phytoplankton to epibenthic filter feeders were reduced below what would be typically observed though if reduced too greatly bivalve filter feeders may shift to detritus dominated diets when faced with limited access to phytoplankton and while some of the region s shellfish consume detritus munroe et al 2013 the majority of their consumption should be phytoplankton both et al 2020 cranford and grant 1990 we recommend a careful assessment of the dynamics on any single layer boxes and a contextual evaluation of whether a two layer box i e a separate benthic boundary and euphotic layer would be a better alternative 5 3 consequences of phytoplankton forcing phytoplankton forcing in atlantis results in a one way coupling between the satellite derived size class product and neusv2 as a consequence at each time step biomass values are entirely overwritten regardless of the intermediate grazing the result is that even when grazing is high local depletions in phytoplankton do not persist into further time steps the goal of proper calibration is then to replicate the magnitude and seasonality of in situ grazing present at the time of satellite measurements despite the lack of bottom up feedbacks on zooplankton groups in end to end ecosystem models zooplankton act as a bridge between biogeochemistry and higher trophic levels htls rose et al 2010 and allowing two way feedbacks between htls and zooplankton can be essential for obtaining realistic htl population dynamics holt et al 2014 travers et al 2009 atlantis models typically simulate all lower trophic level ltl dynamics including the underlying biogeochemistry only requiring physical forcing fulton et al 2005 but only at the coarse resolution of large boxes despite neusv2 breaking the bidirectional feedbacks between phytoplankton and zooplankton it retains two way interactions between zooplankton and htls integrating the higher resolution satellite products instead of using atlantis traditional primary producer dynamics provides neusv2 with information on smaller scale phytoplankton processes i e coastal and upwelling effects as well as drives seasonality in ltl processes at the expense of phytoplankton zooplankton coupling given that that the ultimate objective of neusv2 is to inform htl resource management this tradeoff does not reduce the applicability of neusv2 due to the one directional phytoplankton zooplankton interactions and data limitations grazers in neusv2 rarely experience food limitation even when competition is high without careful tuning of clearance and growth rates forced primary producers can effectively subsidize grazer production resulting in unrealistically high population biomass to compensate for the lack of bottom up control on zooplankton a quadratic mortality term was applied for all zooplankton functional groups quadratic mortality in zooplankton typically represents intra guild consumption mitra et al 2014 ohman et al 2002 but also acts as a top down control on zooplankton biomass and ultimately grazing the result was more stable biomass time series with the tradeoff of potentially losing some responsiveness to bottom up signals kearney et al 2012 though top down controls are built into the phytoplankton forcing they are independent from neusv2 dynamics this works well for an atlantis hindcast as the forced phytoplankton act as a historical driver for the system however if the model was run as a projection different phytoplankton forcing sources would need to be incorporated past the present day in this case neusv2 would have to be coupled to a comparable regional biogeochemical model projection drenkard et al 2021 6 conclusions one of the major goals of neusv2 was to integrate existing data products in order to both ensure that critical patterns in environmental variables and primary production were captured and to build a foundation for the simulated ecosystem that would allow for comparisons to regional fisheries management and assessments we have found that the coarse resolution of neusv2 adequately captures seasonal and spatial characteristics of high resolution glorys12v1 temperature and salinity as well as the high resolution ocean color derived phytoplankton size classes this new phytoplankton forcing method allowed for a simplified bottom up calibration strategy and drove the seasonality of the simulated ecosystem with forced phytoplankton neusv2 was capable of reproducing plausible population sizes of zooplankton and planktivores despite removing the bi directional feedback between phytoplankton and zooplankton neusv2 planktivores and other higher trophic levels htls were able to respond to zooplankton dynamics overall we recommend this forcing method for other atlantis models if high model skill is required for lower trophic or nutrient processes calibrating atlantis internal biogeochemical processes or coupling atlantis to a nutrient phytoplankton and zooplankton npz model may be more appropriate kearney et al 2012 stock et al 2014 atlantis lower trophic level sub models are comprehensive enough to capture essential dynamics within the system fulton et al 2005 travers et al 2007 but operate on a much coarser resolution than other more specialized npz model products additionally global parameters and a coarse resolution necessitate that atlantis models should have non tactical objectives fulton 2010 even if an upscaled regionally tuned npz model is used forcing phytoplankton with an observation based product will require additional coupling to other biogeochemical simulations to run neusv2 as a projection while additional features are needed in order for neusv2 to be used directly as a strategic management tool e g improve realism in socio economics and htl dynamics it is well suited for exploring ecosystem level impacts to changes in functional group biomass fishing pressure and life history parameters with regards to community composition and population dynamics neusv2 also provides a hypothesis testing framework for ecological indicators ecological sensitivity

consortium 2015 furthermore neusv2 forces phytoplankton biomass with an ocean color derived phytoplankton size class model turner et al 2021 this biological forcing aims to reduce calibration needs improve the realism of lower trophic level dynamics and more accurately reflect observed trends in plankton dynamics together these new forcing changes sought to improve the biological stability of the hindcast model and allow the neusv2 hindcast to be regularly updated using continually updated forcing data neusv2 is the first atlantis model to be forced by satellite ocean color data a full description of neusv2 is beyond the scope of this work and rather we describe and evaluate here neusv2 s new forcing here we present three main objectives 1 describe overall model performance for grazing functional groups with regards to minimum performance standards 2 evaluate the ability for the neusv2 box geometry to adequately capture expected spatial and seasonal patterns observed in its original forcing sources 3 determine whether zooplankton functional groups respond to primary producer forcing through analyses of biomass time series seasonality trophic interactions and comparisons

temperature salinity and vertical advection fluxes occur between the layers of two adjacent boxes faces and include horizontal advection tracer variables are optional state variables that when forced overwrite the values calculated by atlantis i e how neusv2 phytoplankton forcing is implemented time series inputs drive additional processes e g solar radiation and fisheries catch and do not overwrite any existing variables neusv2 hindcast simulation runs from 1998 to 2018 with a 33 year spin up period a repeated climatological year was generated using the mean day of year value from each forced variable s source data this climatological year was repeated annually from what would be 1964 until the annually varying forcing data starts 1993 for physics and 1998 for phytoplankton a climatology was used instead of repeating a chosen year from the forcing data to avoid outlier conditions in any particular year from creating an unreasonable equilibrium in biological groups this spin up duration is comparable to that used in other atlantis models bossier et al 2018 the spin up period ends in 1998 when all forced variables are based on their original data source i e not climatology a spin up period in atlantis allows for biological processes to reach steady state and for them to respond to the inter annual variability in the forcing 2 2 physical forcing 2 2 1 temperature and salinity within the atlantis framework there are several ways to influence functional group processes based on environmental conditions particularly temperature and ph presently in neusv2 temperature influences growth rates clearance rates and mortality of only invertebrates using a q10 temperature coefficient this functionality is planned to be incorporated and calibrated for higher trophic levels htls in further updates sensitivity to salinity is possible in atlantis models but is not yet included for any functional groups in neusv2 glorys12v1 has been used in the northeast u s continental shelf for a variety of applications including regional temperature trends bastille et al 2021 marine heat waves schlegel et al 2021 and bottom temperature forecasting cai et al 2021 daily temperature salinity and horizontal advection were obtained from glorys12v1 global ocean reanalysis cmems 2018 this product has a gridded 8 km horizontal resolution up to 50 fixed vertical depth bins and extends from 1993 to 2018 a horizontal spatial mapping was used to assign the center point of each glorys12v1 grid cell to an atlantis box within each glorys12v1 cell depth bins were assigned a corresponding neusv2 depth layer glorys12v1 depth bins extending deeper than corresponding neusv2 boxes were excluded within each atlantis box layer combination a weighted mean by cell area was taken for all glorys12v1 cells within a given box i e horizontal aggregation then a weighted mean of all glorys12v1 layers corresponding to each neusv2 layer was calculated i e vertical aggregation using the proportion that each glorys12v1 layer occupies a neusv2 layer as weights the result was a single value per box layer and day 2 2 2 horizontal advection in atlantis horizontal transport acts orthogonally to the vertical plane between two boxes i e faces the neusv2 faces are defined as rhumb lines between two box vertices for all glorys12v1 cells intersecting a neusv2 face a mean east west u and north south v component of horizontal advection was computed at each glorys12v1 depth bin then as above glorys12v1 depth bins were mapped to neusv2 layers and a weighted mean was used to aggregate vertically ensuring a single flux per face per day for each glorys12v1 cell the magnitude of the horizontal velocity v z for a layer z was defined as v z u z 2 v z 2 with an associated flux angle θ defined as θ t a n 1 v u the relative angle ψ between the face and the velocity vector was calculated as ψ t a n 1 s i n θ φ c o s θ φ where φ is the angle of the face the cross sectional area of the face a was calculated as a l δ z where l is the length of the face and δ z is the depth of the neusv2 layer finally the flux relative to each face f was calculated as f c o s ψ π 2 a v z where the sign is dependent on the user defined directionality of each atlantis face 2 2 3 vertical advection atlantis requires vertical advection as part of its physical forcing routines since daily vertical advection is not provided by glorys12v1 output vertical advection was obtained from nasa s eccov4 ecco consortium 2015 eccov4 has a similar horizontal resolution to neusv2 1 and provides vertical advection on a monthly interval in general atlantis boxes possess uniform vertical advection throughout so only seasonality and larger scale spatial patterns are relevant all neusv2 boxes were mapped to eccov4 cells using spatial overlap or if eccov4 cell center points lay within 25 km of a box edge the same vertical assignment and aggregation methods used for glorys12v1 state variables were used for each box layer a daily interpolation of vertical advection was generated from monthly values using a kernel regression smoother a normal distribution kernel and a bandwidth of 15 days horizontal and vertical advection arrays were then run through a separate atlantis program hydroconstruct this program performs mass balance and hyperdiffusion corrections on horizontal advection it also translates box level vertical velocities into actual box layer exchanges and reconciles horizontal and vertical flows audzijonyte et al 2017 2 4 biological forcing generally atlantis possesses a primary production sub model that utilizes biological parameterization physical forcing trophic interactions and biogeochemical processes to simulate phytoplankton growth and mortality when using this sub model phytoplankton biomass is heavily influenced by parameter choice and requires extensive calibration given that the primary scope of neusv2 is simulating higher trophic levels on regional scales upscaling a higher resolution model to replicate large scale patterns is sufficient forcing phytoplankton biomass was anticipated to establish a baseline level of primary production provide bottom up controls on higher trophic levels and drive seasonal patterns in zooplankton these effects were thought to create a stable simulated food web ensure a correct scale of system wide energy input and allow for a unidirectional bottom up calibration strategy atlantis biological forcing only operates on functional group biomass so phytoplankton biomass was chosen over net primary production as the focal metric neusv2 phytoplankton size classes derived from ocean color remote sensing were mapped to neusv2 s phytoplankton functional groups diatoms dinoflagellates and picophytoplankton daily ocean color data 1998 2018 were obtained from the european space agency s ocean color climate change initiative oc cci version 4 2 sathyendranath et al 2020 which provides global estimates of chlorophyll a concentration at a 4 km2 horizontal resolution sathyendranath et al 2019 additional daily sea surface temperature sst data needed to estimate the phytoplankton size class include the 4 km nighttime noaa advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr pathfinder avhrr pathfinder version 5 3 2018 casey et al 2010 and the group for high resolution sea surface temperature ghrsst multiscale ultrahigh resolution mur version 4 1 level 4 data chin et al 2017 jpl mur measures 2015 the avhrr pathfinder data are used as the sst source until 2002 and mur in subsequent years comparisons to in situ measurements show a relatively low bias in the phytoplankton size class estimates with a bias of 0 04 and 0 08 mg chl a m 3 for micro and combined pico and nano phytoplankton respectively turner et al 2021 neusv2 uses the phytoplankton size class model to estimate the amount of chlorophyll a chl a associated with the micro 20 μm nano 2 20 μm and picophytoplankton 2 μm size classes turner et al 2021 an 8 day moving average was used to reduce data gaps caused by cloud cover after which each box had only 7 to 14 days of missing data per year on average a cubic spline function was used to temporally interpolate time series within each box at each time step the median of all pixels within each neusv2 box was used for each phytoplankton variable the median was chosen to avoid the overrepresentation of dynamics of small portions of a box i e preventing high local primary production from extending across the entire region as boxes are intended to represent larger scale patterns the phytoplankton size class data are a near surface two dimensional product that provides chl a in each cell aggregated over the first optical depth with primary production estimates integrated over the euphotic depth whereas neusv2 can simulate phytoplankton in each of the vertical layers the euphotic depth derived from the morel and berthon 1989 model showed that the median daily euphotic depth across all neusv2 boxes was 41 2 m thus all forced phytoplankton biomass was assigned to the fixed depth neusv2 surface layer 0 50m satellite phytoplankton size class estimates were then transformed into neusv2 s predetermined phytoplankton functional groups the satellite derived microphytoplankton was assumed to be a combination of diatoms and dinoflagellates to differentiate these functional groups we estimated the diatom fraction from the global hirata et al 2011 phytoplankton functional type model derived from the same oc cci data as the turner et al 2021 data the remainder of microphytoplankton were assigned to dinoflagellates this proportion was calculated as a day of year median of each 4km cell from 1998 to 2019 and applied across all years diatom proportions differed by box as well as seasonally with a mean of 0 89 0 07 sd the sum of the satellite derived nano and picophytoplankton were assigned to the neusv2 picophytoplankton functional group this picophytoplankton group in neusv2 is actually a small phytoplankton group distinguished primarily by their smaller size slower sinking rate and higher consumption by microzooplankton the neusv2 chlorophyll to nitrogen conversion factor of 7 was used to convert the chlorophyll units from mg m 3 of chl a to the atlantis required units of mg n m 3 and was derived from a chl a carbon range of 27 67 riemann et al 1989 with a redfield c n of 7 3 analysis the following analyses are aligned with the three main objectives of the paper first we assess neusv2 s performance relative to our calibration criteria second we quantify the bias in hydrographic and satellite forcing datasets after upscaling to the neusv2 box structure lastly we analyze the spatial patterns of zooplankton herbivorous benthos and planktivorous fish groups to ensure these groups are responding realistically to forced primary producers additional work regarding further calibration of higher trophic levels a comprehensive model skill assessment and sensitivity analyses are ongoing and outside the scope of this study 3 1 calibration criteria we used two minimum performance standards to evaluate biomass time series of functional groups based on guidelines suggested by kaplan and marshall 2016 the first criteria persistence was that no functional groups go extinct during the hindcast by maintaining a domain wide biomass above 10 of the starting biomass this criterion ensures that simulated diets are roughly balanced and that recruitment and growth parameterizations can sustain each population the second criterion stability was that no functional group s domain wide biomass time series possessed a relative rate of change of 5 per year or greater over the last 20 years of the simulation ensuring a baseline level of time series stability and that no functional groups are exhibiting extreme population growth both calibration criteria thresholds were based on analyses of noaa s stock smart assessment database noaa fisheries 2022 biomass time series were obtained for all neusv2 species available in noaa s stock smart stock assessment database noaa fisheries 2022 the minimum of each species biomass relativized to the earliest year was used as the threshold for persistence where the median across all species was 14 of initial biomass stock smart species relativized biomass from 1998 to 2018 after a linear regression showed a median slope across species of 4 per year 3 2 upscaling assessment for the glorys12v1 temperature and salinity as well as the satellite phytoplankton biomass a mean daily bias was calculated to determine whether neusv2 forcing was representative of the original high resolution forcing source for each neusv2 box layer and day the box wide neusv2 value was subtracted from each forcing product cell s value the mean of all cell level biases were calculated to obtain a daily mean bias for each neusv2 box and layer for each box variable temperature salinity and phytoplankton biomass a two way anova was performed bias box season to determine whether significant differences in mean bias were present in atlantis horizontal advection acts across all box faces simultaneously at each time step and represents the net flux of all transport across the faces adjoining any two boxes even though phytoplankton are forced in neusv2 they are not influenced by circulation but circulation still determines the flow of nutrients to characterize broad circulation patterns net transport was aggregated over all faces adjoining each pair of boxes then converted to a mean daily flow speed v for each layer of each box pair whereby v t l z where t is the net transport between boxes l is the total length of all faces that adjoin the boxes and z is the depth of that given layer then semi quantitative comparisons of specific circulation features were used to determine the translation of the upscaled circulation a daily mean bias in flow speed was also calculated on each neusv2 face using similar methods to that described for box wide variables instead only glorys12v1 cells that intersect each neusv2 face were used in calculations a two way anova was used bias face season to identify spatial and temporal differences in flow bias 3 3 spatiotemporal patterns in output neusv2 box variable outputs were aggregated over the northeast fishery science center s ecological production units epus fig 1 bastille et al 2021 the mid atlantic bight mab georges bank gb and the gulf of maine gom these regional assignments allowed for comparisons to regional reports and a more intuitive interpretation of regional oceanographic and ecological patterns most further references to biomass outputs will be presented as aggregations by epu to account for differences in epu size pelagic group biomass was standardized by box volume and epibenthic biomass was standardized by box area in some cases the 5 day output was temporally aggregated as seasonal means and defined as winter january march spring april june summer july september and fall october december further analyses of neusv2 s functional groups were constrained to only functional groups interacting with forced phytoplankton zooplankton benthos and planktivores neusv2 has three zooplankton size classes microzooplankton mesozooplankton and macrozooplankton benthos and planktivore are aggregated categories that are composed of 9 and 7 true neusv2 functional groups respectively table 1 and are combined for illustrative purposes only time series decomposition was used to isolate seasonality in functional group biomass output this method allows for a clearer understanding of when seasonal events occur and the relative timing of groups seasonal cycles a multiple seasonal trend decomposition using loess mstl algorithm was applied to monthly and epu aggregated biomass of each functional group output using the mstl function from the r package forecast v8 13 hyndman and khandakar 2008 this function uses loess smoothing to extract repeating seasonal cycles from the time series a standardized seasonality index was constructed as the monthly mean seasonality divided by the time series standard deviation to compare seasonal cycles of groups with different intra annual variances the coastal and ocean plankton ecology production and observation database copepod moriarty and o brien 2013 provides total carbon mass mg c m 3 as a gridded monthly product aggregated over several years of data and was used as a reference point for evaluating neusv2 zooplankton the copepod grid was mapped to the neusv2 epus and a seasonal mean concentration was calculated the mean seasonal neusv2 zooplankton concentration was calculated from the sum of all three neusv2 zooplankton size classes and converted to carbon using atlantis redfield ratio then the ratio of copepod to neusv2 biomass concentration was calculated copepod is a multi year aggregated product and does not provide zooplankton size distributions so neusv2 values within an order of magnitude were considered similar 3 4 forced phytoplankton interactions to determine how much primary producer biomass transferred to pelagic and benthic food webs the consumed biomass c of each phytoplankton group p by each grazer g was calculated as c g p p g p e g where eg is the total consumed biomass of each predator and pg p is the mean proportion of each predator s diet that constitutes phytoplankton group p then the proportion of each phytoplankton group biomass consumed pp was calculated p p g c g p b p where bp is the total biomass of phytoplankton group p the relative contribution of each grazer to the consumption of phytoplankton p gg p was calculated g g p c g p g c g p c p and g were calculated on each 5 day time step the phytoplankton deposition to sediments is not tracked explicitly within atlantis outputs to estimate it a theoretical passive deposition flux was calculated for each phytoplankton group in atlantis the biomass flux of sinking phytoplankton fp from one box layer to the one below is calculated as f p c p w p a where wp is the sinking velocity of phytoplankton and a is the horizontal area of the box thus the proportion of each phytoplankton sinking from any given pelagic layer dbox p can be calculated as d b o x p f p c p v w p z b o x where v is the box volume and zbox is the depth of the pelagic layer 4 results 4 1 upscaling assessment 4 1 1 physical forcing neusv2 was able to reproduce many of the region s broad circulation characteristics observed in glorys12v1 figure 2 given that neusv2 uses only 151 faces to define circulation it was not expected that neusv2 could reproduce small scale circulation patterns but rather the general circulation patterns of the region additionally verifying broad circulation patterns ensures that nutrients detrital pools and passively transported functional groups behave realistically in the mid atlantic bight mab cross shelf faces correctly showed a southwestern surface flow figure 2 label 1 of 2 to 6 cm s 1 which was consistent with observations lentz 2008 surface horizontal fluxes were most variable in spring 1 58 cm s 1 sd and least in summer 1 44 cm s 1 sd large northward flows in the southern mab while not offshore enough to be caused by the gulf stream frankignoul et al 2001 were cause by strong northward flow components where the gulf stream separates from the coastline in those few glorys cells bias in mean flow speed figure s1 did not vary by season anova p 0 46 but differed between faces anova p 0 001 flow bias was generally higher in the southern mab faces and around nantucket shoals and low throughout the gulf of maine gom neusv2 correctly captured the anti cyclonic surface circulation in georges bank gb figure 2 label 4 pettigrew et al 2005 but not the cyclonic flows in the gom figure 2 label 5 gom surface and slope water correctly flowed northwest through the scotian shelf and the northeast channel nec figure 2 label 3 and southwest within the great south channel figure 2 label 2 brooks 1985 in the nec a deep water counter current is present zhang et al 2019 which was not possible to reproduce given the resolution of neusv2 but could explain the southeast flow in neusv2 s bottom nec box layer overall the dominant flows in and out of the neusv2 domain were adequately captured ensuring that planktonic functional groups and nutrients were not being flushed from the system the influence of circulation on phytoplankton is already captured in the satellite data so any further discrepancies in neusv2 s circulation should not strongly influence lower trophic level dynamics the box geometry of neusv2 allowed for a better approximation of the glorys12v1 temperature figure 3 and salinity figure 4 patterns than it does for circulation as boxes are based largely on bathymetric features the expectation was that neusv2 s box geometry and the upscaling process did not inhibit its ability to resolve seasonal patterns and spatial patterns at scales at or larger than its boxes neusv2 s surface layer 0 50m resolved the cross shelf temperature gradient in the mab spring and fall in glorys12v1 as well as the latitudinal temperature gradient in all seasons figure 3 strong latitudinal gradients in the mab and shelf break boxes resulted in divergent patterns of bias where bias was higher in the south and lower in the north of each box in contrast central gom and northern gb boxes had a narrower temperature distribution resulting lower bias boxes in the gom had similar temperature bias but significant differences between boxes were present overall anova p 0 001 the southern mab boxes had more negative temperature biases neusv2 correctly reproduced the lower spatial variation in salinity from glorys12v1 figures 4 as well as the decreasing salinity gradient from offshore to inshore mean box wide mean salinity bias was small 0 02 to 0 005 and differed between boxes figure 5 anova p 0 001 as with temperature salinity bias was lowest in the gom and gb boxes with significantly more negative bias in the southern mab at all depth levels patterns of within box bias were mainly driven by cross shelf gradients as opposed to latitudinal gradients with temperature overall temperature and salinity bias was sufficiently low for the purpose of reproducing the large scale processes necessary for neusv2 4 1 2 biological forcing neusv2 boxes resolved much of the spatial and seasonal variation in surface chl a in the satellite data figure 6 furthermore neusv2 correctly reproduced higher chl a within nearshore boxes and within gb and lower chl a offshore and in the central gom the elevated chl a observed over nantucket shoals and over gb was dampened in neusv2 since those features were split by multiple boxes and spatially averaged with lower chl a areas figure 6 generally upscaling resulted in a damping of the intensity of elevated chl a regions all neusv2 phytoplankton size classes showed similar overall patterns as total chl a with higher concentrations nearshore and over gb as in the satellite data the mean seasonal concentration of diatoms was about 9 times higher than dinoflagellates and the ratio of diatoms to picophytoplankton varied seasonally with a maximum of 7 5 in winter and a minimum of 7 10 in summer analyses of bias in size class chl a concentration showed the presence of significant box differences anova p 0 001 patterns in phytoplankton size class bias figure 7 showed similar levels of bias in offshore and deeper water boxes the spatial heterogeneity in concentration within nearshore boxes resulted in significant differences in bias 4 2 spatial and temporal patterns 4 2 1 phytoplankton and zooplankton the seasonality of the satellite phytoplankton data was not affected by the upscaling process diatoms were the dominant phytoplankton group in gb and the gom but were in equal proportion to picophytoplankton in the mab figure 8 table 1 diatoms bloomed in spring in all regions and fall in the mab dinoflagellate blooms occurred in spring and fall in all regions picophytoplankton blooms occurred in summer and fall in gb and the gom while blooms occurred in spring and fall in the mab zooplankton composition differed between the three regions where micro meso and macrozooplankton were relatively prominent in gb the mab and the gom respectively but all zooplankton groups maintained robust fractions in all regions figure 8 table 1 both meso and macrozooplankton required 10 to 20 model years to reach a stable biomass with mesozooplankton stabilized at a mean biomass between 1 9 and 3 1 starting biomass and macrozooplankton stabilized at 4 times starting biomass due to data limitations zooplankton initial conditions are uncertain and may not necessarily represent the target biomass for contemporary conditions microzooplankton were strongly coupled to picophytoplankton through diet interactions resulting in an indirect coupling of macro and mesozooplankton to picophytoplankton through their diet interactions microzooplankton biomass peaks in the fall in all epus just after picophytoplankton blooms figure 9 neusv2 zooplankton were comparable to that in the copepod dataset winter concentrations in neusv2 were higher 1 4 to 1 7 times than copepod with a more similarity 1 to 1 9 times in the other seasons similarity between copepod and neusv2 zooplankton did not consistently relate to ecological production unit epu figure s2 where no single epu provided a better estimate of copepod across seasons neusv2 zooplankton have a predefined vertical and horizontal distributions so discrepancies were not caused by behavior but possibly due to the poor sampling coverage the copepod during those months n 1 121 in winter compared to n 2 481 in spring copepod may also underestimate microzooplankton due to larger mesh size selectivity from this assessment neusv2 provided a reasonable approximation well within an order of magnitude of zooplankton biomass the seasonal decomposition of biomass time series for each functional group showed a clear succession of zooplankton groups within a year figure 9 in all epus a bloom of microzooplankton occured after a rise in picophytoplankton and mesozooplankton responded to either the micro zooplankton blooms gb and mab or the fall diatom bloom gom figure 8 in all regions zooplankton groups appeared less responsive to the spring phytoplankton blooms either due to top down control by planktivores in the spring or the strong coupling between microzooplankton and picophytoplankton 4 2 2 planktivores and benthos planktivore species spatial distribution was directly specified figure s3 but community composition emerges in part from the spatial distributions and abundance of predators and prey the majority of neusv2 s planktivore biomass was attributable to atlantic herring clupea harengus atlantic menhaden brevoortia tyrannus atlantic mackerel scomber scombrus and butterfish peprilus triacanthus table 1 the mean annual biomass for these dominant planktivore species after spin up was within 0 5 to 2 times available assessment data with the exception of butterfish 5 4 times higher in neusv2 planktivores primarily consumed diatoms and zooplankton planktivore consumption uses a hollings type ii functional response with an availability parameter for each prey such that trophic interactions are higher with increased spatial overlap with prey as such elevated mesozooplankton biomass in the gom were likely the result of lower planktivores biomass compared to other regions figure 8 additionally neusv2 planktivore species spawning using a bevorton holt parameterization occurs on predetermined dates each year so seasonal cycles in biomass are not emergent properties the benthos functional groups exhibited negligible seasonal patterns and showed a steady increase in biomass within the mab and a decrease in gb figure 8 gom benthos biomass stabilized early in the simulation on a domain wide scale benthos species biomass fell within the 5 annual threshold thus passing the stability criteria for epibenthic filter feeders ocean quahogs artica islandica atlantic sea scallops placopecten magellanicus and atlantic surfclam spisula solidissima the post spin up neusv2 biomass was within 0 5 to 3 8 times assessment data benthos species in neusv2 despite being large consumers of deposited phytoplankton did not show the seasonal responsiveness as seen in zooplankton likely due to the temporal lag between surface production and deposition 4 3 grazing the average daily consumption cp of diatoms dinoflagellates and picophytoplankton by all grazers was 5 9 9 and 15 6 respectively unconsumed phytoplankton either remained in the surface layer until they are overwritten by the next time step s forcing sank or mixed into deeper pelagic layers deposited into the sediment layer or lysed and are converted into detrital pools neusv2 does not classify deposited phytoplankton as detritus until they are consumed but still may appear as a dominant food source in the sediments thus consumption of phytoplankton by in sediment benthos in neusv2 should be considered detritivory i e consuming dead plant matter rather than grazing on live phytoplankton a box level mean of 0 5 of diatoms and 0 3 of dinoflagellates are deposited dbox p from the deepest pelagic layer at each time step picophytoplankton are not parameterized to sink in neusv2 due to their small size these deposition rates were low enough to ensure minimal accumulation of inactive phytoplankton in the benthos in most boxes much of the benthic invertebrate diets consisted of deposited phytoplankton which constituted 92 of consumption of phytoplankton live and dead on average benthic grazers consumed 90 of the passively deposited diatoms in the pelagic food web 56 of diatoms consumption was performed by zooplankton and 43 by planktivores table 2 nearly all pelagic picophytoplankton consumption was performed by microzooplankton which was the intentional result of gape size limitations of planktivore groups and a simplified lower trophic food web the amount of grazing attributable to each function group was consistent over time with only slight seasonal fluctuations 5 discussion to our knowledge neusv2 is the first atlantis model to successfully force primary production with ocean color data as such we feel a description of the observations and hurdles involved in these new methods would be beneficial to other modelers these lessons learned can be found in the supplementary material 5 1 model performance all neusv2 phytoplankton zooplankton planktivore and benthic functional groups met our baseline calibration criteria of persistence and time series stability with the exception of sea scallops which had a relative increase of 7 per year since phytoplankton were forced it was critical that zooplankton and planktivore groups mirrored observed behavior in order to ensure that primary production was distributed throughout the simulated food web temporal analyses of northeast shelf zooplankton communities suggest a shift in community composition occurring around 2010 morse et al 2017 and while individual zooplankton species are not resolved a breakpoint analysis of neusv2 total zooplankton biomass time series shows a change in time series slope in 2013 the general agreement between neusv2 and copepod s total zooplankton carbon mass indicates that neusv2 was capable of reproducing a plausible zooplankton population biomass however copepod does not possess the spatial or temporal resolution required to perform a statistical comparison a potential source of error in zooplankton biomass may result from the error inherent in the phytoplankton forcing turner et al 2021 describe a correlation coefficient absolute bias between in situ and modeled of 0 7 0 04 for micro phytoplankton concentrations and 0 58 0 08 for nano and pico phytoplankton this bias represents about 10 of typical diatom and picophytoplankton concentrations in neusv2 suggesting low impact of model results due to their small size and pelagic distribution the planktivores simulated in neusv2 are not as well sampled compared to demersal species in regional trawl surveys resulting in a high degree of uncertainty regarding population level biomass however planktivore species assessment biomass estimates from the noaa stock smart database show that neusv2 values well within an order of magnitude of assessment as additional aspects of higher trophic level calibration are outside the scope of this study we deem planktivores to be at an acceptable level possible causes for discrepancies with assessment data are the inclusion of juveniles in neusv2 species biomass as well as errors derived from growth and recruitment parameters anecdotally we observed that during calibration there was a strong coupling between macrozooplankton biomass and the equilibrium biomass for herring and mackerel despite some inconsistencies between simulated planktivores and assessments it is clear that the forced primary production is being transferred into higher trophic levels in the pelagic food web through zooplankton and not entirely dependent on benthic grazers i e some alternative stable state 5 2 model configuration one eventual goal of neusv2 is to develop ecosystem level projections under different climate and management scenarios thus it is important that neusv2 reproduces ecosystem processes on the spatial and temporal scales relevant for this goal a notable tradeoff in atlantis model design is between the scope of the simulated processes and the scale that those processes can be practically resolved link et al 2010 this tradeoff is evident in neusv2 s box definitions and the translation of forcing data atlantis models generally define box geometry based on bathymetry with partial consideration of regional habitat types biological communities fisheries independent survey strata and fisheries management areas as such neusv2 is intentionally not designed to capture fine details of physical processes and its box geometry has been left relatively unchanged since neusv1 circulation was particularly difficult to capture due neusv2 s relatively few number of faces and neusv2 captured circulation best when faces were arranged perpendicular to major currents one method for improving neusv2 s ability to capture more circulation features would be to increase the number of simulated boxes yet this would result in a large increase in run time audzijonyte et al 2017 thus it is unlikely that any slight increase in box count with no other changes would improve neusv2 s ability to simulate higher trophic levels and improve its applicability to management additionally neusv2 s simulated food web is less reliant on horizontal advection than other atlantis models with dynamic primary production since forced phytoplankton are not influenced by nutrient fluxes and other state variables temperature and salinity the coarse vertical resolution of neusv2 also had unexpected consequences on biological processes single layer boxes result in equal access to phytoplankton for both pelagic and epibenthic grazers to prevent the forced phytoplankton from subsidizing the epibenthos the clearance rates and availability of phytoplankton to epibenthic filter feeders were reduced below what would be typically observed though if reduced too greatly bivalve filter feeders may shift to detritus dominated diets when faced with limited access to phytoplankton and while some of the region s shellfish consume detritus munroe et al 2013 the majority of their consumption should be phytoplankton both et al 2020 cranford and grant 1990 we recommend a careful assessment of the dynamics on any single layer boxes and a contextual evaluation of whether a two layer box i e a separate benthic boundary and euphotic layer would be a better alternative 5 3 consequences of phytoplankton forcing phytoplankton forcing in atlantis results in a one way coupling between the satellite derived size class product and neusv2 as a consequence at each time step biomass values are entirely overwritten regardless of the intermediate grazing the result is that even when grazing is high local depletions in phytoplankton do not persist into further time steps the goal of proper calibration is then to replicate the magnitude and seasonality of in situ grazing present at the time of satellite measurements despite the lack of bottom up feedbacks on zooplankton groups in end to end ecosystem models zooplankton act as a bridge between biogeochemistry and higher trophic levels htls rose et al 2010 and allowing two way feedbacks between htls and zooplankton can be essential for obtaining realistic htl population dynamics holt et al 2014 travers et al 2009 atlantis models typically simulate all lower trophic level ltl dynamics including the underlying biogeochemistry only requiring physical forcing fulton et al 2005 but only at the coarse resolution of large boxes despite neusv2 breaking the bidirectional feedbacks between phytoplankton and zooplankton it retains two way interactions between zooplankton and htls integrating the higher resolution satellite products instead of using atlantis traditional primary producer dynamics provides neusv2 with information on smaller scale phytoplankton processes i e coastal and upwelling effects as well as drives seasonality in ltl processes at the expense of phytoplankton zooplankton coupling given that that the ultimate objective of neusv2 is to inform htl resource management this tradeoff does not reduce the applicability of neusv2 due to the one directional phytoplankton zooplankton interactions and data limitations grazers in neusv2 rarely experience food limitation even when competition is high without careful tuning of clearance and growth rates forced primary producers can effectively subsidize grazer production resulting in unrealistically high population biomass to compensate for the lack of bottom up control on zooplankton a quadratic mortality term was applied for all zooplankton functional groups quadratic mortality in zooplankton typically represents intra guild consumption mitra et al 2014 ohman et al 2002 but also acts as a top down control on zooplankton biomass and ultimately grazing the result was more stable biomass time series with the tradeoff of potentially losing some responsiveness to bottom up signals kearney et al 2012 though top down controls are built into the phytoplankton forcing they are independent from neusv2 dynamics this works well for an atlantis hindcast as the forced phytoplankton act as a historical driver for the system however if the model was run as a projection different phytoplankton forcing sources would need to be incorporated past the present day in this case neusv2 would have to be coupled to a comparable regional biogeochemical model projection drenkard et al 2021 6 conclusions one of the major goals of neusv2 was to integrate existing data products in order to both ensure that critical patterns in environmental variables and primary production were captured and to build a foundation for the simulated ecosystem that would allow for comparisons to regional fisheries management and assessments we have found that the coarse resolution of neusv2 adequately captures seasonal and spatial characteristics of high resolution glorys12v1 temperature and salinity as well as the high resolution ocean color derived phytoplankton size classes this new phytoplankton forcing method allowed for a simplified bottom up calibration strategy and drove the seasonality of the simulated ecosystem with forced phytoplankton neusv2 was capable of reproducing plausible population sizes of zooplankton and planktivores despite removing the bi directional feedback between phytoplankton and zooplankton neusv2 planktivores and other higher trophic levels htls were able to respond to zooplankton dynamics overall we recommend this forcing method for other atlantis models if high model skill is required for lower trophic or nutrient processes calibrating atlantis internal biogeochemical processes or coupling atlantis to a nutrient phytoplankton and zooplankton npz model may be more appropriate kearney et al 2012 stock et al 2014 atlantis lower trophic level sub models are comprehensive enough to capture essential dynamics within the system fulton et al 2005 travers et al 2007 but operate on a much coarser resolution than other more specialized npz model products additionally global parameters and a coarse resolution necessitate that atlantis models should have non tactical objectives fulton 2010 even if an upscaled regionally tuned npz model is used forcing phytoplankton with an observation based product will require additional coupling to other biogeochemical simulations to run neusv2 as a projection while additional features are needed in order for neusv2 to be used directly as a strategic management tool e g improve realism in socio economics and htl dynamics it is well suited for exploring ecosystem level impacts to changes in functional group biomass fishing pressure and life history parameters with regards to community composition and population dynamics neusv2 also provides a hypothesis testing framework for ecological indicators ecological sensitivity to particular functional groups and application of alternative physical and primary production models future work will aim to improve model skill of higher trophic levels and improve species

24386,climate is a core aspect of a species niche that is frequently incorporated into species distribution models sdms the proliferation of readily accessible climate data is stimulating the increasing use of climate based species distribution models csdms in conservation planning and management however it is uncertain how sensitive csdms are to the choice of climate data used we compared the performance of maximum entropy based csdms calibrated with seven different climate data sets worldclim chelsa terraclimate climate research unit time series cru ts prism streamcat and earthenv for each species four amphibians and two reptiles in california we used a standardized objective procedure to select climate predictors from each data set we then assessed performance with standard metrics calculated variable importance scores and compared predicted distributions to historical range maps of the target species the climate data set used affected csdm performance with models based on some data sets overpredicting and others underpredicting distributions compared with historical range maps of each of the species critically for the six species we tested no one climate data set always performed worst or best these results indicate that the effects of different climate data sets should be incorporated into model evaluation when developing applying and interpreting climate based sdms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords climate climate data sets climate based species distribution models maximum entropy model mapped predictions historical range maps 1 introduction climate is among the most important determinants of where species are found peterson and dawson 2003 since the early 19th century overwhelming scientific evidence has shown that the global climate is changing rapidly and it is adversely affecting species and ecosystems in general species climate suitabilities are moving northwards and upwards respectively chen et al 2011 these shifts are associated with climate induced changes in the location of physiologically optimal and tolerable temperatures pörtner 2001 the availability and abundance of food and habitats mantyka pringle et al 2012 interspecific interactions suttle et al 2007 the timing of seasonal life history events such as migration blooming and reproduction post et al 2001 and the rate of species extinctions cahill et al 2013 in response to this crisis conservationists have devised techniques to both quantify the effects climate change will have on species and their habitats to better inform decisions regarding conservation actions climate based species distribution models hereafter csdms represent a method to quantify how climate affects the probability that species will exist in a given location throughout this paper we use csdms to refer to models built with only climate predictors and species distribution models sdms for models that may include a variety of types of predictor variables including climate variables several studies have assessed different aspects of csdm performance and interpretation because of their potential utility in conservation planning and management for example a common problem often encountered when developing csdms is deciding which climate data set or database to use some progress has been made in comparing the effects of climate data sources on model performance but these comparisons tend to focus on comparing just two data sets at a time para and manahan 2008 watling et al 2014 datta et al 2020 jiménez valverde et al 2021 with the increasing availability and accessibility of climate data sets it is now possible to conduct more thorough comparisons of how climate data sources affect csdms climate based species distribution models belong to a category of sdms that associate species occurrence or abundance records with climatic data such as monthly temperature and precipitation to estimate a species bioclimatic niche or envelope pearson and dawson 2003 these associations are then used to generate predictions that can be visualized as maps of habitat suitability or occurrence probability for the modeled species elith and leathwick 2009 the resulting suitability maps are assumed to be representative of the climatic range within which a species can live lomolino et al 2005 in addition csdms assume that if the current climate suitability of a species is accurately estimated then the model can be used to generate future predictions franklin 2010 although csdms can provide useful information uncertainties associated with the predictors used for model building can potentially lead to misleading conservation and management decisions baker et al 2016 synes and osborne 2011 it is therefore important to understand how csdms and resulting suitability maps are sensitive to predictors the two major input data required for developing csdms are occurrence data species presences absences and abundances and climate predictors generally occurrence data are gathered in two ways 1 as actual recordings of observed species at point locations or specimen collections e g global biodiversity information facility gbif http www gbif org inaturalist https www inaturalist org observations and natureserve https explorer natureserve org databases and 2 through sampling of pseudo occurrences within the extent of expert derived range maps maps representing the geographic boundaries within which a species can occur e g the international union for conservation of nature range maps yannic et al 2014 fourcade et al 2016 there are uncertainties associated with each of the occurrence data types point observations can underestimate true species distributions because of biased or incomplete sampling efforts imprecise recordings species misidentification and uneven coverage of a species life history stages rondinini et al 2006 conversely expert derived range maps do not document specifically where species occur within a range peterson et al 2018 there are also inherent uncertainties associated with climate data climate data are either collected directly from weather stations interpolated from weather station data derived from remotely sensed data or estimated from some combination of different approaches apart from the inherent uncertainties in the different approaches used for generating climate data other data attributes and treatments can potentially affect csdm accuracy and interpretation for example collinearity of predictor variables discrepancies in variable selection techniques used in model building and mismatches between the spatial and temporal resolution of predictor variables can all reduce the reliability and specificity of sdms here we focus on how the collective differences among climate data sets in spatial and temporal resolution spatial extent and the specific variables they contain affect csdm performance and interpretation the performance of different data sets may be influenced by not only the specific variables the data set contains but also by the data s spatial and temporal resolution extent and how estimates of climate conditions at individual grid cells are derived the effects of climate data sources on model performance are especially important to recognize because many ecologists will build csdms from a single climate data source ecologists can now choose from multiple readily accessible climate data sets overpeck et al 2011 but little guidance exists on which ones to use and why even though some climate data sources have similar predictor variables data sets can differ in their spatial extents of coverage e g global as in worldclim and continental as in prism temporal resolutions spatial resolutions the weather station data used to produce the coverages and the interpolation techniques used to produce spatially continuous grids of the variables in addition some climate data sets include continuous grids of uniform size such as worldclim flick and hijmans 2017 and terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 whereas others tend to cover only a portion of the landscape stream reaches or watersheds and the cell size of the coverage can vary substantially e g streamcat hill et al 2016 and earthenv domisch et al 2015 given the inherent mismatch between the grid size of mapped climate data and the size of habitat patches occupied by individuals of different species differences in the spatial resolution of available climate data sets may affect sdm accuracy and interpretability pearson and dawson 2003 seo et al 2009 fine resolution predictors should improve models as they more precisely delineate spatial variation in climate associated with local scale landscape features such as rivers corridors roads etc lawes and piper 1998 hess et al 2006 however studies on the effects of spatial resolution have produced inconsistent results for example habitat suitability modeling of different bird species has shown that fine spatial resolution can improve model performance as measured by area under the receiver operating curve auc however this improvement was only the case for most species when modeled at a very small spatial resolution of 1 m gottschalk et al 2011 guisan et al 2007 reported that a 10 fold increase in spatial resolution of predictors reduced sdm performance for some species but had little to no effect or even improved auc in other species additionally other studies have reported enhanced model performance with either fine spatial resolution scales et al 2017 nezer et al 2017 or coarse spatial resolution predictors tobalske 2002 these initial studies imply that differences between climate data sets in one or more attributes may generally influence csdm performance however no empirical studies have yet been conducted that comprehensively compare csdm performance across multiple climate data sets in this study we use a standard approach to compare how different climate data sets that vary in extent spatial resolution and how different climate variables were estimated affect csdm performance metrics and interpretation 2 methods 2 1 general approach to understand how climate data sets affect csdms we assembled and analyzed publicly available species occurrence and climate data we assembled georeferenced records of occurrence for six imperiled species that occur in california and seven commonly used climate data sets that vary in the extent of coverages and spatial resolution we eliminated highly correlated predictors from each climate data set and retained only the climatic variables that were uncorrelated for example out of the 19 bioclimatic variables of the wordclim data set we retained five uncorrelated temperature and precipitation variables we used the maximum entropy maxent modeling framework to build csdms because it requires only presence data we then used several metrics to assess model performance and used the models to map how predicted habitat suitability varied across all of california for each target species finally we compared habitat suitability maps to historical range maps of each species and assessed the similarities between climate suitability maps for each climate data source and each species 2 2 focal species and occurrence data we compiled occurrence data for the six target species table 1 from the global biodiversity information facility database gbif http www gbif org downloaded march 16 and 18 2021 the target species included california red legged frog rana draytonii baird and girard 1852 arroyo toad anaxyrus californicus camp 1915 two striped garter snake thamnophis hammondii kennicott 1860 foothill yellow legged frog rana boylii baird 1854 western spadefoot toad spea hammondii baird 1859 and california legless lizard anniella pulchra gray 1852 to maximize temporal matching between occurrence and climate data see below we only used occurrence records from 2015 to 2019 we also dropped occurrence records that lacked latitude and longitude coordinates and we removed duplicate records finally we obtained range maps for each target species from the united states geological surveys usgs gap analysis project on vertebrate species ranges portal https gapanalysis usgs gov apps species data download accessed march 18 2021 range maps represent the geographic limits within which species can be found based on expert judgment in the usgs gap project the best information available about known species ranges from multiple sources was compiled and intersected with hydrologic units huc 12 usgs gap 2018 these data sets were then attributed with information regarding species occurrence presence extant possibly present potentially present extirpated origin native introduced reintroduced vagrant reproductive use breeding non breeding both and seasonal use year round summer winter migratory vagrant given the absence of extensive and comprehensive survey data range maps provide a way of comparing sdm predictions with our best understanding of each species historical distribution 2 3 climate data sets we assembled climate predictors from seven commonly used and publicly accessible databases table 2 appendix a the databases include worldclim v 2 1 flick and hijmans 2017 chelsa v 1 2 climatologies at high resolution for the earth s land surface areas karger et al 2017 cru ts v 4 0 4 climate research unit time series harris et al 2020 terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model daly et al 2008 stream catchment hill et al 2016 and earthenv domisch et al 2015 all data sets consist of climate interpolations extrapolations and differ in their spatial extent spatial resolution temporal resolution and level of landscape coverage the worldclim v 2 data set hereafter worldclim has a global extent and consists of 19 bioclimatic variables averages of 1950 to 2000 estimates available in four spatial resolutions we used the 30 s 1 km resolution data the predictors include precipitation and temperature means extremes measures of variability and measures of seasonality that are considered to be associated with species distributions dupin et al 2011 the chelsa v 1 2 data set hereafter chelsa has global coverage and contains 19 bioclimatic variables however the chelsa data differ from the worldclim data in that interpolation of precipitation is adjusted for the effects of elevation and aspect in other words although both worldclim and chelsa data sets contain the same 19 bioclimatic predictors the models that generate these databases estimate the amount of precipitation differently as a consequence precipitation tends to be lower in worldclim than in chelsa cru ts v 4 0 4 hereafter cru includes gridded climate time series data derived from monthly observations at meteorological stations across the global land surface areas excluding antarctica the data set consists of monthly climate anomalies with a resolution of 50 km cru is the coarsest of all the climate data sets we analyzed the terraclimate data set has 4 km spatial resolution and describes the monthly climate and climate water balance for terrestrial landscapes across the globe abatzoglou et al 2018 the prism data set covers the conterminous united states and consists of 30 year climate normals for this project we used the 800 m resolution 30 year averages of monthly precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature for the period 1981 to 2010 the stream catchment hereafter streamcat data set describes geo climatic conditions at each of 2 65 million stream segments and their corresponding catchments within the conterminous united states streamcat contains a large suite of both natural and land use variables but we extracted only climate variables for use in this study table 3 we used data expressed at both local catchment areas on the landscape laterally upslope of stream segments but not including upstream contributions and watershed level true contributing areas upslope and upstream of the reach scales of aggregation we created raster layers of the focal streamcat climate predictors in arcmap 10 6 1 esri 2016 for california by joining the streamcat data set to stream catchments and watersheds available in the national hydrography data set plus version 2 nhdplusv2 usgs 2019 the earthenv data set has near global 1 km resolution coverage and includes bioclimatic variables relevant to stream ecosystems the earthenv data set describes climatic conditions for stream networks so we used the rastertools feature verbruggen 2012 in arcmap to move the location of the gbif occurrence record to the nearest raster cell that overlapped with a stream channel collinearity among predictors may affect model results and different mixes of predictors can generate different parameter estimates slopes meloun et al 2002 dorman et al 2013 de marco and nóbrega 2018 if two variables are highly correlated it is difficult to differentiate the potential effect of one variable from the other dormann et al 2013 to minimize multicollinearity among predictors we used a standardized procedure to select subsets of predictors from each climate data set during model construction first we used the crop and mask functions of the raster package in the r statistical software r development core team 2020 to clip the raster layers to include only the state of california then we used the vifcor function in the package usdm naimi 2015 to identify and eliminate highly correlated variables within each data set the vifcor function first identifies a pair of variables that has the maximum correlation with r 0 7 and excludes the variable with the higher variance inflation factor vif dormann et al 2013 this process is repeated until variables with a high correlation coefficient greater than 0 7 with other variables are completely removed vif is calculated based on the correlation coefficient derived from the regression of one predictor against all other predictors we used the remaining variables five from worldclim seven from chelsa three from cru eight from terraclimate four from prism two from streamcat and seven from earthenv appendices b g to model occurrence climate relationships for each of the focal species 2 4 modeling approach we used maxent version 3 4 4 a maximum entropy based machine learning algorithm as implemented in the r dismo package hijmans et al 2016 to model the distribution of the target species we chose maxent because a it does not require true absence data phillips and dudík 2008 b it can deal with complex interactions between predictors and species occurrence data and c it has performed well in previous studies phillips et al 2006 elith et al 2011 we trained models with 70 of the occurrence data table 1 and associated climate data sets and used the remaining 30 of the observations to evaluate model performance metrics for each species we randomly selected the number of pseudo absence points to equal the number of occurrence records to maintain prevalence in data barbet massin et al 2012 imbalance in prevalence ratio of presences to pseudo absences has been shown to affect model accuracy jiménez valverde et al 2009 we used standard default values for all other settings given that they have been shown to perform well across different taxonomic groups phillips et al 2006 regularization value 1 iterations 500 prediction probability ranging from 0 to 1 we then predicted and mapped habitat suitability values at all grid cells in california in addition to the models comparing the effect of different climate data sets on csdms we built another set of models based on each of the four spatial resolutions of worldclim data sets for all six target species this analysis further allowed us to directly test the hypothesis that increased spatial resolutions of predictors improve model performance this analysis also enabled us to assess whether our conclusions about the effect of spatial resolution on model performance are potentially confounded by the different climate data sets used throughout the analyses to better understand the effect of choosing between alternative climate data on the accuracy of single source csdms we maintained the original spatial resolution and spatial structure of each data set 2 5 model assessment to assess model accuracy and interpretability we computed several performance metrics and visually compared mapped predictions with historical maps we used maxent s percentage variable contribution to identify the strongest predictors for each model percent variable contribution calculates the contribution of each predictor to the regularized training gain of the models the summation of each variable contribution to a model must add up to 100 we assessed overall performance for each model based on the validation data by calculating model sensitivity specificity area under the receiver operator curve statistic auc and true skill statistic tss sensitivity is the percentage or proportion of species presences predicted correctly specificity is the percentage or proportion of species absences that are correctly predicted auc measures model performance relative to a null model as a baseline fielding and bell 1997 auc can vary between 0 and 1 where values less than 0 5 indicate a model that performed no better than random and values closer to 1 indicate a highly performing model auc is a widely used model performance metric but it is often criticized for being unable to identify if models differ in their ability to predict presences and absences correctly hanczar et al 2010 like auc the tss also combines both sensitivity and specificity into a single metric of model performance however tss is less noisy than auc tss derived as sensitivity specificity 1 gives a balance between the ability of the model to predict presences and absences and a good indication of model calibration vezza et al 2015 tss scores range from 1 to 1 where 1 indicates perfect model agreement and values of zero or less indicate a model that performs no better than random allouche et al 2006 we used the presenceabsence r package to calculate all the performance metrics we used the usgs range maps as references to visually examine whether the climate suitability models underpredicted or overpredicted the expert derived species ranges we used histograms to summarize how the statistical distributions of climate suitability values varied across each model finally to assess the similarity between mapped predictions climate suitability maps we computed the spatial correlation between the map outputs from the different climate data set combinations using the continuous mapped predictions from each data set we calculated the pairwise correlation coefficient pearson s r between maps from the different data sets and for each of the different target species 3 results 3 1 effect of climate data on csdm performance we found that the choice of climate data set affected the performance of the csdms however the climate data sets that produced the top and poorest performing models were not the same across all species table 3 the differences in performance metric values were generally small for most species although the tss varied modestly across models for california red legged frog arroyo toad two stripped garter snake and western spadefoot toad table 3 in the analyses involving all data sets there was no clear evidence to suggest that spatial resolution of climate data sets affects csdm performance cru the spatially coarsest data set performed comparably to other data sets for three of the six species california red legged frog two stripped garter snake and california legless lizard table 3 additionally in the analyses involving all four spatial resolutions of the wordclim data there was no clear pattern to suggest that finer resolution predictors improved model performance the effect of spatial resolution of the predictor data sets on model performance was inconsistent table 4 the importance of precipitation and temperature variables varied across species precipitation variables appeared to be the most important for the arroyo toad foothill yellow legged frog western spadefoot toad and california legless lizard appendices c e f g whereas temperature variables were most strongly associated with habitat suitability of the two stripped garter snake and california red legged frog appendices b d 3 2 effect of climate data on csdm interpretation the predicted habitat suitability maps based on different climate data sets sometimes differed markedly from one another and sometimes were similar to one another for example most california red legged frog models underpredicted suitability in parts compared with the historical range map except for the cru based model which overpredicted distributions compared with the historical range map appendix h for two stripped garter snake models built with terraclimate prism and earthenv underpredicted suitability in parts whereas worldclim chelsa cru and streamcat overpredicted suitability compared with historical range maps appendix i for western spadefoot toad all models underpredicted suitability in parts except for the cru based model which overpredicted suitability compared with this species historical range map appendix k regardless of the data set used california legless lizard models tended to underpredict suitability in parts of the central valley and the sierra nevada compared with historical range maps fig 2 in one of the extreme cases of overprediction the mapped predictions for the arroyo toad based on worldclim prism and streamcat unrealistically extended into the northern part and edges of the central valley of california fig 1 conversely the california legless lizard was an extreme case of underprediction all the climate data sets underpredicted the southernmost range limit extending from los angeles to san diego of california legless lizard except for the cru and streamcat based models fig 2 high performing models based on tss did not always result in mapped predictions that closely corresponded with the historical range of a target species and vice versa for example even though the tss values were substantially different between the prism based tss 0 36 and chelsa based tss 0 75 foothill yellow legged frog models little difference existed in their mapped predictions appendices j l and m table 3 although the climate suitability maps did not differ in a consistent manner for the most part suitability maps based on wordclim data and its derivatives such as chelsa and earthenv were most similar across species compared to the other data sets appendix m of all the target species the foothill yellow legged frog model predictions were the most similar regardless of the climate data set pairing the lowest correlation coefficient recorded was between cru and earthenv based predictions r 0 74 appendix m 4 discussion climate is a core aspect of a species niche and csdms should therefore be useful tools for assessing the suitabilities of different locations for species however despite the increased availability and accessibility of climate data sets it is uncertain how different climate data sets affect performance metrics and interpretation spatial accuracy of csdms the few studies that have investigated the effect of using different climate data sets for modeling the distribution of different species e g para and manahan 2008 watling et al 2014 datta et al 2020 jiménez valverde et al 2021 tend to compare only two data sets at a time we took advantage of the increasing accessibility and availability of climate data sets to compare the effects of climate data sources on csdms our study showed that the performance metrics and spatial accuracy of csdms can vary depending on the climate data see figs 1 and 2 table 3 whilst the effect of spatial resolution of climate data was inconsistent table 3 and 4 below we discuss the nature and magnitude of the discrepancies we observed among models and the implications these differences may have for conservation decision making 4 1 effects of climate data sets and spatial resolutions on model performance our results suggest that model performance and interpretation vary with the choice of climate data sets the literature on the effects of different climate data sets on csdm performance is neither consistent nor conclusive as also indicated in our study for example watling et al 2014 compared the performance of sdms developed for 12 imperiled vertebrates in florida based on two climate data sets worldclim and cru and found no significant difference in model performance when they compared chi square results for models based on auc and kappa in contrast datta et al 2020 reported that sdms for invasive plant species in the western himalayas based on chelsa data outperformed models based on worldclim data in the training area however when models were transferred to a new area model performance flipped with worldclim outperforming chelsa our results showed that if we had used just two climate data sets we could have observed either similar or different model performances for each of the six target species which highlights the importance of evaluating multiple climate data sets when developing and selecting csdms a comparison of different model performance metrics was not the focus of our study but discrepancies in model performance scores support the need for assessing multiple performance metrics for model evaluation for example we found that even when variation existed in performance scores three of the four performance metrics we calculated were mostly above values considered to be acceptable table 3 e g sensitivity specificity and auc values 0 7 landis and koch 1977 swets 1988 only tss differed markedly across models this trend in tss was not surprising as tss has the potential to distinguish model performance well allouche et al 2006 however despite the high performance metric scores based on tss for most models there were discrepancies in mapped predictions across models highly performing models did not always result in mapped predictions that were close to the historical range maps of the species in general our results support watling et al 2014 recommendation that multiple performance metrics should be used when assessing model performance especially given that different metrics assess different aspects of a model s performance our results do not support the assertion that finer spatial resolution in predictor variables improves model predictive performance c f connor et al 2018 manzoor et al 2018 scales et al 2017 nezer et al 2017 for example in our study csdms trained with the coarser resolution cru data set performed as well for four species california red legged frog two stripped garter snake western spadefoot toad and california legless lizard as finer resolution climate data however spatial resolution may matter for model interpretability and transferability our models based on the coarser resolution cru data tended to overpredict suitable areas for target species this result is consistent with connor et al 2018 who showed that coarser resolution data predicted 14 times more suitable habitat on average than the true areas for each of four species in a simulation models based on coarse resolution data will not capture the effects of small scale environmental variability that may be critical in determining the specific locations where a species is found or can persist fernández and hamilton 2015 the inconsistencies in the effect of spatial resolution on model performance based on the different resolutions of worldclim data indicate that the effect of spatial resolution is independent of the climate data sets for the target species future modeling studies should continue to assess the effects that spatial resolution of predictors may have on both model performance metrics and specific spatial distributions this comparative analysis of spatial resolutions will help to determine the scale that best suits the species being modeled peterman et al 2014 connor et al 2018 4 2 effects of climate data sets on model predictions uncertainties associated with climate data sets can lead to unrealistic sdm fits spurious predictions and erroneous conservation decisions for example arroyo toads are historically known to occupy the coastal drainages ranging from monterey county in california to the baja peninsula in mexico gergus et al 1997 grismer 2002 however the csdms we developed based on cru prism and streamcat data sets overpredicted the arroyo toad s california range into parts of the central valley coastal ranges and the sierra nevada given that the chelsa data set accounts for orographic precipitation we expected that models developed with chelsa derived predictors would better predict the distribution of species whose ranges extend into mountainous areas such as california red legged frog and foothill yellow legged frog stebbins 2003 bradley shaffer et al 2004 the mapped predictions based on the chelsa data set included some of the foothill yellow legged frog s range in the sierra nevada foothills but did not do so for the california red legged frog previous studies have also reported variation in the spatial predictions of models developed with alternative climate data sets for example the datta et al 2020 study reported unrealistic overpredictions from models derived with chelsa data compared with those based on worldclim data spatial predictions derived from models of imperiled vertebrate species using worldclim and cru data sets also varied watling et al 2014 however the degree of discrepancy was lesser for current climatic conditions compared with future climatic conditions the variations in our mapped predictions and previous studies highlight the uncertainties associated with climate data sets and the potential implications these uncertainties have for species conservation and management in general models could underpredict or overpredict a species range for some potential reasons we have long known that climate is an important driver of species distributions and the target species we studied appear to have distinctly different climate niches although csdms have been widely used to understand the effect of climate species distributions important caveats apply the primary assumption of csdms is that climate either directly affects distributions e g temperature or is a surrogate for other habitat requirements e g soil or vegetation pearson and dawson 2003 the extent to which climate predictors capture the habitat requirements of species is critical for interpreting csdms if the selected predictors do not adequately reflect the species habitat requirements then subsequent model predictions may either overestimate or underestimate actual habitat suitability pearson and dawson 2003 because we are limited to the available climate predictors in a particular climate data it is important to understand if these climate predictors adequately characterize habitat conditions our models appear to generally capture habitat conditions of our target species although more so for some species than others for example arroyo toads typically breed in shallow and slow moving streams that are frequently and naturally disturbed by floods sweet and sullivan 2005 historically suitable habitats were known to extend from fort hunter liggett in monterey county the northernmost extent of their range southward through the transverse and peninsular ranges price and sullivan 1998 these regions were predicted to be highly suitable for the arroyo toad by our models except for those based on cru prism and streamcat data in which the predictions into the coastal ranges and the sierra nevada are not known to be suitable regions for the species fig 1 these overpredictions could potentially be a result of the models not being able to distinguish areas with frequent floods from those with less frequent floods we observed underpredictions of habitat suitability with some species for example the amount of precipitation is a critical climatic factor for california red legged frog as more rainfall provides more habitats that allow for increased reproduction and dispersal usfws 2010 in addition the rates of embryonic development for several rana species native to north america are strongly affected by temperature and the development rates are highest close to a species critical thermal maximum moore 1942 the critical thermal maximum of the california red legged frog is unknown but lab experiments suggest that it is at least 23 c for eggs unpublished data reported by cook and jennings 2007 our model predictions were generally consistent with this species known habitat requirements however most models predicted low habitat suitability in the sierra nevada and the chelsa and streamcat models did not predict any non zero level of suitability in this region foothill yellow legged frogs favor partially shaded perennial streams and rivers at low to moderate elevations hayes and jennings 1988 reproduction in foothill yellow legged frogs is highly temperature dependent the minimum temperature required for oviposition is 10 c and water temperatures at breeding sites have been shown to correlate with breeding activities wheeler et al 2015 our model predictions appendix j match what we know about the habitat requirements of this species in california however the models predicted only marginal suitability for parts of the sierra nevada an area known to be highly suitable for the species jennings and hayes 1994 at this time we do not understand why suitability is underpredicted in these regions the california legless lizard can tolerate a wide temperature range and its upper thermal limit is 40 c miller 1944 this wide temperature range allows the species to adjust to extreme temperatures our model predictions were largely consistent with the known thermal ecology of this species however models mostly underpredicted suitability in parts of the central valley and the sierra nevada that were historically known to be suitable fig 2 given that this specie favors loose soil it is likely that the climate variables we used are not good surrogates for this type of soil condition in general the lack of consistency in how different species characteristics affect model performance highlights the need for both more thorough ecological knowledge of target species and predictors other than climate variables factors other than climate can affect the performance of sdms we used only climate variables for developing our models because of the importance of climate on species distributions hijmans and grahams 2006 and the frequent use of just climate variables in sdms watling et al 2014 borzée et al 2019 however several other types of predictor variables will likely be needed to accurately predict species habitat suitabilities and distributions our results should not be construed to imply that only climate predictors are important for predicting species distributions for example competition maynard et al 2017 presence or absence of predation risk abdulwahab et al 2019 dispersal ability pulliam 1988 topography and land use can all affect where organisms are found or live at a particular time and season historical constraints on dispersal can limit the spatial extent of distributions independent of the presence of otherwise suitably climate conditions however in the absence of dispersal limitations species may be able to colonize new environments outside of their current ranges in the future additionally the large individual grid cells of all climate data sets may be poor predictors of the occurrence of patches of small scale micro climate conditions suitable for a species scheffers et al 2014 suggitt et al 2011 also edaphic factors may not strongly correlate with climatic predictors and can independently affect species distributions sugalski and claussen 1997 for example regions with similar climates but different geologies will have different soils that may influence species occurrence antonelli et al 2018 we focused on using only climate predictors to facilitate a comparison of how differences in one important class of variables might affect model performance given that similar climate predictors might differ in how they are derived we recommend that researchers investigate what specific climate variables are available in different climate data sets and use a standardized variable selection protocol when comparing data sets to ensure the difference in model performance are not the result of differences in how subsets of predictor variables are selected from the entire list of potential variables in the data sets in our study we used range maps of each target species as a yardstick to compare how well our models predicted the extent of suitable habitat range maps are prepared by experts based on their own judgment of a species historical distributions and are themselves subject to error also a species is typically not found everywhere within the boundary of a range map range maps may also miss some areas with peripheral populations despite their shortcomings range maps were the best option we had for accessing the spatial accuracy of our models 4 3 implications for species distribution modeling and conservation sdms can be used to inform recommendations regarding conservation planning and management one such sdm application is the assessment of what climate conditions support different species of interest or concern hijmans and graham 2006 another important use of sdms is to identify locations to survey in the future in many cases insufficient resources exist to survey large areas and a targeted approach must be adopted chadès et al 2011 however if the results of sdms are to be useful it is important to understand the sources of data error and how those errors affect the uncertainty of predictions in addition to several other factors known to affect the reliability of sdm results e g modeling technique variable selection collinearity of predictors differences among climate data sets can clearly affect the uncertainty of predicted species distributions our study highlights the importance of exercising care in using mapped predictions from csdms in conservation decision making for example the discrepancies in the mapped prediction of csdms may cause conservation mistakes such as the appropriation of limited conservation dollars to protect habitats that do not support target species carvalho et al 2010 additionally the discrepancies in model predictions associated with climate data sources that we and others have observed highlight the need to integrate the analyses of climate data sources as a critical first step when modeling species distribution although our study compared how seven climate data sets affected csdm performance and spatial accuracy the climate data sets we used are in no way exhaustive we primarily compiled freely available data sets that are representative of the different data sets available and widely used for modeling species distributions a common practice in the species distribution modeling community is to build ensembles by calculating the mean of individual model predictions hao et al 2020 thuiller et al 2019 although ensemble models may help understand the variability in predictions and potential uncertainties that are associated with individual models they do not guarantee the most accurate predictions an averaged ensemble model prediction must be less accurate than those from the actual best performing individual model as demonstrated by several previous studies e g crimmins et al 2013 hao et al 2020 knutti et al 2010 as additional climate data sets become available e g cmcc bioclimind noce et al 2020 cmip phase 6 durack 2020 we need to assess if they improve our ability to predict species distributions doing so will help us better understand how species respond to changing climatic conditions and develop effective management strategies credit authorship contribution statement umarfarooq a abdulwahab

24386,climate is a core aspect of a species niche that is frequently incorporated into species distribution models sdms the proliferation of readily accessible climate data is stimulating the increasing use of climate based species distribution models csdms in conservation planning and management however it is uncertain how sensitive csdms are to the choice of climate data used we compared the performance of maximum entropy based csdms calibrated with seven different climate data sets worldclim chelsa terraclimate climate research unit time series cru ts prism streamcat and earthenv for each species four amphibians and two reptiles in california we used a standardized objective procedure to select climate predictors from each data set we then assessed performance with standard metrics calculated variable importance scores and compared predicted distributions to historical range maps of the target species the climate data set used affected csdm performance with models based on some data sets overpredicting and others underpredicting distributions compared with historical range maps of each of the species critically for the six species we tested no one climate data set always performed worst or best these results indicate that the effects of different climate data sets should be incorporated into model evaluation when developing applying and interpreting climate based sdms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords climate climate data sets climate based species distribution models maximum entropy model mapped predictions historical range maps 1 introduction climate is among the most important determinants of where species are found peterson and dawson 2003 since the early 19th century overwhelming scientific evidence has shown that the global climate is changing rapidly and it is adversely affecting species and ecosystems in general species climate suitabilities are moving northwards and upwards respectively chen et al 2011 these shifts are associated with climate induced changes in the location of physiologically optimal and tolerable temperatures pörtner 2001 the availability and abundance of food and habitats mantyka pringle et al 2012 interspecific interactions suttle et al 2007 the timing of seasonal life history events such as migration blooming and reproduction post et al 2001 and the rate of species extinctions cahill et al 2013 in response to this crisis conservationists have devised techniques to both quantify the effects climate change will have on species and their habitats to better inform decisions regarding conservation actions climate based species distribution models hereafter csdms represent a method to quantify how climate affects the probability that species will exist in a given location throughout this paper we use csdms to refer to models built with only climate predictors and species distribution models sdms for models that may include a variety of types of predictor variables including climate variables several studies have assessed different aspects of csdm performance and interpretation because of their potential utility in conservation planning and management for example a common problem often encountered when developing csdms is deciding which climate data set or database to use some progress has been made in comparing the effects of climate data sources on model performance but these comparisons tend to focus on comparing just two data sets at a time para and manahan 2008 watling et al 2014 datta et al 2020 jiménez valverde et al 2021 with the increasing availability and accessibility of climate data sets it is now possible to conduct more thorough comparisons of how climate data sources affect csdms climate based species distribution models belong to a category of sdms that associate species occurrence or abundance records with climatic data such as monthly temperature and precipitation to estimate a species bioclimatic niche or envelope pearson and dawson 2003 these associations are then used to generate predictions that can be visualized as maps of habitat suitability or occurrence probability for the modeled species elith and leathwick 2009 the resulting suitability maps are assumed to be representative of the climatic range within which a species can live lomolino et al 2005 in addition csdms assume that if the current climate suitability of a species is accurately estimated then the model can be used to generate future predictions franklin 2010 although csdms can provide useful information uncertainties associated with the predictors used for model building can potentially lead to misleading conservation and management decisions baker et al 2016 synes and osborne 2011 it is therefore important to understand how csdms and resulting suitability maps are sensitive to predictors the two major input data required for developing csdms are occurrence data species presences absences and abundances and climate predictors generally occurrence data are gathered in two ways 1 as actual recordings of observed species at point locations or specimen collections e g global biodiversity information facility gbif http www gbif org inaturalist https www inaturalist org observations and natureserve https explorer natureserve org databases and 2 through sampling of pseudo occurrences within the extent of expert derived range maps maps representing the geographic boundaries within which a species can occur e g the international union for conservation of nature range maps yannic et al 2014 fourcade et al 2016 there are uncertainties associated with each of the occurrence data types point observations can underestimate true species distributions because of biased or incomplete sampling efforts imprecise recordings species misidentification and uneven coverage of a species life history stages rondinini et al 2006 conversely expert derived range maps do not document specifically where species occur within a range peterson et al 2018 there are also inherent uncertainties associated with climate data climate data are either collected directly from weather stations interpolated from weather station data derived from remotely sensed data or estimated from some combination of different approaches apart from the inherent uncertainties in the different approaches used for generating climate data other data attributes and treatments can potentially affect csdm accuracy and interpretation for example collinearity of predictor variables discrepancies in variable selection techniques used in model building and mismatches between the spatial and temporal resolution of predictor variables can all reduce the reliability and specificity of sdms here we focus on how the collective differences among climate data sets in spatial and temporal resolution spatial extent and the specific variables they contain affect csdm performance and interpretation the performance of different data sets may be influenced by not only the specific variables the data set contains but also by the data s spatial and temporal resolution extent and how estimates of climate conditions at individual grid cells are derived the effects of climate data sources on model performance are especially important to recognize because many ecologists will build csdms from a single climate data source ecologists can now choose from multiple readily accessible climate data sets overpeck et al 2011 but little guidance exists on which ones to use and why even though some climate data sources have similar predictor variables data sets can differ in their spatial extents of coverage e g global as in worldclim and continental as in prism temporal resolutions spatial resolutions the weather station data used to produce the coverages and the interpolation techniques used to produce spatially continuous grids of the variables in addition some climate data sets include continuous grids of uniform size such as worldclim flick and hijmans 2017 and terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 whereas others tend to cover only a portion of the landscape stream reaches or watersheds and the cell size of the coverage can vary substantially e g streamcat hill et al 2016 and earthenv domisch et al 2015 given the inherent mismatch between the grid size of mapped climate data and the size of habitat patches occupied by individuals of different species differences in the spatial resolution of available climate data sets may affect sdm accuracy and interpretability pearson and dawson 2003 seo et al 2009 fine resolution predictors should improve models as they more precisely delineate spatial variation in climate associated with local scale landscape features such as rivers corridors roads etc lawes and piper 1998 hess et al 2006 however studies on the effects of spatial resolution have produced inconsistent results for example habitat suitability modeling of different bird species has shown that fine spatial resolution can improve model performance as measured by area under the receiver operating curve auc however this improvement was only the case for most species when modeled at a very small spatial resolution of 1 m gottschalk et al 2011 guisan et al 2007 reported that a 10 fold increase in spatial resolution of predictors reduced sdm performance for some species but had little to no effect or even improved auc in other species additionally other studies have reported enhanced model performance with either fine spatial resolution scales et al 2017 nezer et al 2017 or coarse spatial resolution predictors tobalske 2002 these initial studies imply that differences between climate data sets in one or more attributes may generally influence csdm performance however no empirical studies have yet been conducted that comprehensively compare csdm performance across multiple climate data sets in this study we use a standard approach to compare how different climate data sets that vary in extent spatial resolution and how different climate variables were estimated affect csdm performance metrics and interpretation 2 methods 2 1 general approach to understand how climate data sets affect csdms we assembled and analyzed publicly available species occurrence and climate data we assembled georeferenced records of occurrence for six imperiled species that occur in california and seven commonly used climate data sets that vary in the extent of coverages and spatial resolution we eliminated highly correlated predictors from each climate data set and retained only the climatic variables that were uncorrelated for example out of the 19 bioclimatic variables of the wordclim data set we retained five uncorrelated temperature and precipitation variables we used the maximum entropy maxent modeling framework to build csdms because it requires only presence data we then used several metrics to assess model performance and used the models to map how predicted habitat suitability varied across all of california for each target species finally we compared habitat suitability maps to historical range maps of each species and assessed the similarities between climate suitability maps for each climate data source and each species 2 2 focal species and occurrence data we compiled occurrence data for the six target species table 1 from the global biodiversity information facility database gbif http www gbif org downloaded march 16 and 18 2021 the target species included california red legged frog rana draytonii baird and girard 1852 arroyo toad anaxyrus californicus camp 1915 two striped garter snake thamnophis hammondii kennicott 1860 foothill yellow legged frog rana boylii baird 1854 western spadefoot toad spea hammondii baird 1859 and california legless lizard anniella pulchra gray 1852 to maximize temporal matching between occurrence and climate data see below we only used occurrence records from 2015 to 2019 we also dropped occurrence records that lacked latitude and longitude coordinates and we removed duplicate records finally we obtained range maps for each target species from the united states geological surveys usgs gap analysis project on vertebrate species ranges portal https gapanalysis usgs gov apps species data download accessed march 18 2021 range maps represent the geographic limits within which species can be found based on expert judgment in the usgs gap project the best information available about known species ranges from multiple sources was compiled and intersected with hydrologic units huc 12 usgs gap 2018 these data sets were then attributed with information regarding species occurrence presence extant possibly present potentially present extirpated origin native introduced reintroduced vagrant reproductive use breeding non breeding both and seasonal use year round summer winter migratory vagrant given the absence of extensive and comprehensive survey data range maps provide a way of comparing sdm predictions with our best understanding of each species historical distribution 2 3 climate data sets we assembled climate predictors from seven commonly used and publicly accessible databases table 2 appendix a the databases include worldclim v 2 1 flick and hijmans 2017 chelsa v 1 2 climatologies at high resolution for the earth s land surface areas karger et al 2017 cru ts v 4 0 4 climate research unit time series harris et al 2020 terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model daly et al 2008 stream catchment hill et al 2016 and earthenv domisch et al 2015 all data sets consist of climate interpolations extrapolations and differ in their spatial extent spatial resolution temporal resolution and level of landscape coverage the worldclim v 2 data set hereafter worldclim has a global extent and consists of 19 bioclimatic variables averages of 1950 to 2000 estimates available in four spatial resolutions we used the 30 s 1 km resolution data the predictors include precipitation and temperature means extremes measures of variability and measures of seasonality that are considered to be associated with species distributions dupin et al 2011 the chelsa v 1 2 data set hereafter chelsa has global coverage and contains 19 bioclimatic variables however the chelsa data differ from the worldclim data in that interpolation of precipitation is adjusted for the effects of elevation and aspect in other words although both worldclim and chelsa data sets contain the same 19 bioclimatic predictors the models that generate these databases estimate the amount of precipitation differently as a consequence precipitation tends to be lower in worldclim than in chelsa cru ts v 4 0 4 hereafter cru includes gridded climate time series data derived from monthly observations at meteorological stations across the global land surface areas excluding antarctica the data set consists of monthly climate anomalies with a resolution of 50 km cru is the coarsest of all the climate data sets we analyzed the terraclimate data set has 4 km spatial resolution and describes the monthly climate and climate water balance for terrestrial landscapes across the globe abatzoglou et al 2018 the prism data set covers the conterminous united states and consists of 30 year climate normals for this project we used the 800 m resolution 30 year averages of monthly precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature for the period 1981 to 2010 the stream catchment hereafter streamcat data set describes geo climatic conditions at each of 2 65 million stream segments and their corresponding catchments within the conterminous united states streamcat contains a large suite of both natural and land use variables but we extracted only climate variables for use in this study table 3 we used data expressed at both local catchment areas on the landscape laterally upslope of stream segments but not including upstream contributions and watershed level true contributing areas upslope and upstream of the reach scales of aggregation we created raster layers of the focal streamcat climate predictors in arcmap 10 6 1 esri 2016 for california by joining the streamcat data set to stream catchments and watersheds available in the national hydrography data set plus version 2 nhdplusv2 usgs 2019 the earthenv data set has near global 1 km resolution coverage and includes bioclimatic variables relevant to stream ecosystems the earthenv data set describes climatic conditions for stream networks so we used the rastertools feature verbruggen 2012 in arcmap to move the location of the gbif occurrence record to the nearest raster cell that overlapped with a stream channel collinearity among predictors may affect model results and different mixes of predictors can generate different parameter estimates slopes meloun et al 2002 dorman et al 2013 de marco and nóbrega 2018 if two variables are highly correlated it is difficult to differentiate the potential effect of one variable from the other dormann et al 2013 to minimize multicollinearity among predictors we used a standardized procedure to select subsets of predictors from each climate data set during model construction first we used the crop and mask functions of the raster package in the r statistical software r development core team 2020 to clip the raster layers to include only the state of california then we used the vifcor function in the package usdm naimi 2015 to identify and eliminate highly correlated variables within each data set the vifcor function first identifies a pair of variables that has the maximum correlation with r 0 7 and excludes the variable with the higher variance inflation factor vif dormann et al 2013 this process is repeated until variables with a high correlation coefficient greater than 0 7 with other variables are completely removed vif is calculated based on the correlation coefficient derived from the regression of one predictor against all other predictors we used the remaining variables five from worldclim seven from chelsa three from cru eight from terraclimate four from prism two from streamcat and seven from earthenv appendices b g to model occurrence climate relationships for each of the focal species 2 4 modeling approach we used maxent version 3 4 4 a maximum entropy based machine learning algorithm as implemented in the r dismo package hijmans et al 2016 to model the distribution of the target species we chose maxent because a it does not require true absence data phillips and dudík 2008 b it can deal with complex interactions between predictors and species occurrence data and c it has performed well in previous studies phillips et al 2006 elith et al 2011 we trained models with 70 of the occurrence data table 1 and associated climate data sets and used the remaining 30 of the observations to evaluate model performance metrics for each species we randomly selected the number of pseudo absence points to equal the number of occurrence records to maintain prevalence in data barbet massin et al 2012 imbalance in prevalence ratio of presences to pseudo absences has been shown to affect model accuracy jiménez valverde et al 2009 we used standard default values for all other settings given that they have been shown to perform well across different taxonomic groups phillips et al 2006 regularization value 1 iterations 500 prediction probability ranging from 0 to 1 we then predicted and mapped habitat suitability values at all grid cells in california in addition to the models comparing the effect of different climate data sets on csdms we built another set of models based on each of the four spatial resolutions of worldclim data sets for all six target species this analysis further allowed us to directly test the hypothesis that increased spatial resolutions of predictors improve model performance this analysis also enabled us to assess whether our conclusions about the effect of spatial resolution on model performance are potentially confounded by the different climate data sets used throughout the analyses to better understand the effect of choosing between alternative climate data on the accuracy of single source csdms we maintained the original spatial resolution and spatial structure of each data set 2 5 model assessment to assess model accuracy and interpretability we computed several performance metrics and visually compared mapped predictions with historical maps we used maxent s percentage variable contribution to identify the strongest predictors for each model percent variable contribution calculates the contribution of each predictor to the regularized training gain of the models the summation of each variable contribution to a model must add up to 100 we assessed overall performance for each model based on the validation data by calculating model sensitivity specificity area under the receiver operator curve statistic auc and true skill statistic tss sensitivity is the percentage or proportion of species presences predicted correctly specificity is the percentage or proportion of species absences that are correctly predicted auc measures model performance relative to a null model as a baseline fielding and bell 1997 auc can vary between 0 and 1 where values less than 0 5 indicate a model that performed no better than random and values closer to 1 indicate a highly performing model auc is a widely used model performance metric but it is often criticized for being unable to identify if models differ in their ability to predict presences and absences correctly hanczar et al 2010 like auc the tss also combines both sensitivity and specificity into a single metric of model performance however tss is less noisy than auc tss derived as sensitivity specificity 1 gives a balance between the ability of the model to predict presences and absences and a good indication of model calibration vezza et al 2015 tss scores range from 1 to 1 where 1 indicates perfect model agreement and values of zero or less indicate a model that performs no better than random allouche et al 2006 we used the presenceabsence r package to calculate all the performance metrics we used the usgs range maps as references to visually examine whether the climate suitability models underpredicted or overpredicted the expert derived species ranges we used histograms to summarize how the statistical distributions of climate suitability values varied across each model finally to assess the similarity between mapped predictions climate suitability maps we computed the spatial correlation between the map outputs from the different climate data set combinations using the continuous mapped predictions from each data set we calculated the pairwise correlation coefficient pearson s r between maps from the different data sets and for each of the different target species 3 results 3 1 effect of climate data on csdm performance we found that the choice of climate data set affected the performance of the csdms however the climate data sets that produced the top and poorest performing models were not the same across all species table 3 the differences in performance metric values were generally small for most species although the tss varied modestly across models for california red legged frog arroyo toad two stripped garter snake and western spadefoot toad table 3 in the analyses involving all data sets there was no clear evidence to suggest that spatial resolution of climate data sets affects csdm performance cru the spatially coarsest data set performed comparably to other data sets for three of the six species california red legged frog two stripped garter snake and california legless lizard table 3 additionally in the analyses involving all four spatial resolutions of the wordclim data there was no clear pattern to suggest that finer resolution predictors improved model performance the effect of spatial resolution of the predictor data sets on model performance was inconsistent table 4 the importance of precipitation and temperature variables varied across species precipitation variables appeared to be the most important for the arroyo toad foothill yellow legged frog western spadefoot toad and california legless lizard appendices c e f g whereas temperature variables were most strongly associated with habitat suitability of the two stripped garter snake and california red legged frog appendices b d 3 2 effect of climate data on csdm interpretation the predicted habitat suitability maps based on different climate data sets sometimes differed markedly from one another and sometimes were similar to one another for example most california red legged frog models underpredicted suitability in parts compared with the historical range map except for the cru based model which overpredicted distributions compared with the historical range map appendix h for two stripped garter snake models built with terraclimate prism and earthenv underpredicted suitability in parts whereas worldclim chelsa cru and streamcat overpredicted suitability compared with historical range maps appendix i for western spadefoot toad all models underpredicted suitability in parts except for the cru based model which overpredicted suitability compared with this species historical range map appendix k regardless of the data set used california legless lizard models tended to underpredict suitability in parts of the central valley and the sierra nevada compared with historical range maps fig 2 in one of the extreme cases of overprediction the mapped predictions for the arroyo toad based on worldclim prism and streamcat unrealistically extended into the northern part and edges of the central valley of california fig 1 conversely the california legless lizard was an extreme case of underprediction all the climate data sets underpredicted the southernmost range limit extending from los angeles to san diego of california legless lizard except for the cru and streamcat based models fig 2 high performing models based on tss did not always result in mapped predictions that closely corresponded with the historical range of a target species and vice versa for example even though the tss values were substantially different between the prism based tss 0 36 and chelsa based tss 0 75 foothill yellow legged frog models little difference existed in their mapped predictions appendices j l and m table 3 although the climate suitability maps did not differ in a consistent manner for the most part suitability maps based on wordclim data and its derivatives such as chelsa and earthenv were most similar across species compared to the other data sets appendix m of all the target species the foothill yellow legged frog model predictions were the most similar regardless of the climate data set pairing the lowest correlation coefficient recorded was between cru and earthenv based predictions r 0 74 appendix m 4 discussion climate is a core aspect of a species niche and csdms should therefore be useful tools for assessing the suitabilities of different locations for species however despite the increased availability and accessibility of climate data sets it is uncertain how different climate data sets affect performance metrics and interpretation spatial accuracy of csdms the few studies that have investigated the effect of using different climate data sets for modeling the distribution of different species e g para and manahan 2008 watling et al 2014 datta et al 2020 jiménez valverde et al 2021 tend to compare only two data sets at a time we took advantage of the increasing accessibility and availability of climate data sets to compare the effects of climate data sources on csdms our study showed that the performance metrics and spatial accuracy of csdms can vary depending on the climate data see figs 1 and 2 table 3 whilst the effect of spatial resolution of climate data was inconsistent table 3 and 4 below we discuss the nature and magnitude of the discrepancies we observed among models and the implications these differences may have for conservation decision making 4 1 effects of climate data sets and spatial resolutions on model performance our results suggest that model performance and interpretation vary with the choice of climate data sets the literature on the effects of different climate data sets on csdm performance is neither consistent nor conclusive as also indicated in our study for example watling et al 2014 compared the performance of sdms developed for 12 imperiled vertebrates in florida based on two climate data sets worldclim and cru and found no significant difference in model performance when they compared chi square results for models based on auc and kappa in contrast datta et al 2020 reported that sdms for invasive plant species in the western himalayas based on chelsa data outperformed models based on worldclim data in the training area however when models were transferred to a new area model performance flipped with worldclim outperforming chelsa our results showed that if we had used just two climate data sets we could have observed either similar or different model performances for each of the six target species which highlights the importance of evaluating multiple climate data sets when developing and selecting csdms a comparison of different model performance metrics was not the focus of our study but discrepancies in model performance scores support the need for assessing multiple performance metrics for model evaluation for example we found that even when variation existed in performance scores three of the four performance metrics we calculated were mostly above values considered to be acceptable table 3 e g sensitivity specificity and auc values 0 7 landis and koch 1977 swets 1988 only tss differed markedly across models this trend in tss was not surprising as tss has the potential to distinguish model performance well allouche et al 2006 however despite the high performance metric scores based on tss for most models there were discrepancies in mapped predictions across models highly performing models did not always result in mapped predictions that were close to the historical range maps of the species in general our results support watling et al 2014 recommendation that multiple performance metrics should be used when assessing model performance especially given that different metrics assess different aspects of a model s performance our results do not support the assertion that finer spatial resolution in predictor variables improves model predictive performance c f connor et al 2018 manzoor et al 2018 scales et al 2017 nezer et al 2017 for example in our study csdms trained with the coarser resolution cru data set performed as well for four species california red legged frog two stripped garter snake western spadefoot toad and california legless lizard as finer resolution climate data however spatial resolution may matter for model interpretability and transferability our models based on the coarser resolution cru data tended to overpredict suitable areas for target species this result is consistent with connor et al 2018 who showed that coarser resolution data predicted 14 times more suitable habitat on average than the true areas for each of four species in a simulation models based on coarse resolution data will not capture the effects of small scale environmental variability that may be critical in determining the specific locations where a species is found or can persist fernández and hamilton 2015 the inconsistencies in the effect of spatial resolution on model performance based on the different resolutions of worldclim data indicate that the effect of spatial resolution is independent of the climate data sets for the target species future modeling studies should continue to assess the effects that spatial resolution of predictors may have on both model performance metrics and specific spatial distributions this comparative analysis of spatial resolutions will help to determine the scale that best suits the species being modeled peterman et al 2014 connor et al 2018 4 2 effects of climate data sets on model predictions uncertainties associated with climate data sets can lead to unrealistic sdm fits spurious predictions and erroneous conservation decisions for example arroyo toads are historically known to occupy the coastal drainages ranging from monterey county in california to the baja peninsula in mexico gergus et al 1997 grismer 2002 however the csdms we developed based on cru prism and streamcat data sets overpredicted the arroyo toad s california range into parts of the central valley coastal ranges and the sierra nevada given that the chelsa data set accounts for orographic precipitation we expected that models developed with chelsa derived predictors would better predict the distribution of species whose ranges extend into mountainous areas such as california red legged frog and foothill yellow legged frog stebbins 2003 bradley shaffer et al 2004 the mapped predictions based on the chelsa data set included some of the foothill yellow legged frog s range in the sierra nevada foothills but did not do so for the california red legged frog previous studies have also reported variation in the spatial predictions of models developed with alternative climate data sets for example the datta et al 2020 study reported unrealistic overpredictions from models derived with chelsa data compared with those based on worldclim data spatial predictions derived from models of imperiled vertebrate species using worldclim and cru data sets also varied watling et al 2014 however the degree of discrepancy was lesser for current climatic conditions compared with future climatic conditions the variations in our mapped predictions and previous studies highlight the uncertainties associated with climate data sets and the potential implications these uncertainties have for species conservation and management in general models could underpredict or overpredict a species range for some potential reasons we have long known that climate is an important driver of species distributions and the target species we studied appear to have distinctly different climate niches although csdms have been widely used to understand the effect of climate species distributions important caveats apply the primary assumption of csdms is that climate either directly affects distributions e g temperature or is a surrogate for other habitat requirements e g soil or vegetation pearson and dawson 2003 the extent to which climate predictors capture the habitat requirements of species is critical for interpreting csdms if the selected predictors do not adequately reflect the species habitat requirements then subsequent model predictions may either overestimate or underestimate actual habitat suitability pearson and dawson 2003 because we are limited to the available climate predictors in a particular climate data it is important to understand if these climate predictors adequately characterize habitat conditions our models appear to generally capture habitat conditions of our target species although more so for some species than others for example arroyo toads typically breed in shallow and slow moving streams that are frequently and naturally disturbed by floods sweet and sullivan 2005 historically suitable habitats were known to extend from fort hunter liggett in monterey county the northernmost extent of their range southward through the transverse and peninsular ranges price and sullivan 1998 these regions were predicted to be highly suitable for the arroyo toad by our models except for those based on cru prism and streamcat data in which the predictions into the coastal ranges and the sierra nevada are not known to be suitable regions for the species fig 1 these overpredictions could potentially be a result of the models not being able to distinguish areas with frequent floods from those with less frequent floods we observed underpredictions of habitat suitability with some species for example the amount of precipitation is a critical climatic factor for california red legged frog as more rainfall provides more habitats that allow for increased reproduction and dispersal usfws 2010 in addition the rates of embryonic development for several rana species native to north america are strongly affected by temperature and the development rates are highest close to a species critical thermal maximum moore 1942 the critical thermal maximum of the california red legged frog is unknown but lab experiments suggest that it is at least 23 c for eggs unpublished data reported by cook and jennings 2007 our model predictions were generally consistent with this species known habitat requirements however most models predicted low habitat suitability in the sierra nevada and the chelsa and streamcat models did not predict any non zero level of suitability in this region foothill yellow legged frogs favor partially shaded perennial streams and rivers at low to moderate elevations hayes and jennings 1988 reproduction in foothill yellow legged frogs is highly temperature dependent the minimum temperature required for oviposition is 10 c and water temperatures at breeding sites have been shown to correlate with breeding activities wheeler et al 2015 our model predictions appendix j match what we know about the habitat requirements of this species in california however the models predicted only marginal suitability for parts of the sierra nevada an area known to be highly suitable for the species jennings and hayes 1994 at this time we do not understand why suitability is underpredicted in these regions the california legless lizard can tolerate a wide temperature range and its upper thermal limit is 40 c miller 1944 this wide temperature range allows the species to adjust to extreme temperatures our model predictions were largely consistent with the known thermal ecology of this species however models mostly underpredicted suitability in parts of the central valley and the sierra nevada that were historically known to be suitable fig 2 given that this specie favors loose soil it is likely that the climate variables we used are not good surrogates for this type of soil condition in general the lack of consistency in how different species characteristics affect model performance highlights the need for both more thorough ecological knowledge of target species and predictors other than climate variables factors other than climate can affect the performance of sdms we used only climate variables for developing our models because of the importance of climate on species distributions hijmans and grahams 2006 and the frequent use of just climate variables in sdms watling et al 2014 borzée et al 2019 however several other types of predictor variables will likely be needed to accurately predict species habitat suitabilities and distributions our results should not be construed to imply that only climate predictors are important for predicting species distributions for example competition maynard et al 2017 presence or absence of predation risk abdulwahab et al 2019 dispersal ability pulliam 1988 topography and land use can all affect where organisms are found or live at a particular time and season historical constraints on dispersal can limit the spatial extent of distributions independent of the presence of otherwise suitably climate conditions however in the absence of dispersal limitations species may be able to colonize new environments outside of their current ranges in the future additionally the large individual grid cells of all climate data sets may be poor predictors of the occurrence of patches of small scale micro climate conditions suitable for a species scheffers et al 2014 suggitt et al 2011 also edaphic factors may not strongly correlate with climatic predictors and can independently affect species distributions sugalski and claussen 1997 for example regions with similar climates but different geologies will have different soils that may influence species occurrence antonelli et al 2018 we focused on using only climate predictors to facilitate a comparison of how differences in one important class of variables might affect model performance given that similar climate predictors might differ in how they are derived we recommend that researchers investigate what specific climate variables are available in different climate data sets and use a standardized variable selection protocol when comparing data sets to ensure the difference in model performance are not the result of differences in how subsets of predictor variables are selected from the entire list of potential variables in the data sets in our study we used range maps of each target species as a yardstick to compare how well our models predicted the extent of suitable habitat range maps are prepared by experts based on their own judgment of a species historical distributions and are themselves subject to error also a species is typically not found everywhere within the boundary of a range map range maps may also miss some areas with peripheral populations despite their shortcomings range maps were the best option we had for accessing the spatial accuracy of our models 4 3 implications for species distribution modeling and conservation sdms can be used to inform recommendations regarding conservation planning and management one such sdm application is the assessment of what climate conditions support different species of interest or concern hijmans and graham 2006 another important use of sdms is to identify locations to survey in the future in many cases insufficient resources exist to survey large areas and a targeted approach must be adopted chadès et al 2011 however if the results of sdms are to be useful it is important to understand the sources of data error and how those errors affect the uncertainty of predictions in addition to several other factors known to affect the reliability of sdm results e g modeling technique variable selection collinearity of predictors differences among climate data sets can clearly affect the uncertainty of predicted species distributions our study highlights the importance of exercising care in using mapped predictions from csdms in conservation decision making for example the discrepancies in the mapped prediction of csdms may cause conservation mistakes such as the appropriation of limited conservation dollars to protect habitats that do not support target species carvalho et al 2010 additionally the discrepancies in model predictions associated with climate data sources that we and others have observed highlight the need to integrate the analyses of climate data sources as a critical first step when modeling species distribution although our study compared how seven climate data sets affected csdm performance and spatial accuracy the climate data sets we used are in no way exhaustive we primarily compiled freely available data sets that are representative of the different data sets available and widely used for modeling species distributions a common practice in the species distribution modeling community is to build ensembles by calculating the mean of individual model predictions hao et al 2020 thuiller et al 2019 although ensemble models may help understand the variability in predictions and potential uncertainties that are associated with individual models they do not guarantee the most accurate predictions an averaged ensemble model prediction must be less accurate than those from the actual best performing individual model as demonstrated by several previous studies e g crimmins et al 2013 hao et al 2020 knutti et al 2010 as additional climate data sets become available e g cmcc bioclimind noce et al 2020 cmip phase 6 durack 2020 we need to assess if they improve our ability to predict species distributions doing so will help us better understand how species respond to changing climatic conditions and develop effective management strategies credit authorship contribution statement umarfarooq a abdulwahab

within 48 49 eastern longitude and 34 17 northern latitude it is one of the counties of hamadan which is located in the southeastern part of the province its altitude is 1780 m above sea level malayer has a large rural population due to its extensive agricultural lands in addition to vineyards the agricultural lands in this county are under the cultivation of chickpea barley black chickpeas mung bean kidney bean navy bean pinto bean and lentil most of these lands are in the west northwest and southwest of the county many of these crops in the central parts of the county and adjacent to the gardens are irrigated crops and other parts are under the cultivation of rain fed crops e g chickpeas barley and lentils the population varies in different seasons and grows significantly during the agricultural season in early spring and late summer the county has 7 protected areas within its borders listed in fig 1 separately by the degree of protection and name 2 2 record of presence points and reduction of spatial autocorrelation the points of conflict in this study are where the species is present or approaches the agricultural lands and gardens especially vineyards in addition to boars birds such as house sparrow passer domesticus and magpie pica pica are also harmful species with far less damage than boars since the activity range of these species is during the day the presence of farmers will considerably moderate their damage the field visits were conducted in four spring summer autumn and winter seasons between 2017 and 2021 in malayer county this period coincided with the time of grape ripening and harvesting i e late august to late october an average of 10 visits per month with 3 day intervals were performed by a two person team during the visits farmers ranchers and gardeners were interviewed orally to obtain information about the last time they were on the farm and left by confirming the index of presence that point was recorded using the global positioning system gps otherwise visiting the gardens to search for the index would continue the basis for recording the points was the damage that boars inflicted on the gardens during sunset mid night and night activities the conflict points were hedges orchards crushed and eaten grapes footprints hair damaged branches of vines and parts of the fields plowed in total 67 points of conflict were recorded which is an appropriate sample size for widespread species van proosdij et al 2016 some of the recorded locations were within the protected and no hunting areas this is due to the agricultural lands inside and on the outskirts of these areas e g vineyards in zand no hunting areas non conflict points were recorded in the field to ensure that the samples only indicate the conflict points no points were recorded beyond the mentioned framework such as the profiles and presence of species in rangelands altitudes and other habitats a total number of 120 no conflict points were recorded which is almost twice the number of the points that are used in modeling studies morovati et al 2020 the autocorrelation of the presence points was checked at three intervals of 100 300 and 500 m to reduce the bias the reduction of autocorrelation was made with maintaining the data homogeneity due to the role that height can play in shaping the diversity of environmental conditions dem was used as the layer that determines the priority of removing points morovati et al 2020 in this method heterogeneity is calculated as an index for height based on the calculated index in specifying distances to reduce autocorrelation the emphasis is on eliminating the points with a lower elevation variation this was done in the sdm toolboxv2 5 to execute the ommand the area parameters were set to rectangle with a 3 3 spatial scale sdm toolbox is a python based arcgis toolbox used for spatial analysis in distribution modeling it contains most pre and post processing analyses needed in distribution models and used in macroecology landscape genetics and evolutionary studies brown et al 2017 2 3 variables affecting the conflict according to the studies on the species rutten et al 2019 alexander et al 2016 amici et al 2012 saito et al 2012 those variables that could identify the conflict prone areas were selected thus this study used the variables of elevation compound topographic index cti distance from residential areas distance from main roads normalized difference water index ndwi normalized difference vegetation index ndvi distance from gardens and vineyards and distance from the river the digital elevation model with an accuracy of 30 m was prepared from the usgs system usgs 2014 and then used to prepare the cti variable moore et al 1991 in sagav2 32 software the variable as a function of slope and upstream contributing area per unit width is orthogonal to the direction of water flow which was first designed for hillslope catenas because the accumulation numbers in the flat areas will be very large the cti will not be a related variable there was found a high correlation between cti and soil attributes e g organic matter r 0 57 silt content r 0 61 horizon depth r 0 55 and phosphorus r 0 53 moore et al 1993 ndwi and ndvi indices due to their high potential for impact on species distribution were also prepared from the long term average from march 30 2018 to march 30 2021 of landsat 8 satellite images in the google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 the use of mean values will reduce the random errors in the images zhang et al 2008 and allow better differentiation between gardens and other agricultural fields the ndwi index fluctuates between 1 and 1 gao 1996 the upper ndwi values indicate high water content of the land cover and a high fraction of the vegetation cover and vice versa the index value will drop at water stress times this index was prepared using the normalized difference of bands 3 and 5 of the landsat 8 satellite the ndvi is also an indicator for vegetation cover and has a range of change from 1 to 1 high index values indicate vegetation cover negative values indicate water and close to 0 indicate barren lands the variables of distance from gardens and residential areas were obtained from the land use map prepared by the rangeland and watershed management organization of iran frwmo the distance from the features on the map was calculated using the euclidean distance command from the spatial analyst tools toolbox after checking and correcting the border with ndvi and ndwi maps the map of distance from the gardens was prepared from the land use map the points of springs and the maps of the main roads and rivers were also prepared for the department of environment doe all habitat variables were standardized and prepared with 100 100 m spatial resolution in arcgis 10 4 1 table 1 shows the habitat variables used the range of change the unit and the reference multicollinearity was tested by the variance inflation factor vif to avoid over fitting the model vayghan et al al 2013 those variables with a vif of more than 10 were excluded from the analysis chatterjee and hadi 2013 2 4 distribution models in this study presence and non presence methods were used for modeling these models include the classification and regression tree cart random forest mars and tree net the salford predictive modeler spm v8 2 was used to run these models these are among the best habitat models mi et al 2017 that have been used in many studies evans et al 2011 rather et al 2020 felicísimo et al 2013 bui et al 2019 for example the efficiency of the random forest model in species distribution modeling has been mentioned in other studies piri sahragard et al 2018 grenouillet et al 2011 gallardo and aldridge 2013 since the input variable in the modeling has two classes of conflict and non conflict binary the problem type was selected based on classification in proportion to the problem solving approach the output of the models will be binary in the implementation of all the mentioned models the default settings of the models were used in the implementation of each model 80 of the data were used for training and the remaining 20 for testing the models to achieve a suitable model with high efficiency all the outputs of the single models were integrated using the auc criterion obtained from the assessment of the models morovati et al 2020 araújo and new 2007 marmion et al 2009 2 5 model assessment and threshold limit the models were evaluated using auc this criterion is mostly used to evaluate habitat models the values higher than 0 9 are very good between 0 7 to 0 9 are good and less are suitable pearce and ferrier 2000 the models identify and apply the threshold applied to the data in the model implementation process sensitivity specificity correct classification and misclassification statistics were used to evaluate the thresholds applied karami et al 2020 sensitivity evaluates the error rates of presence points that are correctly detected as presence and specificity evaluates the non presence points that are correctly detected as non presence the values high and close to 1 are considered appropriate for these thresholds the other two criteria measure the power of classification since this study adopted the ensemble approach for modeling after integrating the single models the true skill statistic tss threshold was used to convert the ensemble prediction map into the risk map 0 and 1 karami et al 2020 morovati et al 2020 allouche et al 2006 2 6 distribution of the conflict risk after preparing the risk map lulc and landform maps were used to assess the effect of different landforms and lulc types on the conflict binary map the lulc map is the output of the processing of etm satellite images prepared by the frwmo the map classifies malayer plain into 12 lulc classes the sign mix beside the name of any lulc class shows that the class is integrated with other classes and x at the end of the class indicates that it is integrated with other similar classes the landform is an influential variable on boars park and lee 2003 cai et al 2008 and many environmental parameters because it can indirectly affect temperature humidity slope vegetation and many other factors swanson et al 1988 the variable was created using the topography tools in arcgis10 4 1 the output of the landform classification jenness tool divides the landform into 10 classes including canyons shallow valleys upland drainages u shaped valleys plains open slopes upper slope hills in valleys small hills in plains and mountain tops dilts 2015 the compliance of the risk map with each of the mentioned lulc classes was calculated using the intersect function to determine the percentage of conflict risk three lulc classes with the highest attack risk were also analyzed based on the landform to clarify the role of landforms in conflicts 2 7 niche breadth of conflict niche breadth representing specialty generality was calculated using enmtools 1 3 software the conflict niche breadth index with two indices of levin s b1 and b2 uncertainty levin 1968 indicates the extent and range of desirability of the habitat conditions under conflict which can be called niche breadth of conflict the index values fluctuate between 0 and 1 mandle et al 2010 values close to 0 indicate unfavorable conditions and values close to 1 mean the wide breadth of the ecological niche vorsino et al 2013 to evaluate the conflict niche breadth in different lulc classes and landforms the ensemble map was prepared separately by classes and then transferred to enmtools software in ascii format to calculate the relevant metrics 3 results 3 1 reduction of autocorrelation and collinearity analysis by applying different distances finally at a distance of 500 m 10 of the 67 points of presence used were removed and 57 points of presence remained and entered into the model table 2 shows the results of the vif calculation and the mean values for the conflict and non conflict points since vif was not high in any of the variables none was excluded from the analysis the average distance of conflict zones from the road is 1366 17 m and this amount is 1630 35 m for springs 3 2 model validation and threshold limits based on the results the auc values for the training data in rf cart mars and tree net models were calculated to be 0 92 0 98 0 96 and 0 96 respectively these values were equal to 0 95 0 89 0 97 and 0 95 for the test data indicating the model s proper implementation table 3 shows the values applied to the habitat models and the efficiency of each in distinguishing between presence and non presence data among the single models the random forest model was able to best distinguish the suitable and unsuitable habitats of the species the sensitivity value for identifying presence oints was 0 98 a very good value the model also identified pseudo absence points with an accuracy of 0 95 indicating good resolution power the model of classification and regression tree also worked well 3 3 conflict and landfrom and lulc types tables 4 and 5 show the distribution of conflict and non conflict points by different landforms and lulc classes according to the chi square test results there is a significant difference between the presence and absence of boars in different lulc classes p 0 0086 a significant difference was also observed in different landforms p 0 0001 among the different lulc classes the highest points of conflict 20 points were recorded in gardens and next in poor rangelands 10 points which are generally on the edge of gardens nine points of conflict were recorded in medium quality rangelands these conflicts are the cases observed by local shepherds forty two points of conflict were recorded in deep valleys these valleys cover most of the gardens of malayer after that 9 points were found in u shaped valleys the highest number of conflict points were found in valleys 3 4 prediction of the conflict extent fig 2 shows the areas prone to conflict in malayer county in this figure blue patches are the areas prone to conflict which in the cart mars rf and tree net models were respectively 66 924 51 ha 70 598 84 ha 81 827 63 and 39 224 65 ha the tree net method predicts areas prone to conflict with a smaller area and the correlation between the identified spots is less than other models according to the ensemble technique an area equal to 88 865 13 ha has a potential for conflict which is equivalent to 26 87 of the entire area of malayer county 3 5 importance of the effective variables table 6 shows the importance of the influential variables listed separately by the models used according to the results of the 4 models random forest cart mars and tree net ndvi had the greatest impact on the possibility of conflict the ndwi variable was the second most influential variable in the random forest model followed by the distance from the vineyards in the cart model elevation and distance from the river had the greatest impact in the mars model distance from the spring and elevation had the greatest impact and in the tree net model the variables of distance from the spring and gardens 3 6 evaluation of the niche breadth distribution fig 3 depicts the results of the ensemble technique displaying the landform alongside the lulc classes in the study area blue colors in the conflict potential map show high potential for conflict and brown colors the areas with low potential in the same way the areas with a high probability of attack and conflict are marked in yellow based on these results most of the vineyards in malayer are prone to conflict according to the results the highest risk of attack is proportional to the distribution of the species presence points in the central and southern parts of the county major landforms observed in this area include u shaped valleys and deep waterways tables 7 and 8 show the niche breadth in different lulc classes and landforms based on the b1 and b2 metrics the maximum breadth of the species ecological niche was found in u shaped valleys deeply incised streams and mid slope ridges respectively boars in these areas have the largest width of ecological niche in terms of conflict occurrence in the study of different lulc classes it was found that gardens provide the highest breadth of ecological niche for the species b1 0 60 b2 0 95 after that the largest width of ecological niche is related to the mix good range x class which includes high quality gardens in combination with other land uses usually rainfed farm fields 3 7 landform functions in conflict occurrence the boar conflict areas include 10 028 20 ha 11 28 of the protected areas and 9429 30 ha 10 61 of the no hunting areas table 9 shows the risk of attacks by lulc types according to the results the highest attack probability is related to the gardens in the county 29 37 mix dryfarming x with a probability of 17 71 is ranked next the three classes of gardens mix dryfarming x and mod range which had the highest transport risk were divided based on different landform classes fig 4 according to the results gardens located in deeply incised streams and u shaped valleys are prone to an attack probability of 65 68 integrated rainfed farm fields located in waterways and on hills have a risk percentage of 51 21 and 13 44 respectively in the poor rangeland class those rangelands located in deeply incised streams and mountain tops have the highest potential for attack 51 12 and 13 44 respectively 4 discussion environmental services to animals e g safety food etc are constantly changing under anthropogenic or climatic constraints schloss et al 2012 sih et al 2011 boars are scattered throughout iran except in completely dry and waterless areas goshtasb 2001 and increase their population by 15 annually massei 1992 this study was conducted to detect areas prone to boar conflict with vineyards in malayer county and investigate the impact of important environmental factors on the occurrence of this conflict attempts were made to analyze the attacks considering the ecological niche breadth separately by landform and lulc maps this was done using ensemble and single models a set of conditions is necessary for the occurrence of the conflict and these conditions can be considered the ecological niche of conflict this study attempted to investigate the availability of these conditions in different lulc classes and landforms using niche width metrics however relevant studies on the species have not addressed the quantification of niche width and the combination of results with lulc and landform jin et al 2021 rho et al 2015 johann et al 2020 all models used had high performance based on auc values among the single models random forest rf performed better and the sensitivity and specificity values of the model were 0 98 and 0 95 respectively table 3 the high values of these two metrics are very important in evaluating habitat suitability models morovati et al 2020 indicating the appropriate resolution of the model ahmadi et al 2017 this study showed that sdms could be used as a suitable tool to investigate areas prone to the presence and conflict of different species the appropriateness of using these models has been reported in various conflict studies behdarvand et al 2014 ficetola et al 2014 a significant difference was found in the conflict between different landform classes which shows that the species act professionally in choosing the landform tables 4 and 5 among the different landform classes deeply incised streams and u shaped valleys were the most suitable for the species and the conflict niche breadth of the species in these classes was the highest in these landforms these classes have the highest coverage of gardens and rangelands the most important features of these areas are moisture vegetation cover and water which are all important components for boars various studies have also reported boars specialized and non random habitat selection keuling et al 2008 fattebert et al 2017 gaudiano et al 2022 the average ndvi and ndwi indices provide a good picture of water and vegetation cover density status negative ndwi values in this study indicate woody plants i e gardens gao 1996 serrano et al 2019 in almost all models ndvi had the greatest impact on the likelihood of conflict high ndvi values refer to the gardens inside the deeply incised streams u shaped valleys and riparian woodland the high ndvi can indicate safe areas and dense vegetation can be the main protection against predation barasona et al 2021 the areas with low ndvi will also provide less security for species activities alexander et al 2016 our findings are consistent with the findings of baubet et al 2004 in france geisser and reyer 2005 in thurgau switzerland melis et al 2006 in west eurasia fonseca 2008 in southeastern poland and keuling et al 2009 in northeastern germany concluded that the highest boar presence was in areas with dense vegetation cover vegetation cover is a prerequisite for boar activity in gardens as their activity is affected by finding shelter and food morelle and lejeune 2015 in other studies damage to farms usually occurs at the forest edge liu et al 2019 thurfjell et al 2009 or at a distance from the forest edge jin et al 2021 and the forests somehow have a supportive role ficetola et al 2014 pandey et al 2016 for boar activities since wild boars spend considerable time on the margins of wallow drink forage and defecate water resources gray et al 2019 woodlands within deeply incised streams and u shaped valleys with woody cover amici et al 2012 along with water and moisture can play the role of forest in supporting boar activities sometimes it is not possible to use shelter and food simultaneously boars may travel long distances between resting and feeding areas which happens when safe areas are away from feeding areas in the study by muthoka et al 2022 on boars it was found that the closer the species habitat is to agricultural lands as a source of food saito et al 2012 the greater the possibility of their presence but rivers play an important role in gardens far away from protected areas on the one hand the crossing of the haramabad and manizan rivers and the connection of the gardens on the other like a corridor facilitate the movement of the boars and lead to their presence at farther distances from the southeast to the county center due to their use for agricultural purposes rivers are considered one of the attractive factors and the vegetation of the gardens will also play a conservative role coverage in a study by markov et al 2019 on the distribution of boars in northern eurasia river valleys were reported to affect the expansion of the distribution of boars revealing the important role of the river valleys in increasing the distribution depending on the distribution range different plant species and animals may be exposed to boars which indicates the high width of the ecological nest of this species gürtler et al 2017 in a study by giménez giménez anaya et al 2008 on the species diet it was claimed that the species is specialized in nutrition in a study by ficetola et al 2014 in the alta murgia national park cereals were reported to be most affected by boar attacks gardens play an important role in providing food for this species due to the presence of grapes roots and underground components of plants and the presence of more earthworms which are the most important food source for boars distance from springs has been an important and influential variable on the possibility of conflict the presence of springs and any habitat component that is somehow related to water and moisture is also indicative of this issue as boars tend to have water resources in their home range ilse and hellgren 1995 maybe that is why deeply incised streams and u shaped valleys are the most desirable for boars in a study by jin et al 2021 on the multi scale analysis of wild boar damage in hunchun county and the study by morelle and lejeune 2015 in condroz and loamy regions it was claimed that water resources did not play a role in the distribution of wild boars which contradicts the findings of this study the role of water and its related parameters in various ecosystems is different and directly depends on the degree of drought and temperature the findings showed that the wild boars in the study area has acquired adaptations to increase the efficiency and use of food resources that are compatible with the local ecosystems the woodlands and orchards within deeply incised streams and u shaped valleys and moving along riverbeds have increased their access to the vineyards according to the results increasing the distance from residential areas to 1800 m increases the likelihood of conflict most villages and residential areas are centralized and close to the areas where there are gardens which has caused most conflicts to occur at short distances from rural areas the favorable conditions of the margins of residential areas were analyzed by niche breadth metrics table 8 therefore the presence of the species in the margins of human settlements is not unexpected the tendency of the species to be close to residential areas can be due to the proximity of these areas to gardens in other words the location of gardens on the edge of residential and rural areas has caused the boar to approach these areas lópez et al 2014 conducted a study in the iberian peninsula spain southwest of the arctic and concluded that the highest presence of boars is near human settlements and areas that have been severely altered by humans which is consistent with the findings of this study there are also reports of boar presence on the margins of residential areas in germany jansen et al 2007 however the findings of this study are not consistent with the studies by lyang and lee 2010 in mt jeombong in korea fu et al al 2022 in jilin province of china frackowiak et al 2013 in northeast poland and also with the results of rho 2015 in gangwon do and jeollanam do in korea and saito et al 2012 in chiba prefecture japan reporting that boars prefer distances away from human settlements in a study by ficetola et al 2014 areas with low human density moderate forest cover and shrub cover were suitable for the species therefore the presence or non presence of boars near residential areas also depends on the favorableness of other habitat variables as the distance from the road increases the probability of conflict increases and from a greater distance the conflict will decrease the main arak hamedan road passes through the gardens due to the ease of access most roads are in the path of gardens accordingly the maximum distance of 2 km is the distance the boars keep from the roads in the region the proximity of the wild boars to roads and residential areas indicates that they are constantly aware of the spatiotemporal activities in these areas helping them beware of the risks of these areas such activity of the species has been observed by weverse et al 2020 in hoge kempen national park and fu et al 2022 in jilin most recorded conflicts with the species occur in late summer and early fall and most of the displacement of boar flocks around the gardens is related to this period of 2 to 3 months while the conflict is not high in the other seasons of spring and winter the fruiting of the gardens fruiting seasons and the sweetness of the grapes in late summer and early autumn can be a reason for this because in other seasons when the grapes are not yet fully ripe the boars movements are less such seasonally consistent activity for boars has also been reported in studies by johann et al 2020 from central europe and keuling et al 2008 from germany in summer with the sunset the activity and movement of the boars begin which is probably because the days are hot in addition during the grape harvest from the orchards the daily presence of farmers in the fields and orchards has led to the postponement of the boars activities to the night in a study by brivio et al 2017 on boar activities the results showed that the boar was nocturnal throughout the year which contradicts the findings of this study and could indicate the presence of human pressures or the high adaptability of the boars in the different distribution regions according to the results 21 89 of conflict prone areas are inside protected and no hunting areas this is due to the gardens and agricultural lands in and around these areas parts of lashgardar and golparabad regions have farm fields and vineyards the same also applies to no hunting areas with food shortages and declining quality inside the habitat the conflict will not be unexpected in and around these areas in such a situation we are faced with the management of vertebrate biodiversity conservation in the context of multiple land uses which should adopt the appropriate management model hansen et al 1993 accepted the two hypotheses that the reaction of animal species to landscape changes is a function of the species life history and local pattern of changes they proposed a pattern that includes five steps 1 set clear goals for land management 2 connect the species to the structure and configure the landscape 3 assess potential habitats of the species 4 use simulations to predict the future patterns 5 implement scenarios and investigate the species response implementing this model for the boar populations in the county landscape is necessary an area equivalent to 78 11 of the conflict prone regions is located outside the protected areas which requires prevention approaches a large population of wild boars is present outside the protected areas thus the reserve effect which refers to the use of protected areas as a shelter during hunting seasons does not apply to the protected areas in this study which contradicts the findings of colomer et al 2021 and amici et al 2012 this role in the study area can be defined for the woodlands various methods have been proposed to prevent possible damage of boars to agricultural products sapkota et al 2014 thapa 2010 saito et al 2011 due to the high rate of adaptation giménez anaya et al 2020 especially with human dominated environments stillfried et al 2017 a combination of different methods is proposed to use pandey et al 2016 some have proposed direct firing and food poisoning as a solution for controlling the populations of this species massei et al 2011 west et al 2009 hanson et al 2009 due to the possibility of the wolf attacks in hamadan province and malayer county behdarvand et al 2014 the methods such as hunting poisoning or any other methods cause a sudden decline in the population of this species is dangerous the declining population of this species may lead to more dangerous conflicts such as increasing the likelihood of wolf attacks on humans and livestock mohammadi et al al 2019 in the county as the balance between prey and predator will be lost there are reports of wolf canis lupus attacks on domestic livestock due to declining prey carbone et al al 1999 considering the predator s dependence on changing the prey s population size carbone et al 1999 and reducing its access to wolves the possibility of increasing the conflict of this species in the distribution range especially in the home range is not far from expectation jhala 2003 treves et al 2011 meriggi and lovari 1996 considered the protection of wild ungulates as the most important way to reduce the number of wolf attacks on livestock to prevent damage of boars to gardens the use of fences or walls is suggested as mentioned in other studies honda et al 2008 saito et al 2011 in late summer as grapes ripen locals use various methods to prevent boar infestation including night attendance at vineyards using an aerial shot to warn and using domestic dogs these traditional methods of indigenous people chardonnet et al 2010 are more effective than the modern methods electric fencing or net wires thapa 2010 sapkota et al 2014 in cases where large herds of boars attack these gardens the doe will issue a hunting permit for traditional vineyards instead of traditional cultivation the tree is on the ground support structures are also suggested reducing the impact of pests and increasing production zhang et al 1995 reported that the lighting and microclimate under the canopy greatly affect the grape cluster s growth yield and quality and the more light is received by the plant grape the more quantity and quality of the fruit experiments performed around the world show the superiority of the grapevine support structures adjusting the ratio of c n carbohydrate to nitrogen and increasing it in the grape plant increases the amount of plant assimilates and allows the conversion of vegetative organs to reproductive organs in annual branches reynolds and heuvel 2009 however the higher cost compared to traditional cultivation is an issue that arises regarding the use of this cultivation system 5 conclusions different compositions of the landscape are effective in the formation of conflict with wildlife landforms such as u shaped valleys and deeply incised streams as the physical structure of the landscape by providing secondary conditions like creating moisture and microclimate for vegetation have caused these areas to have more dense vegetation than other landform classes and provide favourable conditions for the presence and distribution of boars integrating ecological niche width criteria with the findings from the distribution modeling contributes to better transparency and analysis of different land use land cover and landform types therefore it is suggested that with the help of sdms the width of the conflict niche be examined separately for the different landscape classes to analyze the desired range of boar activity in more detail the boar population management approaches in the study area should be with full knowledge of the ecological relationships of the species especially predator prey relations therefore future studies are proposed on the diet of wolves canis lupus in malayer and the overlap of boar conflict with wolfs habitat any drastic change in the boar population can lead to increased wolf conflict with local communities in the county therefore it is suggested that management measures do not lead to severe population fluctuations gardeners can also take an important step toward increasing crop production and reducing conflict by mechanizing cultivation switching from traditional methods to grapevine support structures and creating tall hedges identification and analysis of

24387,boars with high reproduction wide distribution and adaptability have great potential to conflict with human interests malayer county in hamedan province is one of the economic hubs of grape production and related products in iran considering that the county s economic growth is based on this horticultural product this study was conducted to detect conflict prone areas in different land use cover lulc types and landforms the ensemble model of attack risk was developed using single tree and regression models and 10 topographic vegetation and human variables the significant difference between conflict non conflict points in the lulc and landform maps was checked using the chi square test the results showed a significant difference in the occurrence of conflict in different lulc classes p 0 05 the ndvi the distance from spring and the distance from vineyards were the three variables with the greatest effect in all models the widest niche breadth conflict in the lulc and

abundance and ultimately the food network chavarria et al 2007 this effect is especially greater in areas that have been formed due to the conversion of agricultural lands the degradations from wild boar activities have frequently been identified as a key factor influencing ecosystem structure tierney and cushman 2006 that can cause significant damage especially to agricultural sectors pandey et

account for 1000 hectares of agricultural land chatrabgoun et al 2020 with a yield of 23 tons per hectare they include 59 of grapes produced in hamedan behrouzi et al 2017 numerous water sources dense vegetation cover due to the existence of gardens and the passage of rivers along these gardens in low lying areas have provided suitable conditions for the presence of boars the economic view of grapes and their products on the one hand and the ecological conditions of the gardens and farms of this county on the other hand have provided the ground for the occurrence of conflicts with different wildlife species such as boars it is a challenging research topic in science to know the stimuli and strategies of animals to adapt to changing environments winkler et al 2014 identifying the needs habitat constraints and degradation factors is critical to conserving an important species morovati et al al 2020 species distribution models sdms or ecological niche models are useful for preparing habitat suitability maps predicting the most suitable wildlife overpass in the landscape on a large scale rho 2015 sdms have widely been used in many research fields today including climate change conservation biology ecology biogeography guisan and thuiller 2005 and wildlife conflict carvalho et al al 2015 ficetola et al al 2014 identifying areas prone to conflict using sdms ultimately focuses on analyzing some variables of the environment that affect conflict some environmental parameters such as landforms can help interpret many environmental parameters tricart and kiewietdejonge 1992 and even determine where a plant or animal species can live kim et al 2021 although the role of landforms in facilitating or preventing conflicts has not been investigated quantitatively so far this criterion can be used as a surrogate in analyzing ecosystem characteristics barton et al 2020 numerous studies have yet been conducted on boar habitat suitability fonseca 2008 thurfjell et al 2009 lópez et al 2014 damage pattern assessment cai et al 2008 schley et al 2008 rao et al 2015 the perspective of local communities li et al 2010 mobility mauri et al 2019 morelle and lejeune 2015 and diet cuevas et al 2010 rho 2015 reported boar habitat in densely vegetated rocky areas far from human habitats and roads and close to water resources less affected by human communities morelle and lejeune 2015 examined boar habitat suitability in two chapters in agricultural landscapes the model was run by maxent according to the results the distribution range of boars to feed on crops during the growing season is doubled the activity of boars in agricultural fields for activity and food is affected by the land cover another study by rutten et al 2019 examined the habitat suitability of boars using hunting bag and citizen science data in flanders using the maximum entropy method the urban area and habitat diversity have had only a small effect on habitat suitability revealing the adaptation flexibility of wild boars with landscapes dominated by humans sumitha and shaharban 2022 examined the economic effects of the boar conflict in kerala india the results showed that the economic losses caused by boar attacks are very high government agencies have not sufficiently compensated for the damage causing farmers to turn to non agricultural activities gaudiano et al 2022 investigated the spatiotemporal behaviors of the female boars in italy in terms of home range habitat selection and activity rhythm in an agro forestry pastoral landscape using gps collar tagged the group of female boars selected the margin of deciduous forests boar activity was higher on dark nights than on full moon nights considering the issues raised the objectives of this study are to identify areas prone to human boar conflict differentiate different lulc types in terms of the vulnerability against the risk of attacks investigate the role of landforms in the occurrence of conflict and identify the most important habitat variables of conflict occurrence and appropriate approaches 2 material and methods 2 1 study area malayer county with an approximate area of 3210 km2 is located within 48 49 eastern longitude and 34 17 northern latitude it is one of the counties of hamadan which is located in the southeastern part of the province its altitude is 1780 m above sea level malayer has a large rural population due to its extensive agricultural lands in addition to vineyards the agricultural lands in this county are under the cultivation of chickpea barley black chickpeas mung bean kidney bean navy bean pinto bean and lentil most of these lands are in the west northwest and southwest of the county many of these crops in the central parts of the county and adjacent to the gardens are irrigated crops and other parts are under the cultivation of rain fed crops e g chickpeas barley and lentils the population varies in different seasons and grows significantly during the agricultural season in early spring and late summer the county has 7 protected areas within its borders listed in fig 1 separately by the degree of protection and name 2 2 record of presence points and reduction of spatial autocorrelation the points of conflict in this study are where the species is present or approaches the agricultural lands and gardens especially vineyards in addition to boars birds such as house sparrow passer domesticus and magpie pica pica are also harmful species with far less damage than boars since the activity range of these species is during the day the presence of farmers will considerably moderate their damage the field visits were conducted in four spring summer autumn and winter seasons between 2017 and 2021 in malayer county this period coincided with the time of grape ripening and harvesting i e late august to late october an average of 10 visits per month with 3 day intervals were performed by a two person team during the visits farmers ranchers and gardeners were interviewed orally to obtain information about the last time they were on the farm and left by confirming the index of presence that point was recorded using the global positioning system gps otherwise visiting the gardens to search for the index would continue the basis for recording the points was the damage that boars inflicted on the gardens during sunset mid night and night activities the conflict points were hedges orchards crushed and eaten grapes footprints hair damaged branches of vines and parts of the fields plowed in total 67 points of conflict were recorded which is an appropriate sample size for widespread species van proosdij et al 2016 some of the recorded locations were within the protected and no hunting areas this is due to the agricultural lands inside and on the outskirts of these areas e g vineyards in zand no hunting areas non conflict points were recorded in the field to ensure that the samples only indicate the conflict points no points were recorded beyond the mentioned framework such as the profiles and presence of species in rangelands altitudes and other habitats a total number of 120 no conflict points were recorded which is almost twice the number of the points that are used in modeling studies morovati et al 2020 the autocorrelation of the presence points was checked at three intervals of 100 300 and 500 m to reduce the bias the reduction of autocorrelation was made with maintaining the data homogeneity due to the role that height can play in shaping the diversity of environmental conditions dem was used as the layer that determines the priority of removing points morovati et al 2020 in this method heterogeneity is calculated as an index for height based on the calculated index in specifying distances to reduce autocorrelation the emphasis is on eliminating the points with a lower elevation variation this was done in the sdm toolboxv2 5 to execute the ommand the area parameters were set to rectangle with a 3 3 spatial scale sdm toolbox is a python based arcgis toolbox used for spatial analysis in distribution modeling it contains most pre and post processing analyses needed in distribution models and used in macroecology landscape genetics and evolutionary studies brown et al 2017 2 3 variables affecting the conflict according to the studies on the species rutten et al 2019 alexander et al 2016 amici et al 2012 saito et al 2012 those variables that could identify the conflict prone areas were selected thus this study used the variables of elevation compound topographic index cti distance from residential areas distance from main roads normalized difference water index ndwi normalized difference vegetation index ndvi distance from gardens and vineyards and distance from the river the digital elevation model with an accuracy of 30 m was prepared from the usgs system usgs 2014 and then used to prepare the cti variable moore et al 1991 in sagav2 32 software the variable as a function of slope and upstream contributing area per unit width is orthogonal to the direction of water flow which was first designed for hillslope catenas because the accumulation numbers in the flat areas will be very large the cti will not be a related variable there was found a high correlation between cti and soil attributes e g organic matter r 0 57 silt content r 0 61 horizon depth r 0 55 and phosphorus r 0 53 moore et al 1993 ndwi and ndvi indices due to their high potential for impact on species distribution were also prepared from the long term average from march 30 2018 to march 30 2021 of landsat 8 satellite images in the google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 the use of mean values will reduce the random errors in the images zhang et al 2008 and allow better differentiation between gardens and other agricultural fields the ndwi index fluctuates between 1 and 1 gao 1996 the upper ndwi values indicate high water content of the land cover and a high fraction of the vegetation cover and vice versa the index value will drop at water stress times this index was prepared using the normalized difference of bands 3 and 5 of the landsat 8 satellite the ndvi is also an indicator for vegetation cover and has a range of change from 1 to 1 high index values indicate vegetation cover negative values indicate water and close to 0 indicate barren lands the variables of distance from gardens and residential areas were obtained from the land use map prepared by the rangeland and watershed management organization of iran frwmo the distance from the features on the map was calculated using the euclidean distance command from the spatial analyst tools toolbox after checking and correcting the border with ndvi and ndwi maps the map of distance from the gardens was prepared from the land use map the points of springs and the maps of the main roads and rivers were also prepared for the department of environment doe all habitat variables were standardized and prepared with 100 100 m spatial resolution in arcgis 10 4 1 table 1 shows the habitat variables used the range of change the unit and the reference multicollinearity was tested by the variance inflation factor vif to avoid over fitting the model vayghan et al al 2013 those variables with a vif of more than 10 were excluded from the analysis chatterjee and hadi 2013 2 4 distribution models in this study presence and non presence methods were used for modeling these models include the classification and regression tree cart random forest mars and tree net the salford predictive modeler spm v8 2 was used to run these models these are among the best habitat models mi et al 2017 that have been used in many studies evans et al 2011 rather et al 2020 felicísimo et al 2013 bui et al 2019 for example the efficiency of the random forest model in species distribution modeling has been mentioned in other studies piri sahragard et al 2018 grenouillet et al 2011 gallardo and aldridge 2013 since the input variable in the modeling has two classes of conflict and non conflict binary the problem type was selected based on classification in proportion to the problem solving approach the output of the models will be binary in the implementation of all the mentioned models the default settings of the models were used in the implementation of each model 80 of the data were used for training and the remaining 20 for testing the models to achieve a suitable model with high efficiency all the outputs of the single models were integrated using the auc criterion obtained from the assessment of the models morovati et al 2020 araújo and new 2007 marmion et al 2009 2 5 model assessment and threshold limit the models were evaluated using auc this criterion is mostly used to evaluate habitat models the values higher than 0 9 are very good between 0 7 to 0 9 are good and less are suitable pearce and ferrier 2000 the models identify and apply the threshold applied to the data in the model implementation process sensitivity specificity correct classification and misclassification statistics were used to evaluate the thresholds applied karami et al 2020 sensitivity evaluates the error rates of presence points that are correctly detected as presence and specificity evaluates the non presence points that are correctly detected as non presence the values high and close to 1 are considered appropriate for these thresholds the other two criteria measure the power of classification since this study adopted the ensemble approach for modeling after integrating the single models the true skill statistic tss threshold was used to convert the ensemble prediction map into the risk map 0 and 1 karami et al 2020 morovati et al 2020 allouche et al 2006 2 6 distribution of the conflict risk after preparing the risk map lulc and landform maps were used to assess the effect of different landforms and lulc types on the conflict binary map the lulc map is the output of the processing of etm satellite images prepared by the frwmo the map classifies malayer plain into 12 lulc classes the sign mix beside the name of any lulc class shows that the class is integrated with other classes and x at the end of the class indicates that it is integrated with other similar classes the landform is an influential variable on boars park and lee 2003 cai et al 2008 and many environmental parameters because it can indirectly affect temperature humidity slope vegetation and many other factors swanson et al 1988 the variable was created using the topography tools in arcgis10 4 1 the output of the landform classification jenness tool divides the landform into 10 classes including canyons shallow valleys upland drainages u shaped valleys plains open slopes upper slope hills in valleys small hills in plains and mountain tops dilts 2015 the compliance of the risk map with each of the mentioned lulc classes was calculated using the intersect function to determine the percentage of conflict risk three lulc classes with the highest attack risk were also analyzed based on the landform to clarify the role of landforms in conflicts 2 7 niche breadth of conflict niche breadth representing specialty generality was calculated using enmtools 1 3 software the conflict niche breadth index with two indices of levin s b1 and b2 uncertainty levin 1968 indicates the extent and range of desirability of the habitat conditions under conflict which can be called niche breadth of conflict the index values fluctuate between 0 and 1 mandle et al 2010 values close to 0 indicate unfavorable conditions and values close to 1 mean the wide breadth of the ecological niche vorsino et al 2013 to evaluate the conflict niche breadth in different lulc classes and landforms the ensemble map was prepared separately by classes and then transferred to enmtools software in ascii format to calculate the relevant metrics 3 results 3 1 reduction of autocorrelation and collinearity analysis by applying different distances finally at a distance of 500 m 10 of the 67 points of presence used were removed and 57 points of presence remained and entered into the model table 2 shows the results of the vif calculation and the mean values for the conflict and non conflict points since vif was not high in any of the variables none was excluded from the analysis the average distance of conflict zones from the road is 1366 17 m and this amount is 1630 35 m for springs 3 2 model validation and threshold limits based on the results the auc values for the training data in rf cart mars and tree net models were calculated to be 0 92 0 98 0 96 and 0 96 respectively these values were equal to 0 95 0 89 0 97 and 0 95 for the test data indicating the model s proper implementation table 3 shows the values applied to the habitat models and the efficiency of each in distinguishing between presence and non presence data among the single models the random forest model was able to best distinguish the suitable and unsuitable habitats of the species the sensitivity value for identifying presence oints was 0 98 a very good value the model also identified pseudo absence points with an accuracy of 0 95 indicating good resolution power the model of classification and regression tree also worked well 3 3 conflict and landfrom and lulc types tables 4 and 5 show the distribution of conflict and non conflict points by different landforms and lulc classes according to the chi square test results there is a significant difference between the presence and absence of boars in different lulc classes p 0 0086 a significant difference was also observed in different landforms p 0 0001 among the different lulc classes the highest points of conflict 20 points were recorded in gardens and next in poor rangelands 10 points which are generally on the edge of gardens nine points of conflict were recorded in medium quality rangelands these conflicts are the cases observed by local shepherds forty two points of conflict were recorded in deep valleys these valleys cover most of the gardens of malayer after that 9 points were found in u shaped valleys the highest number of conflict points were found in valleys 3 4 prediction of the conflict extent fig 2 shows the areas prone to conflict in malayer county in this figure blue patches are the areas prone to conflict which in the cart mars rf and tree net models were respectively 66 924 51 ha 70 598 84 ha 81 827 63 and 39 224 65 ha the tree net method predicts areas prone to conflict with a smaller area and the correlation between the identified spots is less than other models according to the ensemble technique an area equal to 88 865 13 ha has a potential for conflict which is equivalent to 26 87 of the entire area of malayer county 3 5 importance of the effective variables table 6 shows the importance of the influential variables listed separately by the models used according to the results of the 4 models random forest cart mars and tree net ndvi had the greatest impact on the possibility of conflict the ndwi variable was the second most influential variable in the random forest model followed by the distance from the vineyards in the cart model elevation and distance from the river had the greatest impact in the mars model distance from the spring and elevation had the greatest impact and in the tree net model the variables of distance from the spring and gardens 3 6 evaluation of the niche breadth distribution fig 3 depicts the results of the ensemble technique displaying the landform alongside the lulc classes in the study area blue colors in the conflict potential map show high potential for conflict and brown colors the areas with low potential in the same way the areas with a high probability of attack and conflict are marked in yellow based on these results most of the vineyards in malayer are prone to conflict according to the results the highest risk of attack is proportional to the distribution of the species presence points in the central and southern parts of the county major landforms observed in this area include u shaped valleys and deep waterways tables 7 and 8 show the niche breadth in different lulc classes and landforms based on the b1 and b2 metrics the maximum breadth of the species ecological niche was found in u shaped valleys deeply incised streams and mid slope ridges respectively boars in these areas have the largest width of ecological niche in terms of conflict occurrence in the study of different lulc classes it was found that gardens provide the highest breadth of ecological niche for the species b1 0 60 b2 0 95 after that the largest width of ecological niche is related to the mix good range x class which includes high quality gardens in combination with other land uses usually rainfed farm fields 3 7 landform functions in conflict occurrence the boar conflict areas include 10 028 20 ha 11 28 of the protected areas and 9429 30 ha 10 61 of the no hunting areas table 9 shows the risk of attacks by lulc types according to the results the highest attack probability is related to the gardens in the county 29 37 mix dryfarming x with a probability of 17 71 is ranked next the three classes of gardens mix dryfarming x and mod range which had the highest transport risk were divided based on different landform classes fig 4 according to the results gardens located in deeply incised streams and u shaped valleys are prone to an attack probability of 65 68 integrated rainfed farm fields located in waterways and on hills have a risk percentage of 51 21 and 13 44 respectively in the poor rangeland class those rangelands located in deeply incised streams and mountain tops have the highest potential for attack 51 12 and 13 44 respectively 4 discussion environmental services to animals e g safety food etc are constantly changing under anthropogenic or climatic constraints schloss et al 2012 sih et al 2011 boars are scattered throughout iran except in completely dry and waterless areas goshtasb 2001 and increase their population by 15 annually massei 1992 this study was conducted to detect areas prone to boar conflict with vineyards in malayer county and investigate the impact of important environmental factors on the occurrence of this conflict attempts were made to analyze the attacks considering the ecological niche breadth separately by landform and lulc maps this was done using ensemble and single models a set of conditions is necessary for the occurrence of the conflict and these conditions can be considered the ecological niche of conflict this study attempted to investigate the availability of these conditions in different lulc classes and landforms using niche width metrics however relevant studies on the species have not addressed the quantification of niche width and the combination of results with lulc and landform jin et al 2021 rho et al 2015 johann et al 2020 all models used had high performance based on auc values among the single models random forest rf performed better and the sensitivity and specificity values of the model were 0 98 and 0 95 respectively table 3 the high values of these two metrics are very important in evaluating habitat suitability models morovati et al 2020 indicating the appropriate resolution of the model ahmadi et al 2017 this study showed that sdms could be used as a suitable tool to investigate areas prone to the presence and conflict of different species the appropriateness of using these models has been reported in various conflict studies behdarvand et al 2014 ficetola et al 2014 a significant difference was found in the conflict between different landform classes which shows that the species act professionally in choosing the landform tables 4 and 5 among the different landform classes deeply incised streams and u shaped valleys were the most suitable for the species and the conflict niche breadth of the species in these classes was the highest in these landforms these classes have the highest coverage of gardens and rangelands the most important features of these areas are moisture vegetation cover and water which are all important components for boars various studies have also reported boars specialized and non random habitat selection keuling et al 2008 fattebert et al 2017 gaudiano et al 2022 the average ndvi and ndwi indices provide a good picture of water and vegetation cover density status negative ndwi values in this study indicate woody plants i e gardens gao 1996 serrano et al 2019 in almost all models ndvi had the greatest impact on the likelihood of conflict high ndvi values refer to the gardens inside the deeply incised streams u shaped valleys and riparian woodland the high ndvi can indicate safe areas and dense vegetation can be the main protection against predation barasona et al 2021 the areas with low ndvi will also provide less security for species activities alexander et al 2016 our findings are consistent with the findings of baubet et al 2004 in france geisser and reyer 2005 in thurgau switzerland melis et al 2006 in west eurasia fonseca 2008 in southeastern poland and keuling et al 2009 in northeastern germany concluded that the highest boar presence was in areas with dense vegetation cover vegetation cover is a prerequisite for boar activity in gardens as their activity is affected by finding shelter and food morelle and lejeune 2015 in other studies damage to farms usually occurs at the forest edge liu et al 2019 thurfjell et al 2009 or at a distance from the forest edge jin et al 2021 and the forests somehow have a supportive role ficetola et al 2014 pandey et al 2016 for boar activities since wild boars spend considerable time on the margins of wallow drink forage and defecate water resources gray et al 2019 woodlands within deeply incised streams and u shaped valleys with woody cover amici et al 2012 along with water and moisture can play the role of forest in supporting boar activities sometimes it is not possible to use shelter and food simultaneously boars may travel long distances between resting and feeding areas which happens when safe areas are away from feeding areas in the study by muthoka et al 2022 on boars it was found that the closer the species habitat is to agricultural lands as a source of food saito et al 2012 the greater the possibility of their presence but rivers play an important role in gardens far away from protected areas on the one hand the crossing of the haramabad and manizan rivers and the connection of the gardens on the other like a corridor facilitate the movement of the boars and lead to their presence at farther distances from the southeast to the county center due to their use for agricultural purposes rivers are considered one of the attractive factors and the vegetation of the gardens will also play a conservative role coverage in a study by markov et al 2019 on the distribution of boars in northern eurasia river valleys were reported to affect the expansion of the distribution of boars revealing the important role of the river valleys in increasing the distribution depending on the distribution range different plant species and animals may be exposed to boars which indicates the high width of the ecological nest of this species gürtler et al 2017 in a study by giménez giménez anaya et al 2008 on the species diet it was claimed that the species is specialized in nutrition in a study by ficetola et al 2014 in the alta murgia national park cereals were reported to be most affected by boar attacks gardens play an important role in providing food for this species due to the presence of grapes roots and underground components of plants and the presence of more earthworms which are the most important food source for boars distance from springs has been an important and influential variable on the possibility of conflict the presence of springs and any habitat component that is somehow related to water and moisture is also indicative of this issue as boars tend to have water resources in their home range ilse and hellgren 1995 maybe that is why deeply incised streams and u shaped valleys are the most desirable for boars in a study by jin et al 2021 on the multi scale analysis of wild boar damage in hunchun county and the study by morelle and lejeune 2015 in condroz and loamy regions it was claimed that water resources did not play a role in the distribution of wild boars which contradicts the findings of this study the role of water and its related parameters in various ecosystems is different and directly depends on the degree of drought and temperature the findings showed that the wild boars in the study area has acquired adaptations to increase the efficiency and use of food resources that are compatible with the local ecosystems the woodlands and orchards within deeply incised streams and u shaped valleys and moving along riverbeds have increased their access to the vineyards according to the results increasing the distance from residential areas to 1800 m increases the likelihood of conflict most villages and residential areas are centralized and close to the areas where there are gardens which has caused most conflicts to occur at short distances from rural areas the favorable conditions of the margins of residential areas were analyzed by niche breadth metrics table 8 therefore the presence of the species in the margins of human settlements is not unexpected the tendency of the species to be close to residential areas can be due to the proximity of these areas to gardens in other words the location of gardens on the edge of residential and rural areas has caused the boar to approach these areas lópez et al 2014 conducted a study in the iberian peninsula spain southwest of the arctic and concluded that the highest presence of boars is near human settlements and areas that have been severely altered by humans which is consistent with the findings of this study there are also reports of boar presence on the margins of residential areas in germany jansen et al 2007 however the findings of this study are not consistent with the studies by lyang and lee 2010 in mt jeombong in korea fu et al al 2022 in jilin province of china frackowiak et al 2013 in northeast poland and also with the results of rho 2015 in gangwon do and jeollanam do in korea and saito et al 2012 in chiba prefecture japan reporting that boars prefer distances away from human settlements in a study by ficetola et al 2014 areas with low human density moderate forest cover and shrub cover were suitable for the species therefore the presence or non presence of boars near residential areas also depends on the favorableness of other habitat variables as the distance from the road increases the probability of conflict increases and from a greater distance the conflict will decrease the main arak hamedan road passes through the gardens due to the ease of access most roads are in the path of gardens accordingly the maximum distance of 2 km is the distance the boars keep from the roads in the region the proximity of the wild boars to roads and residential areas indicates that they are constantly aware of the spatiotemporal activities in these areas helping them beware of the risks of these areas such activity of the species has been observed by weverse et al 2020 in hoge kempen national park and fu et al 2022 in jilin most recorded conflicts with the species occur in late summer and early fall and most of the displacement of boar flocks around the gardens is related to this period of 2 to 3 months while the conflict is not high in the other seasons of spring and winter the fruiting of the gardens fruiting seasons and the sweetness of the grapes in late summer and early autumn can be a reason for this because in other seasons when the grapes are not yet fully ripe the boars movements are less such seasonally consistent activity for boars has also been reported in studies by johann et al 2020 from central europe and keuling et al 2008 from germany in summer with the sunset the activity and movement of the boars begin which is probably because the days are hot in addition during the grape harvest from the orchards the daily presence of farmers in the fields and orchards has led to the postponement of the boars activities to the night in a study by brivio et al 2017 on boar activities the results showed that the boar was nocturnal throughout the year which contradicts the findings of this study and could indicate the presence of human pressures or the high adaptability of the boars in the different distribution regions according to the results 21 89 of conflict prone areas are inside protected and no hunting areas this is due to the gardens and agricultural lands in and around these areas parts of lashgardar and golparabad regions have farm fields and vineyards the same also applies to no hunting areas with food shortages and declining quality inside the habitat the conflict will not be unexpected in and around these areas in such a situation we are faced with the management of vertebrate biodiversity conservation in the context of multiple land uses which should adopt the appropriate management model hansen et al 1993 accepted the two hypotheses that the reaction of animal species to landscape changes is a function of the species life history and local pattern of changes they proposed a pattern that includes five steps 1 set clear goals for land management 2 connect the species to the structure and configure the landscape 3 assess potential habitats of the species 4 use simulations to predict the future patterns 5 implement scenarios and investigate the species response implementing this model for the boar populations in the county landscape is necessary an area equivalent to 78 11 of the conflict prone regions is located outside the protected areas which requires prevention approaches a large population of wild boars is present outside the protected areas thus the reserve effect which refers to the use of protected areas as a shelter during hunting seasons does not apply to the protected areas in this study which contradicts the findings of colomer et al 2021 and amici et al 2012 this role in the study area can be defined for the woodlands various methods have been proposed to prevent possible damage of boars to agricultural products sapkota et al 2014 thapa 2010 saito et al 2011 due to the high rate of adaptation giménez anaya et al 2020 especially with human dominated environments stillfried et al 2017 a combination of different methods is proposed to use pandey et al 2016 some have proposed direct firing and food poisoning as a solution for controlling the populations of this species massei et al 2011 west et al 2009 hanson et al 2009 due to the possibility of the wolf attacks in hamadan province and malayer county behdarvand et al 2014 the methods such as hunting poisoning or any other methods cause a sudden decline in the population of this species is dangerous the declining population of this species may lead to more dangerous conflicts such as increasing the likelihood of wolf attacks on humans and livestock mohammadi et al al 2019 in the county as the balance between prey and predator will be lost there are reports of wolf canis lupus attacks on domestic livestock due to declining prey carbone et al al 1999 considering the predator s dependence on changing the prey s population size carbone et al 1999 and reducing its access to wolves the possibility of increasing the conflict of this species in the distribution range especially in the home range is not far from expectation jhala 2003 treves et al 2011 meriggi and lovari 1996 considered the protection of wild ungulates as the most important way to reduce the number of wolf attacks on livestock to prevent damage of boars to gardens the use of fences or walls is suggested as mentioned in other studies honda et al 2008 saito et al 2011 in late summer as grapes ripen locals use various methods to prevent boar infestation including night attendance at vineyards using an aerial shot to warn and using domestic dogs these traditional methods of indigenous people chardonnet et al 2010 are more effective than the modern methods electric fencing or net wires thapa 2010 sapkota et al 2014 in cases where large herds of boars attack these gardens the doe will issue a hunting permit for traditional vineyards instead of traditional cultivation the tree is on the ground support structures are also suggested reducing the impact of pests and increasing production zhang et al 1995 reported that the lighting and microclimate under the canopy greatly affect the grape cluster s growth yield and quality and the more light is received by the plant grape the more quantity and quality of the fruit experiments performed around the world show the superiority of the grapevine support structures adjusting the ratio of c n carbohydrate to nitrogen and increasing it in the grape plant increases the amount of plant assimilates and allows the conversion of vegetative organs to reproductive organs in annual branches reynolds and heuvel 2009 however the higher cost compared to traditional cultivation is an issue that arises regarding the use of this cultivation system 5 conclusions different compositions of the landscape are effective in the formation of conflict with wildlife landforms such as u shaped valleys and deeply incised streams as the physical structure of the landscape by providing secondary conditions like creating moisture and microclimate for vegetation have caused these areas to have more dense vegetation than other landform classes and provide favourable conditions for the presence and distribution of boars integrating ecological niche width criteria with the findings from the distribution modeling contributes to better transparency and analysis of different land use land cover and landform types therefore it is suggested that with the help of sdms the width of the conflict niche be examined separately for the different landscape classes to analyze the desired range of boar activity in more detail the boar population management approaches in the study area should be with full knowledge of the ecological relationships of the species especially predator prey relations therefore future studies are proposed on the diet of wolves canis lupus in malayer and the overlap of boar conflict with wolfs habitat any drastic change in the boar population can lead to increased wolf conflict with local communities in the county therefore it is suggested that management measures do not lead to severe population fluctuations gardeners can also take an important step toward increasing crop production and reducing conflict by mechanizing cultivation switching from traditional methods to grapevine support structures and creating tall hedges identification and analysis of

24388,confluences are common habitats of ecological significance given their complicated hydraulic structures and mass transportation in hydropower cascades dissolved gas supersaturation downstream of a dam becomes a negative environmental impact caused by dam spilling which may cause fish to suffer from gas bubble disease and even death a difference in the supersaturation level of dissolved gas is consistently noted between the mainstream and tributaries mainly due to their different cascade developments and dam scales resulting in a significant nonuniform distribution of dissolved gas at a confluence this study focused on describing the hydrodynamics and dissolved gas distributions under unsteady inflows at an actual confluence of the min river and jinsha river in china a long period of prototype observations on dissolved oxygen do were conducted to demonstrate do variation at the confluence and calibrate the do dissipation coefficient a depth averaged two dimensional numerical model was developed that reflects the nonconstant characteristics of flow and supersaturated do at the confluence and was verified to be in good agreement with the measured data series the supersaturated do level at the confluence increases as the inflow do level of the mainstream jinsha river increases and decreases as the flow ratio of the branch min river and jinsha river increases representing two aspects influencing the distribution of do at the confluence a comparison was performed to evaluate the do saturation calculation method when do was laterally mixed downstream of the confluence the accuracy of the flow weighted average calculation based on the data of the mainstream and a tributary upstream of the confluence was acceptable but the simulation method was recommended to obtain a refined distribution and spatial utilization of supersaturated do at the confluence when it was necessary to pay more attention to the ecological function in this region a two dimensional unsteady numerical model based on valuable prototype observations was proposed which provides technical tools for characterizing the hydrodynamics and dissolved gas variations and distributions at confluences and better evaluating the risk for fish in regions of great ecological significance keywords dissolved gas supersaturation confluences field observation numerical model unsteady flow 1 introduction the confluence of rivers forms a river network and the confluence zone as its connection point exhibits a unique hydraulic structure and material transport characteristics benda et al 2004 the tributaries have a backwater effect on the mainstream and the differences in velocity and momentum between the tributary and mainstream create several flow regimes with different turbulence features yang et al 2010 in the mixing regions given the complex characteristics of the confluence zone six main flow zones are shaped best 1986 of which the stagnate zone and separation zone of the confluence zone have more moderate flow velocities that are biologically friendly clarke and wharton 2001 lush vegetation in confluence bank and the turbulent kinetic energy be changed by vegetation yang et al 2021 nutrient rich sediments are easily deposited allowing aquatic organisms to thrive jones and schmidt 2018 wang et al 2012 thus these areas represent an important spawning and baiting ground for fish and a biological hotspot in the river network system fernandes podos and lundberg 2004 nutrient replenishment from high sediment bearing flows during floods in particular makes the confluence area ecologically important as a site for fish to solicit bait for fertilization with the construction and operation of cascade power stations the hydrological situation of natural rivers changes bai et al 2012 although the frequency and peak flow of large floods are reduced under flood storage gan et al 2020 it is still difficult to meet the demand of flood scheduling by relying on power generation during floods and flood relief structures need to be activated to release water to cross the river the release of water from high dams is accompanied by supersaturation of dissolved gas in the water downstream of the dam qu et al 2011 zhang yang and liu 2020 and the release of dissolved gas is slow in the process of transport with flow thus long term life in water supersaturated with dissolved gas will lead to bubble disease and even large scale mortality in fish smiley et al 2011 backman and evans 2002 also found that supersaturated gas stress reduces the swimming ability of fish affects the fertility of fish with migratory spawning requirements during the flood season wang et al 2017 and reduces the ability of fish to swim for bait the united nations environmental programme unep proposed 110 as the upper limit of supersaturated dissolved gas in rivers and a research team from sichuan university in china proposed 115 as the tolerance threshold for endemic fish in the upper yangtze river wang et al 2020 faced with the ecological risk it is necessary to study the distribution and dissipation pattern of supersaturated dissolved gas in confluence regions most previous studies on confluence areas focus on hydrodynamics sediments and traditional pollutant transport ahmad et al 2019 calculated the correlation between the separation zone and confluence angle froude number and mainstream width based on three dimensional numerical simulations cheng and constantinescu 2018 employed a numerical model to calculate the stratification effect under riverbed inconsistency for the mixing interface effects liu et al 2019 studied the pollution transport characteristics of y shaped confluences yuan et al 2019 investigated the sediment transport pattern on the water surface and its distribution of adsorbed phosphorus at the huaihe river confluence in china huai et al 2019 used innovative displacement model simulated suspended sediment concentration in open channel and analysed the profile with double averaging method huai et al2020 studies on supersaturated dissolved gas in confluence areas are less frequently reported shen et al 2016 established a planar two dimensional mathematical model of constant flow validated the results using a confluent experimental flume and proposed the idea of using low total dissolved gas tdg saturation of tributaries to create fish refuge space at confluence areas shen 2019 continued to establish a three dimensional constant flow model in the confluence area based on experimental data and analysed the relationship of the refuge area range with the flow ratio through experimental research zhou et al 2019 also demonstrated that fish have the ability to sense the gradient of supersaturated dissolved gas at confluences and swim to tributaries to avoid the adverse effects of supersaturated dissolved gas current research on river confluence areas is mostly focused on hydrodynamic characteristics and sediment and pollutant transport gualtieri et al 2018 xie yang and lundstrom 2020 zhang et al 2020 and the distribution of supersaturated dissolved gas at the confluence region is only based on results from experimental conditions of constant flow in lab flumes the mainstream and tributary interactions of natural rivers at confluences are more complicated by topography and river potential zhang feng and chen 2020 and the inconsistent nature of the mainstream and tributary flow processes and dissolved gas levels also lead to a more complex distribution of supersaturated gas at the confluence and its impact on fish therefore this study analysed the changes in the distribution of supersaturated dissolved gas in actual river confluences based on 34 days of continuous field observations and proposed a prediction model that reflects the distribution characteristics of water flow and supersaturated dissolved gas under nonconstant flow conditions which was validated by field monitoring data series this research provided a technical tool that is of great significance to the ecological protection of hydropower development rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 field observation 2 1 1 observation region and sections setting the confluence of the jinsha river and minjiang river was selected for prototype observation which is called the yangtze river after the confluence of the two rivers in yibin the final dam stage of the jinsha river is xiangjiaba power station xjb which is approximately 30 km from the confluence the final hub of the minjiang river is the longxikou water conservancy hub lxk which is approximately 70 km from the confluence a 162 m high dam is located at the xjb station and surface and middle holes are used to release flood water with significant dissolved gas supersaturation downstream of flooding the 20 2 m high lxk hub only uses flood gates to release flood water therefore no significant supersaturation phenomenon was found in the minjiang river reach during the flood period four observation sections were established in the research region these sections were located 28 km upstream of the confluence under the xjb jsr 1 1 km upstream of the confluence in the jinsha river section jsr 2 2 km upstream of the confluence in the minjiang river section mjr and 1 km downstream of the confluence in the yangtze section yzr due to the limitation of observation conditions the monitoring point of the jsr 1 section was located on the left bank and the other three sections were monitored using ferries for the left middle and right sides the location distribution of the monitoring sections is shown in fig 1 2 1 2 monitoring periods and methods day by day monitoring at the four observation sections was conducted for 34 days in july august 2020 measured indicators included dissolved oxygen do concentration do saturation atmospheric pressure temperature and surface flow velocity the portable multiparameter pro20 water quality analyser ysi corporation usa was used to measure the do concentration do saturation atmospheric pressure and temperature this instrument can measure do concentrations in the range of 0 50 mg l with an accuracy of 0 1 mg l the range of do saturation is 0 200 and the accuracy is 1 the instrument is able to measure local atmospheric pressure from 50 to 110 kpa with a precision of 0 2 kpa the instrument measures temperatures in the range of 5 c to 70 c with an accuracy of 0 2 c river surface velocity was investigated on the stream surface with a doppler svr electrowave velocity detector decatur company the measuring range was 0 1 m s 9 1 m s and the accuracy was 0 01 m s 2 2 numerical simulation prototype observations showed that the dissolved gas saturation of the minjiang river was lower than that of the jinsha river during the monitoring periods forming a significant lateral distribution in the confluence area the distribution was complicated because it was affected by the unsteady change in flow and saturation of the main and tributaries which was minimally accurately expressed despite monitoring scattering points to further explore the change in the distribution of supersaturated dissolved gas at the interaction area and attempt to protect and take advantage of this ecologically important area it was necessary to establish a mathematical model considering the unique hydraulic structure and complex dissolved gas transport process at the confluence area where the mainstream and tributary flows were simultaneously nonconstant and to simulate the changes in the distributions of supersaturated dissolved gas under the unsteady incoming flow conditions of the confluent rivers based on prototype observations 2 2 1 model equations a depth average planar 2d

of the xjb to 45 km downstream of the confluence to completely consider the impact of the confluence from the tributary minjiang river a 13 km region of the minjiang river was used to perform the calculation a triangular grid was used to grid the area local encryption was conducted in the boundary area and local grid encryption was conducted in the confluence area as shown in fig 2 2 2 3 boundary conditions the simulation region contains two inlets of the jinsha river and minjiang river both of which adopt the flow boundary as model conditions the model outlet was a 45 km section of the yangtze river downstream of the confluence that adopts the water level as the boundary condition the flow process of the jinsha river adopts the outflow of the xjb and the supersaturation of dissolved gas adopts the measured value at the jsr 1 section at station lxk there was no regulation capacity so the measured flow at gaochang hydrological station 6 km upstream of the power station was used the dissolved gas saturation was extrapolated from the measured value of the mjr section the water level boundary at the outlet of the calculation area was calculated using the measured data from the zhutuo hydrological station 70 km downstream of the confluence and back projected using a one dimensional hydrodynamic calculation the inlet flow and process of supersaturated dissolved gas in the simulation period are shown in figs 3 and 4 2 2 4 parameter determination the manning coefficient for bottom roughness was set at 0 03 the smagorinsky coefficient used for the turbulence model was 0 28 the horizontal dispersion of the transport equation was used for the scaled eddy viscosity formulation in which the dispersion coefficient is calculated by scaling eddy viscosity multiplied factor be 1 2 the dissipation coefficient an important parameter affecting the release of supersaturated dissolved gas was related to hydrodynamic factors such as depth and flow velocity and environmental elements such as temperature sediment content and surface wind speed feng et al 2014 reference to previous researches different river network accompany with variety dissipation determinations glroia et al 2016 kamal et al 2019 li et al 2015 because the calculated river reach was not considered the effect of variation in the dissipation coefficient was not significant and a dissipation coefficient was calculated based on file observations for model simulation 3 results 3 1 field observation results the field measurement results are shown in fig 5 the saturation of do was higher in the jinsha river and lower in the minjiang river upstream of the confluence the do saturation was basically uniformly distributed in the lateral direction and the difference in saturation between the left middle and right measured points was not significant when two flows interacted the monitoring saturation value of the yzr section was lower than that of the jsr 2 section forming a remarkably inhomogeneous distribution of do saturation with low left banks and high right banks the do saturation levels at the jsr 2 section mjr section and yzr section during the monitoring period ranged from 104 to 130 94 to 113 and 98 to 121 respectively according to the daily observational results of the three sections fig 5 the saturation of the yzr section at confluence was between jsr 2 and mjr and saturation discrepancies between the left bank and right bank ranged from 2 to 20 the flow rate range of jinsha river is from 4000 m3 s to 16 500 m3 s while the saturation of jsr 1 section range from 116 to 133 in order to distinguish the distributions of supersaturated gas at the confluence under different flow levels three flow rate range was defined considering the fact that generated dissolved gas totally increases with flow rate increasing it was defined 4000 m3 s to 6000 m3 s to be low flow condition 6000 m3 s to 10 000 m3 s to be medium flow condition and discharges more than 10 000 m3 s to be high flow condition which was shown in table 1 compared with the monitoring results from the high flow medium flow and low flow days of the jinsha river in fig 7 the do saturation differences between the left bank and right bank of the yzr section were 14 16 and 9 respectively a comparative analysis of the saturation processes on the banks of the yzr section and mainstream and tributary in fig 6 shows that the saturation process on the right bank of the yzr section was similar to the jinsha river saturation process and the saturation process on the left bank of the section was similar to the minjiang river process 3 2 coefficient calibration as noted in the flow process diagram the discharge varies greatly in the investigation period moreover the flow rate during the rise and fall process of the jinsha river and minjiang river was not consistent regarding the jinsha river flow rate the three day discharge values on the 28th day average flow 14966 m3 s 11th day average flow 8578 m3 s and 23th day average flow 4116 m3 s represent high flow middle flow and low flow levels respectively for the calibration dissipation coefficients more details on calibration conditions are presented in table 1 a significant dissolved gas distribution phenomenon is noted at the interaction between the main river and the tributaries and the low saturation zone appears on the tributary side the dissipation coefficient of dissolved gas was obtained using the trial method with a value of 7 4 10 7 s the distribution of supersaturated do for each calculated working condition was consistent with the measured values among which the simulation results of the confluence area on day 11 are shown in fig 8 the comparison between the measured and calculated values at the monitoring points of the jsr 2 and yzr sections under the three conditions is shown in fig 6 and the average difference was 0 3 the maximum difference between the simulated and measured values at the middle of the river measurement point if the jsr 2 section was 1 and the maximum difference between the calculated and monitored values at the bank measurement point of the yzr section was 1 8 3 3 model validation the boundary conditions in section 2 2 3 and the coefficient identified in section 2 2 4 were used to simulate 34 days of nonconstant flow in the study area 3 3 1 flow field the simulation results were verified using the flow velocity values measured by the yzr section surface flow a total of 15 flow velocity measurements were obtained on the left bank of the yangtze river during the prototype observation periods as shown in fig 10 the results show that the simulated flow velocity is basically consistent with the measured flow velocities and the model accurately reflects the flow velocity at confluences 3 2 2 supersaturated do comparing the saturation values simulated with the measured values of the jsr 2 and yzr sections in fig 11 where the jsr 2 section was located upstream of confluences and there was no significant difference in dissolved gas saturation in the cross section the middle point jsr 2 m measured saturation values were employed to verify the simulated results the yzr section distribution was impacted by the tributary and presented an obvious uneven distribution in the lateral direction thus the measured values on the left middle and right banks were used to verify the model model calculation results show that the overall saturation of the yzr section left bank was lower than that of the right bank after the confluence of the minjiang river which was consistent with the monitoring conclusion regarding the calculation time series the calculated results fit well with the measured values the simulated data of section jsr 2 are shown in fig 11 a the average deviation between simulated and measured was 1 2 and the largest deviation was 6 7 the simulated results of the left bank of section yzr are shown in fig 11 c the average deviation between simulated and measured was 1 6 and the largest deviation was 5 the average deviation of the middle point of section yzr was 2 2 and the largest deviation was 4 8 as shown in fig 11 b according to fig 11 d the average deviation of simulated and measured results was 1 4 and the largest deviation was 5 combined with the above results the simulated results basically reflect the supersaturation dissolved gas change process at confluence areas with spatial and time distributions under the conditions of nonconstant flow and supersaturated gas in the mainstream and tributary rivers the nonconstant supersaturated dissolved gas prediction model and parameter determination methods established in this paper better predict the transport and distribution of supersaturated dissolved gas in the confluence area of the actual river networks 3 4 flow features in confluences fig 12 shows the velocity field at the confluence area under each jinsha river inflow condition fig 12 a shows that under the low inflow condition of the jinsha river the average flow velocity of the jinsha river was 0 5 m s and the flow velocity of the minjiang river was 4 m s the maximum flow zone appeared in the middle area of confluences after the two flows made contact and the velocity was 3 3 m s until the velocity regain zone section the average velocity was 2 9 m s in the cross section a separation zone of low velocity was formed near the tributary bank and the flow velocity in the separation zone was only 0 2 0 7 m s the width of the separation zone was 120 m and the length was 48 m the formation of the flow stagnation zone at the confluence corner was not obvious the flow field under the condition of comparable flow rates of the mainstream and tributary is shown in fig 12 b the velocity of the jinsha river was 1 5 m s the velocity of the minjiang river was 1 8 m s the maximum zone velocity reached 2 2 m s the low velocity separation zone still existed on the left bank but the acreage was reduced the width decreased to 70 m and the length was reduced to 370 m the flow velocity stagnation zone observably appeared in the confluence corner and the average velocity was only 0 4 m s when the jinsha river stream discharge was significantly higher than the minjiang river flow the average velocity of the jinsha river was approximately 2 5 m s the minjiang river velocity was 1 4 m s and the velocity in the maximum zone was 2 8 m s in the middle zone of the yangtze river the acreage of the separation zone on the tributary bank further decreased the area width was only 55 m and the length was only 220 m the stagnate zone developed at the confluence and the length increased to 200 m as shown in fig 12 c in summary when mainstream flow occurs at low velocity conditions the flow velocity of the confluence area is consistent with that of the tributary and the maximum flow velocity zone was in the middle of the river on the side of the tributary in addition the separation zone was formed on the left bank with the increase in the mainstream flow the mainstream velocity increases in one aspect the joint action of the mainstream and tributaries affects the velocity distribution in the confluence region the maximum zone gradually moves to the opposite bank of the tributaries the area of the separation zone shrinks in contrast to the gradual increase in the flow stagnation area at the confluence corner 3 5 distribution characteristics of do in confluences fig 13 shows the distribution of supersaturation dissolved gas under different mainstream flow conditions under the low inflow condition of the mainstream the saturation of mainstream inlet is 115 and the tributary saturation is in a normal saturation sate the region close to equilibrium saturation and the degree of saturation predominate at the yzr section laterally indicating that the inflow from tributary was the main flow in the sink area the supersaturation area exists on the right bank and the supersaturation on the right bank of the confluence is slightly decreased compared with the mainstream the supersaturation in water continued to decrease as the downstream distances from confluences increased in addition there was a tendency to spread to the opposite side the high supersaturation water does not continue to extend downstream but rather stays near the right bank region of the yzr monitoring section the downstream waters are all close to equilibrium saturation within a short distance as the inflow of the jinsha river increased the distribution of supersaturated do was much different compared to the low flow condition first as the mainstream spill discharge increased the supersaturation of the jinsha river increased up to 133 which was 18 higher than the low flow condition however the saturation of the tributary with minimal floating remained in the normal saturation state second the normal saturation area in the confluence gradually decreased the tributary saturation area horizontally was compressed towards the tributary side banks and the supersaturated water gradually widened occupying up to 3 4 of the channel width in the longitudinal direction the length of the natural saturation region on the left bank of the confluence gradually decreased a shortening of the downstream propagation distance was noted and the low saturation area on the left bank extended a limited distance at the highest flow condition approximately 2 km downstream after which the normal saturation area in the river disappeared the whole river water was in an oversaturated state and the distribution trend still gradually increased from the left bank to the right bank this distribution difference starts to weaken in the process of flowing downstream making the saturation on the left bank exhibit an increasing phenomenon and the saturation on the right bank exhibit a decreasing trend for the completely mixed section the average supersaturation was still high at 120 the mixed section distances from confluences under low flow middle flow and high flow conditions were 3 5 km 4 km and 4 5 km respectively 4 discussion 4 1 downstream supersaturation level the level of dissolved gas supersaturation of the yangtze river was influenced by the interaction of the jinsha river and minjiang river the army corps of engineers proposed a method using pollutant mixing theory to calculate the supersaturation in the confluence by flow weighted averaging u s army corps of engineers 2005 but this method has not been verified using measured data from the scene the saturation weights of the tributary and mainstream were defined by flow discharges and the following formula is used to calculate the weight averaged supersaturation in confluences 6 g f q t g t q m g m q t q m where g t and g m are the saturation of the tributary and mainstream respectively the measured saturation values and simulation results of the jsr 2 mjr yzr and yzr u sections were selected to analyse the variation in supersaturated dissolved gas levels at the confluences of the two streams and the calculation methods the yzr u section was the section where dissolved gas was completely mixed and reached a uniform distribution in the cross section on the yangtze river in accordance with the simulated results the farthest mixed section settles 4 8 km downstream of confluences the shortest fully mixed section was 3 km downstream of the confluence the averaged mixed distance was 4 5 km thus the section was determined to be a completely mixed section yzr u in the yangtze river the saturation flow weight averaged hydrograph cal line was obtained by calculating the flow rate and saturation value of jinsha river and minjiang river the measured values of the yzr cross section bar line were obtained using the arithmetic average of monitoring saturation of the left middle and right bank of yzr section based on simulation results the averaged values of dissolved gas in sections yzr and yzr u were obtained sim 1 and sim 2 and the final result is presented in fig 14 the figure shows that the weight averaged do saturation process with discharge data and stream saturation roughly agrees with the monitoring results of the yzr section with an average deviation of 1 6 the largest deviation that occurs on day 16 was 4 6 the sim 2 saturation is slightly lower than sim 1 due to the dissipation effect of dissolved gas comparing the two simulated lines with the measured data shows that the trends of the simulated and measured results were consistent and basically matched using the simulated value of the yzr section for statistical analysis the average error with the measured value was 1 4 and the maximum error was 5 4 in comparison given that the numerical simulation takes into account the diffusion mass transmission and dissipation of dissolved gas when calculating the simulated results are closer to the actual level thus the results in the figure also show that the simulated values are closer to the measured values than the calculated values of the weighted average of the jinsha and minjiang rivers the above analysis indicated that the results of flow weighted averaging using the inflow supersaturated dissolved gas levels of two or more rivers can be used when accuracy is not required and can roughly meet the requirements if fine scale results of supersaturated dissolved gas processes in confluence areas are needed it was recommended that numerical simulations be used to obtain the supersaturated dissolved gas distribution in the confluence as a method to more accurately analyse the effect of mainstream and tributary interactions on the dissolved gas distribution zeng mo and chen 2020 4 2 low saturation zone analysis using 115 as the safety saturation and statistical the safety zone acreage cao et al 2016 form the confluence to the completed mixed section yzr u which is the safety zone area ratio observed in fig 15 the zone acreages are not constant under unsteady conditions during study phase the size of the safe saturation area of the confluence area was directly influenced by the saturation of the incoming mainstream flow and the relationship between the saturation of the jinsha river boundary and the area share of the safe area is shown in fig 15 the data demonstrate that as the safe saturation area increases the input saturation of the jinsha river showed a decreasing trend and the most unfavourable situation is jinsha river inflow saturation achieved 133 and 125 the analysis reveals that the former situation was due to the mainstream saturation and was caused by the weakening of the tributary remit effect due to high mainstream flows and the weakening of tributary dilution effect for small flows in the latter case mahmodinia and javan 2020 the input low saturated water from the mainstream enhances the effect of tributary creation in the confluence area creating a larger region of safety in the confluence the condition of safe saturation in the confluence area as a whole was that the input saturation of the jinsha river was less than or equal to 115 second considering that safety zone acreage is related to the ratio of the inflow of the minjiang river to the flow of the jinsha river the relationship between the area of the safety zone and the flow ratio of the tributaries is shown in fig 16 in general the flow ratio has a fine linear relationship with the area ratio and the r2 value was 0 43 as the flow ratio increased the area ratio also increased however the proportion of tributaries was not the only control factor for example the flow ratio was 0 38 on day 11 and the area ratio was 78 7 in contrast on day 13 the same flow ratio was used but the area ratio of the safety zone was only 38 the analysis of the jinsha river revealed that the saturation degree was 117 on day 11 and 123 on day 13 and that of the minjiang river saturation booth was 105 under the same inflow conditions the low saturation created a safer saturation zone in the intermediate transition zone whereas the dilution effect was reduced at high saturation which made the intermediate transition zone still under dangerous saturation it was necessary to jointly consider the combined action of the jinsha river do level and flow ratio in the low saturation zone in confluences created by the import of tributaries the zone is mainly contoured by two elements mainstream supersaturation and the ratio of tributaries and mainstreams shen et al 2019 in the medium saturation region between the mainstream saturation and the tributary saturation in the mixing region of confluences the mainstream decides whether the medium region belongs to the safety zone tributary discharges decide the tributary saturation zone acreage and the dilution to the mainstream and a larger flow ratio tributary creates a larger safety zone 5 conclusions field measurements and mathematical models were used to simulate the supersaturation dissolved gas distribution and change process in natural river confluences under unsteady conditions combining the model and monitored data the following conclusions were obtained 1 the distribution of supersaturation dissolved gas in river confluences under unsteady inflow conditions is reported in the lateral distribution the region of the low saturation is main influenced by the tributaries and the saturation of the high saturation region follows the mainstream saturation process 2 flow conditions affect the size of the separation and stagnation the higher the flow of tributaries the larger the separation zone the greater the main flow the larger the area of the stagnation zone 3 mixing regions were severely turbulent but could not promote the dissipation of supersaturated dissolved gas for the 4 5 km downstream area of the junction the flow weighted average calculation method can be used to estimate the average saturation value of the section 4 in the confluences a safety saturation area was created by the inflow of low saturation water from tributaries and its area was affected by the degree of mainstream saturation and the flow ratio between tributaries and the mainstream the higher the mainstream saturation the smaller the safety saturation area the higher the tributary confluence ratio the higher the safety saturation area credit authorship contribution statement zhuo chen software data curation writing original draft visualization jingjie feng conceptualization

24388,confluences are common habitats of ecological significance given their complicated hydraulic structures and mass transportation in hydropower cascades dissolved gas supersaturation downstream of a dam becomes a negative environmental impact caused by dam spilling which may cause fish to suffer from gas bubble disease and even death a difference in the supersaturation level of dissolved gas is consistently noted between the mainstream and tributaries mainly due to their different cascade developments and dam scales resulting in a significant nonuniform distribution of dissolved gas at a confluence this study focused on describing the hydrodynamics and dissolved gas distributions under unsteady inflows at an actual confluence of the min river and jinsha river in china a long period of prototype observations on dissolved oxygen do were conducted to demonstrate do variation at the confluence and calibrate the do dissipation coefficient a depth averaged two dimensional numerical model was developed that reflects the nonconstant characteristics of flow and supersaturated do at the confluence and was verified to be in good agreement with the measured data series the supersaturated do level at the confluence increases as the inflow do level of the mainstream jinsha river increases and decreases as the flow ratio of the branch min river and jinsha river increases representing two aspects influencing the distribution of do at the confluence a comparison was performed to evaluate the do saturation calculation method when do was laterally mixed downstream of the confluence the accuracy of the flow weighted average calculation based on the data of the mainstream and a tributary upstream of the confluence was acceptable but the simulation method was recommended to obtain a refined distribution and spatial utilization of supersaturated do at the confluence when it was necessary to pay more attention to the ecological function in this region a two dimensional unsteady numerical model based on valuable prototype observations was proposed which provides technical tools for characterizing the hydrodynamics and dissolved gas variations and distributions at confluences and better evaluating the risk for fish in regions of great ecological significance keywords dissolved gas supersaturation confluences field observation numerical model unsteady flow 1 introduction the confluence of rivers forms a river network and the confluence zone as its connection point exhibits a unique hydraulic structure and material transport characteristics benda et al 2004 the tributaries have a backwater effect on the mainstream and the differences in velocity and momentum between the tributary and mainstream create several flow regimes with different turbulence features yang et al 2010 in the mixing regions given the complex characteristics of the confluence zone six main flow zones are shaped best 1986 of which the stagnate zone and separation zone of the confluence zone have more moderate flow velocities that are biologically friendly clarke and wharton 2001 lush vegetation in confluence bank and the turbulent kinetic energy be changed by vegetation yang et al 2021 nutrient rich sediments are easily deposited allowing aquatic organisms to thrive jones and schmidt 2018 wang et al 2012 thus these areas represent an important spawning and baiting ground for fish and a biological hotspot in the river network system fernandes podos and lundberg 2004 nutrient replenishment from high sediment bearing flows during floods in particular makes the confluence area ecologically important as a site for fish to solicit bait for fertilization with the construction and operation of cascade power stations the hydrological situation of natural rivers changes bai et al 2012 although the frequency and peak flow of large floods are reduced under flood storage gan et al 2020 it is still difficult to meet the demand of flood scheduling by relying on power generation during floods and flood relief structures need to be activated to release water to cross the river the release of water from high dams is accompanied by supersaturation of dissolved gas in the water downstream of the dam qu et al 2011 zhang yang and liu 2020 and the release of dissolved gas is slow in the process of transport with flow thus long term life in water supersaturated with dissolved gas will lead to bubble disease and even large scale mortality in fish smiley et al 2011 backman and evans 2002 also found that supersaturated gas stress reduces the swimming ability of fish affects the fertility of fish with migratory spawning requirements during the flood season wang et al 2017 and reduces the ability of fish to swim for bait the united nations environmental programme unep proposed 110 as the upper limit of supersaturated dissolved gas in rivers and a research team from sichuan university in china proposed 115 as the tolerance threshold for endemic fish in the upper yangtze river wang et al 2020 faced with the ecological risk it is necessary to study the distribution and dissipation pattern of supersaturated dissolved gas in confluence regions most previous studies on confluence areas focus on hydrodynamics sediments and traditional pollutant transport ahmad et al 2019 calculated the correlation between the separation zone and confluence angle froude number and mainstream width based on three dimensional numerical simulations cheng and constantinescu 2018 employed a numerical model to calculate the stratification effect under riverbed inconsistency for the mixing interface effects liu et al 2019 studied the pollution transport characteristics of y shaped confluences yuan et al 2019 investigated the sediment transport pattern on the water surface and its distribution of adsorbed phosphorus at the huaihe river confluence in china huai et al 2019 used innovative displacement model simulated suspended sediment concentration in open channel and analysed the profile with double averaging method huai et al2020 studies on supersaturated dissolved gas in confluence areas are less frequently reported shen et al 2016 established a planar two dimensional mathematical model of constant flow validated the results using a confluent experimental flume and proposed the idea of using low total dissolved gas tdg saturation of tributaries to create fish refuge space at confluence areas shen 2019 continued to establish a three dimensional constant flow model in the confluence area based on experimental data and analysed the relationship of the refuge area range with the flow ratio through experimental research zhou et al 2019 also demonstrated that fish have the ability to sense the gradient of supersaturated dissolved gas at confluences and swim to tributaries to avoid the adverse effects of supersaturated dissolved gas current research on river confluence areas is mostly focused on hydrodynamic characteristics and sediment and pollutant transport gualtieri et al 2018 xie yang and lundstrom 2020 zhang et al 2020 and the distribution of supersaturated dissolved gas at the confluence region is only based on results from experimental conditions of constant flow in lab flumes the mainstream and tributary interactions of natural rivers at confluences are more complicated by topography and river potential zhang feng and chen 2020 and the inconsistent nature of the mainstream and tributary flow processes and dissolved gas levels also lead to a more complex distribution of supersaturated gas at the confluence and its impact on fish therefore this study analysed the changes in the distribution of supersaturated dissolved gas in actual river confluences based on 34 days of continuous field observations and proposed a prediction model that reflects the distribution characteristics of water flow and supersaturated dissolved gas under nonconstant flow conditions which was validated by field monitoring data series this research provided a technical tool that is of great significance to the ecological protection of hydropower development rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 field observation 2 1 1 observation region and sections setting the confluence of the jinsha river and minjiang river was selected for prototype observation which is called the yangtze river after the confluence of the two rivers in yibin the final dam stage of the jinsha river is xiangjiaba power station xjb which is approximately 30 km from the confluence the final hub of the minjiang river is the longxikou water conservancy hub lxk which is approximately 70 km from the confluence a 162 m high dam is located at the xjb station and surface and middle holes are used to release flood water with significant dissolved gas supersaturation downstream of flooding the 20 2 m high lxk hub only uses flood gates to release flood water therefore no significant supersaturation phenomenon was found in the minjiang river reach during the flood period four observation sections were established in the research region these sections were located 28 km upstream of the confluence under the xjb jsr 1 1 km upstream of the confluence in the jinsha river section jsr 2 2 km upstream of the confluence in the minjiang river section mjr and 1 km downstream of the confluence in the yangtze section yzr due to the limitation of observation conditions the monitoring point of the jsr 1 section was located on the left bank and the other three sections were monitored using ferries for the left middle and right sides the location distribution of the monitoring sections is shown in fig 1 2 1 2 monitoring periods and methods day by day monitoring at the four observation sections was conducted for 34 days in july august 2020 measured indicators included dissolved oxygen do concentration do saturation atmospheric pressure temperature and surface flow velocity the portable multiparameter pro20 water quality analyser ysi corporation usa was used to measure the do concentration do saturation atmospheric pressure and temperature this instrument can measure do concentrations in the range of 0 50 mg l with an accuracy of 0 1 mg l the range of do saturation is 0 200 and the accuracy is 1 the instrument is able to measure local atmospheric pressure from 50 to 110 kpa with a precision of 0 2 kpa the instrument measures temperatures in the range of 5 c to 70 c with an accuracy of 0 2 c river surface velocity was investigated on the stream surface with a doppler svr electrowave velocity detector decatur company the measuring range was 0 1 m s 9 1 m s and the accuracy was 0 01 m s 2 2 numerical simulation prototype observations showed that the dissolved gas saturation of the minjiang river was lower than that of the jinsha river during the monitoring periods forming a significant lateral distribution in the confluence area the distribution was complicated because it was affected by the unsteady change in flow and saturation of the main and tributaries which was minimally accurately expressed despite monitoring scattering points to further explore the change in the distribution of supersaturated dissolved gas at the interaction area and attempt to protect and take advantage of this ecologically important area it was necessary to establish a mathematical model considering the unique hydraulic structure and complex dissolved gas transport process at the confluence area where the mainstream and tributary flows were simultaneously nonconstant and to simulate the changes in the distributions of supersaturated dissolved gas under the unsteady incoming flow conditions of the confluent rivers based on prototype observations 2 2 1 model equations a depth average planar 2d

of the xjb to 45 km downstream of the confluence to completely consider the impact of the confluence from the tributary minjiang river a 13 km region of the minjiang river was used to perform the calculation a triangular grid was used to grid the area local encryption was conducted in the boundary area and local grid encryption was conducted in the confluence area as shown in fig 2 2 2 3 boundary conditions the simulation region contains two inlets of the jinsha river and minjiang river both of which adopt the flow boundary as model conditions the model outlet was a 45 km section of the yangtze river downstream of the confluence that adopts the water level as the boundary condition the flow process of the jinsha river adopts the outflow of the xjb and the supersaturation of dissolved gas adopts the measured value at the jsr 1 section at station lxk there was no regulation capacity so the measured flow at gaochang hydrological station 6 km upstream of the power station was used the dissolved gas saturation was extrapolated from the measured value of the mjr section the water level boundary at the outlet of the calculation area was calculated using the measured data from the zhutuo hydrological station 70 km downstream of the confluence and back projected using a one dimensional hydrodynamic calculation the inlet flow and process of supersaturated dissolved gas in the simulation period are shown in figs 3 and 4 2 2 4 parameter determination the manning coefficient for bottom roughness was set at 0 03 the smagorinsky coefficient used for the turbulence model was 0 28 the horizontal dispersion of the transport equation was used for the scaled eddy viscosity formulation in which the dispersion coefficient is calculated by scaling eddy viscosity multiplied factor be 1 2 the dissipation coefficient an important parameter affecting the release of supersaturated dissolved gas was related to hydrodynamic factors such as depth and flow velocity and environmental elements such as temperature sediment content and surface wind speed feng et al 2014 reference to previous researches different river network accompany with variety dissipation determinations glroia et al 2016 kamal et al 2019 li et al 2015 because the calculated river reach was not considered the effect of variation in the dissipation coefficient was not significant and a dissipation coefficient was calculated based on file observations for model simulation 3 results 3 1 field observation results the field measurement results are shown in fig 5 the saturation of do was higher in the jinsha river and lower in the minjiang river upstream of the confluence the do saturation was basically uniformly distributed in the lateral direction and the difference in saturation between the left middle and right measured points was not significant when two flows interacted the monitoring saturation value of the yzr section was lower than that of the jsr 2 section forming a remarkably inhomogeneous distribution of do saturation with low left banks and high right banks the do saturation levels at the jsr 2 section mjr section and yzr section during the monitoring period ranged from 104 to 130 94 to 113 and 98 to 121 respectively according to the daily observational results of the three sections fig 5 the saturation of the yzr section at confluence was between jsr 2 and mjr and saturation discrepancies between the left bank and right bank ranged from 2 to 20 the flow rate range of jinsha river is from 4000 m3 s to 16 500 m3 s while the saturation of jsr 1 section range from 116 to 133 in order to distinguish the distributions of supersaturated gas at the confluence under different flow levels three flow rate range was defined considering the fact that generated dissolved gas totally increases with flow rate increasing it was defined 4000 m3 s to 6000 m3 s to be low flow condition 6000 m3 s to 10 000 m3 s to be medium flow condition and discharges more than 10 000 m3 s to be high flow condition which was shown in table 1 compared with the monitoring results from the high flow medium flow and low flow days of the jinsha river in fig 7 the do saturation differences between the left bank and right bank of the yzr section were 14 16 and 9 respectively a comparative analysis of the saturation processes on the banks of the yzr section and mainstream and tributary in fig 6 shows that the saturation process on the right bank of the yzr section was similar to the jinsha river saturation process and the saturation process on the left bank of the section was similar to the minjiang river process 3 2 coefficient calibration as noted in the flow process diagram the discharge varies greatly in the investigation period moreover the flow rate during the rise and fall process of the jinsha river and minjiang river was not consistent regarding the jinsha river flow rate the three day discharge values on the 28th day average flow 14966 m3 s 11th day average flow 8578 m3 s and 23th day average flow 4116 m3 s represent high flow middle flow and low flow levels respectively for the calibration dissipation coefficients more details on calibration conditions are presented in table 1 a significant dissolved gas distribution phenomenon is noted at the interaction between the main river and the tributaries and the low saturation zone appears on the tributary side the dissipation coefficient of dissolved gas was obtained using the trial method with a value of 7 4 10 7 s the distribution of supersaturated do for each calculated working condition was consistent with the measured values among which the simulation results of the confluence area on day 11 are shown in fig 8 the comparison between the measured and calculated values at the monitoring points of the jsr 2 and yzr sections under the three conditions is shown in fig 6 and the average difference was 0 3 the maximum difference between the simulated and measured values at the middle of the river measurement point if the jsr 2 section was 1 and the maximum difference between the calculated and monitored values at the bank measurement point of the yzr section was 1 8 3 3 model validation the boundary conditions in section 2 2 3 and the coefficient identified in section 2 2 4 were used to simulate 34 days of nonconstant flow in the study area 3 3 1 flow field the simulation results were verified using the flow velocity values measured by the yzr section surface flow a total of 15 flow velocity measurements were obtained on the left bank of the yangtze river during the prototype observation periods as shown in fig 10 the results show that the simulated flow velocity is basically consistent with the measured flow velocities and the model accurately reflects the flow velocity at confluences 3 2 2 supersaturated do comparing the saturation values simulated with the measured values of the jsr 2 and yzr sections in fig 11 where the jsr 2 section was located upstream of confluences and there was no significant difference in dissolved gas saturation in the cross section the middle point jsr 2 m measured saturation values were employed to verify the simulated results the yzr section distribution was impacted by the tributary and presented an obvious uneven distribution in the lateral direction thus the measured values on the left middle and right banks were used to verify the model model calculation results show that the overall saturation of the yzr section left bank was lower than that of the right bank after the confluence of the minjiang river which was consistent with the monitoring conclusion regarding the calculation time series the calculated results fit well with the measured values the simulated data of section jsr 2 are shown in fig 11 a the average deviation between simulated and measured was 1 2 and the largest deviation was 6 7 the simulated results of the left bank of section yzr are shown in fig 11 c the average deviation between simulated and measured was 1 6 and the largest deviation was 5 the average deviation of the middle point of section yzr was 2 2 and the largest deviation was 4 8 as shown in fig 11 b according to fig 11 d the average deviation of simulated and measured results was 1 4 and the largest deviation was 5 combined with the above results the simulated results basically reflect the supersaturation dissolved gas change process at confluence areas with spatial and time distributions under the conditions of nonconstant flow and supersaturated gas in the mainstream and tributary rivers the nonconstant supersaturated dissolved gas prediction model and parameter determination methods established in this paper better predict the transport and distribution of supersaturated dissolved gas in the confluence area of the actual river networks 3 4 flow features in confluences fig 12 shows the velocity field at the confluence area under each jinsha river inflow condition fig 12 a shows that under the low inflow condition of the jinsha river the average flow velocity of the jinsha river was 0 5 m s and the flow velocity of the minjiang river was 4 m s the maximum flow zone appeared in the middle area of confluences after the two flows made contact and the velocity was 3 3 m s until the velocity regain zone section the average velocity was 2 9 m s in the cross section a separation zone of low velocity was formed near the tributary bank and the flow velocity in the separation zone was only 0 2 0 7 m s the width of the separation zone was 120 m and the length was 48 m the formation of the flow stagnation zone at the confluence corner was not obvious the flow field under the condition of comparable flow rates of the mainstream and tributary is shown in fig 12 b the velocity of the jinsha river was 1 5 m s the velocity of the minjiang river was 1 8 m s the maximum zone velocity reached 2 2 m s the low velocity separation zone still existed on the left bank but the acreage was reduced the width decreased to 70 m and the length was reduced to 370 m the flow velocity stagnation zone observably appeared in the confluence corner and the average velocity was only 0 4 m s when the jinsha river stream discharge was significantly higher than the minjiang river flow the average velocity of the jinsha river was approximately 2 5 m s the minjiang river velocity was 1 4 m s and the velocity in the maximum zone was 2 8 m s in the middle zone of the yangtze river the acreage of the separation zone on the tributary bank further decreased the area width was only 55 m and the length was only 220 m the stagnate zone developed at the confluence and the length increased to 200 m as shown in fig 12 c in summary when mainstream flow occurs at low velocity conditions the flow velocity of the confluence area is consistent with that of the tributary and the maximum flow velocity zone was in the middle of the river on the side of the tributary in addition the separation zone was formed on the left bank with the increase in the mainstream flow the mainstream velocity increases in one aspect the joint action of the mainstream and tributaries affects the velocity distribution in the confluence region the maximum zone gradually moves to the opposite bank of the tributaries the area of the separation zone shrinks in contrast to the gradual increase in the flow stagnation area at the confluence corner 3 5 distribution characteristics of do in confluences fig 13 shows the distribution of supersaturation dissolved gas under different mainstream flow conditions under the low inflow condition of the mainstream the saturation of mainstream inlet is 115 and the tributary saturation is in a normal saturation sate the region close to equilibrium saturation and the degree of saturation predominate at the yzr section laterally indicating that the inflow from tributary was the main flow in the sink area the supersaturation area exists on the right bank and the supersaturation on the right bank of the confluence is slightly decreased compared with the mainstream the supersaturation in water continued to decrease as the downstream distances from confluences increased in addition there was a tendency to spread to the opposite side the high supersaturation water does not continue to extend downstream but rather stays near the right bank region of the yzr monitoring section the downstream waters are all close to equilibrium saturation within a short distance as the inflow of the jinsha river increased the distribution of supersaturated do was much different compared to the low flow condition first as the mainstream spill discharge increased the supersaturation of the jinsha river increased up to 133 which was 18 higher than the low flow condition however the saturation of the tributary with minimal floating remained in the normal saturation state second the normal saturation area in the confluence gradually decreased the tributary saturation area horizontally was compressed towards the tributary side banks and the supersaturated water gradually widened occupying up to 3 4 of the channel width in the longitudinal direction the length of the natural saturation region on the left bank of the confluence gradually decreased a shortening of the downstream propagation distance was noted and the low saturation area on the left bank extended a limited distance at the highest flow condition approximately 2 km downstream after which the normal saturation area in the river disappeared the whole river water was in an oversaturated state and the distribution trend still gradually increased from the left bank to the right bank this distribution difference starts to weaken in the process of flowing downstream making the saturation on the left bank exhibit an increasing phenomenon and the saturation on the right bank exhibit a decreasing trend for the completely mixed section the average supersaturation was still high at 120 the mixed section distances from confluences under low flow middle flow and high flow conditions were 3 5 km 4 km and 4 5 km respectively 4 discussion 4 1 downstream supersaturation level the level of dissolved gas supersaturation of the yangtze river was influenced by the interaction of the jinsha river and minjiang river the army corps of engineers proposed a method using pollutant mixing theory to calculate the supersaturation in the confluence by flow weighted averaging u s army corps of engineers 2005 but this method has not been verified using measured data from the scene the saturation weights of the tributary and mainstream were defined by flow discharges and the following formula is used to calculate the weight averaged supersaturation in confluences 6 g f q t g t q m g m q t q m where g t and g m are the saturation of the tributary and mainstream respectively the measured saturation values and simulation results of the jsr 2 mjr yzr and yzr u sections were selected to analyse the variation in supersaturated dissolved gas levels at the confluences of the two streams and the calculation methods the yzr u section was the section where dissolved gas was completely mixed and reached a uniform distribution in the cross section on the yangtze river in accordance with the simulated results the farthest mixed section settles 4 8 km downstream of confluences the shortest fully mixed section was 3 km downstream of the confluence the averaged mixed distance was 4 5 km thus the section was determined to be a completely mixed section yzr u in the yangtze river the saturation flow weight averaged hydrograph cal line was obtained by calculating the flow rate and saturation value of jinsha river and minjiang river the measured values of the yzr cross section bar line were obtained using the arithmetic average of monitoring saturation of the left middle and right bank of yzr section based on simulation results the averaged values of dissolved gas in sections yzr and yzr u were obtained sim 1 and sim 2 and the final result is presented in fig 14 the figure shows that the weight averaged do saturation process with discharge data and stream saturation roughly agrees with the monitoring results of the yzr section with an average deviation of 1 6 the largest deviation that occurs on day 16 was 4 6 the sim 2 saturation is slightly lower than sim 1 due to the dissipation effect of dissolved gas comparing the two simulated lines with the measured data shows that the trends of the simulated and measured results were consistent and basically matched using the simulated value of the yzr section for statistical analysis the average error with the measured value was 1 4 and the maximum error was 5 4 in comparison given that the numerical simulation takes into account the diffusion mass transmission and dissipation of dissolved gas when calculating the simulated results are closer to the actual level thus the results in the figure also show that the simulated values are closer to the measured values than the calculated values of the weighted average of the jinsha and minjiang rivers the above analysis indicated that the results of flow weighted averaging using the inflow supersaturated dissolved gas levels of two or more rivers can be used when accuracy is not required and can roughly meet the requirements if fine scale results of supersaturated dissolved gas processes in confluence areas are needed it was recommended that numerical simulations be used to obtain the supersaturated dissolved gas distribution in the confluence as a method to more accurately analyse the effect of mainstream and tributary interactions on the dissolved gas distribution zeng mo and chen 2020 4 2 low saturation zone analysis using 115 as the safety saturation and statistical the safety zone acreage cao et al 2016 form the confluence to the completed mixed section yzr u which is the safety zone area ratio observed in fig 15 the zone acreages are not constant under unsteady conditions during study phase the size of the safe saturation area of the confluence area was directly influenced by the saturation of the incoming mainstream flow and the relationship between the saturation of the jinsha river boundary and the area share of the safe area is shown in fig 15 the data demonstrate that as the safe saturation area increases the input saturation of the jinsha river showed a decreasing trend and the most unfavourable situation is jinsha river inflow saturation achieved 133 and 125 the analysis reveals that the former situation was due to the mainstream saturation and was caused by the weakening of the tributary remit effect due to high mainstream flows and the weakening of tributary dilution effect for small flows in the latter case mahmodinia and javan 2020 the input low saturated water from the mainstream enhances the effect of tributary creation in the confluence area creating a larger region of safety in the confluence the condition of safe saturation in the confluence area as a whole was that the input saturation of the jinsha river was less than or equal to 115 second considering that safety zone acreage is related to the ratio of the inflow of the minjiang river to the flow of the jinsha river the relationship between the area of the safety zone and the flow ratio of the tributaries is shown in fig 16 in general the flow ratio has a fine linear relationship with the area ratio and the r2 value was 0 43 as the flow ratio increased the area ratio also increased however the proportion of tributaries was not the only control factor for example the flow ratio was 0 38 on day 11 and the area ratio was 78 7 in contrast on day 13 the same flow ratio was used but the area ratio of the safety zone was only 38 the analysis of the jinsha river revealed that the saturation degree was 117 on day 11 and 123 on day 13 and that of the minjiang river saturation booth was 105 under the same inflow conditions the low saturation created a safer saturation zone in the intermediate transition zone whereas the dilution effect was reduced at high saturation which made the intermediate transition zone still under dangerous saturation it was necessary to jointly consider the combined action of the jinsha river do level and flow ratio in the low saturation zone in confluences created by the import of tributaries the zone is mainly contoured by two elements mainstream supersaturation and the ratio of tributaries and mainstreams shen et al 2019 in the medium saturation region between the mainstream saturation and the tributary saturation in the mixing region of confluences the mainstream decides whether the medium region belongs to the safety zone tributary discharges decide the tributary saturation zone acreage and the dilution to the mainstream and a larger flow ratio tributary creates a larger safety zone 5 conclusions field measurements and mathematical models were used to simulate the supersaturation dissolved gas distribution and change process in natural river confluences under unsteady conditions combining the model and monitored data the following conclusions were obtained 1 the distribution of supersaturation dissolved gas in river confluences under unsteady inflow conditions is reported in the lateral distribution the region of the low saturation is main influenced by the tributaries and the saturation of the high saturation region follows the mainstream saturation process 2 flow conditions affect the size of the separation and stagnation the higher the flow of tributaries the larger the separation zone the greater the main flow the larger the area of the stagnation zone 3 mixing regions were severely turbulent but could not promote the dissipation of supersaturated dissolved gas for the 4 5 km downstream area of the junction the flow weighted average calculation method can be used to estimate the average saturation value of the section 4 in the confluences a safety saturation area was created by the inflow of low saturation water from tributaries and its area was affected by the degree of mainstream saturation and the flow ratio between tributaries and the mainstream the higher the mainstream saturation the smaller the safety saturation area the higher the tributary confluence ratio the higher the safety saturation area credit authorship contribution statement zhuo chen software data curation writing original draft visualization jingjie feng conceptualization

24389,species distribution models are valuable tools for conservation management however there remain challenges in developing and interpreting these models in the marine environment such as the nature of the species used for the modelling process when working with mobile species in dynamic environments lack of observation is usually interpreted as an observation of absence which can result in the introduction of biases by methodological false absences here we explore the role of absences when modelling marine megafauna distributions to better understand how the use of absences or equivalent affects the niche modelling algorithms we used a set of 20 virtual species with different relations to the habitat generalist static specialist static generalist dynamic and specialist dynamic with different encounter rates we tested six different modelling techniques divided into three distinct groups presence only presence background and presence absence we compared the outputs of the models using traditional validation metrics and overlap metrics in the geographical and environmental spaces algorithms characterized the ecological niche for the simulated species differently approaches using background data generally outperformed the other methods suggesting that the non observation of a species in a given location and time should not be considered as an absence a very intense practically unrealistic sampling schema would be required to obtain a genuine unbiased absence when working with these species and habitats for highly mobile species a precautionary approach would be to consider the non observation of a species as part of the background a sample of the conditions available in the study area rather than an absence a good starting point would be to use presence background models complemented with presence absence and or presence only models comparing outputs from the different algorithms tested in the geographic and environmental space improving model performance for highly mobile marine species should lead to better informed decision making for conservation keywords absences ecological niche modelling cetaceans marine megafauna mobile species species distribution models 1 introduction a good understanding of species distributions is crucial to supporting conservation management improving access to technology and species occurrences data has expanded the use of modelling procedures to provide distribution estimates using various techniques commonly termed ecological niche models enms or species distribution models sdms sillero 2011 sillero et al 2021 over the past 20 years more than 6000 studies have used these tools using a wide variety of methods and protocols this wide variation of applications has led to a set of best practices for guiding the building of the models and evaluating the models adequacy to feed biodiversity assessments araújo et al 2019 sillero et al 2021 one of the most discussed topics is the relative performance of different modelling algorithms in calculating distributional estimates previous studies tried to rate the algorithms available to select the best performing methods e g brotons et al 2004 elith et al 2006 there are three basic modelling approaches to estimate distributions available according to the nature of the characteristics of the occurrence data sillero et al 2021 1 using presence only data 2 using presence absence data when available or pseudo absences when not available and 3 using presence data and a sample of background data according to phillips et al 2009 background data is a sample from the study area as a whole used to characterize the environmental conditions across the study region including the sites where the species could also be sighted however a pseudo absence record intends to mimic absence data and it might include locations that the species does or could occupy contrary to the methodology s purpose in fact pseudo absences can be considered a biased sample of the background data franklin 2010 modelling algorithms using presences and true absences calculate the actual probability of the species presence and estimate the actual distributional area distinguishing between occupied and non occupied areas by the species something similar to the realized niche rn conversely background or presence only data methods provide information on how to classify sites by their similarity to known occupied regions sillero et al 2021 consequently background or pseudo absence data methods will predict an area between the actual occupied area and the abiotic niche jiménez valverde et al 2008 soberon nakamura 2009 somehow closer to the fundamental niche concept fn soberón and peterson 2005 define the rn as the set of locations where abiotic conditions are suitable for positive population growth and the required biotic conditions e g mutualists competitors predators will lead to positive fitness on the other side the fn represents the conditions where the conditions are suitable for the species in the case of cetaceans one might argue that due to their mobility and dispersion capacity all the suitable areas will be accessible however the optimal biotic conditions for the species will be only present in a small range of the suitable area therefore a good amount of occurrence points in the areas with suitable abiotic conditions would be needed to estimate the fn while the rn calculation would require much more information regarding the biotic interactions the best choice to produce accurate distribution estimates for current biodiversity assessments would appear to be presence absence algorithms however this statement is more complex than it looks it is necessary to consider the nature of the species data used in the modelling processes while the concept of presence is relatively straightforward a place where the organism has been directly observed absence is a more complex concept they can be classified into three types environmental contingent and methodological lobo et al 2010 the first two kinds of absences are related to natural processes shaping species distributions soberon nakamura 2009 and linked with the available environmental conditions environmental absences are more probable in those localities showing environmental conditions very different from the environmental universe defined by the presence localities e g a polar habitat for a tropical species in contrast contingent absences correspond to environmentally suitable areas not occupied due to biotic historical and dispersal reasons lobo et al 2010 however methodological absences created by biased surveys are a consequence of the very nature of the biodiversity distribution information which frequently is incomplete and biased it can be challenging to interpret the absence of observation as an observation of absence e g dennis et al 1999 graham et al 2004 soberon peterson 2004 hortal et al 2008 lobo et al 2007 peterson et al 2011 kramer schadt et al 2013 boira et al 2014 methodological absences constitute the most important source of uncertainty for analysing patterns and processes underlying the geographic distribution of biodiversity the so called wallacean shortfall whittaker et al 2005 therefore while environmental absences will be prevalent in areas less environmentally suitable for the species methodological absences can be found everywhere and are generally higher in suitable environmental locations close to the recorded presences lobo et al 2010 because survey effort is naturally biased towards areas of expected presence other problems can arise even in a stable terrestrial ecosystem with a very intense sampling program where confidence in absences is high maybe the species is not present because the area is outside the dispersal range or the species was not present at the time of sampling due to temporary occupancy migration or temporal inactivity diurnal species nocturnal species estivation hibernation or present nearby but not observed soberón peterson 2005 when looking at the marine environment these issues become even more complex marine environments are more dynamic than terrestrial ecosystems fernandez et al 2017 the environmental suitability can rapidly change in a specific location e g due to changing ocean currents which intrinsically implies that species might move to track favourable conditions marine physical processes such as eddies upwellings and surface currents are highly dynamic requiring a careful selection of the predictor variables and many times resulting in temporal or spatial lags between physical and biological processes redfern et al 2006 moreover some marine species such as cetaceans are highly mobile with daily ranges of 100 km leatherwood ljungblad 1979 perrin et al 1979 scott et al 1993 the environmental variability and high motility of species create difficulties for obtaining complete and unbiased datasets therefore methodological absences are often present in the dataset even if assuming a perfect detectability scenario improbable in most marine settings for example an area sampled at a specific time t 1 might be noted as an absence however the species could be present at that exact location at time t fig 1 while this set of environmental conditions would be noted as not favourable for the species they could be highly favourable but simply not visited when the species was present it is essential to highlight that modelling algorithms use surface sightings of marine species as presences however the species might be present at that location but simply below the surface in such cases the species is present but noted as absent occurrence datasets for cetacean habitat modelling studies may come from carefully designed standardised field studies including ship aerial and acoustic surveys redfern et al 2006 those surveys are generally based on transect distance sampling methods buckland et al 2001 to estimate quantitative abundance surveys are typically designed to ensure equal sampling probabilities throughout the study area moreover there are tools to correct the errors related to the perception bias survey conditions e g sea state visibility and availability bias proportion of time spent by the animals at the surface the use of detectability functions independent observers and dual platform methods two observers searching for and counting animals simultaneously ensuring they do not cue each other on the locations of the animals are generally used to minimize biases buckland et al 2001 these correction methods analyse the observer s probability of detecting the species if it was present at the sampling moment however generally they do not consider the habitat dynamism or the species motility this is not a problem for species with a low dynamism but it is for many oceanic species such as cetaceans using absences in modelling algorithms may not forecast the potential distribution of oceanic species but the sampling effort of the surveys therefore datasets collected following these procedures could present a high rate of methodological absences recently glennie et al 2020 built a theoretical framework to incorporate the mobility factor in the detectability indices however there are still many challenges the method proposed by the authors assumed that animals have a spatially invariant movement not taking into account other relevant factors such as behavioural changes or habitat preferences of the species as distance sampling methods are based on collecting real absence data cetacean distributional estimates are generally calculated using presence absence algorithms some algorithms are widely used such as generalized linear models glms or generalized additive models gams e g becker et al 2014 cañadas hammond 2008 de segura et al 2008 tepsich et al 2014 virgili et al 2017 however only recently fiedler et al 2018 compared the use of algorithms using background data maxent with the performance of gams to calculate distributional estimates of cetaceans in the tropical pacific ocean area finding non significant differences between both approaches in the present study we use 20 cetacean based virtual species with distinctive habitat preferences and encounter rates to study how the use of different kinds of absences or equivalent affects modelling algorithms performance we aim to understand better how the presence of methodological absences in standardized survey datasets might influence the accuracy of the predictions when using 1 presence absences 2 presence background and 3 presence only modelling approaches the study s goal is to describe potential method biases and provide recommendations on how to account for them 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the azores archipelago a group of north atlantic oceanic islands located approximately 1 800 km west of lisbon portugal the region is strongly influenced by the gulf stream and all its branches creating a complex and highly dynamic structure the system is affected by incoming meanders and filaments originating in the gulf stream and westward propagating eddies pinching off from the azores current caldeira reis 2017 other factors such as the archipelago s importance for retaining incoming particles might also play a role in local biological systems sala et al 2016 2 2 environmental variables a set of actual marine environmental variables was selected to represent the variability and dynamism of an oceanic system only three variables were chosen to facilitate the modelling processes based on their reported influence on previous cetacean distribution studies in the area e g fernandez et al 2018 these were divided into two thematic groups static little or no short term variation topographic variables and dynamic rapidly changing variables such as sea surface temperature two static variables were used depth derived from the digital elevation model of the emodnet bathymetry portal and slope calculated from the digital elevation model using qgis 3 2 all static variables were initially calculated at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 km daily dynamic variables were derived from nasa s multi scale ultra high resolution mur sea surface temperature sst dataset downloaded on 01 12 2018 from https mur jpl nasa gov which merges many infrared and passive microwave datasets gathered from satellites into daily global maps at 1 km resolution corresponding to the sampling period see survey design for further details for the present study we calculated 8 day estimates using the means of sst daily values finally all the layers were aggregated to 2 2 km resolutions using a bilinear interpolation we applied a variance inflation factor vif approach as implemented in the r package usdm naimi 2015 to test for collinearity no issues were found 2 3 survey design the virtual species environmental and effort data mirrored the time frame of a simulated cetacean detection survey for the azores archipelago surveys were performed around the islands and other vital areas covering 39 316 9 km2 per year we used the transects designed by faustino et al 2010 fig 2 to last four months 12 weeks per year with four days of sampling per week over four years 2013 2016 cruise speed was defined as 7 5 knots during 8 hours each sampled day to avoid any area s resampling survey transects were mapped onto the 2 km grid that matched the environmental data 2 4 virtual species 2 4 1 species definitions a total of 20 virtual species were created four different relationships with the environment variables were used 1 generalist species highly influenced by static variables 2 specialist species highly influenced by static variables 3 generalist species highly influenced by dynamic variables 4 specialist species highly influenced by dynamic variables the species were created using the virtualspecies r package leroy et al 2016 based on their assumed relationship with daily environmental variables for simplicity bell shaped functions gaussian functions and logistic functions were used to define the relations with the environmental parameters for full details of construction see appendix s1 response functions were combined using an additive approach with different weights for each variable table 1 based on results found for other species in the same area by fernandez et al 2018 habitat suitability for each of the four general kinds of species generalist static specialist static generalist dynamic and specialist dynamic was calculated every 8 days each day environmental suitability was converted into presence absence areas for all the sampled regions using a probabilistic approach suggested by meynard and kaplan 2013 to perform this conversion we calculated a logistic curve with β 0 6 representing the curve s inflexion point and α 0 05 which creates a logistic shape for the curve using this approach we forced the presences to be more likely in areas with suitability values around or higher than 0 6 and allowed some individuals to occur in areas with low suitability sometimes even at values lower than 0 3 this represents a realistic scenario where species can be observed moving through environmentally sub optimal areas to access other suitable locations for each species five different groups of sampling encounter rates were used per 100 km 1 4 1 0 6 0 4 and 0 2 based on real world data observations obtained by silva et al 2014 in the azores we assumed a perfect presence absence detection scenario to simplify the analysis all the groups present during the sampling were detected although this is unusual for marine species katsanevakis et al 2012 assuming a value of 1 for the detectability the encounter rate values could be linked with the species prevalence or how the species uses the suitable habitat even if the prevalence is a property of the data it usually covaries with species ecology and range size i e data for rare species usually show low prevalence scores while widely distributed species show the opposite jimenez valverde et al 2009 therefore species with higher encounter rates will occupy more suitable grid cells representing widely distributed species than those with lower encounter rates representing rare species 2 4 2 sample occurrences once presence absence areas were delimited we performed the last step of the virtual species generation process sampling species occurrences the occurrences points were calculated based on the presence absence areas previously delimited each case s encounter rates and the weighted environmental suitability values following fernandez et al 2017 we allowed the encounter rate to change through time related to the amount of suitable daily habitat per kilometre this creates a more realistic scenario where for dynamic species encounter rates will increase with appropriate conditions simulating dynamic populations where species are primarily present when conditions are good according to the niche modelling temporal resolution daily presence points were pooled together with the effort and the consequent environmental variables with 8 day means of sst for each grid cell a value of 1 was assigned for each sighting when more than one sighting was found in a segment only one presence point was used 2 5 modelling techniques to understand how different types of absences affect the modelling processes we performed the analysis using six different approaches divided into three distinct groups related to the occurrences data sources nature presence only presence background and presence absence moreover as characteristics of target species might also influence model performance qiao et al 2015 we used different algorithms to minimize this problem 2 5 1 presence absence algorithms pa in this case observed absences were treated as true absences we used two kinds of presence absence algorithms generalized linear models glms and generalized additive models gams both methods are based on the correlation of presences and genuine theoretical absences or pseudo absences with environmental variables therefore these models assume that environmental conditions were not suitable for survival if the species were not found we fitted binomial glms with quadratic terms using a logit link using r version 3 4 0 r core team 2017 two different approaches were used for the gams fitting process using the mgcv package wood 2011 1 using all presences and all theoretical absences pooled together and 2 running ten iterations with all presences and 1000 theoretical absences selected randomly on each run mimicking the absences zones approach used by derville et al 2016 we used a logit link for both approaches and allowed a maximum of three degrees of freedom for each spline to limit over fitting becker et al 2014 furthermore the model s effort was included as an offset term to account for variations in segment length 2 5 2 presence background algorithms pb for this scenario observed absences were treated as a sample of the conditions available in the region maxent uses presence points and background samples pooled together with environmental variables to calculate the potential habitat suitability phillips et al 2017 background points represent environmental conditions available for the species phillips et al 2009 background includes randomly selected pixels where the species have been observed and pixels where the species was not observed phillips et al 2009 maxent version 3 4 1 was implemented using the r package dismo hijmans et al 2017 we fitted two different maxent approaches 1 a classical approach with automatic features and 2 a more simplistic approach with only linear and quadratic features we decided to test the second approach due to the virtual species simplistic response curves designed for the present study we applied a regularization factor of 2 to avoid over fitting fiedler et al 2018 occurrences and background data were pooled into a table in the sample with data format to input maxent in a sightings with data swd format 2 5 3 presence only algorithms po presence only algorithms are solely based on the observed occurrences not considering the absences registered for the present study we used the bioclim busby 1986 booth et al 2014 and domain carpenter et al 1993 implementation on the r package dismo 2 6 validation techniques to assess the accuracy of the models produced we used a variety of validation techniques one index based on the area under the curve auc the response curves plots from the different modelling algorithms a plot of species presence in relation to a changing environmental variable and a group of indices based on the comparison of models predictions with the suitability of the virtual species in geographic and environmental space ideally discrimination measures such as auc should be obtained with the use of an independent dataset peterson et al 2011 or at least with the use of spatial or temporal bins to perform a binned cross validation radosavljevic anderson 2014 however this is still not common practice and there are many examples of cetacean studies using auc based on randomized testing fold selection e g fiedler et al 2018 virgili et al 2017 therefore to understand how these metrics explain the model accuracy we calculated the test auc with a random 5 fold approach approx 25 of dataset for testing these metrics were calculated using the r dismo package the other two validation techniques were based on the niche overlap between virtual and modelled virtual species both in geographic and environmental space these analyses quantify the accuracy of the model predictions in comparison with real virtual species niches firstly we calculated the schoener s d schoener 1968 in the geographical space g space using the r package enmtools warren et al 2017 schoener s d ranges from 0 dissimilarity to 1 similarity warren et al 2017 the comparison of the model s geographical projections measures the predictions accuracy using the observed environmental conditions this analysis was performed using the comparison of the models projection with the actual theoretical suitability for each species in all the study area including many places outside the surveyed regions but with similar environmental conditions a fuzzy similarity index was applied to the g space to find differences between projection outcomes these indices consider the fuzziness of the location going beyond site by site comparison and giving partial credit to neighbouring sites barbosa 2015 we used a fuzzy similarity index based on baroni urbani buser 1976 index which accounts for both shared presences and shared absences but gives greater weight to presences analysis was implemented using the fuzzysim r package barbosa 2015 working in the geographical dimension can be problematic because the measured niche overlap is likely to vary depending on the extent and distribution of environmental gradients in the study area and unquantified statistical artefacts related to model fitting broennimann et al 2012 to overcome the biases associated with the geographical dimension broennimann et al 2012 proposed to perform niche overlap tests directly in environmental space allowing the use of all potential combinations of variables in an n dimensional space this process was applied using the enmtools warren et al 2021 drawing latin hypercube samples from the space of all possible combinations of environmental variables given the minimum and maximum of each variable within the training region warren et al 2019 the schoener s d index and the spearman correlation rank were applied to test for differences between modelling scenarios 3 results a total of 14 000 models were constructed corresponding to the 20 virtual species 7 algorithms types and 100 iterations for each scenario we found differences in the results according to the species analysed the encounter rates and the validation metric used in contrast similar results between algorithms were obtained when using the auc test metric fig 3 nevertheless higher variability in the accuracy was observed in the results with lower encounter rates the same effect is noticeable when using other validation techniques especially for the lowest encounter rate scenarios 0 2 encounters per 100km moreover auc test values for specialists are higher than for generalist species particularly in static species the two tests performed on the geographical space highlighted differences between modelling techniques fig 4 schoener s d index presented lower overlap values for the specialist species than the generalists however this pattern is not present when using the fuzzy similarity test for the different algorithms the lowest overlap values were consistently obtained for bioclim while the use of domain resulted in high overlap values for both indexes fig 4 together with domain the maxent algorithm predictions resulted in higher overlap and similarity indexes than presence absence algorithms gam2 gam2 and glm nevertheless this trend is not so evident in the dynamic specialist species where overlap indexes for all models in g space are highly variable the projected maps for the 4 selected species fig 5 depict the poorer performance of the predictions made using the bioclim algorithm on the other hand the domain algorithm over predicts some areas the pa models glm gam1 and gam2 tend to under predict suitable areas while maxent produced the best results but still with some areas over predicted all the algorithms showed difficulties predicting the low suitability ranges gradient which is especially clear when looking at the lower suitability values blue gradient for static species fig 5a and 5b in the environmental space e space evaluation models constructed using maxent produced higher schoener s d overlap indexes fig 6 only the dynamic specialist species values seem similar among all algorithms tested nevertheless maxent models had much lower standard deviation values domain predictions were equal or worse than those of pa algorithms species with lower encounter rates produced the worst results resulting in higher standard deviation values the response curves fig s5 s24 reflect a similar pattern to those observed in the other validation analysis when considering the weighting of the variables for the different species the maxent approaches performed better in general with lower variability in the results and curves more similar to those expected nevertheless for the specialist species figs s10 s14 and figs s20 s24 the curves for the regression methods glm and gams also showed a good performance curves for domain and bioclim were in general overestimated and unable to detect the different weighting of the variables finally the linear approach for maxent maxent2 in the figures for the static specialists species produced better estimates in contrast the classic maxent approaches varied producing similar results to the pa algorithms when working with high encounter rates pb approaches and pa produced similar results for the dynamic specialists species when using high encounter rates however with low encounter rates the standard deviation values for the pb were lower than all the other approaches the use of different settings for gams gam1 and gam2 and maxent maxent1 and maxent2 proved to be effective in some cases with different results observed depending on the settings used as can be observed in all the results obtained fig 4 5 and 6 4 discussion overall depending on how observed absences were treated analyses showed apparent differences when using distinct algorithms to characterize the ecological niche for the simulated species the different validation techniques allowed us to obtain an accurate idea of the methods weaknesses and strengths for example the two metrics calculated in g space fig 4 a more classical approach schoener s d index and a more complex approach fuzzy similarity permitted us to understand the models projections differences better using e space for validation proved beneficial as it reinforced some subtle tendencies barely visible with the g space methods the overlap tests both in environmental and geographical space indicate that the modelling approaches treating observed absences as background data could equally or better determine the species niche than when considering the non observation as a real absence pa methods or when considering no absences at all po approach this might be related to specific ecological traits highly mobile species such as cetaceans or other pelagic marine megafauna might use the habitat versatilely oceans are in constant flux the physical forcing of the oceanographic seascape spans multiple spatial and temporal scales oceanographic features that both predators and preys follow like fronts and eddies move dynamically across similar scales steele 1991 therefore even the so called specialists large marine predators might have flexible and dynamic habitat use when looking for prey patches moreover animal migrations and foraging or breeding aggregations track dynamic oceanographic features across multiple scales block et al 2011 consequently the non observation of a species in a specific location and time might easily constitute a methodological absence as lobo et al 2010 suggested this can lead to obtaining absences in suitable environmental locations especially in areas close to recorded presences therefore a very intense sampling schema unrealistic would be required to obtain a genuine unbiased absence when working with these species ideally when trying to unveil or predict the occupied niche or the distribution of a species actual absence data and pa models might be the best theoretical option sillero 2011 as we discussed our results suggest that pa models should not be applied when true absences are not available pa models attempt to calculate accurate distribution estimates distinguishing between occupied and non occupied habitats producing in some cases unrealistic and over fitted predictions while other methods such as presence background methods are more flexible peterson et al 2011 it is precisely this flexibility that might be a better choice when working with highly motile species as when working in dynamic environments and mobile species the non observation of a species in a given location and time should not be considered as an absence but instead considered as a sample of the whole study area which agrees with the definition of a background sample phillips et al 2009 summing the g and e space results resulted in a better or at least equal performance of pb approaches over all the other methods tested interestingly fiedler et al 2018 found that maxent can produce models similar to gam presence absence models when background data points are selected from observed absences it is important to notice that the cited study only used auc metrics and a point biserial correlation to compare the outputs instead we decided to use a broader set of metrics in the g and e space to compare the model predictions which allowed us to find some differences between modelling approaches that might be missed when using more simplistic comparison methods interpretations based solely on geographic space hold relatively limited information and should be taken with caution models should instead be analysed in environmental and geographic spaces escobar et al 2018 comparing predictions in environmental space fig 6 allowed us to overcome some of the limitations derived from the structure and composition of environmental variables in the specific region of study highlighting differences between modelling approaches that would otherwise remain invisible warren et al 2019 summing the g and e space results resulted in a better or at least equal performance of pb approaches over all the other methods tested an interesting pattern observable in e space is that for generalist species treating the observed absences as background data seemed to perform consistently better with higher overlap values and lower standard deviations agreeing with evangelista et al 2008 findings however different patterns emerge for specialist species with different results depending on the species encounter rate and modelling algorithm used some of the differences observed between modelling techniques might be related to the niche breadth of the target species broad realised niches generalist species groups 1 and 3 are more challenging to model than narrow niches specialist species groups 2 and 4 with marked differences in performance when using different algorithms qiao et al 2015 connor et al 2018 the present study found that the differences between algorithms are less visible for specialist species especially for static ones species group 2 when the available suitable area is more restricted and stable through time the sampling effort needed to obtain genuine environmental or contingent absences is lower for example suppose a cetacean species occurs only in coastal areas and we sample coastal and non coastal areas in that case the chance of obtaining true absences is higher than if the species occur over a broader range of conditions therefore using observed absences as real absences and applying presence absence models might be a good choice in this scenario nevertheless our results showed that even if pa models performed well pb methods and even po in some cases performed equally well furthermore our results agree with other findings on the importance of model settings and calibration warren et al 2014 we obtained different results when using the same type of algorithm but with different settings or parameter combinations parameter choice can produce dramatic influences on model output we found that using the gam2 approach using the sampling approach from absences zones produced better results than a classical gam approach the same was observed with the two settings used for maxent models hence besides testing different algorithms it is also critical to build models with different settings using tools to perform detailed development of ecological niche models such as kuenm cobos et al 2019 or enmeval kass et al 2021 5 conclusion as a result of the experiences and analysis performed here we cannot recommend one unique way of considering observed absences for niche modelling when working with highly mobile species our results suggest that in highly mobile species an excellent precautionary approach would be to consider the non observation of a species as a background point a sample of the conditions available in the sampled area rather than an absence however as qiao et al 2015 pointed out there are no silver bullets and therefore there is no fixed recipe that will work for all the cases in some cases such as working with static species with high prevalence the absences encountered during the sampling process might be a good approximation to real absences therefore pa methods would be an optimal choice however sufficient ecological knowledge of the species may be unavailable in many cases especially when working with marine megafauna in such cases using a pb method might be a good starting point which ideally should be complemented with pa and po models afterwards evaluation tests should be performed comparing the outputs from the different algorithms tested in g and e space as suggested by previous studies escobar et al 2018 warren et al 2019 ideally we would like to obtain the probability of finding a species on a specific site when modelling distributions for management purposes in the present study we focused on transect survey data however other methods such as tracking could help obtain better insights into the species movements and habitat preferences scales et al 2017 used movement simulations of blue whales to better investigate the potential of tracking data for predictive habitat modelling fine scale movement data might provide an excellent opportunity to obtain distributional models at finer temporal resolutions and therefore improve management applications such as collision risk assessments blondin et al 2020 moreover pa models estimates are based on occurrence and absence data collected on a fixed time frame and therefore they predict the probability of occurrence areas with high suitability values do not guarantee that the species will always be present with highly motile species occupancy rates might vary even more they have broader home ranges and these movements can be related to many factors such as competition food availability or behaviour specificities however including these covariates is highly complex and requires continuous recording systems and further study long term moored acoustic systems might help answer some of these questions improving distributional and occupancy estimates e g fraiser et al 2021

24389,species distribution models are valuable tools for conservation management however there remain challenges in developing and interpreting these models in the marine environment such as the nature of the species used for the modelling process when working with mobile species in dynamic environments lack of observation is usually interpreted as an observation of absence which can result in the introduction of biases by methodological false absences here we explore the role of absences when modelling marine megafauna distributions to better understand how the use of absences or equivalent affects the niche modelling algorithms we used a set of 20 virtual species with different relations to the habitat generalist static specialist static generalist dynamic and specialist dynamic with different encounter rates we tested six different modelling techniques divided into three distinct groups presence only presence background and presence absence we compared the outputs of the models using traditional validation metrics and overlap metrics in the geographical and environmental spaces algorithms characterized the ecological niche for the simulated species differently approaches using background data generally outperformed the other methods suggesting that the non observation of a species in a given location and time should not be considered as an absence a very intense practically unrealistic sampling schema would be required to obtain a genuine unbiased absence when working with these species and habitats for highly mobile species a precautionary approach would be to consider the non observation of a species as part of the background a sample of the conditions available in the study area rather than an absence a good starting point would be to use presence background models complemented with presence absence and or presence only models comparing outputs from the different algorithms tested in the geographic and environmental space improving model performance for highly mobile marine species should lead to better informed decision making for conservation keywords absences ecological niche modelling cetaceans marine megafauna mobile species species distribution models 1 introduction a good understanding of species distributions is crucial to supporting conservation management improving access to technology and species occurrences data has expanded the use of modelling procedures to provide distribution estimates using various techniques commonly termed ecological niche models enms or species distribution models sdms sillero 2011 sillero et al 2021 over the past 20 years more than 6000 studies have used these tools using a wide variety of methods and protocols this wide variation of applications has led to a set of best practices for guiding the building of the models and evaluating the models adequacy to feed biodiversity assessments araújo et al 2019 sillero et al 2021 one of the most discussed topics is the relative performance of different modelling algorithms in calculating distributional estimates previous studies tried to rate the algorithms available to select the best performing methods e g brotons et al 2004 elith et al 2006 there are three basic modelling approaches to estimate distributions available according to the nature of the characteristics of the occurrence data sillero et al 2021 1 using presence only data 2 using presence absence data when available or pseudo absences when not available and 3 using presence data and a sample of background data according to phillips et al 2009 background data is a sample from the study area as a whole used to characterize the environmental conditions across the study region including the sites where the species could also be sighted however a pseudo absence record intends to mimic absence data and it might include locations that the species does or could occupy contrary to the methodology s purpose in fact pseudo absences can be considered a biased sample of the background data franklin 2010 modelling algorithms using presences and true absences calculate the actual probability of the species presence and estimate the actual distributional area distinguishing between occupied and non occupied areas by the species something similar to the realized niche rn conversely background or presence only data methods provide information on how to classify sites by their similarity to known occupied regions sillero et al 2021 consequently background or pseudo absence data methods will predict an area between the actual occupied area and the abiotic niche jiménez valverde et al 2008 soberon nakamura 2009 somehow closer to the fundamental niche concept fn soberón and peterson 2005 define the rn as the set of locations where abiotic conditions are suitable for positive population growth and the required biotic conditions e g mutualists competitors predators will lead to positive fitness on the other side the fn represents the conditions where the conditions are suitable for the species in the case of cetaceans one might argue that due to their mobility and dispersion capacity all the suitable areas will be accessible however the optimal biotic conditions for the species will be only present in a small range of the suitable area therefore a good amount of occurrence points in the areas with suitable abiotic conditions would be needed to estimate the fn while the rn calculation would require much more information regarding the biotic interactions the best choice to produce accurate distribution estimates for current biodiversity assessments would appear to be presence absence algorithms however this statement is more complex than it looks it is necessary to consider the nature of the species data used in the modelling processes while the concept of presence is relatively straightforward a place where the organism has been directly observed absence is a more complex concept they can be classified into three types environmental contingent and methodological lobo et al 2010 the first two kinds of absences are related to natural processes shaping species distributions soberon nakamura 2009 and linked with the available environmental conditions environmental absences are more probable in those localities showing environmental conditions very different from the environmental universe defined by the presence localities e g a polar habitat for a tropical species in contrast contingent absences correspond to environmentally suitable areas not occupied due to biotic historical and dispersal reasons lobo et al 2010 however methodological absences created by biased surveys are a consequence of the very nature of the biodiversity distribution information which frequently is incomplete and biased it can be challenging to interpret the absence of observation as an observation of absence e g dennis et al 1999 graham et al 2004 soberon peterson 2004 hortal et al 2008 lobo et al 2007 peterson et al 2011 kramer schadt et al 2013 boira et al 2014 methodological absences constitute the most important source of uncertainty for analysing patterns and processes underlying the geographic distribution of biodiversity the so called wallacean shortfall whittaker et al 2005 therefore while environmental absences will be prevalent in areas less environmentally suitable for the species methodological absences can be found everywhere and are generally higher in suitable environmental locations close to the recorded presences lobo et al 2010 because survey effort is naturally biased towards areas of expected presence other problems can arise even in a stable terrestrial ecosystem with a very intense sampling program where confidence in absences is high maybe the species is not present because the area is outside the dispersal range or the species was not present at the time of sampling due to temporary occupancy migration or temporal inactivity diurnal species nocturnal species estivation hibernation or present nearby but not observed soberón peterson 2005 when looking at the marine environment these issues become even more complex marine environments are more dynamic than terrestrial ecosystems fernandez et al 2017 the environmental suitability can rapidly change in a specific location e g due to changing ocean currents which intrinsically implies that species might move to track favourable conditions marine physical processes such as eddies upwellings and surface currents are highly dynamic requiring a careful selection of the predictor variables and many times resulting in temporal or spatial lags between physical and biological processes redfern et al 2006 moreover some marine species such as cetaceans are highly mobile with daily ranges of 100 km leatherwood ljungblad 1979 perrin et al 1979 scott et al 1993 the environmental variability and high motility of species create difficulties for obtaining complete and unbiased datasets therefore methodological absences are often present in the dataset even if assuming a perfect detectability scenario improbable in most marine settings for example an area sampled at a specific time t 1 might be noted as an absence however the species could be present at that exact location at time t fig 1 while this set of environmental conditions would be noted as not favourable for the species they could be highly favourable but simply not visited when the species was present it is essential to highlight that modelling algorithms use surface sightings of marine species as presences however the species might be present at that location but simply below the surface in such cases the species is present but noted as absent occurrence datasets for cetacean habitat modelling studies may come from carefully designed standardised field studies including ship aerial and acoustic surveys redfern et al 2006 those surveys are generally based on transect distance sampling methods buckland et al 2001 to estimate quantitative abundance surveys are typically designed to ensure equal sampling probabilities throughout the study area moreover there are tools to correct the errors related to the perception bias survey conditions e g sea state visibility and availability bias proportion of time spent by the animals at the surface the use of detectability functions independent observers and dual platform methods two observers searching for and counting animals simultaneously ensuring they do not cue each other on the locations of the animals are generally used to minimize biases buckland et al 2001 these correction methods analyse the observer s probability of detecting the species if it was present at the sampling moment however generally they do not consider the habitat dynamism or the species motility this is not a problem for species with a low dynamism but it is for many oceanic species such as cetaceans using absences in modelling algorithms may not forecast the potential distribution of oceanic species but the sampling effort of the surveys therefore datasets collected following these procedures could present a high rate of methodological absences recently glennie et al 2020 built a theoretical framework to incorporate the mobility factor in the detectability indices however there are still many challenges the method proposed by the authors assumed that animals have a spatially invariant movement not taking into account other relevant factors such as behavioural changes or habitat preferences of the species as distance sampling methods are based on collecting real absence data cetacean distributional estimates are generally calculated using presence absence algorithms some algorithms are widely used such as generalized linear models glms or generalized additive models gams e g becker et al 2014 cañadas hammond 2008 de segura et al 2008 tepsich et al 2014 virgili et al 2017 however only recently fiedler et al 2018 compared the use of algorithms using background data maxent with the performance of gams to calculate distributional estimates of cetaceans in the tropical pacific ocean area finding non significant differences between both approaches in the present study we use 20 cetacean based virtual species with distinctive habitat preferences and encounter rates to study how the use of different kinds of absences or equivalent affects modelling algorithms performance we aim to understand better how the presence of methodological absences in standardized survey datasets might influence the accuracy of the predictions when using 1 presence absences 2 presence background and 3 presence only modelling approaches the study s goal is to describe potential method biases and provide recommendations on how to account for them 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the azores archipelago a group of north atlantic oceanic islands located approximately 1 800 km west of lisbon portugal the region is strongly influenced by the gulf stream and all its branches creating a complex and highly dynamic structure the system is affected by incoming meanders and filaments originating in the gulf stream and westward propagating eddies pinching off from the azores current caldeira reis 2017 other factors such as the archipelago s importance for retaining incoming particles might also play a role in local biological systems sala et al 2016 2 2 environmental variables a set of actual marine environmental variables was selected to represent the variability and dynamism of an oceanic system only three variables were chosen to facilitate the modelling processes based on their reported influence on previous cetacean distribution studies in the area e g fernandez et al 2018 these were divided into two thematic groups static little or no short term variation topographic variables and dynamic rapidly changing variables such as sea surface temperature two static variables were used depth derived from the digital elevation model of the emodnet bathymetry portal and slope calculated from the digital elevation model using qgis 3 2 all static variables were initially calculated at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 km daily dynamic variables were derived from nasa s multi scale ultra high resolution mur sea surface temperature sst dataset downloaded on 01 12 2018 from https mur jpl nasa gov which merges many infrared and passive microwave datasets gathered from satellites into daily global maps at 1 km resolution corresponding to the sampling period see survey design for further details for the present study we calculated 8 day estimates using the means of sst daily values finally all the layers were aggregated to 2 2 km resolutions using a bilinear interpolation we applied a variance inflation factor vif approach as implemented in the r package usdm naimi 2015 to test for collinearity no issues were found 2 3 survey design the virtual species environmental and effort data mirrored the time frame of a simulated cetacean detection survey for the azores archipelago surveys were performed around the islands and other vital areas covering 39 316 9 km2 per year we used the transects designed by faustino et al 2010 fig 2 to last four months 12 weeks per year with four days of sampling per week over four years 2013 2016 cruise speed was defined as 7 5 knots during 8 hours each sampled day to avoid any area s resampling survey transects were mapped onto the 2 km grid that matched the environmental data 2 4 virtual species 2 4 1 species definitions a total of 20 virtual species were created four different relationships with the environment variables were used 1 generalist species highly influenced by static variables 2 specialist species highly influenced by static variables 3 generalist species highly influenced by dynamic variables 4 specialist species highly influenced by dynamic variables the species were created using the virtualspecies r package leroy et al 2016 based on their assumed relationship with daily environmental variables for simplicity bell shaped functions gaussian functions and logistic functions were used to define the relations with the environmental parameters for full details of construction see appendix s1 response functions were combined using an additive approach with different weights for each variable table 1 based on results found for other species in the same area by fernandez et al 2018 habitat suitability for each of the four general kinds of species generalist static specialist static generalist dynamic and specialist dynamic was calculated every 8 days each day environmental suitability was converted into presence absence areas for all the sampled regions using a probabilistic approach suggested by meynard and kaplan 2013 to perform this conversion we calculated a logistic curve with β 0 6 representing the curve s inflexion point and α 0 05 which creates a logistic shape for the curve using this approach we forced the presences to be more likely in areas with suitability values around or higher than 0 6 and allowed some individuals to occur in areas with low suitability sometimes even at values lower than 0 3 this represents a realistic scenario where species can be observed moving through environmentally sub optimal areas to access other suitable locations for each species five different groups of sampling encounter rates were used per 100 km 1 4 1 0 6 0 4 and 0 2 based on real world data observations obtained by silva et al 2014 in the azores we assumed a perfect presence absence detection scenario to simplify the analysis all the groups present during the sampling were detected although this is unusual for marine species katsanevakis et al 2012 assuming a value of 1 for the detectability the encounter rate values could be linked with the species prevalence or how the species uses the suitable habitat even if the prevalence is a property of the data it usually covaries with species ecology and range size i e data for rare species usually show low prevalence scores while widely distributed species show the opposite jimenez valverde et al 2009 therefore species with higher encounter rates will occupy more suitable grid cells representing widely distributed species than those with lower encounter rates representing rare species 2 4 2 sample occurrences once presence absence areas were delimited we performed the last step of the virtual species generation process sampling species occurrences the occurrences points were calculated based on the presence absence areas previously delimited each case s encounter rates and the weighted environmental suitability values following fernandez et al 2017 we allowed the encounter rate to change through time related to the amount of suitable daily habitat per kilometre this creates a more realistic scenario where for dynamic species encounter rates will increase with appropriate conditions simulating dynamic populations where species are primarily present when conditions are good according to the niche modelling temporal resolution daily presence points were pooled together with the effort and the consequent environmental variables with 8 day means of sst for each grid cell a value of 1 was assigned for each sighting when more than one sighting was found in a segment only one presence point was used 2 5 modelling techniques to understand how different types of absences affect the modelling processes we performed the analysis using six different approaches divided into three distinct groups related to the occurrences data sources nature presence only presence background and presence absence moreover as characteristics of target species might also influence model performance qiao et al 2015 we used different algorithms to minimize this problem 2 5 1 presence absence algorithms pa in this case observed absences were treated as true absences we used two kinds of presence absence algorithms generalized linear models glms and generalized additive models gams both methods are based on the correlation of presences and genuine theoretical absences or pseudo absences with environmental variables therefore these models assume that environmental conditions were not suitable for survival if the species were not found we fitted binomial glms with quadratic terms using a logit link using r version 3 4 0 r core team 2017 two different approaches were used for the gams fitting process using the mgcv package wood 2011 1 using all presences and all theoretical absences pooled together and 2 running ten iterations with all presences and 1000 theoretical absences selected randomly on each run mimicking the absences zones approach used by derville et al 2016 we used a logit link for both approaches and allowed a maximum of three degrees of freedom for each spline to limit over fitting becker et al 2014 furthermore the model s effort was included as an offset term to account for variations in segment length 2 5 2 presence background algorithms pb for this scenario observed absences were treated as a sample of the conditions available in the region maxent uses presence points and background samples pooled together with environmental variables to calculate the potential habitat suitability phillips et al 2017 background points represent environmental conditions available for the species phillips et al 2009 background includes randomly selected pixels where the species have been observed and pixels where the species was not observed phillips et al 2009 maxent version 3 4 1 was implemented using the r package dismo hijmans et al 2017 we fitted two different maxent approaches 1 a classical approach with automatic features and 2 a more simplistic approach with only linear and quadratic features we decided to test the second approach due to the virtual species simplistic response curves designed for the present study we applied a regularization factor of 2 to avoid over fitting fiedler et al 2018 occurrences and background data were pooled into a table in the sample with data format to input maxent in a sightings with data swd format 2 5 3 presence only algorithms po presence only algorithms are solely based on the observed occurrences not considering the absences registered for the present study we used the bioclim busby 1986 booth et al 2014 and domain carpenter et al 1993 implementation on the r package dismo 2 6 validation techniques to assess the accuracy of the models produced we used a variety of validation techniques one index based on the area under the curve auc the response curves plots from the different modelling algorithms a plot of species presence in relation to a changing environmental variable and a group of indices based on the comparison of models predictions with the suitability of the virtual species in geographic and environmental space ideally discrimination measures such as auc should be obtained with the use of an independent dataset peterson et al 2011 or at least with the use of spatial or temporal bins to perform a binned cross validation radosavljevic anderson 2014 however this is still not common practice and there are many examples of cetacean studies using auc based on randomized testing fold selection e g fiedler et al 2018 virgili et al 2017 therefore to understand how these metrics explain the model accuracy we calculated the test auc with a random 5 fold approach approx 25 of dataset for testing these metrics were calculated using the r dismo package the other two validation techniques were based on the niche overlap between virtual and modelled virtual species both in geographic and environmental space these analyses quantify the accuracy of the model predictions in comparison with real virtual species niches firstly we calculated the schoener s d schoener 1968 in the geographical space g space using the r package enmtools warren et al 2017 schoener s d ranges from 0 dissimilarity to 1 similarity warren et al 2017 the comparison of the model s geographical projections measures the predictions accuracy using the observed environmental conditions this analysis was performed using the comparison of the models projection with the actual theoretical suitability for each species in all the study area including many places outside the surveyed regions but with similar environmental conditions a fuzzy similarity index was applied to the g space to find differences between projection outcomes these indices consider the fuzziness of the location going beyond site by site comparison and giving partial credit to neighbouring sites barbosa 2015 we used a fuzzy similarity index based on baroni urbani buser 1976 index which accounts for both shared presences and shared absences but gives greater weight to presences analysis was implemented using the fuzzysim r package barbosa 2015 working in the geographical dimension can be problematic because the measured niche overlap is likely to vary depending on the extent and distribution of environmental gradients in the study area and unquantified statistical artefacts related to model fitting broennimann et al 2012 to overcome the biases associated with the geographical dimension broennimann et al 2012 proposed to perform niche overlap tests directly in environmental space allowing the use of all potential combinations of variables in an n dimensional space this process was applied using the enmtools warren et al 2021 drawing latin hypercube samples from the space of all possible combinations of environmental variables given the minimum and maximum of each variable within the training region warren et al 2019 the schoener s d index and the spearman correlation rank were applied to test for differences between modelling scenarios 3 results a total of 14 000 models were constructed corresponding to the 20 virtual species 7 algorithms types and 100 iterations for each scenario we found differences in the results according to the species analysed the encounter rates and the validation metric used in contrast similar results between algorithms were obtained when using the auc test metric fig 3 nevertheless higher variability in the accuracy was observed in the results with lower encounter rates the same effect is noticeable when using other validation techniques especially for the lowest encounter rate scenarios 0 2 encounters per 100km moreover auc test values for specialists are higher than for generalist species particularly in static species the two tests performed on the geographical space highlighted differences between modelling techniques fig 4 schoener s d index presented lower overlap values for the specialist species than the generalists however this pattern is not present when using the fuzzy similarity test for the different algorithms the lowest overlap values were consistently obtained for bioclim while the use of domain resulted in high overlap values for both indexes fig 4 together with domain the maxent algorithm predictions resulted in higher overlap and similarity indexes than presence absence algorithms gam2 gam2 and glm nevertheless this trend is not so evident in the dynamic specialist species where overlap indexes for all models in g space are highly variable the projected maps for the 4 selected species fig 5 depict the poorer performance of the predictions made using the bioclim algorithm on the other hand the domain algorithm over predicts some areas the pa models glm gam1 and gam2 tend to under predict suitable areas while maxent produced the best results but still with some areas over predicted all the algorithms showed difficulties predicting the low suitability ranges gradient which is especially clear when looking at the lower suitability values blue gradient for static species fig 5a and 5b in the environmental space e space evaluation models constructed using maxent produced higher schoener s d overlap indexes fig 6 only the dynamic specialist species values seem similar among all algorithms tested nevertheless maxent models had much lower standard deviation values domain predictions were equal or worse than those of pa algorithms species with lower encounter rates produced the worst results resulting in higher standard deviation values the response curves fig s5 s24 reflect a similar pattern to those observed in the other validation analysis when considering the weighting of the variables for the different species the maxent approaches performed better in general with lower variability in the results and curves more similar to those expected nevertheless for the specialist species figs s10 s14 and figs s20 s24 the curves for the regression methods glm and gams also showed a good performance curves for domain and bioclim were in general overestimated and unable to detect the different weighting of the variables finally the linear approach for maxent maxent2 in the figures for the static specialists species produced better estimates in contrast the classic maxent approaches varied producing similar results to the pa algorithms when working with high encounter rates pb approaches and pa produced similar results for the dynamic specialists species when using high encounter rates however with low encounter rates the standard deviation values for the pb were lower than all the other approaches the use of different settings for gams gam1 and gam2 and maxent maxent1 and maxent2 proved to be effective in some cases with different results observed depending on the settings used as can be observed in all the results obtained fig 4 5 and 6 4 discussion overall depending on how observed absences were treated analyses showed apparent differences when using distinct algorithms to characterize the ecological niche for the simulated species the different validation techniques allowed us to obtain an accurate idea of the methods weaknesses and strengths for example the two metrics calculated in g space fig 4 a more classical approach schoener s d index and a more complex approach fuzzy similarity permitted us to understand the models projections differences better using e space for validation proved beneficial as it reinforced some subtle tendencies barely visible with the g space methods the overlap tests both in environmental and geographical space indicate that the modelling approaches treating observed absences as background data could equally or better determine the species niche than when considering the non observation as a real absence pa methods or when considering no absences at all po approach this might be related to specific ecological traits highly mobile species such as cetaceans or other pelagic marine megafauna might use the habitat versatilely oceans are in constant flux the physical forcing of the oceanographic seascape spans multiple spatial and temporal scales oceanographic features that both predators and preys follow like fronts and eddies move dynamically across similar scales steele 1991 therefore even the so called specialists large marine predators might have flexible and dynamic habitat use when looking for prey patches moreover animal migrations and foraging or breeding aggregations track dynamic oceanographic features across multiple scales block et al 2011 consequently the non observation of a species in a specific location and time might easily constitute a methodological absence as lobo et al 2010 suggested this can lead to obtaining absences in suitable environmental locations especially in areas close to recorded presences therefore a very intense sampling schema unrealistic would be required to obtain a genuine unbiased absence when working with these species ideally when trying to unveil or predict the occupied niche or the distribution of a species actual absence data and pa models might be the best theoretical option sillero 2011 as we discussed our results suggest that pa models should not be applied when true absences are not available pa models attempt to calculate accurate distribution estimates distinguishing between occupied and non occupied habitats producing in some cases unrealistic and over fitted predictions while other methods such as presence background methods are more flexible peterson et al 2011 it is precisely this flexibility that might be a better choice when working with highly motile species as when working in dynamic environments and mobile species the non observation of a species in a given location and time should not be considered as an absence but instead considered as a sample of the whole study area which agrees with the definition of a background sample phillips et al 2009 summing the g and e space results resulted in a better or at least equal performance of pb approaches over all the other methods tested interestingly fiedler et al 2018 found that maxent can produce models similar to gam presence absence models when background data points are selected from observed absences it is important to notice that the cited study only used auc metrics and a point biserial correlation to compare the outputs instead we decided to use a broader set of metrics in the g and e space to compare the model predictions which allowed us to find some differences between modelling approaches that might be missed when using more simplistic comparison methods interpretations based solely on geographic space hold relatively limited information and should be taken with caution models should instead be analysed in environmental and geographic spaces escobar et al 2018 comparing predictions in environmental space fig 6 allowed us to overcome some of the limitations derived from the structure and composition of environmental variables in the specific region of study highlighting differences between modelling approaches that would otherwise remain invisible warren et al 2019 summing the g and e space results resulted in a better or at least equal performance of pb approaches over all the other methods tested an interesting pattern observable in e space is that for generalist species treating the observed absences as background data seemed to perform consistently better with higher overlap values and lower standard deviations agreeing with evangelista et al 2008 findings however different patterns emerge for specialist species with different results depending on the species encounter rate and modelling algorithm used some of the differences observed between modelling techniques might be related to the niche breadth of the target species broad realised niches generalist species groups 1 and 3 are more challenging to model than narrow niches specialist species groups 2 and 4 with marked differences in performance when using different algorithms qiao et al 2015 connor et al 2018 the present study found that the differences between algorithms are less visible for specialist species especially for static ones species group 2 when the available suitable area is more restricted and stable through time the sampling effort needed to obtain genuine environmental or contingent absences is lower for example suppose a cetacean species occurs only in coastal areas and we sample coastal and non coastal areas in that case the chance of obtaining true absences is higher than if the species occur over a broader range of conditions therefore using observed absences as real absences and applying presence absence models might be a good choice in this scenario nevertheless our results showed that even if pa models performed well pb methods and even po in some cases performed equally well furthermore our results agree with other findings on the importance of model settings and calibration warren et al 2014 we obtained different results when using the same type of algorithm but with different settings or parameter combinations parameter choice can produce dramatic influences on model output we found that using the gam2 approach using the sampling approach from absences zones produced better results than a classical gam approach the same was observed with the two settings used for maxent models hence besides testing different algorithms it is also critical to build models with different settings using tools to perform detailed development of ecological niche models such as kuenm cobos et al 2019 or enmeval kass et al 2021 5 conclusion as a result of the experiences and analysis performed here we cannot recommend one unique way of considering observed absences for niche modelling when working with highly mobile species our results suggest that in highly mobile species an excellent precautionary approach would be to consider the non observation of a species as a background point a sample of the conditions available in the sampled area rather than an absence however as qiao et al 2015 pointed out there are no silver bullets and therefore there is no fixed recipe that will work for all the cases in some cases such as working with static species with high prevalence the absences encountered during the sampling process might be a good approximation to real absences therefore pa methods would be an optimal choice however sufficient ecological knowledge of the species may be unavailable in many cases especially when working with marine megafauna in such cases using a pb method might be a good starting point which ideally should be complemented with pa and po models afterwards evaluation tests should be performed comparing the outputs from the different algorithms tested in g and e space as suggested by previous studies escobar et al 2018 warren et al 2019 ideally we would like to obtain the probability of finding a species on a specific site when modelling distributions for management purposes in the present study we focused on transect survey data however other methods such as tracking could help obtain better insights into the species movements and habitat preferences scales et al 2017 used movement simulations of blue whales to better investigate the potential of tracking data for predictive habitat modelling fine scale movement data might provide an excellent opportunity to obtain distributional models at finer temporal resolutions and therefore improve management applications such as collision risk assessments blondin et al 2020 moreover pa models estimates are based on occurrence and absence data collected on a fixed time frame and therefore they predict the probability of occurrence areas with high suitability values do not guarantee that the species will always be present with highly motile species occupancy rates might vary even more they have broader home ranges and these movements can be related to many factors such as competition food availability or behaviour specificities however including these covariates is highly complex and requires continuous recording systems and further study long term moored acoustic systems might help answer some of these questions improving distributional and occupancy estimates e g fraiser et al 2021
