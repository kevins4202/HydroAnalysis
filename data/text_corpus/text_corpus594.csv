2970,the ecological and human health issues caused by inter basin water transfer have drawn wide attention to illustrate the spatial and temporal distribution of heavy metals hms in the middle and lower han river mlhr a 1d hydro environmental model was developed calibrated and validated based on the observed data three simulation scenarios were conducted to analyze the human health risks resulting from heavy metal pollution the results show that the water flow reduction after water transfer enhanced the heavy metal pollution in the mlhr the total health risk of hms in surface water of the mlhr basin was 4 69 10 5 a 1 for adults and 7 82 10 5 a 1 for children without the water transfer while it increased to 4 77 10 5 a 1 and 7 95 10 5 a 1 when the south to north water transfer project snwtp was put into operation the yangtze to han river water transfer project yhwtp can partially offset the adverse snwtp influences however the human health risk is still higher than those without snwtp operation the health risks in the mlhr basin are main from carcinogens as which should be prioritized as the main targets for water environment risk management in the han river basin keywords han river basin water transfer projects heavy metals health risk assessment hydro environmental model flow reduction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction heavy metal pollution in river water has become a high profile environmental pollution issue with the rapid agricultural and industrial development worldwide islam et al 2015 yousaf et al 2018 many rivers are suffering different degrees of heavy metal pollution e g serious cu co and pb pollution in the tigris river varol 2011 extensive deposition of pb zn and cd in the floodplains of the rhine river middelkoop 2000 a moderate degree of cd pollution of the surface sediments in the volga river ahmadov et al 2020 and the severe ni and cu pollution in the yangtze river delta hu et al 2019 heavy metals hms are characterized by high stability non degradability and continuous accumulation which can cause irreversible damage to the surrounding environment bolisetty et al 2019 castanheiro et al 2016 maghsoudi et al 2021 hms enter the human body through food chains and if they exceed the maximum limit required for human health they will pose a severe threat to the human liver kidneys digestive system and nervous system pandey and madhuri 2014 sankhla et al 2016 thus it has received extensive attention from environmental health researchers worldwide agathokleous and calabrese 2020 ahmed et al 2015 jaiswal et al 2018 ziarati et al 2018 it is crucial to study the spatial temporal distribution of heavy metals in surface water environments such as rivers and lakes to evaluate the potential human health risks the health risk evaluation model recommended by the united states environmental protection agency usepa was widely used to conduct health risk evaluation of heavy metal pollution in different surface river water such as the dongjiang river basin the primary drinking water source of guangzhou city and the southwest coast of the bengal bay respectively achary et al 2016 liu et al 2011 based on the health risk evaluation guidance by usepa zeng et al 2015 carried out a health risk assessment of xiangjiang river china and bhagat et al 2020 constructed an artificial intelligence for modeling wastewater heavy metal removal to improve the uncertainty of the model prediction it is worth noting that the most current studies of heavy metals in surface water assess water quality conditions through limited sample data such as field sampling paul 2017 swain and sahoo 2017 however the concentration of heavy metals and other pollutants in river water generally shows continuous changes over time the discrete water quality index series can only reflect the water quality conditions at a finite discrete time and cannot fully characterize the dynamic water quality processes therefore it is essential to examine the heavy metal pollution distribution and evaluate human health risks based on a long time series of environmental data for the integrated water resources utilization and water safety control in watersheds in this paper we selected the han river as the study area to analyze the spatio temporal distribution of heavy metal pollution of as zn cr cu cd and pb and assess their risk to human health the han river is the main water source for the middle route of the snwtp industrial and agricultural development and domestic drinking water along the river however the dramatic hydrological changes accelerated urbanization and rapid growth of industry and agriculture resulted in more severe water environment pollution in the mlhr basin after water transfer li et al 2021 to overcome this adverse influence the yangtze to han water transfer project yhwtp was implemented in 2014 at the lower han river however little attention has been paid to systematically assess the heavy metal pollution of river water in the mlhr basin under the coupling influence of the middle route of snwtp and yhwtp this paper set up a 1d hydro environmental model for the mlhr and introduced a functional data analysis method to establish a new dynamic continuous risk evaluation model of water quality moreover multivariate statistical analysis was used to analyze the correlations between heavy metals in particular the model was applied to evaluate the health risk of hms and quantitatively describe the relationship between heavy metal contamination and human health risk in the mlhr basin therefore this research aims to 1 analyze the statistical characteristics of heavy metal distribution in surface water along the mlhr basin and reveal the environmental response to the snwtp and yhwtp operation 2 quantify the contribution of upstream water transfer projects to the downstream heavy metals distribution and 3 evaluate the potential health risk for the downstream coastal residents this study is expected to provide new insights into analyzing heavy metal pollution in similar rivers worldwide and preventing human health risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and datasets the han river the largest tributary of the yangtze river flows through shanxi and hubei provinces before it flows into the yangtze river in wuhan city the upper han river covers the basin area upstream of the danjiangkou reservoir djkr the middle reaches stretch to zhongxiang from djkr the lower han river generally refers to the reaches from zhongxiang to wuhan fig 1 the han river a total length of 1 577 km covers a watershed area of 159 000 km2 and belongs to the east asian subtropical monsoon climate zone with an average annual precipitation of 700 1 800 mm zhang et al 2018 the mlhr runs through many cities e g danjiangkou xiangyang zhongxiang xiantao and wuhan therefore the mlhr is an important reach for integrated water resources utilization of the han river in addition the mlhr is prominently affected by the construction and development of water conservancy projects wang et al 2015 there are seven cascaded hydropower plants in the mlhr danjiangkou wangfuzhou xinji cuijiaying yakou nianpanshan and xinglong the detailed information on the plants is presented in table s1 in addition to the hydropower plants mentioned above the middle route of the snwtp and the downstream yhwtp are also extremely important components of the integrated water resources utilization system of the han river the snwtp was put into operation on december 12 2014 transferring water from djkr to beijing and tianjin rogers et al 2020 to alleviate the environmental impact of the snwtp on the lower han river the yhwtp was built to supplement water for the han river from the yangtze river which was put into operation on september 26 2014 hydrological data water quality data meteorological data pollutant load data socio economic data etc were collected in this study hydrological data include inflow discharge and the observed water level at the gauging stations while the meteorological data include the evaporation and precipitation gauged in the study area fig 1 pollutant load data including the heavy metals cr cu cd as zn and pb have point sources and non point sources load along the mlhr the observed heavy metal concentration at the sewage outlets along the mlhr was applied as the point source load the non point source load was calculated by the mike load calculator based on the collected socio economic data butler et al 2014 all station monitoring data collected are continuous from 2009 to 2020 these data are free of deficiencies and have been officially verified for release in addition it is worth mentioning that the effects of reservoir scheduling and inter basin water transfer projects on heavy metal transport are analyzed based on their scheduling rules the detailed information on the collected data and the scheduling rules of reservoirs is presented in supplementary materials text s1 table s2 2 2 numerical modeling of hydro environmental processes in the mlhr a 1d numerical simulation system based on non constant flow equations for open channels is used to describe the motion of the water flow and the control equations are presented as follows zhan et al 2017 2 2 1 a t q x q 2 2 2 q t x q 2 a g a h x g q q c 2

sectional area m2 r is the hydraulic radius m c represents the chezy coefficient g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 to simulate the transport processes of toxic substances in river water the convection diffusion equation was added to the numerical simulation system as follows cotta et al 2018 2 2 3 a c t q c x x a d c x a k c c 2 q in which d is the diffusion coefficient m2 s c denotes the concentration mg l k is the linear decay coefficient c2 is the source sink term concentration mg l the numerical simulation system used in this study was based on the mike 11 river modeling packages developed by the danish hydraulic institute havnø et al 1995 the packages are a powerful river modeling toolbox and are widely applied worldwide to deal with kinds of environmental issues panaitescu et al 2016 the modeling packages hydrodynamic and advection dispersion modules were used to solve equations 2 2 1 3 the hydro environmental model of the mlhr in this study covers the channels of 577 85 km including 361 sections the upstream boundary condition for the model was applied by the inflow and load inputs of the djkr in contrast the downstream boundary condition used the observed series of stage data at the hankou gauging station according to the reservoir s scheduling rules the reservoirs along the river channels were generalized as internal nodes to regulate the upstream inflow processes due to the large basin area in this study the influences of rainfall and evaporation on streamflow and pollutant transport were also considered the coupled mike nam module was used to calculate the inflows from some unmonitored tributaries of the mlhr basin mike nam module is a conceptual and aggregate model for quantifying river basins flow generation and collection processes based on evaporation and precipitation data inputs razad et al 2018 the flow diversions of tributaries and the industrial and agricultural water withdrawals along the mainstream were calculated as lateral point sources of flow diversion the detailed information on the industrial and agricultural water demands is presented in text s2 of the supplementary materials similarly the effluent discharge and outflow from the yhwtp into the mainstream were also considered as point sources the origins of heavy metals involved in the model calculations include point and non point sources discharging into the mlhr the point source loads in the model were set as the lateral conditions along the mlhr while the non point sources were estimated by the tool mike load calculator álvarez et al 2017 kaiglová and langhammer 2014 text s3 the computing model framework is shown in fig 2 the model calibration and validation were conducted based on the observed hydro environmental data at gauging stations in 2019 and 2020 the model calibration and validation results of the hydrodynamic module are shown in table 1 table s3 and figure s1 in this study root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were selected as the criteria for model evaluation the nse of water level and flow rate along the channels is greater than 0 967 and the rmse is less than 0 013 which shows that the model could accurately simulate the hydrological process of the river basin the calibration and validation results of advection dispersion modules are presented in table 2 and figure s2 in which the statistical nse is greater than 0 652 and the rmse is less than 0 108 therefore the coupled model can be used for the health risk assessment of heavy metals in the mlhr 2 3 human health risk assessment health risk assessment is important for environmental pollution evaluation which is a quantitative assessment of possible hazards to the exposed population using the assessment principles and technical methods by collecting basic data such as toxicology and epidemiology this research assesses the health risk of heavy metals in the surface water for different people adults and children in the mlhr generally there are two pathways that humans expose themselves to heavy metals water ingestion and dermal contact ihedioha et al 2017 the damage to human health caused by hms through drinking water and dermal contact was assessed using the health risk assessment model recommended by the united states environmental protection agency us epa wang et al 2005 the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risks were evaluated based on the following calculation model 2 3 1 health risk from drinking water ingestion after functionalizing the simulated and observed data a health risk function can present the dynamic processes of various health risks resulting from heavy metal pollution the health risk function of heavy metals is calculated as the following equations 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 which is the functional data analysis of us epa s health risk assessment model zhao et al 2020 the health risk of surface water is functionalized and fitted by b spline basis functions 2 3 1 r ij g

of heavy metals on human health will not show an antagonistic or synergistic relationship between each other the health risk function for heavy metals can be calculated as follows 2 3 7 r j t i 1 m r ij g t r ij dg t i 1 n r ij b t r ij db t where n and m are the numbers of evaluation indicators for non carcinogenic and carcinogenic heavy metals respectively r j t reflects the dynamic process of health risk resulting from heavy metals over time at the gauging station or cross section jth in addition according to the classification by the international agency for research on cancer iarc and the world health organization who chemical carcinogen includes cd cr as while the chemical substances e g zn cu and pb are considered as the non carcinogen the detailed information on the regulatory standards for risk assessment and the parameters of health risk function are presented in supplementary materials table s4 table s7 2 4 modeling scenarios for health risk assessment three modeling scenarios were conducted to assess the health risk of contaminated surface water by hms table 3 these scenarios cover the period from 2009 to 2020 scenarios 1 and 2 simulated the hydro environmental processes along the mlhr with and without the snwtp operation moreover scenario 3 simulated the coupling processes under the integrated operation influences of the cascade reservoirs snwtp and yhwtp to reveal the impacts of snwtp and yhwtp on the mlhr the computing results of scenarios 2 and 3 were compared with that of scenario 1 the load differences at the gauging sections between the scenarios were used to quantify the contribution of the snwtp and yhwtp to the heavy metal pollution and their health risk in the mlhr 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal distribution characteristics of heavy metals the spatial temporal concentration distribution of hms along the mlhr is presented in fig 3 from the viewpoint of time the concentration of some hms in the three scenarios showed a slowly increasing trend taking the concentration change of cu as an example scenario 1 it grew from 3 89 10 3 mg l to 3 99 10 3 mg l at the cross section 95 km downstream of the djkr from 2009 to 2020 the concentration of all hms increases spatially when the river flows through the densely populated areas and confluence areas between the mainstream and seriously polluted tributaries for instance the heavy metal concentration increased sharply downstream of laohekou city due to the confluence of two seriously polluted tributaries the bei river and nan river in addition the concentration of hms decreased distinctly when river flow passes through cascaded reservoirs e g the annual average concentration of cd upstream of cuijiaying reservoir is 2 20 10 4 mg l and it dropped to 1 39 10 4 mg l downstream the cuijiaying reservoir compared with scenario 1 the outflow reduction from the djkr resulted in a generally higher concentration of the six heavy metals in scenario 2 after the snwtp operation pollutants in the river channels downstream of the yhwtp outlet were diluted to a certain degree due to the water supplementation to the lower han river reducing heavy metals concentration in scenario 3 however the water supplementation did not restore the heavy metal concentration in the lower han river to the level before the water transfer of snwtp fig 3 for individual instances the cr concentration 450 km downstream of the djkr dropped by 4 37 in scenario 3 compared with scenario 2 while it was still higher than the cr concentration at the same site in scenario 1 the snwtp and yhwtp exerted influences on pollutant transport in the downstream channels of the yhwtp outlet simultaneously therefore the shilou station at the lower han river was selected to show the monthly average concentration variations of hms in the three scenarios fig 4 there are distinct concentration variations among most hms with and without the water transfer projects in particular compared with scenario 1 the concentration of hms increased after the snwtp operation in scenario 2 e g the concentration increase in cu zn pb as cr and cd at the shilou station by 5 3 3 6 4 4 4 3 4 5 and 9 62 although the concentration of hms downstream of the yhwtp decreased to different degrees it could not be restored to the pre water transfer level the concentration increase in cu zn pb as cr and cd at the shilou station after the snwtp and yhwtp operation were by 2 8 1 9 2 2 2 3 2 6 and 4 6 and the most significant concentration difference occurred at heavy metal cd by 3 62 10 5 mg l 3 2 quantitative contribution to the downstream heavy metal pollution the correlation analysis of the heavy metals in the river water was performed based on the simulation results and the collected data at the gauging stations the analysis results are shown in fig 5 the results show significant positive correlations among cu zn and pb during the wet seasons the correlation coefficient between cu and pb reaches 0 863 at the confidence level of 0 01 and there is also a significant positive correlation between cu and zn on the contrary there is a clear positive correlation between the elements of each heavy metal group during the dry seasons e g zn pb and as cd generally hms with significant correlations may have historical homology and similar geochemical behaviors the mlhr basin is rich in mineral resources such as cu zn pb fe and mn are often associated minerals so they may all originate from industrial production activities such as mineral development to further quantify the pollution contribution of water transfer projects to the mlhr the heavy metal load comparison of scenarios was conducted at the gauging stations of yujiahu and shilou the contribution of water transfer projects to the annual average load of hms is presented in table 4 the water transfer projects contributed less to the downstream hms load transport at the farther gauging station compared to scenario 1 the largest load contribution of water transfer projects to cr was 23 31 and 21 34 at the yujiahu and shilou stations in scenario 2 the most insignificant influences on cd were 12 55 and 10 32 at the same gauging stations it is worth noting that the negative signs indicate the total load flux of gauging stations decreased to a different degree after the snwtp operation when the yhwtp was put into operation the total load flux increased slightly downstream of the yhwtp outlet compared with scenario 1 water transfer projects yhwtp and yhwtp contributed to the load transport from 7 38 to 17 24 and the significant contribution to cr was 17 24 at the shilou station in scenario 3 3 3 response of health risk of heavy metals to the hydrological changes the hydrological changes in the mlhr inevitably led to the variations in human health risks of hms after the water transfer projects were put into service the assessment results of health risks of hms for adults and children with and without the operation of water transfer projects are presented in fig 6 and table 5 the locations with high heavy metal concentrations have correspondingly high health risks along the mlhr the reduction in water flow has led to a general increase in health risks along the channels under different cumulative frequencies fig 6 in particular there are similar health risk variations between adults and children the yhwtp contributed to the decrease of human health risk downstream of the yhwtp outlet even though the reduction did not restore the health risk to the levels of scenario 1 children s health risk is higher than adults at different frequencies about 1 67 times during the statistical periods the highest health risk is from heavy metal as by 4 62 10 5 a 1 and 7 70 10 5 a 1 for adults and children in scenario 1 meanwhile the total risk for adults and children is 4 69 10 5 a 1 and 7 82 10 5 a 1 in scenario 1 so the children s health risk exceeds the acceptable level of 5 0 10 5 a 1 recommended by the icrp compared to scenario 1 there was an evident increase in the health risk of hms for adults and children in scenario 2 the maximum health risk increase occurred for adults and children in cr by 10 4 and the total risk increased by 1 7 although there is a slight improvement in the health risk of scenario 3 the improvement mainly occurred downstream of the yhwtp outlet while there were few changes in the reach from the djkr to the yhwtp outlet take the example of health risks for adults the changing processes of flow discharge and total risk along the mlhr were presented in fig 7 the mean annual flow discharge of scenario 2 decreased from 1 238 43 m3 s to 1 021 67 m3 s compared with scenario 1 especially an evident decrease in the peak flow by 29 70 the duration of low flow was extremely extended and few great flood events occurred after the snwtp operation consequently the multi year average total risk increased from 4 69 10 5 a 1 to 4 77 10 5 a 1 and its peak risk rose by 4 05 the flow increase in the lower han river when the yhwtp was put into service contributed to reducing the health risk from the hms the total risk of scenario 3 decreased by 0 42 and 0 39 at the cross sections 400 km and 500 km from the djkr compared with scenario 2 moreover the peak total risk of scenario 1 generally occurred before the time of peak flow while there was no good consistency after the snwtp and yhwtp operation 4 discussions many factors influence the transport processes of hms in a watershed defo et al 2017 hydrological changes will undoubtedly impact the spatio temporal distribution of heavy metal concentrations in river water along the river channels as one of the important factors shen et al 2021 the simulation results data are more helpful in revealing the changes of hms resulting from hydrological changes in the watershed system compared with the sampling analysis with limited data the spatial and temporal variation analysis of hms based on the coupled hydro environmental models can well reveal the changing patterns of hms in the mlhr basin over time mansoor et al 2018 after the snwtp operation the flow in the middle and lower reaches of the han river has been significantly reduced shen et al 2021 the self purification capacity of the water environment in the middle and lower reaches of the han river has decreased due to the reduction of upstream flow leading to a worse water pollution trend zhang et al 2021 the construction of the cascaded reservoirs plays an important role in flood control power generation water supply and navigation in the mlhr song et al 2018 simultaneously it has an impact on the water environment the cascaded reservoirs have raised the water level and reduced the flow velocity leading to a sharp deterioration of water quality in the middle han river on the one hand the construction of the snwtp has reduced the flow velocity in the reservoir area and thus slowed down the migration and dispersion of heavy metals and other pollutants and on the other hand it has been influenced by the tributaries to the reservoir i e the tributaries near xiangyang xiantao and other cities that receive industrial and agricultural wastewater domestic sewage and agricultural surface pollution discharge all year round hu et al 2018 in addition the analysis results of health risks resulting from the heavy metal pollution in the tributaries around the xiangyang section of the han river reaffirm that the flow reduction in the mlhr due to the water transfer leads to the decrease in the dilution and self purification capacity which in turn increases the health risks of the coastal population the spatial temporal concentration distribution of hms along the mlhr with and without the snwtp operation indicates that the upstream inflow is one of the key factors influencing heavy metal pollution the flow decrease in the mlhr after the snwtp operation directly leads to the load reduction of upstream hms inputs to the downstream however the concentration of hms did not decrease along the channels because of the pollutant inputs of industrial and agricultural wastewater into the river water the reduction in upstream inflow weakens the dilution effect on pollutants which increases the heavy metal concentration huang et al 2020 the average concentration of some hms exceeded the one before the snwtp operation in most reaches of the mlhr moreover the reduction in upstream inflow has also reduced the water level difference between the lower han river and its estuary the decreased water level difference results in a significant decrease in the flow velocity of the lower han river zhang et al 2022 it is well known that the extremely low flow velocity will undoubtedly aggravate water pollution abbaspour et al 2015 consequently there is a high heavy metal concentration in the river water in the lower han river in addition there is a significant positive correction between cu zn and pb which indicates that these hms may have the same sources hao et al 2022 these hms mainly originate from mineral development and other industrial production activities xiangyang xiantao and hanchuan cities in the mlhr have three major industries metal products textile and garments and food and medicine however these cities failed to form a perfect sewage collection treatment and discharge system and did not carry out sewage treatment facilities in time in particular industrial wastewater injected into the han river will inevitably include some heavy metals with the rapid development of mining electroplating metallurgy and chemical industries around the han river basin hu et al 2014 consequently the high content of heavy metals after long term accumulation can seriously affect human health moreover residents domestic sewage and garbage treatment rate were relatively low which inevitably generated heavy metals and other harmful substances that cannot be degraded thus causing heavy metal pollution in the mlhr basin area penido et al 2019 therefore the reduction in water flow after the water transfer in the mlhr will definitely exacerbate heavy metal pollution the increase in heavy metal concentrations in river water after water transfer is the root cause of the elevated health risks in the mlhr the reduction in upstream inflow not only reduces the dilution capacity of water flow for heavy metals but also significantly reduces the along trip transport capacity for heavy metals rampley et al 2020 consequently there is a serious heavy metal enrichment along the mlhr and a significant increase in the health risk to the coastal residents the annual average human health risk of chemical carcinogens far exceeds the annual average health risk of non carcinogens in the mlhr the han river basin is affected by the high arsenic groundwater in the jianghan plain and the as content in the water is generally high wang et al 2017 therefore as is the main carcinogenic element in the han river basin it should be taken as a priority control target for risk decision management in particular children are more sensitive to toxic hms and endure more hazards of heavy metal pollution jafarzadeh et al 2022 therefore the safety supervision and management of children s drinking water needs to be strengthened although the human health risk slightly decreased downstream of the yhwtp outlet due to the flow increase after the snwtp operation the high health risk from some hms still can not be ignored 5 conclusions mathematical modeling and scenario analysis effectively describe the movement and changes of heavy metals with water flow which is of significant importance for pollution prevention and health risk control in the han river basin the concentrations of hms in water flow were generally low in the mlhr before and after the water transfer after the snwtp operation the load of heavy metals decreased below the djkr due to the reduction of pollutant input from upstream but the heavy metal concentrations exceeded the levels before the water transfer the yhwtp cannot completely improve the heavy metal pollution in the lower han river the concentration of hms is still larger than the one without the snwtp flow reduction plays a significant role in the concentration increase in hms along the mlhr the further away from the djkr the less contribution of upstream pollutants to the heavy metal pollution occurred in the mlhr therefore more attention should be deserved to the heavy metal pollution between the snwtp and yhwtp reaches the health risk of carcinogenic heavy metals is as cd cr and the health risk of non carcinogenic heavy metals is cu zn pb generally the health risk of carcinogenic hms is much higher than those of non carcinogenic hms in particular the health risk for adults of the carcinogenic cd cr and as of river water in scenario 3 was 4 49 10 7 a 1 2 79 10 7 a 1 and 4 68 10 5 a 1 in the mlhr which should be considered first for risk control and water resources management children are more vulnerable than adults whose health risk is about 1 67 times adults risk therefore supervision and management of water safety for children should be strengthened after water transfer credit authorship contribution statement junhong zhang conceptualization methodology writing original draft jianping bing data

potential human health risks the health risk evaluation model recommended by the united states environmental protection agency usepa was widely used to conduct health risk evaluation of heavy metal pollution in different surface river water such as the dongjiang river basin the primary drinking water source of guangzhou city and the southwest coast of the bengal bay respectively achary et al 2016 liu et al 2011 based on the health risk evaluation guidance by usepa zeng et al 2015 carried out a health risk assessment of xiangjiang river china and bhagat et al 2020 constructed an artificial intelligence for modeling wastewater heavy metal removal to improve the uncertainty of the model prediction it is worth noting that the most current studies of heavy metals in surface water assess water quality conditions through limited sample data such as field sampling paul 2017 swain and sahoo 2017 however the concentration of heavy metals and other pollutants in river water generally shows continuous changes over time the discrete water quality index series can only reflect the water quality conditions at a finite discrete time and cannot fully characterize the dynamic water quality processes therefore it is essential to examine the heavy metal pollution distribution and evaluate human health risks based on a long time series of environmental data for the integrated water resources utilization and water safety control in watersheds in this paper we selected the han river as the study area to analyze the spatio temporal distribution of heavy metal pollution of as zn cr cu cd and pb and assess their risk to human health the han river is the main water source for the middle route of the snwtp industrial and agricultural development and domestic drinking water along the river however the dramatic hydrological changes accelerated urbanization and rapid growth of industry and agriculture resulted in more severe water environment pollution in the mlhr basin after water transfer li et al 2021 to overcome this adverse influence the yangtze to han water transfer project yhwtp was implemented in 2014 at the lower han river however little attention has been paid to systematically assess the heavy metal pollution of river water in the mlhr basin under the coupling influence of the middle route of snwtp and yhwtp this paper set up a 1d hydro environmental model for the mlhr and introduced a functional data analysis method to establish a new dynamic continuous risk evaluation model of water quality moreover multivariate statistical analysis was used to analyze the correlations between heavy metals in particular the model was applied to evaluate the health risk of hms and quantitatively describe the relationship between heavy metal contamination and human health risk in the mlhr basin therefore this research aims to 1 analyze the statistical characteristics of heavy metal distribution in surface water along the mlhr basin and reveal the environmental response to the snwtp and yhwtp operation 2 quantify the contribution of upstream water transfer projects to the downstream heavy metals distribution and 3 evaluate the potential health risk for the downstream coastal residents this study is expected to provide new insights into analyzing heavy metal pollution in similar rivers worldwide and preventing human health risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and datasets the han river the largest tributary of the yangtze river flows through shanxi and hubei provinces before it flows into the yangtze river in wuhan city the upper han river covers the basin area upstream of the danjiangkou reservoir djkr the middle reaches stretch to zhongxiang from djkr the lower han river generally refers to the reaches from zhongxiang to wuhan fig 1 the han river a total length of 1 577 km covers a watershed area of 159 000 km2 and belongs to the east asian subtropical monsoon climate zone with an average annual precipitation of 700 1 800 mm zhang et al 2018 the mlhr runs through many cities e g danjiangkou xiangyang zhongxiang xiantao and wuhan therefore the mlhr is an important reach for integrated water resources utilization of the han river in addition the mlhr is prominently affected by the construction and development of water conservancy projects wang et al 2015 there are seven cascaded hydropower plants in the mlhr danjiangkou wangfuzhou xinji cuijiaying yakou nianpanshan and xinglong the detailed information on the plants is presented in table s1 in addition to the hydropower plants mentioned above the middle route of the snwtp and the downstream yhwtp are also extremely important components of the integrated water resources utilization system of the han river the snwtp was put into operation on december 12 2014 transferring water from djkr to beijing and tianjin rogers et al 2020 to alleviate the environmental impact of the snwtp on the lower han river the yhwtp was built to supplement water for the han river from the yangtze river which was put into operation on september 26 2014 hydrological data water quality data meteorological data pollutant load data socio economic data etc were collected in this study hydrological data include inflow discharge and the observed water level at the gauging stations while the meteorological data include the evaporation and precipitation gauged in the study area fig 1 pollutant load data including the heavy metals cr cu cd as zn and pb have point sources and non point sources load along the mlhr the observed heavy metal concentration at the sewage outlets along the mlhr was applied as the point source load the non point source load was calculated by the mike load calculator based on the collected socio economic data butler et al 2014 all station monitoring data collected are continuous from 2009 to 2020 these data are free of deficiencies and have been officially verified for release in addition it is worth mentioning that the effects of reservoir scheduling and inter basin water transfer projects on heavy metal transport are analyzed based on their scheduling rules the detailed information on the collected data and the scheduling rules of reservoirs is presented in supplementary materials text s1 table s2 2 2 numerical modeling of hydro environmental processes in the mlhr a 1d numerical simulation system based on non constant flow equations for open channels is used to describe the motion of the water flow and the control equations are presented as follows zhan et al 2017 2 2 1 a t q x q 2 2 2 q t x q 2 a g a h x g q q c 2

sectional area m2 r is the hydraulic radius m c represents the chezy coefficient g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 to simulate the transport processes of toxic substances in river water the convection diffusion equation was added to the numerical simulation system as follows cotta et al 2018 2 2 3 a c t q c x x a d c x a k c c 2 q in which d is the diffusion coefficient m2 s c denotes the concentration mg l k is the linear decay coefficient c2 is the source sink term concentration mg l the numerical simulation system used in this study was based on the mike 11 river modeling packages developed by the danish hydraulic institute havnø et al 1995 the packages are a powerful river modeling toolbox and are widely applied worldwide to deal with kinds of environmental issues panaitescu et al 2016 the modeling packages hydrodynamic and advection dispersion modules were used to solve equations 2 2 1 3 the hydro environmental model of the mlhr in this study covers the channels of 577 85 km including 361 sections the upstream boundary condition for the model was applied by the inflow and load inputs of the djkr in contrast the downstream boundary condition used the observed series of stage data at the hankou gauging station according to the reservoir s scheduling rules the reservoirs along the river channels were generalized as internal nodes to regulate the upstream inflow processes due to the large basin area in this study the influences of rainfall and evaporation on streamflow and pollutant transport were also considered the coupled mike nam module was used to calculate the inflows from some unmonitored tributaries of the mlhr basin mike nam module is a conceptual and aggregate model for quantifying river basins flow generation and collection processes based on evaporation and precipitation data inputs razad et al 2018 the flow diversions of tributaries and the industrial and agricultural water withdrawals along the mainstream were calculated as lateral point sources of flow diversion the detailed information on the industrial and agricultural water demands is presented in text s2 of the supplementary materials similarly the effluent discharge and outflow from the yhwtp into the mainstream were also considered as point sources the origins of heavy metals involved in the model calculations include point and non point sources discharging into the mlhr the point source loads in the model were set as the lateral conditions along the mlhr while the non point sources were estimated by the tool mike load calculator álvarez et al 2017 kaiglová and langhammer 2014 text s3 the computing model framework is shown in fig 2 the model calibration and validation were conducted based on the observed hydro environmental data at gauging stations in 2019 and 2020 the model calibration and validation results of the hydrodynamic module are shown in table 1 table s3 and figure s1 in this study root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were selected as the criteria for model evaluation the nse of water level and flow rate along the channels is greater than 0 967 and the rmse is less than 0 013 which shows that the model could accurately simulate the hydrological process of the river basin the calibration and validation results of advection dispersion modules are presented in table 2 and figure s2 in which the statistical nse is greater than 0 652 and the rmse is less than 0 108 therefore the coupled model can be used for the health risk assessment of heavy metals in the mlhr 2 3 human health risk assessment health risk assessment is important for environmental pollution evaluation which is a quantitative assessment of possible hazards to the exposed population using the assessment principles and technical methods by collecting basic data such as toxicology and epidemiology this research assesses the health risk of heavy metals in the surface water for different people adults and children in the mlhr generally there are two pathways that humans expose themselves to heavy metals water ingestion and dermal contact ihedioha et al 2017 the damage to human health caused by hms through drinking water and dermal contact was assessed using the health risk assessment model recommended by the united states environmental protection agency us epa wang et al 2005 the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risks were evaluated based on the following calculation model 2 3 1 health risk from drinking water ingestion after functionalizing the simulated and observed data a health risk function can present the dynamic processes of various health risks resulting from heavy metal pollution the health risk function of heavy metals is calculated as the following equations 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 which is the functional data analysis of us epa s health risk assessment model zhao et al 2020 the health risk of surface water is functionalized and fitted by b spline basis functions 2 3 1 r ij g

of heavy metals on human health will not show an antagonistic or synergistic relationship between each other the health risk function for heavy metals can be calculated as follows 2 3 7 r j t i 1 m r ij g t r ij dg t i 1 n r ij b t r ij db t where n and m are the numbers of evaluation indicators for non carcinogenic and carcinogenic heavy metals respectively r j t reflects the dynamic process of health risk resulting from heavy metals over time at the gauging station or cross section jth in addition according to the classification by the international agency for research on cancer iarc and the world health organization who chemical carcinogen includes cd cr as while the chemical substances e g zn cu and pb are considered as the non carcinogen the detailed information on the regulatory standards for risk assessment and the parameters of health risk function are presented in supplementary materials table s4 table s7 2 4 modeling scenarios for health risk assessment three modeling scenarios were conducted to assess the health risk of contaminated surface water by hms table 3 these scenarios cover the period from 2009 to 2020 scenarios 1 and 2 simulated the hydro environmental processes along the mlhr with and without the snwtp operation moreover scenario 3 simulated the coupling processes under the integrated operation influences of the cascade reservoirs snwtp and yhwtp to reveal the impacts of snwtp and yhwtp on the mlhr the computing results of scenarios 2 and 3 were compared with that of scenario 1 the load differences at the gauging sections between the scenarios were used to quantify the contribution of the snwtp and yhwtp to the heavy metal pollution and their health risk in the mlhr 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal distribution characteristics of heavy metals the spatial temporal concentration distribution of hms along the mlhr is presented in fig 3 from the viewpoint of time the concentration of some hms in the three scenarios showed a slowly increasing trend taking the concentration change of cu as an example scenario 1 it grew from 3 89 10 3 mg l to 3 99 10 3 mg l at the cross section 95 km downstream of the djkr from 2009 to 2020 the concentration of all hms increases spatially when the river flows through the densely populated areas and confluence areas between the mainstream and seriously polluted tributaries for instance the heavy metal concentration increased sharply downstream of laohekou city due to the confluence of two seriously polluted tributaries the bei river and nan river in addition the concentration of hms decreased distinctly when river flow passes through cascaded reservoirs e g the annual average concentration of cd upstream of cuijiaying reservoir is 2 20 10 4 mg l and it dropped to 1 39 10 4 mg l downstream the cuijiaying reservoir compared with scenario 1 the outflow reduction from the djkr resulted in a generally higher concentration of the six heavy metals in scenario 2 after the snwtp operation pollutants in the river channels downstream of the yhwtp outlet were diluted to a certain degree due to the water supplementation to the lower han river reducing heavy metals concentration in scenario 3 however the water supplementation did not restore the heavy metal concentration in the lower han river to the level before the water transfer of snwtp fig 3 for individual instances the cr concentration 450 km downstream of the djkr dropped by 4 37 in scenario 3 compared with scenario 2 while it was still higher than the cr concentration at the same site in scenario 1 the snwtp and yhwtp exerted influences on pollutant transport in the downstream channels of the yhwtp outlet simultaneously therefore the shilou station at the lower han river was selected to show the monthly average concentration variations of hms in the three scenarios fig 4 there are distinct concentration variations among most hms with and without the water transfer projects in particular compared with scenario 1 the concentration of hms increased after the snwtp operation in scenario 2 e g the concentration increase in cu zn pb as cr and cd at the shilou station by 5 3 3 6 4 4 4 3 4 5 and 9 62 although the concentration of hms downstream of the yhwtp decreased to different degrees it could not be restored to the pre water transfer level the concentration increase in cu zn pb as cr and cd at the shilou station after the snwtp and yhwtp operation were by 2 8 1 9 2 2 2 3 2 6 and 4 6 and the most significant concentration difference occurred at heavy metal cd by 3 62 10 5 mg l 3 2 quantitative contribution to the downstream heavy metal pollution the correlation analysis of the heavy metals in the river water was performed based on the simulation results and the collected data at the gauging stations the analysis results are shown in fig 5 the results show significant positive correlations among cu zn and pb during the wet seasons the correlation coefficient between cu and pb reaches 0 863 at the confidence level of 0 01 and there is also a significant positive correlation between cu and zn on the contrary there is a clear positive correlation between the elements of each heavy metal group during the dry seasons e g zn pb and as cd generally hms with significant correlations may have historical homology and similar geochemical behaviors the mlhr basin is rich in mineral resources such as cu zn pb fe and mn are often associated minerals so they may all originate from industrial production activities such as mineral development to further quantify the pollution contribution of water transfer projects to the mlhr the heavy metal load comparison of scenarios was conducted at the gauging stations of yujiahu and shilou the contribution of water transfer projects to the annual average load of hms is presented in table 4 the water transfer projects contributed less to the downstream hms load transport at the farther gauging station compared to scenario 1 the largest load contribution of water transfer projects to cr was 23 31 and 21 34 at the yujiahu and shilou stations in scenario 2 the most insignificant influences on cd were 12 55 and 10 32 at the same gauging stations it is worth noting that the negative signs indicate the total load flux of gauging stations decreased to a different degree after the snwtp operation when the yhwtp was put into operation the total load flux increased slightly downstream of the yhwtp outlet compared with scenario 1 water transfer projects yhwtp and yhwtp contributed to the load transport from 7 38 to 17 24 and the significant contribution to cr was 17 24 at the shilou station in scenario 3 3 3 response of health risk of heavy metals to the hydrological changes the hydrological changes in the mlhr inevitably led to the variations in human health risks of hms after the water transfer projects were put into service the assessment results of health risks of hms for adults and children with and without the operation of water transfer projects are presented in fig 6 and table 5 the locations with high heavy metal concentrations have correspondingly high health risks along the mlhr the reduction in water flow has led to a general increase in health risks along the channels under different cumulative frequencies fig 6 in particular there are similar health risk variations between adults and children the yhwtp contributed to the decrease of human health risk downstream of the yhwtp outlet even though the reduction did not restore the health risk to the levels of scenario 1 children s health risk is higher than adults at different frequencies about 1 67 times during the statistical periods the highest health risk is from heavy metal as by 4 62 10 5 a 1 and 7 70 10 5 a 1 for adults and children in scenario 1 meanwhile the total risk for adults and children is 4 69 10 5 a 1 and 7 82 10 5 a 1 in scenario 1 so the children s health risk exceeds the acceptable level of 5 0 10 5 a 1 recommended by the icrp compared to scenario 1 there was an evident increase in the health risk of hms for adults and children in scenario 2 the maximum health risk increase occurred for adults and children in cr by 10 4 and the total risk increased by 1 7 although there is a slight improvement in the health risk of scenario 3 the improvement mainly occurred downstream of the yhwtp outlet while there were few changes in the reach from the djkr to the yhwtp outlet take the example of health risks for adults the changing processes of flow discharge and total risk along the mlhr were presented in fig 7 the mean annual flow discharge of scenario 2 decreased from 1 238 43 m3 s to 1 021 67 m3 s compared with scenario 1 especially an evident decrease in the peak flow by 29 70 the duration of low flow was extremely extended and few great flood events occurred after the snwtp operation consequently the multi year average total risk increased from 4 69 10 5 a 1 to 4 77 10 5 a 1 and its peak risk rose by 4 05 the flow increase in the lower han river when the yhwtp was put into service contributed to reducing the health risk from the hms the total risk of scenario 3 decreased by 0 42 and 0 39 at the cross sections 400 km and 500 km from the djkr compared with scenario 2 moreover the peak total risk of scenario 1 generally occurred before the time of peak flow while there was no good consistency after the snwtp and yhwtp operation 4 discussions many factors influence the transport processes of hms in a watershed defo et al 2017 hydrological changes will undoubtedly impact the spatio temporal distribution of heavy metal concentrations in river water along the river channels as one of the important factors shen et al 2021 the simulation results data are more helpful in revealing the changes of hms resulting from hydrological changes in the watershed system compared with the sampling analysis with limited data the spatial and temporal variation analysis of hms based on the coupled hydro environmental models can well reveal the changing patterns of hms in the mlhr basin over time mansoor et al 2018 after the snwtp operation the flow in the middle and lower reaches of the han river has been significantly reduced shen et al 2021 the self purification capacity of the water environment in the middle and lower reaches of the han river has decreased due to the reduction of upstream flow leading to a worse water pollution trend zhang et al 2021 the construction of the cascaded reservoirs plays an important role in flood control power generation water supply and navigation in the mlhr song et al 2018 simultaneously it has an impact on the water environment the cascaded reservoirs have raised the water level and reduced the flow velocity leading to a sharp deterioration of water quality in the middle han river on the one hand the construction of the snwtp has reduced the flow velocity in the reservoir area and thus slowed down the migration and dispersion of heavy metals and other pollutants and on the other hand it has been influenced by the tributaries to the reservoir i e the tributaries near xiangyang xiantao and other cities that receive industrial and agricultural wastewater domestic sewage and agricultural surface pollution discharge all year round hu et al 2018 in addition the analysis results of health risks resulting from the heavy metal pollution in the tributaries around the xiangyang section of the han river reaffirm that the flow reduction in the mlhr due to the water transfer leads to the decrease in the dilution and self purification capacity which in turn increases the health risks of the coastal population the spatial temporal concentration distribution of hms along the mlhr with and without the snwtp operation indicates that the upstream inflow is one of the key factors influencing heavy metal pollution the flow decrease in the mlhr after the snwtp operation directly leads to the load reduction of upstream hms inputs to the downstream however the concentration of hms did not decrease along the channels because of the pollutant inputs of industrial and agricultural wastewater into the river water the reduction in upstream inflow weakens the dilution effect on pollutants which increases the heavy metal concentration huang et al 2020 the average concentration of some hms exceeded the one before the snwtp operation in most reaches of the mlhr moreover the reduction in upstream inflow has also reduced the water level difference between the lower han river and its estuary the decreased water level difference results in a significant decrease in the flow velocity of the lower han river zhang et al 2022 it is well known that the extremely low flow velocity will undoubtedly aggravate water pollution abbaspour et al 2015 consequently there is a high heavy metal concentration in the river water in the lower han river in addition there is a significant positive correction between cu zn and pb which indicates that these hms may have the same sources hao et al 2022 these hms mainly originate from mineral development and other industrial production activities xiangyang xiantao and hanchuan cities in the mlhr have three major industries metal products textile and garments and food and medicine however these cities failed to form a perfect sewage collection treatment and discharge system and did not carry out sewage treatment facilities in time in particular industrial wastewater injected into the han river will inevitably include some heavy metals with the rapid development of mining electroplating metallurgy and chemical industries around the han river basin hu et al 2014 consequently the high content of heavy metals after long term accumulation can seriously affect human health moreover residents domestic sewage and garbage treatment rate were relatively low which inevitably generated heavy metals and other harmful substances that cannot be degraded thus causing heavy metal pollution in the mlhr basin area penido et al 2019 therefore the reduction in water flow after the water transfer in the mlhr will definitely exacerbate heavy metal pollution the increase in heavy metal concentrations in river water after water transfer is the root cause of the elevated health risks in the mlhr the reduction in upstream inflow not only reduces the dilution capacity of water flow for heavy metals but also significantly reduces the along trip transport capacity for heavy metals rampley et al 2020 consequently there is a serious heavy metal enrichment along the mlhr and a significant increase in the health risk to the coastal residents the annual average human health risk of chemical carcinogens far exceeds the annual average health risk of non carcinogens in the mlhr the han river basin is affected by the high arsenic groundwater in the jianghan plain and the as content in the water is generally high wang et al 2017 therefore as is the main carcinogenic element in the han river basin it should be taken as a priority control target for risk decision management in particular children are more sensitive to toxic hms and endure more hazards of heavy metal pollution jafarzadeh et al 2022 therefore the safety supervision and management of children s drinking water needs to be strengthened although the human health risk slightly decreased downstream of the yhwtp outlet due to the flow increase after the snwtp operation the high health risk from some hms still can not be ignored 5 conclusions mathematical modeling and scenario analysis effectively describe the movement and changes of heavy metals with water flow which is of significant importance for pollution prevention and health risk control in the han river basin the concentrations of hms in water flow were generally low in the mlhr before and after the water transfer after the snwtp operation the load of heavy metals decreased below the djkr due to the reduction of pollutant input from upstream but the heavy metal concentrations exceeded the levels before the water transfer the yhwtp cannot completely improve the heavy metal pollution in the lower han river the concentration of hms is still larger than the one without the snwtp flow reduction plays a significant role in the concentration increase in hms along the mlhr the further away from the djkr the less contribution of upstream pollutants to the heavy metal pollution occurred in the mlhr therefore more attention should be deserved to the heavy metal pollution between the snwtp and yhwtp reaches the health risk of carcinogenic heavy metals is as cd cr and the health risk of non carcinogenic heavy metals is cu zn pb generally the health risk of carcinogenic hms is much higher than those of non carcinogenic hms in particular the health risk for adults of the carcinogenic cd cr and as of river water in scenario 3 was 4 49 10 7 a 1 2 79 10 7 a 1 and 4 68 10 5 a 1 in the mlhr which should be considered first for risk control and water resources management children are more vulnerable than adults whose health risk is about 1 67 times adults risk therefore supervision and management of water safety for children should be strengthened after water transfer credit authorship contribution statement junhong zhang conceptualization methodology writing original draft jianping bing data

2971,the tall mountains on the mainland are not only important for ecological barriers but also important for water source bases forests play a key role in maintaining tall mountains ecological and hydrological functions therefore it is important to study the water sources to ensure the existence and growth of forests we sampled precipitation snow melt water soil and picea crassifolia at different altitudes in the qilian mountain and analyzed hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes the study showed that the snow melt water contribution to picea crassifolia water persisted throughout the growing season and was detectable even in the late growing season with snow melt water accounting for 33 of picea crassifolia water sources the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes of picea crassifolia xylem water showed that the plants mainly used snow melt water in the dry season and rainfall in the rainy season the snow melt water greatly reduces the impact of spring and summer droughts on forests in the high mountain system in the mainland our findings mean that the recent rainfall changes reconstructed by hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes of picea crassifolia tree ring can not accurately reflect the water sources in the plant growing season at the same time the eco hydrological model needs to be reconsidered based on the assumption of the rapid transformation of precipitation soil water plant water keywords hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope precipitation snow melt water picea crassifolia data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction the plant water cycle is a key link in the study of terrestrial ecological hydrology ogle et al 2004 bowling et al 2016 jiao et al 2021 precipitation is an important part of the water cycle in nature and precipitation isotopes have obvious temporal and spatial changes affected by climate geography and other factors therefore the stable isotopes of water contain much information about the water cycle gat 1996 bowling et al 2016 previous studies have shown that a few halophytes lin and sternberg 1993 and xerophytes ellsworth and williams 2007 undergo isotopic fractionation during water absorption and transportation the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in most plants stem xylem are consistent with the water absorbed by the plant root system and obvious isotope fractionation will not occur therefore the water sources of plants in a specific area can be determined by comparing and calculating the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope values of plant xylem water and potential water sources dawson et al 2002 studies have shown that snow melt water is an important part of the hydrological cycle liu et al 2021a similar to groundwater in the arid system and can maintain plant life in the dry season sanmiguel vallelado et al 2021 ideally when the seasonal snow begins to melt there is enough liquid water in the soil to alleviate some water stress experienced by plants before the arrival of rainfall which is beneficial for plant growth harpold et al 2015 hu et al 2013 showed that snow melt water is the main water source in the soil before the arrival of summer precipitation usually mid july zhang et al 2019 used a network of pinus sylvestris tree ring collections spanning a wide climate gradient the southern end of the boreal forest in asia to assess their response to climate change for the period 1958 2014 they found that snow melt water likely covers the water deficit so plants are less stressed from the onset of earlier growth zhang et al 2021 found that snow melt water was sourced for growth initiation for both larch and spruce by using the seasonal origin index therefore snow melt water is an important water resource for tree growth in northern forests vaganov et al 1999 grippa et al 2005 which can alleviate the negative effects of drought in spring or summer on plants at present the water sources of plants can be determined by hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope technology dawson 1998 chen et al 2020 by analyzing the isotopic composition of each potential water source and xylem water the contribution percentage of each water source can be calculated using a multivariate linear mixing model phillips and gregg 2003 the soil will retain mixtures from previous precipitation events botter et al 2011 mueller et al 2014 sprenger et al 2016 but plants may not absorb these water sources evenly because plants will take root and preferentially absorb water that movies along faster or slower paths stewart et al 1999 brooks et al 2010 the interaction between root distribution and infiltration dynamics may lead plants to use past seasonal precipitation disproportionately rather than recent precipitation brinkmann et al 2018 allen et al 2019 previous studies have pointed out that siberian taiga uses permafrost in dry seasons sugimoto et al 2002 and oak and beech in swiss forests mostly use winter precipitation scott et al 2019 however the seasonal plant water source in the arid forest ecosystem has not been systematically studied precipitation in arid areas is usually too low to meet the physiological needs of many plants living in these habitats for growth and reproduction hayes et al 2020 in this study area except for recent rainfall another water source may come from melted snow which is non growing season precipitation that accumulates as snow in winter and melts in the next growing season therefore annual rainfall represents a short term water source for plants and seasonal snow melting represents a continuously available water source plant water use patterns in arid areas are closely related to rainfall in growing season and snow melt water in non growing season chesson et al 2004 quantifying the relative contributions of snow melt water winter precipitation and rainfall recent precipitation to plant water use is essential for gaining a thorough understanding of how changed precipitation regimes projected under future climate change scenarios will influence arid regions the qilian mountain forest is located in the arid area of central asia it has ecological functions such as water supply hydrological regulation and soil conservation picea crassifolia is the main constructive forest species in the qilian mountain area accounting for 79 6 of the total forest area in the qilian mountain area in this region soil water content is usually low before the rainy season begins yang et al 2011 and snow melt water can alleviate the water stress experienced by plants before the arrival of precipitation mueller et al 2014 clarifying the impact of snow melt water on the water sources of picea crassifolia will help us carry out ecological function assessment of terrestrial high mountain systems long term climate change assessment and the establishment and optimization of eco hydrological models in this study we measured the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic composition of precipitation snow melt water soil water and plant water using these data we intend to solve the following problems i quantify the water contribution rate of snow melt water winter precipitation and rainfall recent precipitation to picea crassifolia ii judge the seasonal variation of picea crassifolia to soil water absorption depth iii discuss whether the recent rainfall changes reconstructed by stable isotopes can accurately reflect the water sources in plant growing season the results of this study are conducive to evaluating the adaptation potential of picea crassifolia to climate change 2 study area the qilian mountain 94 24 103 46 e 36 43 39 42 n is located in the center of eurasia and is an important ecological barrier in the northwest region fig 1 the study area is located in the forest steppe zone with an altitude of 2500 m 3400 m the annual precipitation is 300 500 mm and most of the precipitation is concentrated from june to september the annual average temperature is 0 6 2 c and the extreme minimum and maximum temperatures are 36 c january and 28 c july respectively the annual relative humidity is 50 70 the annual evaporation is 1200 mm the frost free period is 90 120 days the average sunshine hours for many years is 2130 h and the sunshine percentage is 48 belonging to the semi arid and semi humid mountain forest grassland climate liu et al 2021b the sunny slope of the study area is mountainous grassland and the shady slope is a forest landscape picea crassifolia is a constructive species of trees and distributed in patches or strips on the shady and semi shady slopes of the experimental area the soil type is mainly mountainous gray cinnamon soil the soil characteristics of the picea crassifolia forest are as follows the total porosity of 0 60 cm soil is more than 50 for topsoil 0 10 cm the total porosity is 79 1 and the non capillary porosity is 36 6 the reason is that the soil mechanical composition of the picea crassifolia forest is coarser resulting in large non capillary porosity and the soil bulk density increases gradually with soil depth increase 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample plot layout and sample collection 3 1 1 sample plot layout we set up three monitoring sample plots at different altitude gradients in qilian mountain 2700 m lower limit of the forest 3000 m middle of the forest and 3400 m middle and upper part of the forest the typical representative picea crassifolia with a good forest appearance was selected for investigation and sampling each sampling point is located by gps and the slope and aspect were measured table 1 three sample plots were set under each altitude gradient with an interval of at least 20 m and the sample plot area was 900 m2 30 m 30 m three sampling points were randomly selected in each sample plot to form three repetitions and the average value of the survey results was taken 3 1 2 precipitation and snow melt water sample collection from november 2017 to october 2019 we sampled snow melt water near three sampling points and collected samples every two weeks 80 ml high density polyethylene sample bottles set up a rain gauge at the sampling point to collect precipitation 80 ml high density polyethylene sample bottles snow melt water and precipitation were frozen in the cold storage until experimental analysis 15 c 3 1 3 plant sample collection in 2018 and 2019 we sampled picea crassifolia monthly in the growing season april to october for vegetation collection we selected the stems over two years old and took branches with a diameter of about 0 35 0 5 cm and a length of about 3 5 cm we quickly peeled off the outer bark and phloem of the branches retained the xylem immediately put them into sampling bottles and sealed them picea crassifolia selected from the three sampling points should keep the same density tree height stem diameter and growth condition 3 1 4 soil sample collection soil samples were collected near plants soil and plant sampling were carried out simultaneously for the soil sample collection we used soil drills to collect the soil samples every 10 cm if conditions permit the soil was collected to a depth of 100 cm we collected four parallel samples on each soil layer put three of them into 50 ml glass bottles sealed the bottle mouth with parafilm membrane marked the sampling date and depth and then froze them until the experimental analysis after another parallel sample was put into an aluminum box we weighed its mass and the soil water content was determined by the drying method selecting a relatively flat site we used a soil auger to study the root distribution of picea crassifolia when sampling in august we classified the root into different ranks according to the root diameter measured by a digital caliper indication error 0 03 mm the roots were then washed and oven dried at 75 c to calculate the root biomass 3 1 5 groundwater sample collection in the study area the groundwater is obtained from groundwater observation wells in the shiyang river basin all observation wells are hundred meter wells with water levels between twenty five and thirty meters for groundwater collection we collected the well water of the observation well near the sampling point washed the sampling bottle three times and then directly put the groundwater into the water sample bottle and sealed it 3 1 6 meteorological data during the sampling period we used the automatic weather station watchdog2000 set up near the experimental site to record and obtain local temperature relative humidity and other meteorological data 3 2 experiment analysis the isotope data of all samples were analyzed by a liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 los gatos research usa in the stable isotope laboratory of northwest normal university soil water and plant water was analyzed after being extracted by a cryogenic vacuum distillation device li 2100 lica united technology limited china the extraction accuracy of the cryogenic vacuum distillation unit is as high as 98 during the experiment the isotopic value of each sample was tested six times in order to avoid the residual influence of the previous sample the results of the first two experiments were discarded and the average value of the last four experiments was taken as the isotope value of the test sample zhu et al 2018 the measured value of the isotope is expressed by the symbol δ and expressed in thousandths relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water 1 δ sample r sample r standard 1 1000 in the formula rsample is the ratio of 18o 16o or d 1h in the collected samples rstandard is the ratio of 18o 16o or d 1h of the vienna standard sample and the precision is 0 6 for d and 0 2 for δ18o wang et al 2016 lwia spectral contamination identifier v1 0 software is used to correct the spectral contamination of the measured data 4 research method hydrogen stable isotopes do not fractionate during water absorption

raintosoil δ d soil δ d snow δ d rain δ d snow 100 where δdsoil is the δd value of the soil water δdsnow is the δd value of the snow melt water and δdrain is the mean δd value of the rainfall the snow melt water contribution to soil water was determined as follows 3 f snowtosoil 1 f r a i n t o s o i l based on isotopic analysis δd the rainfall contribution to xylem water was determined by using

ends of the water sources in terms of the lowest and highest δd values the snow melt water contribution to xylem water was determined as follows 5 f snowtoplant 1 f r a i n t o p l a n t the isosource model calculates the contribution proportion of soil water to picea crassifolia according to soil water content and isotopic composition the 1 m profile is divided into 0 20 20 60 and 60 100 cm for water source analysis according to the principles of water balance and isotope mass conservation three potential water sources are input into the isosource model and the mass balance tolerance and source increment are set to 0 1 and 1 after preliminarily determining the water source of the plant the δd value of xylem water and each potential water source is substituted into the model to construct a mass balance formula 6 δ m f a δ a f b δ b f c δ c 7 1 f a f b f c in the equation fa fb and fc are the proportions of each potential water source δa δb and δc are the δd value of each

level 5 results 5 1 rainfall snow melt water and soil moisture content in the seven months of the growing season april to october the rainfall of the three sampling points in 2018 was 473 mm 393 mm and 353 mm respectively also the rainfall of the three sampling points in 2019 was 490 mm 420 mm and 403 mm respectively the rainfall in the growing season in 2018 was less than that in 2019 the dry summer and the wet summer and the rainfall at high altitude sampling sites was greater than that at low altitude sampling sites the annual rainfall in the study area was relatively average but mainly concentrated from july to september in the study area the snow depth occasionally increased with snowfall in february the initial snow melt period was in march with the substantial snow melt in april when deep soil moisture reached a maximum as the snow cover decreased from may to june the deep soil water content decreased fig 2 b so soil water of 60 cm and below was likely to come from snow melt water in late winter at the sampling point with the highest altitude the soil water content was the most and the deep soil water content increased the most after the snow melting the deep soil water content decreased sequentially from july to october which may be due to the utilization of deep soil water during the plant growing season the soil moisture content was the lowest in october at the three sampling sites possibly due to less precipitation and plant growth consuming most of the soil moisture after precipitation in summer and autumn soil water content increased near the surface in 2019 each sampling point had the most precipitation in august and the shallow soil moisture content was the largest at this time fig 2a and fig 2c indicating that the precipitation affected the shallow soil moisture content 5 2 variation of isotopic composition in different water the δd and δ18o values of precipitation were enriched in summer and depleted in spring and autumn and the δd and δ18o values of soil water and plant water followed the seasonal trends we observed in precipitation the slopes of lmwl and swl at each sampling point had little difference but they all changed with altitude the slope of the lmwl at the high altitude sampling point was the largest it may be because the vegetation coverage and air relative humidity of high altitude sampling points were high the slope of the swl increased with decreasing altitude and the soil water isotopic values were almost at the lower right of lmwl indicating that soil water was replenished by precipitation and that soil evaporation at low altitude was greater than that at high altitude picea crassifolia began to germinate in april but the leaves did not fully unfold until june and the leaves began to fall in late september in 2018 and 2019 the water extracted from the picea crassifolia xylem had little difference p 0 05 but the xylem isotope values increased with decreasing altitude indicating that plant transpiration at low altitudes was greater than that at high altitudes during the sampling period most soil water and plant water were distributed below the lmwl in contrast all groundwater was concentrated on the lmwl throughout the growing season the sampling point began to snow in november and melted in march and all snow melt water samples were plotted along the lmwl or only slightly deviated from the lmwl fig 3 compared with rainfall δd and δ18o values of snow melt water decreased but both changed along with the same trend the slope of xylem water was less than that of soil water from june to september indicating that plant transpiration was greater than soil evaporation and the slope of xylem water was greater than that of soil water from april to may and october indicating that plant transpiration was less than soil evaporation table 2 from april to june and from september to october the δd and δ18o of xylem water were significantly different from those of soil water p 0 001 but not in july and august p 0 05 when trees began to grow leaves in april and may the plant evaporation enrichment was weak with the growth of plants when the branches and leaves were lush in july and august the plant evaporation enrichment was the strongest in september and october the temperature decreased the leaves began to senescence and fell off and the plant evaporation enrichment also weakened in the study area the strongest period of soil evaporation and plant transpiration was from mid july to august 5 3 distribution characteristics of root systems the proportion of root biomass prb of picea crassifolia demonstrated marked vertical variation along the soil profile the abundant root network system was concentrated in the shallow and middle soil layer fig 4 the prb of picea crassifolia reached 47 in the 0 20 cm soil layer which was significantly higher than that of the other soil layers 19 17 and 17 for 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 cm respectively in 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm soil layers the biomass of fine roots d 2 mm of picea crassifolia was significantly higher than other root diameters p 0 001 5 4 contributions of rainfall versus snow melt water to soil and plant in our three study sites picea crassifolia is a widely used snow melt water winter precipitation according to isotopic analysis rainfall and snow melt water accounted for 62 and 38 of soil water sources and 67 and 33 of plant water sources fig 5 the rainfall in 2019 was greater than that in 2018 so the contribution rate of rainfall to soil and plants in 2019 is higher than that in 2018 at high altitude sampling sites the air temperature was lower and the snowfall was more the contribution rate of snow melt water to soil and plants is higher than that of lower altitude sampling sites the contribution of snow melt water to plants and soil reached the maximum in april the average contribution rates were 59 and 61 respectively at this time snow melt was the most intense and more snow melt water infiltrated the soil and was used by plants in general before the arrival of summer precipitation usually in mid june snow melt water was the main water source for plants and soil during the dormant period of growth november to march plants reduce their water demand and cannot immediately use winter precipitation at this time the precipitation was stored on the soil in the form of snow and the plant roots could not reach it in april of the next year when the temperature rises the plants begin to grow and the snow gradually melts and penetrates into the soil to be used by the plants at this time the snow melted a lot and the contribution of snow melt water to picea crassifolia was greater than rainfall in may the temperature rose sharply and the snow melted rapidly during this period there was less rainfall and most rainfall may be evaporated before the plants come into contact which could not provide sufficient water for the plants and the plants can only absorb part of the snow melt water to maintain their growth compared with april the contribution rate of snow melt water decreased in may as summer and autumn entered the rainfall increased and the snow had almost melted at this time the rainfall provided more water for the plants generally speaking picea crassifolia used snow melt water in spring and rainfall in summer and autumn snow melt water provided 9 63 water for picea crassifolia of which a larger proportion was consumed in the early growing season in the later growth stages more than 70 of the water in plants comes from rainfall 6 discussion 6 1 seasonal variations in picea crassifolia water uptake depths the water absorption depth of picea crassifolia followed the seasonal melting depth the plant absorbed water from deeper soil in the early growth stage a large number of snow melts used shallow soil water in the middle stage increased precipitation and used deep soil water in the late growth stage in general picea crassifolia uses shallow soil water in the rainy season and deep soil water in the dry season fig 6 the results showed that picea crassifolia has strong plasticity for water use and its water absorption depth changed with the variation of soil water content picea crassifolia was highly dependent on 0 60 cm soil water and the water absorption ratio was more than 70 in the rainy season however in the dry season with less precipitation and an insufficient supply of shallow soil water picea crassifolia turned to using 60 100 cm soil water in this study when the precipitation increased in august the utilization rate of 0 20 cm soil water by picea crassifolia reached the maximum the average value was 50 when the soil water content of 0 20 cm decreased in april and october fig 2 picea crassifolia had the highest utilization proportion of 60 100 cm soil water the average value was 48 this result is consistent with the previous research on the water use patterns of evergreen tree platycladus orientalis in different months liu et al 2017 deng et al 2021 in addition the study by zhang et al 2021 also showed the same result the change of picea crassifolia water absorption depth was based on the soil water availability the average contribution rates of 0 20 cm 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil water to picea crassifolia ware 30 1 33 9 and 36 0 respectively the species had significantly different utilization rates of the shallow middle and deep soil water in different seasons p 0 001 the water use pattern which allowed trees switch to water sources between shallow and deep soil layers was beneficial for trees growing in seasonally dry areas dawson and pate 1996 water use characteristics of plants may be related to their root distribution and physiological characteristics dawson et al 2002 bargués tobella et al 2017 fine roots are an important active physiological component in water uptake schenk 2008 the fine roots of picea crassifolia are mainly concentrated in shallow and middle soils fig 4 when the shallow soil water is sufficient picea crassifolia preferentially obtains water from this soil layer however when the physiological activity of fine roots is inhibited by the scarce water in the shallow soil especially in the dry season the shallow soil water will be rapidly lost due to high temperature and evaporation and picea crassifolia will turn to obtain water from the deep soil through its deep roots this water use pattern has also been found in other tree species such as platycladus orientalis pinus tabuliformis robinia pseudoacacia and quercus variabilis liu et al 2017 deng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 6 2 importance of snow melt water for maintaining picea crassifolia forest previous studies have shown that snow melt water only promoted plant water absorption in the early stage of plant growth while rainfall promoted water absorption in the middle and later stages of plant growth grippa et al 2005 zhang et al 2021 however in our study the contribution of snow melt water to plant water absorption can be detected throughout the growing season and even in the late growing season fig 5 it may be because the rainy season in the qilian mountains starts late and the rainfall is more from early july to late september however the growth season of picea crassifolia begins in early april every year so the contribution rate of snow melt water to picea crassifolia is relatively large from april to july in addition the glaciers in the xiying river basin where the observation point is located are relatively developed from july to september snowfall and snow melt process is still in the high altitude areas and this part of snow melt water becomes the source of soil water at lower altitudes if there is more rainfall the contribution rate of this part of snow melt water to picea crassifolia is small if there is less rainfall this part of snow melt water is very important to maintain the forest growth in inland mountainous areas therefore winter precipitation snow melt water can provide water for plants in the next dry spring or summer the snow melt water provided 9 63 water for picea crassifolia accounting for a larger proportion in the early growth stage in the later growth stage rainfall provided more than 70 water for picea crassifolia precipitation in the growing season affects plant water absorption patterns tao et al 2021 in the rainy season picea crassifolia continued to use more or the same amount of rainfall than snow melt water in the dry season as the snow melts the deep soil becomes moist zhang et al 2019 and picea crassifolia can absorb water from deeper soil layers water in the near surface layer was short lived and evaporated during the warmer seasons resulting in dry environmental conditions gessler et al 2021 in other words snow melt water became a direct water source for plants during droughts it is important to consider the future of forests under global warming miriam et al 2018 suppose warmer temperatures lead to a reduction in snow cover or a change in the melting time the risk of severe damage to picea crassifolia due to water shortage increases in the dry season therefore the eco hydrological model based on the assumption of the rapid transformation of precipitation soil water plant water needs to be further optimized on the basis of considering the recharge of snow melt water at the same time the uncertainty of snow cover changes caused by climate change should be paid attention to the impact of summer rainfall on deep soil water is limited because most of the rainwater produced by precipitation events is absorbed by the topsoil and plants liu et al 2017 dai et al 2020 to support this explanation we found that during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons the hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of deep soil water were lower and closer to the values of snow melt water on the other hand the rainfall contribution increased in the late growth stage due tothe reduction of snow melt water fig 5 the deviation between snow and lmwl can explain the isotopic composition trend of xylem water in the growing season and the snow cover isotopic effect in winter and spring shifts snow melt water to the lower right of the lmwl fig 3 during leaf unfolding in 2018 and 2019 the isotope values of picea crassifolia xylem water decreased due to the absorption of snow melt water fig 7 as the snow melted part of the melt water with low δd and δ18o values infiltrated the soil the reduction of δd and δ18o values in plant xylem water indicated that these waters were utilized by plants picea crassifolia showed the highest transpiration and photosynthesis at the same time or shortly after leaf unfolding these high plant activities from april to june were supported by snow melt water rempe and dietrich 2018 in 2018 the δd value of plant xylem water ranged from 76 2 to 45 2 and the δ18o value ranged from 11 0 to 5 2 in 2019 the δd value of plant xylem water ranged from 69 6 to 38 9 and the δ18o value ranged from 9 1 to 4 3 the δd and δ18o values of plant xylem water remained low in 2018 because of less summer rainfall in 2018 and more summer rainfall in 2019 fig 2a the δd and δ18o values in summer rainfall are higher so the increase of δd and δ18o values in picea crassifolia xylem water in 2019 is due to plants absorbing the high δd and δ18o values in rainfall in summer based on the relative dryness of the soil in the previous autumn data not shown we expect that soil exceeding 60 cm will continue to dry in the process of snow melting deep soil water will be replenished fig 2b therefore soil water exceeding 60 cm comes from late winter snow through the excavated soil profile it was found that some fine roots of picea crassifolia could be observed in the 50 100 cm soil these fine roots may be crucial for deep soil water absorption so that the plant can survive in the dry season wu and xing 2015 suppose the snow melt water mobility is less than the spring summer rainfall input according to the two water worlds hypothesis dawson and ehleringer 1991 snow melt water will persist into summer rather than be replaced by subsequent precipitation events therefore the recent rainfall changes reconstructed by stable isotopes cannot accurately reflect the water sources in the plant growing season and snow melt water should also be considered 7 conclusions in this study stable isotope technology was used to study the contribution of snow melt water to picea crassifolia water absorption with an average contribution rate of 33 in addition the contribution of snow melt water at high altitudes to soil and picea crassifolia was higher than that at low altitudes the contribution of snow melt water to picea crassifolia water absorption can be detected throughout the growing season and even in the late growing season picea crassifolia had strong plasticity to water use using shallow soil water in the rainy season and deep soil water in the dry season the contribution rate of snow melt water to soil and picea crassifolia reached the maximum in april and picea crassifolia used more rainfall from july to october snow can keep the winter precipitation until the plant growing season of the next year melt and provide direct water for plants in dry spring or summer suppose the snow accumulation and melting process are disrupted by future global warming the forest ecosystems in the tall mountain systems of central asia s arid regions may be affected in spring and severely dry summers in addition our results show that the recent rainfall changes reconstructed by stable isotopes cannot accurately reflect the water sources in the plant growing season and snow melt water

2971,the tall mountains on the mainland are not only important for ecological barriers but also important for water source bases forests play a key role in maintaining tall mountains ecological and hydrological functions therefore it is important to study the water sources to ensure the existence and growth of forests we sampled precipitation snow melt water soil and picea crassifolia at different altitudes in the qilian mountain and analyzed hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes the study showed that the snow melt water contribution to picea crassifolia water persisted throughout the growing season and was detectable even in the late growing season with snow melt water accounting for 33 of picea crassifolia water sources the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes of picea crassifolia xylem water showed that the plants mainly used snow melt water in the dry season and rainfall in the rainy season the snow melt water greatly reduces the impact of spring and summer droughts on forests in the high mountain system in the mainland our findings mean that the recent rainfall changes reconstructed by hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes of picea crassifolia tree ring can not accurately reflect the water sources in the plant growing season at the same time the eco hydrological model needs to be reconsidered based on the assumption of the rapid transformation of precipitation soil water plant water keywords hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope precipitation snow melt water picea crassifolia data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction the plant water cycle is a key link in the study of terrestrial ecological hydrology ogle et al 2004 bowling et al 2016 jiao et al 2021 precipitation is an important part of the water cycle in nature and precipitation isotopes have obvious temporal and spatial changes affected by climate geography and other factors therefore the stable isotopes of water contain much information about the water cycle gat 1996 bowling et al 2016 previous studies have shown that a few halophytes lin and sternberg 1993 and xerophytes ellsworth and williams 2007 undergo isotopic fractionation during water absorption and transportation the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in most plants stem xylem are consistent with the water absorbed by the plant root system and obvious isotope fractionation will not occur therefore the water sources of plants in a specific area can be determined by comparing and calculating the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope values of plant xylem water and potential water sources dawson et al 2002 studies have shown that snow melt water is an important part of the hydrological cycle liu et al 2021a similar to groundwater in the arid system and can maintain plant life in the dry season sanmiguel vallelado et al 2021 ideally when the seasonal snow begins to melt there is enough liquid water in the soil to alleviate some water stress experienced by plants before the arrival of rainfall which is beneficial for plant growth harpold et al 2015 hu et al 2013 showed that snow melt water is the main water source in the soil before the arrival of summer precipitation usually mid july zhang et al 2019 used a network of pinus sylvestris tree ring collections spanning a wide climate gradient the southern end of the boreal forest in asia to assess their response to climate change for the period 1958 2014 they found that snow melt water likely covers the water deficit so plants are less stressed from the onset of earlier growth zhang et al 2021 found that snow melt water was sourced for growth initiation for both larch and spruce by using the seasonal origin index therefore snow melt water is an important water resource for tree growth in northern forests vaganov et al 1999 grippa et al 2005 which can alleviate the negative effects of drought in spring or summer on plants at present the water sources of plants can be determined by hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope technology dawson 1998 chen et al 2020 by analyzing the isotopic composition of each potential water source and xylem water the contribution percentage of each water source can be calculated using a multivariate linear mixing model phillips and gregg 2003 the soil will retain mixtures from previous precipitation events botter et al 2011 mueller et al 2014 sprenger et al 2016 but plants may not absorb these water sources evenly because plants will take root and preferentially absorb water that movies along faster or slower paths stewart et al 1999 brooks et al 2010 the interaction between root distribution and infiltration dynamics may lead plants to use past seasonal precipitation disproportionately rather than recent precipitation brinkmann et al 2018 allen et al 2019 previous studies have pointed out that siberian taiga uses permafrost in dry seasons sugimoto et al 2002 and oak and beech in swiss forests mostly use winter precipitation scott et al 2019 however the seasonal plant water source in the arid forest ecosystem has not been systematically studied precipitation in arid areas is usually too low to meet the physiological needs of many plants living in these habitats for growth and reproduction hayes et al 2020 in this study area except for recent rainfall another water source may come from melted snow which is non growing season precipitation that accumulates as snow in winter and melts in the next growing season therefore annual rainfall represents a short term water source for plants and seasonal snow melting represents a continuously available water source plant water use patterns in arid areas are closely related to rainfall in growing season and snow melt water in non growing season chesson et al 2004 quantifying the relative contributions of snow melt water winter precipitation and rainfall recent precipitation to plant water use is essential for gaining a thorough understanding of how changed precipitation regimes projected under future climate change scenarios will influence arid regions the qilian mountain forest is located in the arid area of central asia it has ecological functions such as water supply hydrological regulation and soil conservation picea crassifolia is the main constructive forest species in the qilian mountain area accounting for 79 6 of the total forest area in the qilian mountain area in this region soil water content is usually low before the rainy season begins yang et al 2011 and snow melt water can alleviate the water stress experienced by plants before the arrival of precipitation mueller et al 2014 clarifying the impact of snow melt water on the water sources of picea crassifolia will help us carry out ecological function assessment of terrestrial high mountain systems long term climate change assessment and the establishment and optimization of eco hydrological models in this study we measured the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic composition of precipitation snow melt water soil water and plant water using these data we intend to solve the following problems i quantify the water contribution rate of snow melt water winter precipitation and rainfall recent precipitation to picea crassifolia ii judge the seasonal variation of picea crassifolia to soil water absorption depth iii discuss whether the recent rainfall changes reconstructed by stable isotopes can accurately reflect the water sources in plant growing season the results of this study are conducive to evaluating the adaptation potential of picea crassifolia to climate change 2 study area the qilian mountain 94 24 103 46 e 36 43 39 42 n is located in the center of eurasia and is an important ecological barrier in the northwest region

patches or strips on the shady and semi shady slopes of the experimental area the soil type is mainly mountainous gray cinnamon soil the soil characteristics of the picea crassifolia forest are as follows the total porosity of 0 60 cm soil is more than 50 for topsoil 0 10 cm the total porosity is 79 1 and the non capillary porosity is 36 6 the reason is that the soil mechanical composition of the picea crassifolia forest is coarser resulting in large non capillary porosity and the soil bulk density increases gradually with soil depth increase 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample plot layout and sample collection 3 1 1 sample plot layout we set up three monitoring sample plots at different altitude gradients in qilian mountain 2700 m lower limit of the forest 3000 m middle of the forest and 3400 m middle and upper part of the forest the typical representative picea crassifolia with a good forest appearance was selected for investigation and sampling each sampling point is located by gps and the slope and aspect were measured table 1 three sample plots were set under each altitude gradient with an interval of at least 20 m and the sample plot area was 900 m2 30 m 30 m three sampling points were randomly selected in each sample plot to form three repetitions and the average value of the survey results was taken 3 1 2 precipitation and snow melt water sample collection from november 2017 to october 2019 we sampled snow melt water near three sampling points and collected samples every two weeks 80 ml high density polyethylene sample bottles set up a rain gauge at the sampling point to collect precipitation 80 ml high density polyethylene sample bottles snow melt water and precipitation were frozen in the cold storage until experimental analysis 15 c 3 1 3 plant sample collection in 2018 and 2019 we sampled picea crassifolia monthly in the growing season april to october for vegetation collection we selected the stems over two years old and took branches with a diameter of about 0 35 0 5 cm and a length of about 3 5 cm we quickly peeled off the outer bark and phloem of the branches retained the xylem immediately put them into sampling bottles and sealed them picea crassifolia selected from the three sampling points should keep the same density tree height stem diameter and growth condition 3 1 4 soil sample collection soil samples were collected near plants soil and plant sampling were carried out simultaneously for the soil sample collection we used soil drills to collect the soil samples every 10 cm if conditions permit the soil was collected to a depth of 100 cm we collected four parallel samples on each soil layer put three of them into 50 ml glass bottles sealed the bottle mouth with parafilm membrane marked the sampling date and depth and then froze them until the experimental analysis after another parallel sample was put into an aluminum box we weighed its mass and the soil water content was determined by the drying method selecting a relatively flat site we used a soil auger to study the root distribution of picea crassifolia when sampling in august we classified the root into different ranks according to the root diameter measured by a digital caliper indication error 0 03 mm the roots were then washed and oven dried at 75 c to calculate the root biomass 3 1 5 groundwater sample collection in the study area the groundwater is obtained from groundwater observation wells in the shiyang river basin all observation wells are hundred meter wells with water levels between twenty five and thirty meters for groundwater collection we collected the well water of the observation well near the sampling point washed the sampling bottle three times and then directly put the groundwater into the water sample bottle and sealed it 3 1 6 meteorological data during the sampling period we used the automatic weather station watchdog2000 set up near the experimental site to record and obtain local temperature relative humidity and other meteorological data 3 2 experiment analysis the isotope data of all samples were analyzed by a liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 los gatos research usa in the stable isotope laboratory of northwest normal university soil water and plant water was analyzed after being extracted by a cryogenic vacuum distillation device li 2100 lica united technology limited china the extraction accuracy of the cryogenic vacuum distillation unit is as high as 98 during the experiment the isotopic value of each sample was tested six times in order to avoid the residual influence of the previous sample the results of the first two experiments were discarded and the average value of the last four experiments was taken as the isotope value of the test sample zhu et al 2018 the measured value of the isotope is expressed by the symbol δ and expressed in thousandths relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water 1 δ sample r sample r standard 1 1000 in the formula rsample is the ratio of 18o 16o or d 1h in the collected samples rstandard is the ratio of 18o 16o or d 1h of the vienna standard sample and the precision is 0 6 for d and 0 2 for δ18o wang et al 2016 lwia spectral contamination identifier v1 0 software is used to correct the spectral contamination of the measured data 4 research method hydrogen stable isotopes do not fractionate during water absorption

ends of the water sources in terms of the lowest and highest δd values the snow melt water contribution to xylem water was determined as follows 5 f snowtoplant 1 f r a i n t o p l a n t the isosource model calculates the contribution proportion of soil water to picea crassifolia according to soil water content and isotopic composition the 1 m profile is divided into 0 20 20 60 and 60 100 cm for water source analysis according to the principles of water balance and isotope mass conservation three potential water sources are input into the isosource model and the mass balance tolerance and source increment are set to 0 1 and 1 after preliminarily determining the water source of the plant the δd value of xylem water and each potential water source is substituted into the model to construct a mass balance formula 6 δ m f a δ a f b δ b f c δ c 7 1 f a f b f c in the equation fa fb and fc are the proportions of each potential water source δa δb and δc are the δd value of each

level 5 results 5 1 rainfall snow melt water and soil moisture content in the seven months of the growing season april to october the rainfall of the three sampling points in 2018 was 473 mm 393 mm and 353 mm respectively also the rainfall of the three sampling points in 2019 was 490 mm 420 mm and 403 mm respectively the rainfall in the growing season in 2018 was less than that in 2019 the dry summer and the wet summer and the rainfall at high altitude sampling sites was greater than that at low altitude sampling sites the annual rainfall in the study area was relatively average but mainly concentrated from july to september in the study area the snow depth occasionally increased with snowfall in february the initial snow melt period was in march with the substantial snow melt in april when deep soil moisture reached a maximum as the snow cover decreased from may to june the deep soil water content decreased fig 2 b so soil water of 60 cm and below was likely to come from snow melt water in late winter at the sampling point with the highest altitude the soil water content was the most and the deep soil water content increased the most after the snow melting the deep soil water content decreased sequentially from july to october which may be due to the utilization of deep soil water during the plant growing season the soil moisture content was the lowest in october at the three sampling sites possibly due to less precipitation and plant growth consuming most of the soil moisture after precipitation in summer and autumn soil water content increased near the surface in 2019 each sampling point had the most precipitation in august and the shallow soil moisture content was the largest at this time fig 2a and fig 2c indicating that the precipitation affected the shallow soil moisture content 5 2 variation of isotopic composition in different water the δd and δ18o values of precipitation were enriched in summer and depleted in spring and autumn and the δd and δ18o values of soil water and plant water followed the seasonal trends we observed in precipitation the slopes of lmwl and swl at each sampling point had little difference but they all changed with altitude the slope of the lmwl at the high altitude sampling point was the largest it may be because the vegetation coverage and air relative humidity of high altitude sampling points were high the slope of the swl increased with decreasing altitude and the soil water isotopic values were almost at the lower right of lmwl indicating that soil water was replenished by precipitation and that soil evaporation at low altitude was greater than that at high altitude picea crassifolia began to germinate in april but the leaves did not fully unfold until june and the leaves began to fall in late september in 2018 and 2019 the water extracted from the picea crassifolia xylem had little difference p 0 05 but the xylem isotope values increased with decreasing altitude indicating that plant transpiration at low altitudes was greater than that at high altitudes during the sampling period most soil water and plant water were distributed below the lmwl in contrast all groundwater was concentrated on the lmwl throughout the growing season the sampling point began to snow in november and melted in march and all snow melt water samples were plotted along the lmwl or only slightly deviated from the lmwl fig 3 compared with rainfall δd and δ18o values of snow melt water decreased but both changed along with the same trend the slope of xylem water was less than that of soil water from june to september indicating that plant transpiration was greater than soil evaporation and the slope of xylem water was greater than that of soil water from april to may and october indicating that plant transpiration was less than soil evaporation table 2 from april to june and from september to october the δd and δ18o of xylem water were significantly different from those of soil water p 0 001 but not in july and august p 0 05 when trees began to grow leaves in april and may the plant evaporation enrichment was weak with the growth of plants when the branches and leaves were lush in july and august the plant evaporation enrichment was the strongest in september and october the temperature decreased the leaves began to senescence and fell off and the plant evaporation enrichment also weakened in the study area the strongest period of soil evaporation and plant transpiration was from mid july to august 5 3 distribution characteristics of root systems the proportion of root biomass prb of picea crassifolia demonstrated marked vertical variation along the soil profile the abundant root network system was concentrated in the shallow and middle soil layer fig 4 the prb of picea crassifolia reached 47 in the 0 20 cm soil layer which was significantly higher than that of the other soil layers 19 17 and 17 for 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 cm respectively in 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm soil layers the biomass of fine roots d 2 mm of picea crassifolia was significantly higher than other root diameters p 0 001 5 4 contributions of rainfall versus snow melt water to soil and plant in our three study sites picea crassifolia is a widely used snow melt water winter precipitation according to isotopic analysis rainfall and snow melt water accounted for 62 and 38 of soil water sources and 67 and 33 of plant water sources fig 5 the rainfall in 2019 was greater than that in 2018 so the contribution rate of rainfall to soil and plants in 2019 is higher than that in 2018 at high altitude sampling sites the air temperature was lower and the snowfall was more the contribution rate of snow melt water to soil and plants is higher than that of lower altitude sampling sites the contribution of snow melt water to plants and soil reached the maximum in april the average contribution rates were 59 and 61 respectively at this time snow melt was the most intense and more snow melt water infiltrated the soil and was used by plants in general before the arrival of summer precipitation usually in mid june snow melt water was the main water source for plants and soil during the dormant period of growth november to march plants reduce their water demand and cannot immediately use winter precipitation at this time the precipitation was stored on the soil in the form of snow and the plant roots could not reach it in april of the next year when the temperature rises the plants begin to grow and the snow gradually melts and penetrates into the soil to be used by the plants at this time the snow melted a lot and the contribution of snow melt water to picea crassifolia was greater than rainfall in may the temperature rose sharply and the snow melted rapidly during this period there was less rainfall and most rainfall may be evaporated before the plants come into contact which could not provide sufficient water for the plants and the plants can only absorb part of the snow melt water to maintain their growth compared with april the contribution rate of snow melt water decreased in may as summer and autumn entered the rainfall increased and the snow had almost melted at this time the rainfall provided more water for the plants generally speaking picea crassifolia used snow melt water in spring and rainfall in summer and autumn snow melt water provided 9 63 water for picea crassifolia of which a larger proportion was consumed in the early growing season in the later growth stages more than 70 of the water in plants comes from rainfall 6 discussion 6 1 seasonal variations in picea crassifolia water uptake depths the water absorption depth of picea crassifolia followed the seasonal melting depth the plant absorbed water from deeper soil in the early growth stage a large number of snow melts used shallow soil water in the middle stage increased precipitation and used deep soil water in the late growth stage in general picea crassifolia uses shallow soil water in the rainy season and deep soil water in the dry season fig 6 the results showed that picea crassifolia has strong plasticity for water use and its water absorption depth changed with the variation of soil water content picea crassifolia was highly dependent on 0 60 cm soil water and the water absorption ratio was more than 70 in the rainy season however in the dry season with less precipitation and an insufficient supply of shallow soil water picea crassifolia turned to using 60 100 cm soil water in this study when the precipitation increased in august the utilization rate of 0 20 cm soil water by picea crassifolia reached the maximum the average value was 50 when the soil water content of 0 20 cm decreased in april and october fig 2 picea crassifolia had the highest utilization proportion of 60 100 cm soil water the average value was 48 this result is consistent with the previous research on the water use patterns of evergreen tree platycladus orientalis in different months liu et al 2017 deng et al 2021 in addition the study by zhang et al 2021 also showed the same result the change of picea crassifolia water absorption depth was based on the soil water availability the average contribution rates of 0 20 cm 20 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil water to picea crassifolia ware 30 1 33 9 and 36 0 respectively the species had significantly different utilization rates of the shallow middle and deep soil water in different seasons p 0 001 the water use pattern which allowed trees switch to water sources between shallow and deep soil layers was beneficial for trees growing in seasonally dry areas dawson and pate 1996 water use characteristics of plants may be related to their root distribution and physiological characteristics dawson et al 2002 bargués tobella et al 2017 fine roots are an important active physiological component in water uptake schenk 2008 the fine roots of picea crassifolia are mainly concentrated in shallow and middle soils fig 4 when the shallow soil water is sufficient picea crassifolia preferentially obtains water from this soil layer however when the physiological activity of fine roots is inhibited by the scarce water in the shallow soil especially in the dry season the shallow soil water will be rapidly lost due to high temperature and evaporation and picea crassifolia will turn to obtain water from the deep soil through its deep roots this water use pattern has also been found in other tree species such as platycladus orientalis pinus tabuliformis robinia pseudoacacia and quercus variabilis liu et al 2017 deng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 6 2 importance of snow melt water for maintaining picea crassifolia forest previous studies have shown that snow melt water only promoted plant water absorption in the early stage of plant growth while rainfall promoted water absorption in the middle and later stages of plant growth grippa et al 2005 zhang et al 2021 however in our study the contribution of snow melt water to plant water absorption can be detected throughout the growing season and even in the late growing season fig 5 it may be because the rainy season in the qilian mountains starts late and the rainfall is more from early july to late september however the growth season of picea crassifolia begins in early april every year so the contribution rate of snow melt water to picea crassifolia is relatively large from april to july in addition the glaciers in the xiying river basin where the observation point is located are relatively developed from july to september snowfall and snow melt process is still in the high altitude areas and this part of snow melt water becomes the source of soil water at lower altitudes if there is more rainfall the contribution rate of this part of snow melt water to picea crassifolia is small if there is less rainfall this part of snow melt water is very important to maintain the forest growth in inland mountainous areas therefore winter precipitation snow melt water can provide water for plants in the next dry spring or summer the snow melt water provided 9 63 water for picea crassifolia accounting for a larger proportion in the early growth stage in the later growth stage rainfall provided more than 70 water for picea crassifolia precipitation in the growing season affects plant water absorption patterns tao et al 2021 in the rainy season picea crassifolia continued to use more or the same amount of rainfall than snow melt water in the dry season as the snow melts the deep soil becomes moist zhang et al 2019 and picea crassifolia can absorb water from deeper soil layers water in the near surface layer was short lived and evaporated during the warmer seasons resulting in dry environmental conditions gessler et al 2021 in other words snow melt water became a direct water source for plants during droughts it is important to consider the future of forests under global warming miriam et al 2018 suppose warmer temperatures lead to a reduction in snow cover or a change in the melting time the risk of severe damage to picea crassifolia due to water shortage increases in the dry season therefore the eco hydrological model based on the assumption of the rapid transformation of precipitation soil water plant water needs to be further optimized on the basis of considering the recharge of snow melt water at the same time the uncertainty of snow cover changes caused by climate change should be paid attention to the impact of summer rainfall on deep soil water is limited because most of the rainwater produced by precipitation events is absorbed by the topsoil and plants liu et al 2017 dai et al 2020 to support this explanation we found that during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons the hydrogen and oxygen isotope values of deep soil water were lower and closer to the values of snow melt water on the other hand the rainfall contribution increased in the late growth stage due tothe reduction of snow melt water fig 5 the deviation between snow and lmwl can explain the isotopic composition trend of xylem water in the growing season and the snow cover isotopic effect in winter and spring shifts snow melt water to the lower right of the lmwl fig 3 during leaf unfolding in 2018 and 2019 the isotope values of picea crassifolia xylem water decreased due to the absorption of snow melt water fig 7 as the snow melted part of the melt water with low δd and δ18o values infiltrated the soil the reduction of δd and δ18o values in plant xylem water indicated that these waters were utilized by plants picea crassifolia showed the highest transpiration and photosynthesis at the same time or shortly after leaf unfolding these high plant activities from april to june were supported by snow melt water rempe and dietrich 2018 in 2018 the δd value of plant xylem water ranged from 76 2 to 45 2 and the δ18o value ranged from 11 0 to 5 2 in 2019 the δd value of plant xylem water ranged from 69 6 to 38 9 and the δ18o value ranged from 9 1 to 4 3 the δd and δ18o values of plant xylem water remained low in 2018 because of less summer rainfall in 2018 and more summer rainfall in 2019 fig 2a the δd and δ18o values in summer rainfall are higher so the increase of δd and δ18o values in picea crassifolia xylem water in 2019 is due to plants absorbing the high δd and δ18o values in rainfall in summer based on the relative dryness of the soil in the previous autumn data not shown we expect that soil exceeding 60 cm will continue to dry in the process of snow melting deep soil water will be replenished fig 2b therefore soil water exceeding 60 cm comes from late winter snow through the excavated soil profile it was found that some fine roots of picea crassifolia could be observed in the 50 100 cm soil these fine roots may be crucial for deep soil water absorption so that the plant can survive in the dry season wu and xing 2015 suppose the snow melt water mobility is less than the spring summer rainfall input according to the two water worlds hypothesis dawson and ehleringer 1991 snow melt water will persist into summer rather than be replaced by subsequent precipitation events therefore the recent rainfall changes reconstructed by stable isotopes cannot accurately reflect the water sources in the plant growing season and snow melt water should also be considered 7 conclusions in this study stable isotope technology was used to study the contribution of snow melt water to picea crassifolia water absorption with an average contribution rate of 33 in addition the contribution of snow melt water at high altitudes to soil and picea crassifolia was higher than that at low altitudes the contribution of snow melt water to picea crassifolia water absorption can be detected throughout the growing season and even in the late growing season picea crassifolia had strong plasticity to water use using shallow soil water in the rainy season and deep soil water in the dry season the contribution rate of snow melt water to soil and picea crassifolia reached the maximum in april and picea crassifolia used more rainfall from july to october snow can keep the winter precipitation until the plant growing season of the next year melt and provide direct water for plants in dry spring or summer suppose the snow accumulation and melting process are disrupted by future global warming the forest ecosystems in the tall mountain systems of central asia s arid regions may be affected in spring and severely dry summers in addition our results show that the recent rainfall changes reconstructed by stable isotopes cannot accurately reflect the water sources in the plant growing season and snow melt water

2972,the depletion of groundwater resources gr in iran which is an arid and semi arid country has reached a critical level so managing the remaining of these resources is an urgent need in this respect institutions are a key element of gr protection and management and their social capital is instrumental in the management of these resources because social capital can create a synergy in the collective actions of the institutions involved in groundwater resources management grm the present study investigated the social capital of the institutions involved in grm in lorestan province located in the west of iran using social network analysis sna the results showed that the social capital of these institutions was at a low level and most ties belonged to key institutions indeed institutions that are involved in grm in the study site are heterogeneous in nature and sometimes pursue different and occasionally contradictory goals which hinders their effective cooperation and the creation of strong social capital among them and diverges their measures keywords groundwater resources management groundwater institutions iran social capital social network analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater resources gr are rapidly depleting throughout the world castilla rho et al 2019 which is mainly related to the agricultural sector in arid and semi arid regions of the world llamas martínez santos 2005a indeed researchers have called the excessive use of gr by some people in these areas a silent revolution 1 1 this is a revolution because it has critical socio economic impacts and it is silent because it has been without ballyhoo carried out by millions of farmers in these regions who have dug wells with no control or plan llamas martínez santos 2005a llamas martínez santos 2005b and who have over abstracted water from gr iran is one of the countries located in the arid and semi arid zone of the world the harsh environmental conditions in iran on the one hand and the scarcity of water on the other have made the iranians rely more on gr than on surface water rahimi feyzabad et al 2022 rahmati et al 2015 gr in iran are mainly consumed in three forms springs qanats and wells the novel methods invented by ancient persians for exploiting conserving and storing surface water and groundwater date back to 2 5 millennia ago qanat is an example of these techniques for water management hamidian et al 2015 it is a sustainable system of underground channels that use gravity to transfer water from the groundwater table in highlands through sloping tunnels that may often be several kilometers long to ground surface outlets at the downstream to be used for irrigation and domestic usages fattahi 2015 there are a total of 173 452 springs and 41 011 qanats in iran also there are 733 763 licensed deep and semi deep wells in this country over half of which 416 127 wells are used by the agricultural sector and the remaining by the industrial and drinking water sectors ministry of energy of iran 2022 so the agricultural water requirement is mainly supplied by digging wells and pumping water out of them so wells play a key role in supplying the water demand of the agricultural sector since the early 1960 s when the digging of deep wells became a common practice in iran wells have gradually replaced qanats as the dominant water resource since then the number of wells and the rate of gr depletion have grown sharply so that when the gr levels have decreased farmers have dug deeper wells and mounted larger pumps the growing trend of well digging has resulted in over abstraction from aquifers inasmuch as most parts of iran are suffering from reservoir shortage and or imbalance one of these regions is lorestan province in the west of iran the long term variations of gr depletion during the last twenty years in this region show that they have fallen by about 5 5 m regional water company of lorestan 2022 if gr overexploitation continued at the present pace the region will encounter serious problems in the future in the face of this critical situation sustainable gr management and protection should be considered a major challenge and concern by authorities and people rahimi feyzabad et al 2020 rouzaneh et al 2021 yazdanpanah et al 2015 in this regard studies by some scholars on groundwater over abstraction show the weakness of institutional arrangements about the illegal and unauthorized use of gr de loë et al 2005 nabavi 2018 whereas institutional arrangements are one of the key elements of sustainable protection and management of these resources lopez gunn et al 2013 it can therefore be stated that without effective institutions groundwater abstraction will increase significantly petersen perlman et al 2018 institutions can shape environmental impacts provide mechanisms for environmental management and provide a social context for environmental governance dietz et al 2003 also institutions at different scales mediate the response to environmental issues and contribute to the sustainable management of natural resources ioris 2008 in addition institutions guide people s expectations of each other s behavior and enable the organized use of shared resources or collective action to solve environmental problems bisung et al 2014 furthermore institutions organize interpersonal relationships that define people s rights privileges and responsibilities kobayashi et al 2014 therefore people s communication and interactions are facilitated and regulated by institutions padigala 2014 institutions can also play an important role in shaping individuals identities enhancing their capabilities and empowerment and promoting knowledge education skills development information and support technical institutional and financial of local people islam and nursey bray 2017 as such different institutions in different communities have been formed in response to gr scarcity to prevent improper abstraction and management islam and nursey bray 2017 rahimi feyzabad et al 2021 similarly in iran various institutions have been established for groundwater resources management grm feyzabad et al 2019 rahimi feyzabad et al 2021 the institutional environment of grm in iran is a hierarchy of three levels country wide national province wide provincial and county wide local fig 1 in general the higher water council at the national level is an umbrella in grm the next official institution in charge of grm is the ministry of energy whose water and sewage deputy plays a key role in the context of gr at the provincial level a council has been formed to coordinate policies on water supply distribution and consumption the regional water company at the provincial level is the main institution along public non public and private institutions that are active at the provincial level the lowest level which has an executive role is the county at which level water resources offices of the counties have the primary role in grm in this regard governmental non governmental and private offices are involved in water management under the coordination of the water resources conservation council of the county fig 1 regarding the regulations governing gr in iran water resources management issues used to be resolved by tradition governance i e traditional agreements of the society on the ownership of wells and qanats with the onset of legislation and the enactment of the civil code on may 8 1928 the grm issues were resolved by this code and the government played a more important role in enforcing the relevant regulations the 1980 s was a turning point in water resources management as the gr ownership was transferred to the government and the government was supposed to license gr use table 1 presents the historical trend of the most important rules governing gr in iran islamic parliament research center of the islamic republic of iran 2022 so no single institution is directly responsible for grm but many institutions at the national provincial and county levels are involved in this field but the point to consider is that relationships trust and cooperation between different institutions or in other words the existence of social capital between institutions is essential for the successful development and implementation of gr programs simpson and de loë 2014 so the present research aims to investigate the intra network social capital of institutions involved in grm in lorestan province in iran using social network analysis to accomplish this goal the next section deals with the conceptualization of social capital and its application in social network analysis to achieve this aim the concept of social capital was first scrutinized then social capital was examined through social networks finally the conceptualization and application of social network analysis were discussed 2 social capital and its application in social network analysis social capital is a sociological concept that is more accepted in the social sciences holt 2008 michelini 2013 and is related to various topics such as social deprivation holt 2008 economic development and growth health politics and environmental management polyzou et al 2011 this concept has widely been mentioned when dealing with the protection and management of natural resources bodin and crona 2008 indeed social capital as a solution is associated with natural resources management environmental effectiveness policies and environmental behaviors of people and most studies have emphasized its positive impact bodin and crona 2008 polyzou et al 2011 have mentioned it as an important factor influencing the collective management of natural resources bodin and crona 2008 and have also recognized it as the key to success or failure of natural resources management lópez gunn 2012 if society can broadly be defined as the solidarity of people that have high social or very emotional interactions they can manage natural resources when they are involved in this issue in collective action pretty and ward 2001 specifically regarding water resources social capital plays a key role in mobilizing the collective action for the management of water resources hoogesteger 2013 and consequently the governance of water resources mirzaei et al 2020 in fact social capital results in community based collective action and this contributes to democratizing water management at the local level hoogesteger 2013 as well social capital improves the management of water resources by influencing collective action knowledge attitudes and behaviors dean et al 2016 in addition social capital is a glue that enables individuals organizations communities and nations to cooperate thereby leading to the sustainability of water resources miller and buys 2008 furthermore social capital reinforces social relations among stakeholders and this can increase the chance for people s cooperation and common action for the management of water resources mirzaei et al 2020 and provides opportunities for activating social norms especially norms that are in favor of sustainable water management among water issues dean et al 2016 the sharing of knowledge and information on water has also been considered an essential advantage of social capital dean et al 2016 mirzaei et al 2020 so understanding how social capital influences the participation of stakeholders in the participatory management of water resources is crucial for helping policymakers in designing programs for water use and management mirzaei et al 2020 therefore social capital should be a priority for action in the agenda of good governance lópez gunn 2012 the value of the term was first detected by jane jacobs 1961 and bourdieu and richardson 1986 then james coleman 1988 provided a clear theoretical framework for it which was widely considered and developed by robert putnam 1995 according to jacobs diversity in individuals and their interactions plays an important role in maintaining social solidarity so he discusses social capital to show the networks of individuals that have been lost due to their inadequate interactions hospers 2006 bourdieu and richardson 1986 defines social capital as a set of actual or virtual resources that is related to a stable network of more or less institutionalized relationships between people to get to know each other or in other words for membership in a group thus according to bourdieu social capital is identified by a network of interpersonal relationships michelini 2013 coleman 1988 has defined social capital through two characteristics the first is that social capital is composed of some aspects of social structure and the second is that this type of capital facilitates the specific actions of actors within the structure therefore he has defined social capital as the structure of communication between actors which encourages individuals to engage in productive activities coleman 1988 putnam argues that social capital refers to the relationships between individuals social networks and the norms and mutual trust resulting from them putnam 2000 and allows participants to work together more effectively to achieve common goals putnam 1995 as can be seen according to the definitions put forth by key social capital theorists social networks are the infrastructure of social capital so that strong social networks are created by positive and strong social capital lópez gunn 2012 in this regard social network analysis is a systematic method for measuring and analyzing links within social networks borg et al 2015 which have been used by some researchers to investigate social capital through social network analysis bodin and crona 2008 borg et al 2015 the concept of social networks has been studied since the early 20th century to examine the relationships between the members of a social system bokhove 2018 this method was first developed in the 1960 s and 1970 s to define and analyze the relationships of individuals and organizations grilli et al 2015 then freeman studied and developed social network analysis sna throughout the 1990 s bokhove 2018 at the time the method was extensively used as a robust technique to analyze social networks in various disciplines including sociology anthropology and political science omondiagbe et al 2017 in recent years sna has gradually become increasingly popular in various fields such as governance environmental management and natural resources management too omondiagbe et al 2017 raum 2018 it has also gained much popularity in environmental fields and has become an option for researchers to conduct research on natural resources management borg et al 2015 mandarano 2009 prell et al 2009 yamaki 2017 yang et al 2018 sna is based on four important principles 1 the importance and centrality of social ties among actors 2 the representation of ties through data collection and analysis 3 the graphical representation of tie patterns and 4 the description of the individuals tie patterns with mathematical and computational models freeman 2004 so sna is a strategy for examining social structures and ties through the use of networks and graph theories cramer et al 2017 it emphasizes the ties between the nodes more than the characteristics of the individual nodes enos and nilchiani 2017 so to analyze the data it is necessary to convert the data into a network format which contains information about nodes bokhove 2018 as such the actors are usually represented as nodes and their ties as lines and visual and mathematical analysis of human relations is provided bokhove 2018 concerning the research topic some researchers argue that social capital is a system of institutions padigala 2014 that holds institutions together like glue isanezhad et al 2015 and portrays them in the best possible way chopra 2001 this is so important that some researchers consider social capital a counterpart of institutions kobayashi et al 2014 and suggest that social capital is formed in the context of institutions bisung et al 2014 therefore they examine the internal performance of social capital through institutions nahapiet 2008 woolcock 2002 in this respect water resources management needs a governance structure to facilitate multi level interactions of different institutions including governmental private and civil institutions angst et al 2018 frija et al 2017 ngaruiya et al 2015 romano and akhmouch 2019 stein et al 2011 so an integrated structure is formed of the interactions and interrelationships of the institutions involved in water resources management for its participatory management rogers 2002 the interactions of stakeholders usually result in the formation of social networks of participatory water governance rojas et al 2020 in other words different stakeholders and actors are interrelated in this process and form a network of relations called the social network salajegheh et al 2020 social networks are important for the management and governance of water resources nabiafjadi et al 2021 sna is a proper approach to describing and systematically analyzing the specific aspects of social complexities that underlie water resources governance stein et al 2011 this method is a popular methodological instrument for understanding the structures of relationships among actors involved in governance situations and can thereby provide different and probably more suitable insights versus the conventional methods of stakeholder analysis narayan et al 2020 this method plays an important role in facilitating knowledge and information facilitation resources mobility and use and conflict resolution rojas et al 2020 it also facilitates the cooperation of different stakeholders and paves the way for water resources management salajegheh et al 2020 therefore sna is a proper method to confirm the patterns of social relationships and their configuration about water resources management which allows displaying and analyzing the interactions of institutions by various techniques jacobi and monteiro 2006 therefore the study of water governance social networks can reveal the existing shortages of water management and this can help explicitly orienting water management practices with future challenges ngaruiya et al 2015 in addition the sna method reveals what an organization needs to use and manage water resources sustainably thus it provides managers with a robust analytical framework to study the problems more effectively it also creates a novel and specialized framework of water policies for planners lienert et al 2013 as such the present research adopted the sna method to evaluate the social capital of institutions involved in grm in lorestan province 3 materials and methods empirical application the research was conducted in lorestan province western iran the province is located between the longitudes 46 40 44 and 50 10 42 e and the latitudes 32 07 07 and 34 54 38 n with an area of 28 160 km2 about 71 percent of which is mountainous about 20 000 km2 and the remaining 29 percent encompasses 30 plains a total area of 8 100 km2 based on the administrative and provincial classification the province includes 11 counties 25 cities 31 districts and 87 rural districts khorramabad is the center of the province fig 2 the water resources of the province are divided into surface and gr the surface water is mainly provided by 37 rivers whereas the gr are exploited through springs wells and qanats the agricultural sector uses a total of 1592 semi deep wells with an annual discharge rate of 132 45 million m3 2980 deep wells with an annual discharge rate of 493 07 million m3 6444 springs with an annual discharge rate of 912 million m3 and 1322 qanats with an annual discharge rate of 92 million m3 to supply its water regional water company of lorestan 2022 the study was conducted in two phases in the first phase the institutions involved in grm of the agricultural sector in lorestan province were identified in this respect it can be said that if a realistic and desirable measure and or intervention is to be applied to an institution or community it is crucial to identify the individuals that influence are interested in and profit from the measure or intervention in this regard some researchers clarke and roome 1999 currie et al 2009 argue that considering social and environmental issues is needs identifying different stakeholders and combining their opinions thus it is important to understand the different perspectives of different actors especially those who have interests in natural resources and enjoy their commodities and services raum 2018 according to some researchers grimble and wellard 1997 prell et al 2009 yamaki 2017 most environmental management efforts have failed since they have not considered identifying and participating relevant stakeholders stakeholders characteristics their interests and the costs of conservation and sustainability adequately so it is vital to identify stakeholders and involve them jepsen and eskerod 2009 because stakeholder identification is the key to project success salam and noguchi 2006 researchers in some papers have stated that stakeholder identification is a difficult task achterkamp and vos 2008 because there are multiple groups of stakeholders that have spread at the global national regional and local levels salam and noguchi 2006 as well it is awkward to determine who is a stakeholder and who isn t billgren and holmén 2008 thus authors have discussed how stakeholders are selected billgren and holmén 2008 mitchell et al 2011 therefore stakeholder identification is a challenge especially when there is no authentic source of information about them omondiagbe et al 2017 so far policymaking specialists have specified relevant stakeholders by relying on their limited information and subjective experience a systematic method should therefore be developed for studying stakeholders because if stakeholders are not properly placed in the process it may be difficult to first collect and then reflect their diverse interests yamaki 2017 therefore the institution type and number are determined based on the analysis of the research methodology used in this study the research population of the first phase was composed of the officials and staff of the provincial water resources management institutions out of whom some key informants were sampled by semi structured interview stakeholder list and snowball methods then to identify the stakeholders they were asked some questions like which individuals or institutions do you think are involved in grm in the agricultural sector of the study area which institutions are involved in the planning and decision making processes for gr what are the most well known institutions in this field as such based on the answers provided 25 institutions including 18 public institutions 3 private institutions and 4 civil societies were identified as institutions involved in grm in the agricultural sector of the study area table 2 it should be noted that each institution has been represented by an indicator in the research it is noteworthy that grm should be performed with the cooperation of diverse and multi level institutions alongside the key users since it is a costly and long term process de loë and lukovich 2004 it is technical de loë and kreutzwiser 2005 and it happens in a social ivey et al 2006 and economic context after the relevant stakeholders 25 entities were identified in the first phase using the purposive sampling technique each of the stakeholders was asked to propose their main actors based on their familiarity with grm programs or their participation in groundwater related activities and their interest in collaborating in the study in the second phase the participants were asked to determine the level of trust information exchange and interaction of their institution with any of the institutions involved in grm it should be noted that among the institutions identified the judiciary did not accept to participate in the survey so it was excluded from the responding institutions in the second phase data in this phase were collected with a questionnaire table 3 as such the level of trust information exchange and interactions expressed by each interviewee were used to create a social network map of the institutions the demographic characteristics of the actors who participated in this phase can be summarized as follows all participants 24 people were male their mean age was 43 63 years with a standard deviation sd minimum and maximum of 7 18 34 and 62 respectively the frequency distribution of the participants based on their work experience showed that the mean value was 16 83 years with an sd of 7 15 the minimum work experience was 2 years and the maximum was 32 years according to the frequency distribution of the participants based on the status of their participation in projects related to grm most participants 75 had participated in projects related to grm also the majority of them 83 3 stated that they had participated in training programs related to grm it should be mentioned about how different sna indices were calculated that the ucinet software package was used to understand describe and examine a wide range of network attributes and graphically display the information caniato et al 2014 prell et al 2009 ucinet is a famous statistical software suite for sna which is widely used in this field caniato et al 2014 it is available online and can be accessed by interested readers schröpfer et al 2017 ucinet is characterized by the ease of use extensiveness and diversity of analysis options badi et al 2017 and the capability of formulating sna molano and polo 2015 indeed with this software sna criteria can be calculated as numerical values omondiagbe et al 2017 in other words ucinet can be employed to determine the numerical values of network analysis including network density reciprocity transitivity analysis of core periphery actors centrality and so on molano and polo 2015 omondiagbe et al 2017 finally netdraw software was used to convert mathematical values of data into network graphs bae et al 2015 to calculate the indices in ucinet and generate network graphs in netdraw data were first retrieved as a matrix in ucinet for which the variables in the questionnaire which were coded were converted to 0 1 for analysis schneider et al 2003 so the main variables trust information exchange and institutional interactions which were coded from 0 to 6 were converted into 0 1 for analysis indeed a binary network matrix was generated that showed the presence or absence of ties between the institutions the matrix components were the institutions involved in grm as identified by the participants 24 institutions the generated matrix was symmetrical in that all ties between the nodes were considered undirected and the relationships between each pair of stakeholder institutions were supposed to be equal therefore in this study the data were finally analyzed with ucinet 6 software and its visualization was developed with netdraw software the indicators used to examine the network of trust information exchange and inter institutional interactions in the research included network density reciprocity transitivity analysis of core periphery actors and centrality in degree and out degree centrality betweenness centrality and eigenvalue centrality table 4 4 results social networks can be studied at several levels wasserman and faust 1994 in this respect researchers fredericks and durland 2005 wasserman and faust 1994 argue that sna indices can be divided into indices that describe network structure the whole network is assumed as the analysis unit and indices that specify nodes or actors the individuals nodes are the analysis unit among the indices studied here network density reciprocity and transitivity describe network structure and centrality periphery actors analysis and various centrality indices describe nodes or actors fredericks and durland 2005 to calculate these indices a matrix that described the ties of different actors was formed by ucinet and its representation was converted into sociograms by netdraw such a knowledge map provides more insights into the networks of trust interactions and information exchange among institutions accordingly the results section was so organized that first the network structure describing indices including network density reciprocity and transitivity of ties table 5 and then the actors describing indices were analyzed for the networks of trust interactions and information exchange it is noteworthy that the indices were simultaneously examined for all three networks to allow the comparison of the networks 4 1 density density is the ratio of the existing relational ties to the total relational ties cvitanovic et al 2017 and shows network solidarity barsing et al 2018 in this study network density was measured as the percentage of all possible ties that are actually present the mean network density was estimated at 40 22 26 27 and 34 42 for the networks of trust interactions and information exchange respectively these figures mean that all institutions are not linked and the number of inter institutional ties is lower than the possible number of ties in the network for which the network asymmetry can be implicated in fact these density values of these networks imply that most nodes are dispersed and marginalized and just a few are located around the center whereas a network is integrated when all its actors are connected to one another 4 2 reciprocity of ties reciprocity is a criterion to understand the relations and links between the actors of a network varone et al 2017 this index describes the individual s interrelationships alhajj and rokne 2014 and the stability of the network the lower this index is the lower the network solidarity will be omondiagbe et al 2017 based on the results the reciprocity of ties was 32 14 percent for the network of inter institutional trust 27 19 for the network of inter institutional interactions and 31 03 for the network of information exchange according to this index it can be said that the mutuality of relationships within the network is at a very low level in other words the low level of reciprocity in the networks of inter institutional trust interactions and information exchange indicates weak mutual trust low mutual interactions and poor information exchange between institutions which reflects the fragility and vulnerability of these networks so the networks are poorly stable and the institutions do not form an integrated network 4 3 transitivity of ties this index is rooted in the shared ties of three individuals in which one acts as a bridge between the other two as with the reciprocity of ties this index reflects the network solidarity and stability basati et al 2020 varone et al 2017 based on the results this index was estimated at 61 40 1 and 54 6 percent for the networks of trust interactions and information exchange respectively this indicates the low stability of the network of interactions the medium stability of the network of information exchange and the increasing stability of the network of inter institutional trust in the meantime triple relationships and the presence of individuals that transmit these ties will increase the number of ties established among the institutions in the networks of trust interactions and information exchange leading to network stability and subsequently its resilience 4 4 core periphery actors figs 3 5 depict the analysis of core periphery actors this index divides the actors into two categories of core and periphery actors yamaki 2017 core actors include densely interconnected ties lienert et al 2013 and periphery actors are composed of ties that are only connected to the core loosely ernstson et al 2008 therefore the core nodes are not well connected to the periphery nodes and the network looks like a star lienert et al 2013 in figs 3 5 the pink nodes represent the core institutions and the blue nodes represent the periphery institutions this index reveals the key institutions in the inter institutional networks of trust interactions and information exchange institutions that can ensure network solidarity and stability owing to their strong ties it should be noted that the core periphery index is measured in ucinet with a fit function that operationalizes the correlation between the matrix of effective and permuted data and the ideal core periphery function lienert et al 2013 according to this index the institutions identified as the core entities in the network of inter institutional trust include regional water company forests range and watershed management organization agricultural extension coordination management department of agriculture organization water soil management department of agriculture organization agricultural research education and extension organization province governorate law enforcement force relevant universities agriculture bank water users association and groundwater consulting companies this means that these institutions are the key members of the inter institutional trust network and can build strong ties based on mutual trust thus they can lead to the solidarity and stability of the inter institutional trust network these institutions are all public entities except for one private entity groundwater consulting companies and one civil entity water users associations a look at these institutions shows that local institutions such as rural councils and rural municipality that have direct interaction with the stakeholders are on the periphery in addition private sector technical institutions like drilling companies are marginalized which can adversely affect technical efficiency and consequently sound productivity of the resources the core institutions in the network of inter institutional interactions include regional water company forests range and watershed management organization department of environment agricultural extension coordination management department of agriculture organization water soil management department of agriculture organization agricultural research education and extension organization province governorate rural municipality law enforcement force and water users association indeed these institutions are the key members of this network and can establish strong ties with one another thereby resulting in the solidarity and stability of this network these core entities are all public institutions except for two entities rural municipality and water users association that are civil institutions also private institution including the technical institutions of drilling companies and suppliers of well and irrigation equipment which can play a key role in providing services and logistics were not included in core interactions however technical private institutions of drilling companies and supplier of well and irrigation equipment which can play a key role in supplying logistic services improving technical performance and providing consulting services to public and civil institutions have no proper and central interactions the core institutions in the network of information exchange which had established strong ties for information exchange were identified to be regional water company water soil management department of agriculture organization forests range and watershed management organization agricultural extension coordination management department of agriculture organization agricultural research education and extension organization province governorate relevant universities water users association and groundwater consulting companies these institutions can be a source of solidarity and stability in the network of information exchange based on the results most core institutions are public and only water users association is a civic institution and groundwater consulting companies are private institutions thus local institutions e g rural councils and rural municipality are not involved in information exchange the lack of active role of local institutions in grm can induce knowledge and information bias in central public and even private institutions whereas the civil sector and local community may be the central axis of this management 4 5 centrality figs 6 8 display the centrality index in these graphs colored nodes represent different institutions and their relationship is shown with lines the node size represents the influence of the respective institution and the similar colors represent the same power of the respective institutions it can be inferred from the graphs that the links of trust interactions and information exchange are influenced and controlled by a limited number of institutions in other words these institutions had the most links with other institutions in the network the institutions that gained higher scores in the network of inter institutional trust included water soil management department of agriculture organization agricultural research education and extension organization and regional water company this means that these institutions which are part of public institutions had the most links with other institutions in the inter institutional trust network and local and non governmental institutions are not in a good position fig 6 the low level of trust in local and private institutions in this network may lead to ignoring their potential for cooperation in grm according to fig 7 the most important actor involved in grm which has high power in the network of inter institutional interactions is regional water company followed by water soil management department of agriculture organization rural municipality forests range and watershed management organization and agricultural research education and extension organization these institutions which are part of public institutions had the most ties with other institutions in the network of inter institutional interactions based on the results civil society and private institutions especially technical institutions are farther from the core despite the significance of their knowledge and expertise which can increase expectations from public institutions regarding intervening instead of facilitating finally leading to the governmentalization of grm according to fig 8 water soil management department of agriculture organization in the first rank and regional water company agricultural extension coordination management department of agriculture organization and province governorate which are part of public institutions were identified as institutions with high centrality in the network of inter institutional information exchange so that they had the highest number of information exchange ties with other institutions according to these results civil society and private institutions including technical institutions of groundwater consulting companies drilling companies and suppliers of well and irrigation equipment were not among the institutions considered as information exchangers if non governmental institutions especially technical institutions play no role the management programs may be biased and unrealistic and it is most likely that they enter a blind cycle with no adequate knowledge and information about technical facts and the target community 4 6 in degree and out degree centralities the high in degree and out degree centralities of the networks of inter institutional trust information exchange and interactions reveal that the ties of trust interactions and information exchange are restricted to limited institutions indeed a wide range of institutions are not involved in grm decisions in lorestan province and these decisions depend on the core actors therefore the ties of trust interactions and information exchange also belong to the core institutions and are not performed by almost all institutions involved in grm in this province this means that a high degree centrality will enable a limited number of core actors to receive and disseminate different links on the contrary a low degree centrality means that all institutions in the network have equal power in degree centrality is the number of ties received by an actor basati et al 2020 as is observed in table 6 water soil management department of agriculture organization and agricultural research education and extension organization have the highest in degree centrality in the network of inter institutional trust the entities with the highest in degree centrality in the network of inter institutional interactions are water soil management department of agriculture organization and rural municipality in the network of inter institutional information exchange water soil management department of agriculture organization has the highest in degree centrality this means that this institution is host to a lot of participatory ties and referrals from other institutions of the network however department of environment in the network of inter institutional trust and rural water wastewater company in the network of information exchange are in the lowest rank among the actors in terms of trust and information exchange which is not a desirable finding in addition table 6 shows that relevant universities and agriculture bank in the network of inter institutional interactions have in degree centrality scores of 0 implying that no institution is in interaction with them out degree centrality is the number of ties leaving an actor which is an index of the actor s effectiveness basati et al 2020 in this regard a stronger node is the individual that has been recognized as to be desirable by other actors molano and polo 2015 so it is regarded as the key actor in social influence and establishes most ties with other actors basati et al 2020 as is observed in table 6 regional water company had the highest out degree centrality in all three networks this means that this entity has many ties with other entities based on trust it also has the most interaction ties with other stakeholder institutions additionally it has many information ties with other institutions in the network of information exchange 4 7 betweenness centrality betweenness centrality shows how many times a node acts as a bridge in the shortest distance between two other nodes dotsika and watkins 2017 these nodes are stakeholders through which individuals connect to other network members molano and polo 2015 in other words they can change other stakeholders gan et al 2018 and inhibit or facilitate connections between nodes giurca and metz 2018 the betweenness centrality index is shown in table 6 according to the results the highest betweenness centrality belonged to regional water company in the networks of inter institutional trust and interactions and to water soil management department of agriculture organization and agricultural extension coordination management department of agriculture organization in the network of inter institutional information exchange these institutions are the most important institutions with a strong mediating role playing the role of bridge among different institutions in the networks of inter institutional trust interactions and information exchange 4 8 eigenvector centrality eigenvector centrality is an index of centrality ghafoori kharanagh et al 2020 that supplements betweenness centrality in identifying key stakeholders mbaru and barnes 2017 this index provides a wider understanding of the network ghafoori kharanagh et al 2020 and gives a more precise image of a system s capability to cooperate within the whole system enos and nilchiani 2017 eigenvector centrality is a criterion for the significance of a node in a network that is based on the ties of other nodes i e ties to other well connected individuals bokhove 2018 indeed this index shows ties between an actor and the strong actors of the network ghafoori kharanagh et al 2020 the results of eigenvector centrality are shown in table 6 based on the results the highest eigenvector centrality was obtained by water soil management department of agriculture organization agricultural research education and extension organization and regional water company in the network of inter institutional trust regional water company rural municipality and water soil management department of agriculture organization in the network of inter institutional interactions and water soil management department of agriculture organization regional water company agricultural extension coordination management department of agriculture organization and province governorate in the network of inter institutional information exchange this indicates that based on high trust these institutions can develop most ties with the institutions with high centrality they also have the highest level of information exchange with the other institutions with high centrality and could use their capacity to solve the issues of grm summary of results table 7 summarizes the results of the sna application to assess the social capital of the institutions involved in grm in lorestan province according to the results the network describing indices show a poor level of solidarity and stability of the networks of inter institutional trust interaction and information exchange this means that institutions act independently in other words the social capital is low among the institutions involved in grm on the other hand the indices describing the actors show that grm decisions in lorestan province are not made by a wide range of public private and civil institutions but by a few core actors based on the results most central and important institutions involved in grm in the agricultural sector of lorestan province are public especially institutions a and f whereas some institutions that can play a good role in sustainable and participatory management of gr are not unfortunately in a good position so that ngos and local institutions that can inherently manage gr sustainability are at the lowest levels except for institution k or regarding institution s although it was identified as a central institution based on the core periphery index it has no good place based on other sna indices it is also evident that although there are a few private institutions in the studied population these limited institutions are marginalized for example institution v does not have a good position in the networks of inter institutional trust interactions and information exchange despite the fact that it is a central institution based on the core periphery index 5 discussion and conclusion given the gr crisis in lorestan province and the involvement of various institutions in the management of these resources researchers are paying increasing attention to the study of the links between institutions involved in grm in this province as the main stakeholders of gr this research analyzed social capital among the institutions involved in grm in lorestan province using sna to establish participatory management of water resources the focus was put on three networks of trust interactions and information exchange which are the key social capital components and the essential factors in the successful participatory management of groundwater resources in this province in this research the steps of grm management and governance analysis typically conform to the definition of the sna method the analysis of gr governance structure based on the sna method means that i all institutions involved in grm should be identified ii interaction ties between the institutions should be identified and iii these ties interactions should be drawn to show the significance of the interactions and the relative weight of the interconnected actors in our case study these steps have been considered in the study and analysis of the structure of water management and governance it is worth noting that although the research was developed and tested using empirical social network data in lorestan province its results can help identify the existing social structure and intervention points for reinforcing gr governance the results showed that despite the complicated multi dimensional and multi level nature of grm network and the need for the cooperation of different institutions in the nature mission and structure dimensions the civil and private institutions are not in a good position in the networks of inter institutional trust interactions and information exchange at both macro and local levels in the study site so that they play a marginal role while the main authority belongs to public institutions this may be associated with the fact that water is a public commodity in iran and the government is generally responsible for its management mirzaei et al 2020 however some researchers have acknowledged that water governance should not be limited only to public institutions and other actors should be involved so that they can contribute to solving the issues of water resources actively and constructively ghafoori kharanagh et al 2020 therefore since the most important users of these resources are the rural communities non governmental local organizations have the highest level of trust interactions and information exchange with these users as a result the trivial role of these institutions in information exchange and interactions can reduce the likelihood of local users and stakeholders participation in grm nonetheless non governmental local institutions like rural councils water users associations and provincial ngos are the key individuals and leaders in promoting and facilitating collective action of the users for gr management since they are representatives of the users these entities can mitigate the gr issues by cooperating mediating and negotiating in the community and settle local conflicts by traditional rules and norms derived from moral social and religious values on the other hand rural municipalities among the local non governmental institutions can play a more important role in gr management than other non governmental institutions rural councils water users associations and provincial ngos owing to their legal authorities in general considering the complexity of the network this may be caused by a series of extra institutional or intra institutional factors the weak role of civil institutions such as rural municipalities rural councils water users associations and provincial ngos is related to the fact that public institutions do not trust these institutions and the governance system is government centered and incompetent also the fact that the private sector has no role in exchanges interactions and trust may be associated with the lack of historical experience and the context for private activities and businesses as well as the incomplete privatization and the fact that the delegation and decentralization process has not been institutionalized in addition to these extra institutional complications the inability of private and civil institutions to play an effective role may be related to intra institutional factors examples include the facts that people s participation in public and environmental affairs is not institutionalized individualism dominates collectivism due to resource limitations there is no historical experience of interaction between civil institutions and public institutions and some civil institutions are infant and copied with no attention to traditional cooperation of society also the passivism of private institutions may be related to the lack of a private sector that has high technical and knowledge capacity the lack of mechanisms for the interaction of private public and civil institutions the competition of the public sector with these institutions that hinders their maturity and development the lack of public sector s trust in the culture and entrepreneurship and private sector and the fact that private sector institutions are infant and limited in number according to what was said although the nature of water resources as a public commodity implies that government must take the overall responsibility for water management in iran it is necessary to strengthen the role of the private sector and social institutions due to the nature of this commodity and the limited ability of the government as such a balance can be made in the roles that the institutions involved in the grm network play in the meantime it looks necessary to revise the current policy and strategies of water resources management in iran for this purpose it is recommended to build a shared committee composed of decision making executive and supervising institutions at the national level and provincial level in a hierarchy to change strategic policies and development approaches to developing the private sector by facilitating establishment increasing authorities and providing financial logistic and educational supports furthermore given the low authority of civil institutions and their direct interaction with the user community it seems necessary to have a look at the history of traditional cooperation and people s native technologies in grm in creating and empowering local institutions that are active in local communities and using non governmental and community centered institutions that are composed of the youth women and main users in this regard educational institutions for example agricultural extension coordination management department of agriculture organization agricultural research education and extension organization and forests range and watershed management organization can play an effective role in facilitating and guiding the establishment and dynamism of local institutions credit authorship contribution statement fatemeh rahimi feyzabad conceptualization methodology software

2972,the depletion of groundwater resources gr in iran which is an arid and semi arid country has reached a critical level so managing the remaining of these resources is an urgent need in this respect institutions are a key element of gr protection and management and their social capital is instrumental in the management of these resources because social capital can create a synergy in the collective actions of the institutions involved in groundwater resources management grm the present study investigated the social capital of the institutions involved in grm in lorestan province located in the west of iran using social network analysis sna the results showed that the social capital of these institutions was at a low level and most ties belonged to key institutions indeed institutions that are involved in grm in the study site are heterogeneous in nature and sometimes pursue different and occasionally contradictory goals which hinders their effective cooperation and the creation of strong social capital among them and diverges their measures keywords groundwater resources management groundwater institutions iran social capital social network analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater resources gr are rapidly depleting throughout the world castilla rho et al 2019 which is mainly related to the agricultural sector in arid and semi arid regions of the world llamas martínez santos 2005a indeed researchers have called the excessive use of gr by some people in these areas a silent revolution 1 1 this is a revolution because it has critical socio economic impacts and it is silent because it has been without ballyhoo carried out by millions of farmers in these regions who have dug wells with no control or plan llamas martínez santos 2005a llamas martínez santos 2005b and who have over abstracted water from gr iran is one of the countries located in the arid and semi arid zone of the world the harsh environmental conditions in iran on the one hand and the scarcity of water on the other have made the iranians rely more on gr than on surface water rahimi feyzabad et al 2022 rahmati et al 2015 gr in iran are mainly consumed in three forms springs qanats and wells the novel methods invented by ancient persians for exploiting conserving and storing surface water and groundwater date back to 2 5 millennia ago qanat is an example of these techniques for water management hamidian et al 2015 it is a sustainable system of underground channels that use gravity to transfer water from the groundwater table in highlands through sloping tunnels that may often be several kilometers long to ground surface outlets at the downstream to be used for irrigation and domestic usages fattahi 2015 there are a total of 173 452 springs and 41 011 qanats in iran also there are 733 763 licensed deep and semi deep wells in this country over half of which 416 127 wells are used by the agricultural sector and the remaining by the industrial and drinking water sectors ministry of energy of iran 2022 so the agricultural water requirement is mainly supplied by digging wells and pumping water out of them so wells play a key role in supplying the water demand of the agricultural sector since the early 1960 s when the digging of deep wells became a common practice in iran wells have gradually replaced qanats as the dominant water resource since then the number of wells and the rate of gr depletion have grown sharply so that when the gr levels have decreased farmers have dug deeper wells and mounted larger pumps the growing trend of well digging has resulted in over abstraction from aquifers inasmuch as most parts of iran are suffering from reservoir shortage and or imbalance one of these regions is lorestan province in the west of iran the long term variations of gr depletion during the last twenty years in this region show that they have fallen by about 5 5 m regional water company of lorestan 2022 if gr overexploitation continued at the present pace the region will encounter serious problems in the future in the face of this critical situation sustainable gr management and protection should be considered a major challenge and concern by authorities and people rahimi feyzabad et al 2020 rouzaneh et al 2021 yazdanpanah et al 2015 in this regard studies by some scholars on groundwater over abstraction show the weakness of institutional arrangements about the illegal and unauthorized use of gr de loë et al 2005 nabavi 2018 whereas institutional arrangements are one of the key elements of sustainable protection and management of these resources lopez gunn et al 2013 it can therefore be stated that without effective institutions groundwater abstraction will increase significantly petersen perlman et al 2018 institutions can shape environmental impacts provide mechanisms for environmental management and provide a social context for environmental governance dietz et al 2003 also institutions at different scales mediate the response to environmental issues and contribute to the sustainable management of natural resources ioris 2008 in addition institutions guide people s expectations of each other s behavior and enable the organized use of shared resources or collective action to solve environmental problems bisung et al 2014 furthermore institutions organize interpersonal relationships that define people s rights privileges and responsibilities kobayashi et al 2014 therefore people s communication and interactions are facilitated and regulated by institutions padigala 2014 institutions can also play an important role in shaping individuals identities enhancing their capabilities and empowerment and promoting knowledge education skills development information and support technical institutional and financial of local people islam and nursey bray 2017 as such different institutions in different communities have been formed in response to gr scarcity to prevent improper abstraction and management islam and nursey bray 2017 rahimi feyzabad et al 2021 similarly in iran various institutions have been established for groundwater resources management grm feyzabad et al 2019 rahimi feyzabad et al 2021 the institutional environment of grm in iran is a hierarchy of three levels country wide national province wide provincial and county wide local fig 1 in general the higher water council at the national level is an umbrella in grm the next official institution in charge of grm is the ministry of energy whose water and sewage deputy plays a key role in the context of gr at the provincial level a council has been formed to coordinate policies on water supply distribution and consumption the regional water company at the provincial level is the main institution along public non public and private institutions that are active at the provincial level the lowest level which has an executive role is the county at which level water resources offices of the counties have the primary role in grm in this regard governmental non governmental and private offices are involved in water management under the coordination of the water resources conservation council of the county fig 1 regarding the regulations governing gr in iran water resources management issues used to be resolved by tradition governance i e traditional agreements of the society on the ownership of wells and qanats with the onset of legislation and the enactment of the civil code on may 8 1928 the grm issues were resolved by this code and the government played a more important role in enforcing the relevant regulations the 1980 s was a turning point in water resources management as the gr ownership was transferred to the government and the government was supposed to license gr use table 1 presents the historical trend of the most important rules governing gr in iran islamic parliament research center of the islamic republic of iran 2022 so no single institution is directly responsible for grm but many institutions at the national provincial and county levels are involved in this field but the point to consider is that relationships trust and cooperation between different institutions or in other words the existence of social capital between institutions is essential for the successful development and implementation of gr programs simpson and de loë 2014 so the present research aims to investigate the intra network social capital of institutions involved in grm in lorestan province in iran using social network analysis to accomplish this goal the next section deals with the conceptualization of social capital and its application in social network analysis to achieve this aim the concept of social capital was first scrutinized then social capital was examined through social networks finally the conceptualization and application of social network analysis were discussed 2 social capital and its application in social network analysis social capital is a sociological concept that is more accepted in the social sciences holt 2008 michelini 2013 and is related to various topics such as social deprivation holt 2008 economic development and growth health politics and environmental management polyzou et al 2011 this concept has widely been mentioned when dealing with the protection and management of natural resources bodin and crona 2008 indeed social capital as a solution is associated with natural resources management environmental effectiveness policies and environmental behaviors of people and most studies have emphasized its positive impact bodin and crona 2008 polyzou et al 2011 have mentioned it as an important factor influencing the collective management of natural resources bodin and crona 2008 and have also recognized it as the key to success or failure of natural resources management lópez gunn 2012 if society can broadly be defined as the solidarity of people that have high social or very emotional interactions they can manage natural resources when they are involved in this issue in collective action pretty and ward 2001 specifically regarding water resources social capital plays a key role in mobilizing the collective action for the management of water resources hoogesteger 2013 and consequently the governance of water resources mirzaei et al 2020 in fact social capital results in community based collective action and this contributes to democratizing water management at the local level hoogesteger 2013 as well social capital improves the management of water resources by influencing collective action knowledge attitudes and behaviors dean et al 2016 in addition social capital is a glue that enables individuals organizations communities and nations to cooperate thereby leading to the sustainability of water resources miller and buys 2008 furthermore social capital reinforces social relations among stakeholders and this can increase the chance for people s cooperation and common action for the management of water resources mirzaei et al 2020 and provides opportunities for activating social norms especially norms that are in favor of sustainable water management among water issues dean et al 2016 the sharing of knowledge and information on water has also been considered an essential advantage of social capital dean et al 2016 mirzaei et al 2020 so understanding how social capital influences the participation of stakeholders in the participatory management of water resources is crucial for helping policymakers in designing programs for water use and management mirzaei et al 2020 therefore social capital should be a priority for action in the agenda of good governance lópez gunn 2012 the value of the term was first detected by jane jacobs 1961 and bourdieu and richardson 1986 then james coleman 1988 provided a clear theoretical framework for it which was widely considered and developed by robert putnam 1995 according to jacobs diversity in individuals and their interactions plays an important role in maintaining social solidarity so he discusses social capital to show the networks of individuals that have been lost due to their inadequate interactions hospers 2006 bourdieu and richardson 1986 defines social capital as a set of actual or virtual resources that is related to a stable network of more or less institutionalized relationships between people to get to know each other or in other words for membership in a group thus according to bourdieu social capital is identified by a network of interpersonal relationships michelini 2013 coleman 1988 has defined social capital through two characteristics the first is that social capital is composed of some aspects of social structure and the second is that this type of capital facilitates the specific actions of actors within the structure therefore he has defined social capital as the structure of communication between actors which encourages individuals to engage in productive activities coleman 1988 putnam argues that social capital refers to the relationships between individuals social networks and the norms and mutual trust resulting from them putnam 2000 and allows participants to work together more effectively to achieve common goals putnam 1995 as can be seen according to the definitions put forth by key social capital theorists social networks are the infrastructure of social capital so that strong social networks are created by positive and strong social capital lópez gunn 2012 in this regard social network analysis is a systematic method for measuring and analyzing links within social networks borg et al 2015 which have been used by some researchers to investigate social capital through social network analysis bodin and crona 2008 borg et al 2015 the concept of social networks has been studied since the early 20th century to examine the relationships between the members of a social system bokhove 2018 this method was first developed in the 1960 s and 1970 s to define and analyze the relationships of individuals and organizations grilli et al 2015 then freeman studied and developed social network analysis sna throughout the 1990 s bokhove 2018 at the time the method was extensively used as a robust technique to analyze social networks in various disciplines including sociology anthropology and political science omondiagbe et al 2017 in recent years sna has gradually become increasingly popular in various fields such as governance environmental management and natural resources management too omondiagbe et al 2017 raum 2018 it has also gained much popularity in environmental fields and has become an option for researchers to conduct research on natural resources management borg et al 2015 mandarano 2009 prell et al 2009 yamaki 2017 yang et al 2018 sna is based on four important principles 1 the importance and centrality of social ties among actors 2 the representation of ties through data collection and analysis 3 the graphical representation of tie patterns and 4 the description of the individuals tie patterns with mathematical and computational models freeman 2004 so sna is a strategy for examining social structures and ties through the use of networks and graph theories cramer et al 2017 it emphasizes the ties between the nodes more than the characteristics of the individual nodes enos and nilchiani 2017 so to analyze the data it is necessary to convert the data into a network format which contains information about nodes bokhove 2018 as such the actors are usually represented as nodes and their ties as lines and visual and mathematical analysis of human relations is provided bokhove 2018 concerning the research topic some researchers argue that social capital is a system of institutions padigala 2014 that holds institutions together like glue isanezhad et al 2015 and portrays them in the best possible way chopra 2001 this is so important that some researchers consider social capital a counterpart of institutions kobayashi et al 2014 and suggest that social capital is formed in the context of institutions bisung et al 2014 therefore they examine the internal performance of social capital through institutions nahapiet 2008 woolcock 2002 in this respect water resources management needs a governance structure to facilitate multi level interactions of different institutions including governmental private and civil institutions angst et al 2018 frija et al 2017 ngaruiya et al 2015 romano and akhmouch 2019 stein et al 2011 so an integrated structure is formed of the interactions and interrelationships of the institutions involved in water resources management for its participatory management rogers 2002 the interactions of stakeholders usually result in the formation of social networks of participatory water governance rojas et al 2020 in other words different stakeholders and actors are interrelated in this process and form a network of relations called the social network salajegheh et al 2020 social networks are important for the management and governance of water resources nabiafjadi et al 2021 sna is a proper approach to describing and systematically analyzing the specific aspects of social complexities that underlie water resources governance stein et al 2011 this method is a popular methodological instrument for understanding the structures of relationships among actors involved in governance situations and can thereby provide different and probably more suitable insights versus the conventional methods of stakeholder analysis narayan et al 2020 this method plays an important role in facilitating knowledge and information facilitation resources mobility and use and conflict resolution rojas et al 2020 it also facilitates the cooperation of different stakeholders and paves the way for water resources management salajegheh et al 2020 therefore sna is a proper method to confirm the patterns of social relationships and their configuration about water resources management which allows displaying and analyzing the interactions of institutions by various techniques jacobi and monteiro 2006 therefore the study of water governance social networks can reveal the existing shortages of water management and this can help explicitly orienting water management practices with future challenges ngaruiya et al 2015 in addition the sna method reveals what an organization needs to use and manage water resources sustainably thus it provides managers with a robust analytical framework to study the problems more effectively it also creates a novel and specialized framework of water policies for planners lienert et al 2013 as such the present research adopted the sna method to evaluate the social capital of institutions involved in grm in lorestan province 3 materials and methods empirical application the research was conducted in lorestan province western iran the province is located between the longitudes 46 40 44 and 50 10 42 e and the latitudes 32 07 07 and 34 54 38 n with an area of 28 160 km2 about 71 percent of which is mountainous about 20 000 km2 and the remaining 29 percent encompasses 30 plains a total area of 8 100 km2 based on the administrative and provincial classification the province includes 11 counties 25 cities 31 districts and 87 rural districts khorramabad is the center of the province fig 2 the water resources of the province are divided into surface and gr the surface water is mainly provided by 37 rivers whereas the gr are exploited through springs wells and qanats the agricultural sector uses a total of 1592 semi deep wells with an annual discharge rate of 132 45 million m3 2980 deep wells with an annual discharge rate of 493 07 million m3 6444 springs with an annual discharge rate of 912 million m3 and 1322 qanats with an annual discharge rate of 92 million m3 to supply its water regional water company of lorestan 2022 the study was conducted in two phases in the first phase the institutions involved in grm of the agricultural sector in lorestan province were identified in this respect it can be said that if a realistic and desirable measure and or intervention is to be applied to an institution or community it is crucial to identify the individuals that influence are interested in and profit from the measure or intervention in this regard some researchers clarke and roome 1999 currie et al 2009 argue that considering social and environmental issues is needs identifying different stakeholders and combining their opinions thus it is important to understand the different perspectives of different actors especially those who have interests in natural resources and enjoy their commodities and services raum 2018 according to some researchers grimble and wellard 1997 prell et al 2009 yamaki 2017 most environmental management efforts have failed since they have not considered identifying and participating relevant stakeholders stakeholders characteristics their interests and the costs of conservation and sustainability adequately so it is vital to identify stakeholders and involve them jepsen and eskerod 2009 because stakeholder identification is the key to project success salam and noguchi 2006 researchers in some papers have stated that stakeholder identification is a difficult task achterkamp and vos 2008 because there are multiple groups of stakeholders that have spread at the global national regional and local levels salam and noguchi 2006 as well it is awkward to determine who is a stakeholder and who isn t billgren and holmén 2008 thus authors have discussed how stakeholders are selected billgren and holmén 2008 mitchell et al 2011 therefore stakeholder identification is a challenge especially when there is no authentic source of information about them omondiagbe et al 2017 so far policymaking specialists have specified relevant stakeholders by relying on their limited information and subjective experience a systematic method should therefore be developed for studying stakeholders because if stakeholders are not properly placed in the process it may be difficult to first collect and then reflect their diverse interests yamaki 2017 therefore the institution type and number are determined based on the analysis of the research methodology used in this study the research population of the first phase was composed of the officials and staff of the provincial water resources management institutions out of whom some key informants were sampled by semi structured interview stakeholder list and snowball methods then to identify the stakeholders they were asked some questions like which individuals or institutions do you think are involved in grm in the agricultural sector of the study area which institutions are involved in the planning and decision making processes for gr what are the most well known institutions in this field as such based on the answers provided 25 institutions including 18 public institutions 3 private institutions and 4 civil societies were identified as institutions involved in grm in the agricultural sector of the study area table 2 it should be noted that each institution has been represented by an indicator in the research it is noteworthy that grm should be performed with the cooperation of diverse and multi level institutions alongside the key users since it is a costly and long term process de loë and lukovich 2004 it is technical de loë and kreutzwiser 2005 and it happens in a social ivey et al 2006 and economic context after the relevant stakeholders 25 entities were identified in the first phase using the purposive sampling technique each of the stakeholders was asked to propose their main actors based on their familiarity with grm programs or their participation in groundwater related activities and their interest in collaborating in the study in the second phase the participants were asked to determine the level of trust information exchange and interaction of their institution with any of the institutions involved in grm it should be noted that among the institutions identified the judiciary did not accept to participate in the survey so it was excluded from the responding institutions in the second phase data in this phase were collected with a questionnaire table 3 as such the level of trust information exchange and interactions expressed by each interviewee were used to create a social network map of the institutions the demographic characteristics of the actors who participated in this phase can be summarized as follows all participants 24 people were male their mean age was 43 63 years with a standard deviation sd minimum and maximum of 7 18 34 and 62 respectively the frequency distribution of the participants based on their work experience showed that the mean value was 16 83 years with an sd of 7 15 the minimum work experience was 2 years and the maximum was 32 years according to the frequency distribution of the participants based on the status of their participation in projects related to grm most participants 75 had participated in projects related to grm also the majority of them 83 3 stated that they had participated in training programs related to grm it should be mentioned about how different sna indices were calculated that the ucinet software package was used to understand describe and examine a wide range of network attributes and graphically display the information caniato et al 2014 prell et al 2009 ucinet is a famous statistical software suite for sna which is widely used in this field caniato et al 2014 it is available online and can be accessed by interested readers schröpfer et al 2017 ucinet is characterized by the ease of use extensiveness and diversity of analysis options badi et al 2017 and the capability of formulating sna molano and polo 2015 indeed with this software sna criteria can be calculated as numerical values omondiagbe et al 2017 in other words ucinet can be employed to determine the numerical values of network analysis including network density reciprocity transitivity analysis of core periphery actors centrality and so on molano and polo 2015 omondiagbe et al 2017 finally netdraw software was used to convert mathematical values of data into network graphs bae et al 2015 to calculate the indices in ucinet and generate network graphs in netdraw data were first retrieved as a matrix in ucinet for which the variables in the questionnaire which were coded were converted to 0 1 for analysis schneider et al 2003 so the main variables trust information exchange and institutional interactions which were coded from 0 to 6 were converted into 0 1 for analysis indeed a binary network matrix was generated that showed the presence or absence of ties between the institutions the matrix components were the institutions involved in grm as identified by the participants 24 institutions the generated matrix was symmetrical in that all ties between the nodes were considered undirected and the relationships between each pair of stakeholder institutions were supposed to be equal therefore in this study the data were finally analyzed with ucinet 6 software and its visualization was developed with netdraw software the indicators used to examine the network of trust information exchange and inter institutional interactions in the research included network density reciprocity transitivity analysis of core periphery actors and centrality in degree and out degree centrality betweenness centrality and eigenvalue centrality table 4 4 results social networks can be studied at several levels wasserman and faust 1994 in this respect researchers fredericks and durland 2005 wasserman and faust 1994 argue that sna indices can be divided into indices that describe network structure the whole network is assumed as the analysis unit and indices that specify nodes or actors the individuals nodes are the analysis unit among the indices studied here network density reciprocity and transitivity describe network structure and centrality periphery actors analysis and various centrality indices describe nodes or actors fredericks and durland 2005 to calculate these indices a matrix that described the ties of different actors was formed by ucinet and its representation was converted into sociograms by netdraw such a knowledge map provides more insights into the networks of trust interactions and information exchange among institutions accordingly the results section was so organized that first the network structure describing indices including network density reciprocity and transitivity of ties table 5 and then the actors describing indices were analyzed for the networks of trust interactions and information exchange it is noteworthy that the indices were simultaneously examined for all three networks to allow the comparison of the networks 4 1 density density is the ratio of the existing relational ties to the total relational ties cvitanovic et al 2017 and shows network solidarity barsing et al 2018 in this study network density was measured as the percentage of all possible ties that are actually present the mean network density was estimated at 40 22 26 27 and 34 42 for the networks of trust interactions and information exchange respectively these figures mean that all institutions are not linked and the number of inter institutional ties is lower than the possible number of ties in the network for which the network asymmetry can be implicated in fact these density values of these networks imply that most nodes are dispersed and marginalized and just a few are located around the center whereas a network is integrated when all its actors are connected to one another 4 2 reciprocity of ties reciprocity is a criterion to understand the relations and links between the actors of a network varone et al 2017 this index describes the individual s interrelationships alhajj and rokne 2014 and the stability of the network the lower this index is the lower the network solidarity will be omondiagbe et al 2017 based on the results the reciprocity of ties was 32 14 percent for the network of inter institutional trust 27 19 for the network of inter institutional interactions and 31 03 for the network of information exchange according to this index it can be said that the mutuality of relationships within the network is at a very low level in other words the low level of reciprocity in the networks of inter institutional trust interactions and information exchange indicates weak mutual trust low mutual interactions and poor information exchange between institutions which reflects the fragility and vulnerability of these networks so the networks are poorly stable and the institutions do not form an integrated network 4 3 transitivity of ties this index is rooted in the shared ties of three individuals in which one acts as a bridge between the other two as with the reciprocity of ties this index reflects the network solidarity and stability basati et al 2020 varone et al 2017 based on the results this index was estimated at 61 40 1 and 54 6 percent for the networks of trust interactions and information exchange respectively this indicates the low stability of the network of interactions the medium stability of the network of information exchange and the increasing stability of the network of inter institutional trust in the meantime triple relationships and the presence of individuals that transmit these ties will increase the number of ties established among the institutions in the networks of trust interactions and information exchange leading to network stability and subsequently its resilience 4 4 core periphery actors figs 3 5 depict the analysis of core periphery actors this index divides the actors into two categories of core and periphery actors yamaki 2017 core actors include densely interconnected ties lienert et al 2013 and periphery actors are composed of ties that are only connected to the core loosely ernstson et al 2008 therefore the core nodes are not well connected to the periphery nodes and the network looks like a star lienert et al 2013 in figs 3 5 the pink nodes represent the core institutions and the blue nodes represent the periphery institutions this index reveals the key institutions in the inter institutional networks of trust interactions and information exchange institutions that can ensure network solidarity and stability owing to their strong ties it should be noted that the core periphery index is measured in ucinet with a fit function that operationalizes the correlation between the matrix of effective and permuted data and the ideal core periphery function lienert et al 2013 according to this index the institutions identified as the core entities in the network of inter institutional trust include regional water company forests range and watershed management organization agricultural extension coordination management department of agriculture organization water soil management department of agriculture organization agricultural research education and extension organization province governorate law enforcement force relevant universities agriculture bank water users association and groundwater consulting companies this means that these institutions are the key members of the inter institutional trust network and can build strong ties based on mutual trust thus they can lead to the solidarity and stability of the inter institutional trust network these institutions are all public entities except for one private entity groundwater consulting companies and one civil entity water users associations a look at these institutions shows that local institutions such as rural councils and rural municipality that have direct interaction with the stakeholders are on the periphery in addition private sector technical institutions like drilling companies are marginalized which can adversely affect technical efficiency and consequently sound productivity of the resources the core institutions in the network of inter institutional interactions include regional water company forests range and watershed management organization department of environment agricultural extension coordination management department of agriculture organization water soil management department of agriculture organization agricultural research education and extension organization province governorate rural municipality law enforcement force and water users association indeed these institutions are the key members of this network and can establish strong ties with one another thereby resulting in the solidarity and stability of this network these core entities are all public institutions except for two entities rural municipality and water users association that are civil institutions also private institution including the technical institutions of drilling companies and suppliers of well and irrigation equipment which can play a key role in providing services and logistics were not included in core interactions however technical private institutions of drilling companies and supplier of well and irrigation equipment which can play a key role in supplying logistic services improving technical performance and providing consulting services to public and civil institutions have no proper and central interactions the core institutions in the network of information exchange which had established strong ties for information exchange were identified to be regional water company water soil management department of agriculture organization forests range and watershed management organization agricultural extension coordination management department of agriculture organization agricultural research education and extension organization province governorate relevant universities water users association and groundwater consulting companies these institutions can be a source of solidarity and stability in the network of information exchange based on the results most core institutions are public and only water users association is a civic institution and groundwater consulting companies are private institutions thus local institutions e g rural councils and rural municipality are not involved in information exchange the lack of active role of local institutions in grm can induce knowledge and information bias in central public and even private institutions whereas the civil sector and local community may be the central axis of this management 4 5 centrality figs 6 8 display the centrality index in these graphs colored nodes represent different institutions and their relationship is shown with lines the node size represents the influence of the respective institution and the similar colors represent the same power of the respective institutions it can be inferred from the graphs that the links of trust interactions and information exchange are influenced and controlled by a limited number of institutions in other words these institutions had the most links with other institutions in the network the institutions that gained higher scores in the network of inter institutional trust included water soil management department of agriculture organization agricultural research education and extension organization and regional water company this means that these institutions which are part of public institutions had the most links with other institutions in the inter institutional trust network and local and non governmental institutions are not in a good position fig 6 the low level of trust in local and private institutions in this network may lead to ignoring their potential for cooperation in grm according to fig 7 the most important actor involved in grm which has high power in the network of inter institutional interactions is regional water company followed by water soil management department of agriculture organization rural municipality forests range and watershed management organization and agricultural research education and extension organization these institutions which are part of public institutions had the most ties with other institutions in the network of inter institutional interactions based on the results civil society and private institutions especially technical institutions are farther from the core despite the significance of their knowledge and expertise which can increase expectations from public institutions regarding intervening instead of facilitating finally leading to the governmentalization of grm according to fig 8 water soil management department of agriculture organization in the first rank and regional water company agricultural extension coordination management department of agriculture organization and province governorate which are part of public institutions were identified as institutions with high centrality in the network of inter institutional information exchange so that they had the highest number of information exchange ties with other institutions according to these results civil society and private institutions including technical institutions of groundwater consulting companies drilling companies and suppliers of well and irrigation equipment were not among the institutions considered as information exchangers if non governmental institutions especially technical institutions play no role the management programs may be biased and unrealistic and it is most likely that they enter a blind cycle with no adequate knowledge and information about technical facts and the target community 4 6 in degree and out degree centralities the high in degree and out degree centralities of the networks of inter institutional trust information exchange and interactions reveal that the ties of trust interactions and information exchange are restricted to limited institutions indeed a wide range of institutions are not involved in grm decisions in lorestan province and these decisions depend on the core actors therefore the ties of trust interactions and information exchange also belong to the core institutions and are not performed by almost all institutions involved in grm in this province this means that a high degree centrality will enable a limited number of core actors to receive and disseminate different links on the contrary a low degree centrality means that all institutions in the network have equal power in degree centrality is the number of ties received by an actor basati et al 2020 as is observed in table 6 water soil management department of agriculture organization and agricultural research education and extension organization have the highest in degree centrality in the network of inter institutional trust the entities with the highest in degree centrality in the network of inter institutional interactions are water soil management department of agriculture organization and rural municipality in the network of inter institutional information exchange water soil management department of agriculture organization has the highest in degree centrality this means that this institution is host to a lot of participatory ties and referrals from other institutions of the network however department of environment in the network of inter institutional trust and rural water wastewater company in the network of information exchange are in the lowest rank among the actors in terms of trust and information exchange which is not a desirable finding in addition table 6 shows that relevant universities and agriculture bank in the network of inter institutional interactions have in degree centrality scores of 0 implying that no institution is in interaction with them out degree centrality is the number of ties leaving an actor which is an index of the actor s effectiveness basati et al 2020 in this regard a stronger node is the individual that has been recognized as to be desirable by other actors molano and polo 2015 so it is regarded as the key actor in social influence and establishes most ties with other actors basati et al 2020 as is observed in table 6 regional water company had the highest out degree centrality in all three networks this means that this entity has many ties with other entities based on trust it also has the most interaction ties with other stakeholder institutions additionally it has many information ties with other institutions in the network of information exchange 4 7 betweenness centrality betweenness centrality shows how many times a node acts as a bridge in the shortest distance between two other nodes dotsika and watkins 2017 these nodes are stakeholders through which individuals connect to other network members molano and polo 2015 in other words they can change other stakeholders gan et al 2018 and inhibit or facilitate connections between nodes giurca and metz 2018 the betweenness centrality index is shown in table 6 according to the results the highest betweenness centrality belonged to regional water company in the networks of inter institutional trust and interactions and to water soil management department of agriculture organization and agricultural extension coordination management department of agriculture organization in the network of inter institutional information exchange these institutions are the most important institutions with a strong mediating role playing the role of bridge among different institutions in the networks of inter institutional trust interactions and information exchange 4 8 eigenvector centrality eigenvector centrality is an index of centrality ghafoori kharanagh et al 2020 that supplements betweenness centrality in identifying key stakeholders mbaru and barnes 2017 this index provides a wider understanding of the network ghafoori kharanagh et al 2020 and gives a more precise image of a system s capability to cooperate within the whole system enos and nilchiani 2017 eigenvector centrality is a criterion for the significance of a node in a network that is based on the ties of other nodes i e ties to other well connected individuals bokhove 2018 indeed this index shows ties between an actor and the strong actors of the network ghafoori kharanagh et al 2020 the results of eigenvector centrality are shown in table 6 based on the results the highest eigenvector centrality was obtained by water soil management department of agriculture organization agricultural research education and extension organization and regional water company in the network of inter institutional trust regional water company rural municipality and water soil management department of agriculture organization in the network of inter institutional interactions and water soil management department of agriculture organization regional water company agricultural extension coordination management department of agriculture organization and province governorate in the network of inter institutional information exchange this indicates that based on high trust these institutions can develop most ties with the institutions with high centrality they also have the highest level of information exchange with the other institutions with high centrality and could use their capacity to solve the issues of grm summary of results table 7 summarizes the results of the sna application to assess the social capital of the institutions involved in grm in lorestan province according to the results the network describing indices show a poor level of solidarity and stability of the networks of inter institutional trust interaction and information exchange this means that institutions act independently in other words the social capital is low among the institutions involved in grm on the other hand the indices describing the actors show that grm decisions in lorestan province are not made by a wide range of public private and civil institutions but by a few core actors based on the results most central and important institutions involved in grm in the agricultural sector of lorestan province are public especially institutions a and f whereas some institutions that can play a good role in sustainable and participatory management of gr are not unfortunately in a good position so that ngos and local institutions that can inherently manage gr sustainability are at the lowest levels except for institution k or regarding institution s although it was identified as a central institution based on the core periphery index it has no good place based on other sna indices it is also evident that although there are a few private institutions in the studied population these limited institutions are marginalized for example institution v does not have a good position in the networks of inter institutional trust interactions and information exchange despite the fact that it is a central institution based on the core periphery index 5 discussion and conclusion given the gr crisis in lorestan province and the involvement of various institutions in the management of these resources researchers are paying increasing attention to the study of the links between institutions involved in grm in this province as the main stakeholders of gr this research analyzed social capital among the institutions involved in grm in lorestan province using sna to establish participatory management of water resources the focus was put on three networks of trust interactions and information exchange which are the key social capital components and the essential factors in the successful participatory management of groundwater resources in this province in this research the steps of grm management and governance analysis typically conform to the definition of the sna method the analysis of gr governance structure based on the sna method means that i all institutions involved in grm should be identified ii interaction ties between the institutions should be identified and iii these ties interactions should be drawn to show the significance of the interactions and the relative weight of the interconnected actors in our case study these steps have been considered in the study and analysis of the structure of water management and governance it is worth noting that although the research was developed and tested using empirical social network data in lorestan province its results can help identify the existing social structure and intervention points for reinforcing gr governance the results showed that despite the complicated multi dimensional and multi level nature of grm network and the need for the cooperation of different institutions in the nature mission and structure dimensions the civil and private institutions are not in a good position in the networks of inter institutional trust interactions and information exchange at both macro and local levels in the study site so that they play a marginal role while the main authority belongs to public institutions this may be associated with the fact that water is a public commodity in iran and the government is generally responsible for its management mirzaei et al 2020 however some researchers have acknowledged that water governance should not be limited only to public institutions and other actors should be involved so that they can contribute to solving the issues of water resources actively and constructively ghafoori kharanagh et al 2020 therefore since the most important users of these resources are the rural communities non governmental local organizations have the highest level of trust interactions and information exchange with these users as a result the trivial role of these institutions in information exchange and interactions can reduce the likelihood of local users and stakeholders participation in grm nonetheless non governmental local institutions like rural councils water users associations and provincial ngos are the key individuals and leaders in promoting and facilitating collective action of the users for gr management since they are representatives of the users these entities can mitigate the gr issues by cooperating mediating and negotiating in the community and settle local conflicts by traditional rules and norms derived from moral social and religious values on the other hand rural municipalities among the local non governmental institutions can play a more important role in gr management than other non governmental institutions rural councils water users associations and provincial ngos owing to their legal authorities in general considering the complexity of the network this may be caused by a series of extra institutional or intra institutional factors the weak role of civil institutions such as rural municipalities rural councils water users associations and provincial ngos is related to the fact that public institutions do not trust these institutions and the governance system is government centered and incompetent also the fact that the private sector has no role in exchanges interactions and trust may be associated with the lack of historical experience and the context for private activities and businesses as well as the incomplete privatization and the fact that the delegation and decentralization process has not been institutionalized in addition to these extra institutional complications the inability of private and civil institutions to play an effective role may be related to intra institutional factors examples include the facts that people s participation in public and environmental affairs is not institutionalized individualism dominates collectivism due to resource limitations there is no historical experience of interaction between civil institutions and public institutions and some civil institutions are infant and copied with no attention to traditional cooperation of society also the passivism of private institutions may be related to the lack of a private sector that has high technical and knowledge capacity the lack of mechanisms for the interaction of private public and civil institutions the competition of the public sector with these institutions that hinders their maturity and development the lack of public sector s trust in the culture and entrepreneurship and private sector and the fact that private sector institutions are infant and limited in number according to what was said although the nature of water resources as a public commodity implies that government must take the overall responsibility for water management in iran it is necessary to strengthen the role of the private sector and social institutions due to the nature of this commodity and the limited ability of the government as such a balance can be made in the roles that the institutions involved in the grm network play in the meantime it looks necessary to revise the current policy and strategies of water resources management in iran for this purpose it is recommended to build a shared committee composed of decision making executive and supervising institutions at the national level and provincial level in a hierarchy to change strategic policies and development approaches to developing the private sector by facilitating establishment increasing authorities and providing financial logistic and educational supports furthermore given the low authority of civil institutions and their direct interaction with the user community it seems necessary to have a look at the history of traditional cooperation and people s native technologies in grm in creating and empowering local institutions that are active in local communities and using non governmental and community centered institutions that are composed of the youth women and main users in this regard educational institutions for example agricultural extension coordination management department of agriculture organization agricultural research education and extension organization and forests range and watershed management organization can play an effective role in facilitating and guiding the establishment and dynamism of local institutions credit authorship contribution statement fatemeh rahimi feyzabad conceptualization methodology software

2973,northwest china has experienced a warming wetting climate featured by increasing temperature and precipitation during the past six decades recent studies suggested that the climate may have shifted from wetting to drying after the 1990s if changes in energy supply were considered however how the change in energy supply affects the dryness remains unclear in this study we quantified the dryness in northwest china based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei which considers the impact of potential evapotranspiration estimated by the penman monteith equation on dryness during 1961 2018 then the contributions of changes in meteorological variables precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed and net radiation to the dryness changes were estimated using a detrending technique the results indicated that northwest china experienced a wetting period 1961 1989 and then a drying period 1989 2018 during 1961 1989 increased precipitation and slowed wind were the main drivers of the wetting trend during 1989 2018 although the increased precipitation and decline in solar radiation favored a wetting condition warmer temperature drier air decrease in relative humidity together with rebounded wind speed offset the wetting trend and resulted in significantly increasing dryness in northwest china the dryness would further increase if current climate trends continue in the future which may have important implications for water management in northwest china keywords northwest china driving factors wetting trend land dryness potential evapotranspiration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global climate change has modified the intensities and distributions of precipitation and evapotranspiration at global and regional scales li et al 2017 li and liu 2020 wentz et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 the modification will change dry wet conditions and hence have profound effects on regional water resources agriculture and the environment brookshire and weaver 2015 piao et al 2010 generally the dry get drier wet gets wetter is a typical paradigm of global dry wet variabilities under climate change and it has been well observed on the ocean allan et al 2010 although the dry get drier wet gets wetter is mostly valid on the ocean there is only about 10 8 of global land area meets this paradigm while about 9 5 of global land area showed the opposite paradigm feng and zhang 2015 greve et al 2014 such as central asia north africa and the middle east tabari and willems 2018 yang et al 2019a these studies show that there are large spatial heterogeneities in the changes of dry wet conditions on the land northwest china located in the hinterland of the eurasian continent is a typical arid and semi arid area with a sensitive and fragile ecosystem gao et al 2018 vicente serrano et al 2013 observation data shows that the precipitation in northwest china increases at a rate of 0 55 mm year during 1960 2013 yang et al 2017 and temperature increases in northwest china at a rate of 0 034 year higher than the trends over the entire china 0 025 year and the globe 0 013 year during 1960 2010 li et al 2012 yang et al 2017 due to the observed increase in precipitation runoff and lake water level the trend of warming wetting in northwest china had been reported peng and zhou 2017 shi et al 2002 yao et al 2021 certainly the regional water cycle will accelerate under climate change with the increase in precipitation but also evapotranspiration due to the rising temperature mishra and singh 2010 previous studies often focused on the increase of precipitation due to moisture flux change firstly when discussing the change of dry wet condition in northwest china peng and zhou 2017 and then suggested that northwest china was getting wet hu et al 2019 wang et al 2017 yuan et al 2017 however the water supply precipitation is not the sole controlling factor yang et al 2019b the effect of energy supply namely the potential evapotranspiration pet also plays an important role in the variability of dryness xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2020a the effect of pet on dryness variability has become prominent in china since the 1980s park et al 2017 xu et al 2021 in northwest china most meteorological variables particularly the wind speed and temperature experienced dramatic changes in 1990s yao et al 2020a these changes have resulted in the increase in pet li et al 2014 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2022 and are likely to cause northwest china getting dry again aggravated drought and decline in soil moisture in northwest china were mainly controlled by changes in evaporative demand yao et al 2022 a recent case study in the bosten lake basin located in northwest china has also noticed drying trends since 1980s yang et al 2020a and provided evidence for possible drying trends after 1990 however for the whole northwest china only few studies have focused on the risk of becoming dry assessing the change of dry wet condition based on different indicators may lead to inconsistent conclusions numerous indicators have been developed to analyze the changing trend recently the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 and spei vicente serrano et al 2010 are common indicators that are used to analyze the change of dry wet condition in northwest china the wetting trends with increasing precipitation are likely to weaken or vanish due to the increasing evapotranspiration caused by warming dai 2011 dai 2013 imbalanced in warming and wetting indicated regional differences in increased precipitation and increased temperature wang et al 2020 therefore spei which takes account of the relationship between water supply and energy supply was suitable to describe the change of dry wet condition in northwest china in addition to precipitation and temperature other meteorological variables can affect dryness variabilities by changing pet such as relative humidity wind speed and net radiation zhao et al 2021 to quantitatively explore the impact of meteorological variables on dry wet condition variabilities hu et al 2019 considered precipitation and pet as major drivers using spei by correlation coefficient in northwest china furthermore xu et al 2021 emphasized the drying trends after the 1990s and quantified contributions of precipitation and pet to the change in spei however the complex pet changes due to dramatic changes in meteorological variables in northwest china were ignored and using pet as an integrated index may overshadow the mechanism of internal factors this study aims to quantify the variabilities of dryness and their driving factors in northwest china the dryness in this study will be estimated by considering both water and energy supplies considering data availability and the change point revealed in previous studies the research period was divided into two time periods 1961 1989 and 1989 2018 to assess the existence of drying trends resulted from dramatic changed climate in the recent three decades therefore we designed a series of numerical experiments based on spei to investigate 1 whether the change in energy supply results in significant drying trends in recent three decades and if so where are these drying trends and 2 contributions of different meteorological variables to the changes in spei in northwest china our study can help understand the dryness variabilities and their driving factors in northwest china and provide a basis for future regional management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the study area is northwest china 31 6 49 2 n 73 5 111 2 e including the xinjiang qinghai gansu ningxia and shaanxi provinces fig 1 northwest china is a typical continental climate and the mean annual precipitation is 250 mm deng et al 2014 climate subtypes are also shown in fig 1 which are defined by aridity index ai the ratio of precipitation to pet ranges hyper arid ai 0 05 arid 0 05 ai 0 2 semi arid 0 2 ai 0 5 dry sub humid 0 5 ai 0 65 and humid ai greater than 0 65 huang et al 2016 yao et al 2020b as for climate research has shown a warming wetting trend in northwest china during the period 1961 2010 leading to melting of glaciers an increase of river runoff and water level rise of inland lakes shi et al 2014 shi et al 2007 yang et al 2021 the meteorological data were obtained from the china meteorological data service centre of china meteorological administration http data cma cn this dataset contains monthly precipitation mean temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine duration from 1961 to 2018 these data were developed from 2416 meteorological stations in china and interpolated by methodology anomaly approach to the grid of 0 25 0 25 wu and gao 2013 zhou et al 2016 2 2 calculating spei considering possible effect of drying from increasing evapotranspiration weakens or vanishes the effect of wetting from increasing precipitation spei was selected to describe the variabilities of dryness in northwest china the method for estimating of pet is essential to calculating the spei and several equations are devoted to evaluating pet such as hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 thornthwaite equation thornthwaite 1948 and penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the penman monteith equation considering energy balance and aerodynamics theory performs well both globally and in china especially in northwest china almorox et al 2018 chen et al 2005 the penman monteith equation was selected here as eq 1 allen et al 1998 1 pet 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where pet is potential evapotranspiration m m d a y r n is the net radiation mj m 2 d a y g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 d a y γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature curve kpa c t is the average daily air temperature c u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s e s is the actual vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa and e s e a is the vapor pressure deficit kpa the spei at 12 month time scale namely spei 12 was used to describe annual variabilities of dryness a decrease of spei means an increase of dryness and an increase of spei means a decrease of dryness in order to calculate spei 12 precipitation and the difference between precipitation and pet need to be accumulated in 12 months these accumulated values are fitted to the candidate probability distribution from which probabilities are transformed to the standard normal distribution the generalized extreme value distribution is recommended as a candidate probability distribution in spei stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2010 2 3 statistical analysis and study periods mann kendall test kendall 1948 mann 1945 is a non parametric statistical method used widely for detecting the significance of trends in meteorological time series mallick et al 2021 in this study the significance level α 0 05 was selected to determine whether meteorological variables have changed significantly during different periods meanwhile mann kendall mk test was used to determine the changing trends of spei time series during 1961 1989 and 1989 2018 sen s slope sen 1968 is a non parametric procedure for estimating the slope of trend it is a robust estimate of the magnitude in a trend yue et al 2002 and has been used in meteorological time series gocic and trajkovic 2013 theil sen s slope is given as 2 β m e d i a n x i x j t i t j where x i and x j are data values at times t i and t j i j respectively in this study sen s slope was used to calculate the rate of spei change during different periods and quantify the contributions of meteorological variables to the changes in spei in section 2 4 2 4 a detrending technique to attribute contributions of driving factors to disentangle different effects and quantify the contributions of different meteorological factors on the variabilities of dryness we applied a detrending mao et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 technique to eliminate the trend signals this approach forms new detrended meteorological times series specifically for the period of 1961 2018 the variable x series from january 1961 to december 2018 was divided into 12 groups as shown in the square matrix x 1 1961 x 2 1961 x 12 1961 x 1 1962 x 2 1962 x 12 1962 x 1 2018 x 2 2018 x 12 2018 and each column in the matrix was considered as a group the detrending technique was applied to temperature relative humidity wind speed and net radiation through equation 3 but for precipitation arid regions are prone to have no precipitation for multiple consecutive months in order to avoid unphysical results the detrending of precipitation referred to equation 4 and equation 5 the same approach was applied to the periods of 1961 1989 and 1989 2018 3 f m d e t r

data in year i although keeping one variable unchanged while detrending the other variables may change the dependencies of variables it provides an approach to disentangle effects of different variables at the fixed time zhang et al 2016 we designed six numerical experiments the base case use detrended data for all variables the precipitation only case means all variables except the precipitation are detrended the same rule is also applied to temperature only case relative humidity only case wind speed only case and net radiation only case the relative contribution rates r cr were defined as equation 6 6 rcr i t i t base t i t base 100 where the rcr i is the relative contribution rates in case i the t i is the sen s slope of spei series in case i 3 results 3 1 changes in meteorological conditions the changes in annual precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed net radiation and pet are shown in fig 2 a f as for the whole northwest china the average annual precipitation is 258 m m and shows a significant increasing trend 0 76 m m y e a r p 0 01 during 1961 2018 and the increasing trends are observed in both periods 0 89 m m y e a r during 1961 1989 and 1 59 m m y e a r during 1989 2018 temperature shows a rapidly and significantly increasing trend 0 031 c y e a r p 0 01 and this rapid increase is particularly notable in the period of 1989 2018 0 011 c y e a r during 1961 1989 while 0 039 c y e a r during 1989 2018 the average relative humidity wind speed and net radiation are 50 3 2 m s and 7 6 m j m 2 d a y respectively which are consistent with previous results from yang et al 2019b there is no significant change in relative humidity before 1989 but it has declined rapidly during 1989 2018 0 197 y e a r the wind speed has decreased significantly throughout the entire period it is worth noting that opposite trends were detected in the period of 1961 1989 0 014 m s y e a r and 1989 2018 0 008 m s y e a r the wind speed decreased first and increased then pet is an important variable for calculating spei and the result from penman monteith shows that the average annual pet is 930 m m over northwest china annual pet has increased slightly by 0 35 m m y e a r p 0 01 a rapid increase of pet 3 30 m m y e a r p 0 01 during 1989 2018 is likely to lead to drying trends fig 2f the spatial distributions of mean annual values of meteorological variables are shown in fig 2 g l precipitation decreases gradually from southeast to northwest the distribution of temperature is related to elevation temperatures are high in the basin and low in the plateau area with low relative humidity is mainly in the central northwest china western and eastern northwest china generally have high relative humidity wind speed is high in the middle and low in the eastern and western parts area with high net radiation is in the south while are with low net radiation is in the north pet is high in the center and low in the south and north 3 2 spei changes in northwest china the changes in spei over the whole northwest china are shown in fig 3 during the whole period of 1961 2018 spei increased by 0 0114 y e a r p 0 05 indicating northwest china was getting wet however spei firstly shows a wetting trend during 1961 1989 0 0446 y e a r p 0 05 then a drying trend during 1989 2018 0 0416 y e a r p 0 05 this means northwest china was getting dry instead of wet in the recent three decades the spatial distributions of spei trends at pixel scale during different periods are shown in fig 4 during 1961 2018 there are 66 4 of which 65 2 are statistically significant of northwest china are getting wet but 33 6 of which 14 2 are statistically significant are getting dry western and central northwest china are getting wet while southwestern northern and eastern northwest china are getting dry fig 4 during 1961 1989 the whole northwest china was getting wet fig 4b more than 80 of areas show significant wetting trends especially in western and central northwest china a wetting trend was observed at a quite rapid rate to further examine whether the northwest has become dry again in the recent three decades the spatial distributions of spei trends at pixel scale during 1989 2018 are shown in fig 4c the result shows drying trends appeared in 64 2 of which 39 9 are statistically significant of northwest china especially in western northwest china abrupt and quick shifts from wetting to drying were identified more droughts may occur in northwest china 3 3 contributions of different factors to spei changes the transition from drying to wetting during the whole period was identified between 1961 and 2018 two distinguished transitions drying to wetting during 1961 1989 and wetting to drying during 1989 2018 were found by spei analysis numerical experiments based on detrending technique were used to understand these transitions of dry wet conditions and quantify effects of driving factors on spei changes the differences between trends of specific cases such as precipitation only case and trend of base case are the contributions of corresponding variables to spei change the contributions of meteorological variables to spei changes over the whole northwest china in different periods are given in fig 5 for the entire period the changes in precipitation wind speed and net radiation make northwest china wet while the changes in temperature and relative humidity make it dry combining the trends of variables in fig 2 the spei changes were positively related to the changes of precipitation and relative humidity but negative to temperature wind speed and net radiation temperature was the variable that dominants the changes of spei the increase of temperature by 0 031 c y e a r made spei decline by 0 0282 y e a r precipitation and wind speed were the main reasons making northwest china wet the increase of precipitation by 0 76 m m y e a r and the decline of wind speed by 0 011 m s y e a r made spei increase by 0 0196 y e a r and 0 0183 y e a r respectively the aggregated contributions of different factors were positive and agreed northwest china getting wet as well it should be noted that wind speed played an equally important role as precipitation in the transition from dry to wet in northwest china consequently the effects of precipitation and wind speed offset the drying trend caused by temperature rise so the transition from dry to wet occurred during 1961 1989 effects of precipitation and wind speed led to a wetting trend in northwest china leading to the transition from dry to wet during this period during 1989 2018 drying effects of relative humidity and temperature became paramount and exceeded the wetting effect of precipitation causing the transition from wet to dry in this period a more rapid rise in temperature 0 039 c y e a r and a significant drop in relative humidity 0 20 y e a r resulted in a drying trend again in order to reveal the contributions of meteorological variables to spei changes at pixel scale spatial distributions of r cr are given in fig 6 a and the proportions in different r cr ranges are given in fig 6 b the absolute value of r cr represents the relative importance and the symbol represents the direction of the trend wetting or drying the range of r cr of pr is between 65 0 and 81 1 increased precipitation leads to a wetting trend in 83 of area especially in the central and somewhere in eastern northwest china the average r cr of pr is 43 8 which makes great contributions on drying trends the r cr of tm are always negative meaning all regions get dry due to the changes in temperature the strongest drying contributions appear in the southern part the range of r cr of rh is between 60 1 and 30 7 and more drying trends due to the changes of rh although there are about 30 of regions get wet due to the changes of rh the relative contributions are not obvious the changes in wind speed play an important role in getting wet in western northwest china and getting dry in northern northwest china the absolute values of r cr of rn are below 30 in most regions implying rn has small effects on spei changes the dominant factors defined as the variable with the largest absolute value among pr tm rh win and rn at pixel scale are shown in fig 6 c the area dominated by temperature to spei changes is the largest followed by wind speed precipitation relative humidity only few regions are dominated by net radiation the dominant factors in fig 6 c can be used to explain the spei trends in fig 4 b and help understand the mechanism underpinning spei change the wetting trends are led by wind speed in western northwest china and precipitation in central northwest china the drying trends are led by temperature in southern northwest china and relative humidity in northern northwest china the reasons of drying in eastern northwest china are complex in eastern northwest china one part getting dry is mainly caused by the rise of temperature and the other part is caused by the decline of precipitation it can be concluded that there are obvious regional differences in the dominant factors to spei changes to explain drying trends in northwest china in the last three decades relative contributions of different variables to spei changes during 1989 2018 are given in fig 7 large scale negative contributions of relative humidity and temperature in fig 7 a and b indicate that the decrease in relative humidity and rise in temperature cause drying trends in northwest china the spatial distributions and proportions of r cr in precipitation and temperature during 1989 2018 are similar to the results during 1961 2018 but the contributions of relative humidity and wind speed present large differences the entire western northwest china showed serious drying trends due to the significant decline in relative humidity the recoveries of wind speed indicated wider and more serious drying effects in northern northwest china the dominant factors during 1989 2018 are given in fig 7 c the changes of spei in most areas were dominated by relative humidity 33 5 and precipitation 32 9 although many areas were still dominated by the wetting effect of increased precipitation drying trends caused by relative humidity temperature and wind speed have far exceeded the wetting trends of precipitation 4 discussion under global warming the assessments of change in dry wet conditions are complex because of the changes of intensities and distributions in hydro meteorological variables the regional differences are so evident that the traditional paradigm of dry gets drier wet gets wetter can no longer describe the changes in dry wet condition in different regions in our study spei was used to describe the variabilities of dry wet conditions in typical arid and semi arid area northwest china different from the above paradigm northwest china was getting wet based on spei during 1961 2018 which is consistent with warming wetting trend claimed in many previous studies however the latest studies showed a high probability of drying trends in northwest china in the recent three decades an abrupt shift of pet from decrease to increase happened in the 1990s liu and zhang 2013 wang et al 2019 xing et al 2016 which has increased the evaporative demand and led to a drying trend in northwest china increased pet can easily cause warming induced drying dai 2013 which is likely to weaken or reverse the wetting trend of increased precipitation our results confirmed this hypothesis and there were significant and quick drying trends during 1989 2018 the decline of terrestrial water storage based on the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mo et al 2016 xiong et al 2021 yi et al 2016 confirms the conclusion of increase in land dryness soil moisture reflects land dryness and the variability in soil moisture is strongly controlled by the variability in pet berg et al 2017 mcmillan and srinivasan 2015 an observed sharp decrease in soil moisture since the mid 1990s was associated with increasing pet han et al 2018 yao et al 2018 which supports that evaporative demand results in land dryness to disentangle different effects of meteorological factors with dramatic changes detrending was used to quantify their respective contributions to the drying trend our results showed the changes in precipitation and wind speed led to wetting trends during 1961 2018 but the changes in relative humidity and temperature led to drying trends during 1989 2018 the similar pattern is also found in iran and europe nouri and bannayan 2019 claimed drying trends dominated by precipitation and wind speed in iran stagge et al 2017 claimed increases in temperature and pet have increased drying in southern europe and counteracted wetting in northern europe the uncertainty of results came from two aspects inhomogeneities in meteorological data and limitations of the penman monteith equation meteorological data was collected from more than 2000 stations in china wu and gao 2013 which is more than 323 stations harris et al 2014 peng et al 2019 and 751 stations xu et al 2009 the density of stations in eastern china is quite dense while relatively sparse in northwest china thus the uncertainty of northwest china is larger than that in eastern china peng and zhou 2017 zhou et al 2016 the areas in desert hinterland and western qinghai showed greater uncertainty in this study wu and gao 2013 inhomogeneities due to non climatic shifts like station relocations li et al 2020 instrument changes bertrand et al 2021 zhang and wang 2020 and urbanization jiang et al 2020 can adversely affect the assessment and attribution of climate change zhang et al 2020b station relocation is the primary cause for the inhomogeneities of meteorological series and there are 1834 stations relocated at least once until 2011 cao et al 2016 another source of uncertainty is the penman monteith equation the drying bias due to neglecting the impact of increasing atmospheric co2 concentration has been reported recently lemordant et al 2018 yang et al 2020b in the future when atmospheric co2 concentration continues to increase it is necessary to estimate pet considering atmospheric co2 concentration yang et al 2019c intelligibly changes in precipitation and temperature are important drivers of changing dry wet condition but the effect of wind speed is non negligible liu et al 2014 for the whole northwest china wind speed plays an equally important role as precipitation in the transition from dry to wet and relative humidity in the transition from wet to dry reduced wind speed will drive the decline of pet bian et al 2020 lin et al 2018 during the entire study period the wind speed decreased by 0 012 m s y e a r p 0 01 and there was a sharp decrease before 1992 li et al 2018 a possible explanation is that increasing terrestrial surface roughness due to the large scale afforestation and forest increased from 2 26 in 1980 to 2 98 in 2000 liu and zhang 2013 vautard et al 2010 unfortunately recovery of surface wind speed in northwest china has been reported recently ge et al 2021 li et al 2018 which means increasing pet with much faster warming shi et al 2018 wang and chen 2014 and recovery of wind speed northwest china would show more drying trends in the future 5 conclusions in this study spei was used to analyze the variation of dryness in northwest china over northwest china the spei showed a wetting trend during 1961 2018 p 0 05 indicating an overall wetting condition there however a significant the transition from dry to wet during 1961 1989 and a transition from wet to dry during 1989 2018 were identified by the spei as for the spatial distributions of trends at each pixel there are about 30 of regions showed drying trends when focusing on the recent three decades abrupt and quick shifts to drying were identified during 1989 2018 and more droughts may occur in northwest china to understand the effects of meteorological variables on the wetting drying trend the detrending technique was used to quantify the contributions of different meteorological factors to spei changes in different periods as for the whole northwest china although temperature played the most important role in the drying trend the combined effects from precipitation and wind speed offset the drying trend during 1961 2018 additionally the area with the spei changes dominated by temperature 35 3 was largest followed by wind speed 28 7 precipitation 27 3 relative humidity 8 6 the significant decline in relative humidity and the recoveries of wind speed offset the wetting trend and resulted in a drying trend instead in the recent three decades notably if current climate trends continue i e the rapid increase in temperature along with decrease in relative humidity and recovery of wind speed drying trend would be expected to increase in northwest china in the future the spatial distribution of dominant factors explains the trends of spei and help understand that drier air dominated drying trends in western northwest china it is suggested that both water and energy supplies need to be considered to estimate the dryness on the land for addressing the drying trend in the

2973,northwest china has experienced a warming wetting climate featured by increasing temperature and precipitation during the past six decades recent studies suggested that the climate may have shifted from wetting to drying after the 1990s if changes in energy supply were considered however how the change in energy supply affects the dryness remains unclear in this study we quantified the dryness in northwest china based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei which considers the impact of potential evapotranspiration estimated by the penman monteith equation on dryness during 1961 2018 then the contributions of changes in meteorological variables precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed and net radiation to the dryness changes were estimated using a detrending technique the results indicated that northwest china experienced a wetting period 1961 1989 and then a drying period 1989 2018 during 1961 1989 increased precipitation and slowed wind were the main drivers of the wetting trend during 1989 2018 although the increased precipitation and decline in solar radiation favored a wetting condition warmer temperature drier air decrease in relative humidity together with rebounded wind speed offset the wetting trend and resulted in significantly increasing dryness in northwest china the dryness would further increase if current climate trends continue in the future which may have important implications for water management in northwest china keywords northwest china driving factors wetting trend land dryness potential evapotranspiration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global climate change has modified the intensities and distributions of precipitation and evapotranspiration at global and regional scales li et al 2017 li and liu 2020 wentz et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 the modification will change dry wet conditions and hence have profound effects on regional water resources agriculture and the environment brookshire and weaver 2015 piao et al 2010 generally the dry get drier wet gets wetter is a typical paradigm of global dry wet variabilities under climate change and it has been well observed on the ocean allan et al 2010 although the dry get drier wet gets wetter is mostly valid on the ocean there is only about 10 8 of global land area meets this paradigm while about 9 5 of global land area showed the opposite paradigm feng and zhang 2015 greve et al 2014 such as central asia north africa and the middle east tabari and willems 2018 yang et al 2019a these studies show that there are large spatial heterogeneities in the changes of dry wet conditions on the land northwest china located in the hinterland of the eurasian continent is a typical arid and semi arid area with a sensitive and fragile ecosystem gao et al 2018 vicente serrano et al 2013 observation data shows that the precipitation in northwest china increases at a rate of 0 55 mm year during 1960 2013 yang et al 2017 and temperature increases in northwest china at a rate of 0 034 year higher than the trends over the entire china 0 025 year and the globe 0 013 year during 1960 2010 li et al 2012 yang et al 2017 due to the observed increase in precipitation runoff and lake water level the trend of warming wetting in northwest china had been reported peng and zhou 2017 shi et al 2002 yao et al 2021 certainly the regional water cycle will accelerate under climate change with the increase in precipitation but also evapotranspiration due to the rising temperature mishra and singh 2010 previous studies often focused on the increase of precipitation due to moisture flux change firstly when discussing the change of dry wet condition in northwest china peng and zhou 2017 and then suggested that northwest china was getting wet hu et al 2019 wang et al 2017 yuan et al 2017 however the water supply precipitation is not the sole controlling factor yang et al 2019b the effect of energy supply namely the potential evapotranspiration pet also plays an important role in the variability of dryness xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2020a the effect of pet on dryness variability has become prominent in china since the 1980s park et al 2017 xu et al 2021 in northwest china most meteorological variables particularly the wind speed and temperature experienced dramatic changes in 1990s yao et al 2020a these changes have resulted in the increase in pet li et al 2014 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2022 and are likely to cause northwest china getting dry again aggravated drought and decline in soil moisture in northwest china were mainly controlled by changes in evaporative demand yao et al 2022 a recent case study in the bosten lake basin located in northwest china has also noticed drying trends since 1980s yang et al 2020a and provided evidence for possible drying trends after 1990 however for the whole northwest china only few studies have focused on the risk of becoming dry assessing the change of dry wet condition based on different indicators may lead to inconsistent conclusions numerous indicators have been developed to analyze the changing trend recently the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 and spei vicente serrano et al 2010 are common indicators that are used to analyze the change of dry wet condition in northwest china the wetting trends with increasing precipitation are likely to weaken or vanish due to the increasing evapotranspiration caused by warming dai 2011 dai 2013 imbalanced in warming and wetting indicated regional differences in increased precipitation and increased temperature wang et al 2020 therefore spei which takes account of the relationship between water supply and energy supply was suitable to describe the change of dry wet condition in northwest china in addition to precipitation and temperature other meteorological variables can affect dryness variabilities by changing pet such as relative humidity wind speed and net radiation zhao et al 2021 to quantitatively explore the impact of meteorological variables on dry wet condition variabilities hu et al 2019 considered precipitation and pet as major drivers using spei by correlation coefficient in northwest china furthermore xu et al 2021 emphasized the drying trends after the 1990s and quantified contributions of precipitation and pet to the change in spei however the complex pet changes due to dramatic changes in meteorological variables in northwest china were ignored and using pet as an integrated index may overshadow the mechanism of internal factors this study aims to quantify the variabilities of dryness and their driving factors in northwest china the dryness in this study will be estimated by considering both water and energy supplies considering data availability and the change point revealed in previous studies the research period was divided into two time periods 1961 1989 and 1989 2018 to assess the existence of drying trends resulted from dramatic changed climate in the recent three decades therefore we designed a series of numerical experiments based on spei to investigate 1 whether the change in energy supply results in significant drying trends in recent three decades and if so where are these drying trends and 2 contributions of different meteorological variables to the changes in spei in northwest china our study can help understand the dryness variabilities and their driving factors in northwest china and provide a basis for future regional management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the study area is northwest china 31 6 49 2 n 73 5 111 2 e including the xinjiang qinghai gansu ningxia and shaanxi provinces fig 1 northwest china is a typical continental climate and the mean annual precipitation is 250 mm deng et al 2014 climate subtypes are also shown in fig 1 which are defined by aridity index ai the ratio of precipitation to pet ranges hyper arid ai 0 05 arid 0 05 ai 0 2 semi arid 0 2 ai 0 5 dry sub humid 0 5 ai 0 65 and humid ai greater than 0 65 huang et al 2016 yao et al 2020b as for climate research has shown a warming wetting trend in northwest china during the period 1961 2010 leading to melting of glaciers an increase of river runoff and water level rise of inland lakes shi et al 2014 shi et al 2007 yang et al 2021 the meteorological data were obtained from the china meteorological data service centre of china meteorological administration http data cma cn this dataset contains monthly precipitation mean temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine duration from 1961 to 2018 these data were developed from 2416 meteorological stations in china and interpolated by methodology anomaly approach to the grid of 0 25 0 25 wu and gao 2013 zhou et al 2016 2 2 calculating spei considering possible effect of drying from increasing evapotranspiration weakens or vanishes the effect of wetting from increasing precipitation spei was selected to describe the variabilities of dryness in northwest china the method for estimating of pet is essential to calculating the spei and several equations are devoted to evaluating pet such as hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 thornthwaite equation thornthwaite 1948 and penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the penman monteith equation considering energy balance and aerodynamics theory performs well both globally and in china especially in northwest china almorox et al 2018 chen et al 2005 the penman monteith equation was selected here as eq 1 allen et al 1998 1 pet 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where pet is potential evapotranspiration m m d a y r n is the net radiation mj m 2 d a y g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 d a y γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature curve kpa c t is the average daily air temperature c u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s e s is the actual vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa and e s e a is the vapor pressure deficit kpa the spei at 12 month time scale namely spei 12 was used to describe annual variabilities of dryness a decrease of spei means an increase of dryness and an increase of spei means a decrease of dryness in order to calculate spei 12 precipitation and the difference between precipitation and pet need to be accumulated in 12 months these accumulated values are fitted to the candidate probability distribution from which probabilities are transformed to the standard normal distribution the generalized extreme value distribution is recommended as a candidate probability distribution in spei stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2010 2 3 statistical analysis and study periods mann kendall test kendall 1948 mann 1945 is a non parametric statistical method used widely for detecting the significance of trends in meteorological time series mallick et al 2021 in this study the significance level α 0 05 was selected to determine whether meteorological variables have changed significantly during different periods meanwhile mann kendall mk test was used to determine the changing trends of spei time series during 1961 1989 and 1989 2018 sen s slope sen 1968 is a non parametric procedure for estimating the slope of trend it is a robust estimate of the magnitude in a trend yue et al 2002 and has been used in meteorological time series gocic and trajkovic 2013 theil sen s slope is given as 2 β m e d i a n x i x j t i t j where x i and x j are data values at times t i and t j i j respectively in this study sen s slope was used to calculate the rate of spei change during different periods and quantify the contributions of meteorological variables to the changes in spei in section 2 4 2 4 a detrending technique to attribute contributions of driving factors to disentangle different effects and quantify the contributions of different meteorological factors on the variabilities of dryness we applied a detrending mao et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 technique to eliminate the trend signals this approach forms new detrended meteorological times series specifically for the period of 1961 2018 the variable x series from january 1961 to december 2018 was divided into 12 groups as shown in the square matrix x 1 1961 x 2 1961 x 12 1961 x 1 1962 x 2 1962 x 12 1962 x 1 2018 x 2 2018 x 12 2018 and each column in the matrix was considered as a group the detrending technique was applied to temperature relative humidity wind speed and net radiation through equation 3 but for precipitation arid regions are prone to have no precipitation for multiple consecutive months in order to avoid unphysical results the detrending of precipitation referred to equation 4 and equation 5 the same approach was applied to the periods of 1961 1989 and 1989 2018 3 f m d e t r

data in year i although keeping one variable unchanged while detrending the other variables may change the dependencies of variables it provides an approach to disentangle effects of different variables at the fixed time zhang et al 2016 we designed six numerical experiments the base case use detrended data for all variables the precipitation only case means all variables except the precipitation are detrended the same rule is also applied to temperature only case relative humidity only case wind speed only case and net radiation only case the relative contribution rates r cr were defined as equation 6 6 rcr i t i t base t i t base 100 where the rcr i is the relative contribution rates in case i the t i is the sen s slope of spei series in case i 3 results 3 1 changes in meteorological conditions the changes in annual precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed net radiation and pet are shown in fig 2 a f as for the whole northwest china the average annual precipitation is 258 m m and shows a significant increasing trend 0 76 m m y e a r p 0 01 during 1961 2018 and the increasing trends are observed in both periods 0 89 m m y e a r during 1961 1989 and 1 59 m m y e a r during 1989 2018 temperature shows a rapidly and significantly increasing trend 0 031 c y e a r p 0 01 and this rapid increase is particularly notable in the period of 1989 2018 0 011 c y e a r during 1961 1989 while 0 039 c y e a r during 1989 2018 the average relative humidity wind speed and net radiation are 50 3 2 m s and 7 6 m j m 2 d a y respectively which are consistent with previous results from yang et al 2019b there is no significant change in relative humidity before 1989 but it has declined rapidly during 1989 2018 0 197 y e a r the wind speed has decreased significantly throughout the entire period it is worth noting that opposite trends were detected in the period of 1961 1989 0 014 m s y e a r and 1989 2018 0 008 m s y e a r the wind speed decreased first and increased then pet is an important variable for calculating spei and the result from penman monteith shows that the average annual pet is 930 m m over northwest china annual pet has increased slightly by 0 35 m m y e a r p 0 01 a rapid increase of pet 3 30 m m y e a r p 0 01 during 1989 2018 is likely to lead to drying trends fig 2f the spatial distributions of mean annual values of meteorological variables are shown in fig 2 g l precipitation decreases gradually from southeast to northwest the distribution of temperature is related to elevation temperatures are high in the basin and low in the plateau area with low relative humidity is mainly in the central northwest china western and eastern northwest china generally have high relative humidity wind speed is high in the middle and low in the eastern and western parts area with high net radiation is in the south while are with low net radiation is in the north pet is high in the center and low in the south and north 3 2 spei changes in northwest china the changes in spei over the whole northwest china are shown in fig 3 during the whole period of 1961 2018 spei increased by 0 0114 y e a r p 0 05 indicating northwest china was getting wet however spei firstly shows a wetting trend during 1961 1989 0 0446 y e a r p 0 05 then a drying trend during 1989 2018 0 0416 y e a r p 0 05 this means northwest china was getting dry instead of wet in the recent three decades the spatial distributions of spei trends at pixel scale during different periods are shown in fig 4 during 1961 2018 there are 66 4 of which 65 2 are statistically significant of northwest china are getting wet but 33 6 of which 14 2 are statistically significant are getting dry western and central northwest china are getting wet while southwestern northern and eastern northwest china are getting dry fig 4 during 1961 1989 the whole northwest china was getting wet fig 4b more than 80 of areas show significant wetting trends especially in western and central northwest china a wetting trend was observed at a quite rapid rate to further examine whether the northwest has become dry again in the recent three decades the spatial distributions of spei trends at pixel scale during 1989 2018 are shown in fig 4c the result shows drying trends appeared in 64 2 of which 39 9 are statistically significant of northwest china especially in western northwest china abrupt and quick shifts from wetting to drying were identified more droughts may occur in northwest china 3 3 contributions of different factors to spei changes the transition from drying to wetting during the whole period was identified between 1961 and 2018 two distinguished transitions drying to wetting during 1961 1989 and wetting to drying during 1989 2018 were found by spei analysis numerical experiments based on detrending technique were used to understand these transitions of dry wet conditions and quantify effects of driving factors on spei changes the differences between trends of specific cases such as precipitation only case and trend of base case are the contributions of corresponding variables to spei change the contributions of meteorological variables to spei changes over the whole northwest china in different periods are given in fig 5 for the entire period the changes in precipitation wind speed and net radiation make northwest china wet while the changes in temperature and relative humidity make it dry combining the trends of variables in fig 2 the spei changes were positively related to the changes of precipitation and relative humidity but negative to temperature wind speed and net radiation temperature was the variable that dominants the changes of spei the increase of temperature by 0 031 c y e a r made spei decline by 0 0282 y e a r precipitation and wind speed were the main reasons making northwest china wet the increase of precipitation by 0 76 m m y e a r and the decline of wind speed by 0 011 m s y e a r made spei increase by 0 0196 y e a r and 0 0183 y e a r respectively the aggregated contributions of different factors were positive and agreed northwest china getting wet as well it should be noted that wind speed played an equally important role as precipitation in the transition from dry to wet in northwest china consequently the effects of precipitation and wind speed offset the drying trend caused by temperature rise so the transition from dry to wet occurred during 1961 1989 effects of precipitation and wind speed led to a wetting trend in northwest china leading to the transition from dry to wet during this period during 1989 2018 drying effects of relative humidity and temperature became paramount and exceeded the wetting effect of precipitation causing the transition from wet to dry in this period a more rapid rise in temperature 0 039 c y e a r and a significant drop in relative humidity 0 20 y e a r resulted in a drying trend again in order to reveal the contributions of meteorological variables to spei changes at pixel scale spatial distributions of r cr are given in fig 6 a and the proportions in different r cr ranges are given in fig 6 b the absolute value of r cr represents the relative importance and the symbol represents the direction of the trend wetting or drying the range of r cr of pr is between 65 0 and 81 1 increased precipitation leads to a wetting trend in 83 of area especially in the central and somewhere in eastern northwest china the average r cr of pr is 43 8 which makes great contributions on drying trends the r cr of tm are always negative meaning all regions get dry due to the changes in temperature the strongest drying contributions appear in the southern part the range of r cr of rh is between 60 1 and 30 7 and more drying trends due to the changes of rh although there are about 30 of regions get wet due to the changes of rh the relative contributions are not obvious the changes in wind speed play an important role in getting wet in western northwest china and getting dry in northern northwest china the absolute values of r cr of rn are below 30 in most regions implying rn has small effects on spei changes the dominant factors defined as the variable with the largest absolute value among pr tm rh win and rn at pixel scale are shown in fig 6 c the area dominated by temperature to spei changes is the largest followed by wind speed precipitation relative humidity only few regions are dominated by net radiation the dominant factors in fig 6 c can be used to explain the spei trends in fig 4 b and help understand the mechanism underpinning spei change the wetting trends are led by wind speed in western northwest china and precipitation in central northwest china the drying trends are led by temperature in southern northwest china and relative humidity in northern northwest china the reasons of drying in eastern northwest china are complex in eastern northwest china one part getting dry is mainly caused by the rise of temperature and the other part is caused by the decline of precipitation it can be concluded that there are obvious regional differences in the dominant factors to spei changes to explain drying trends in northwest china in the last three decades relative contributions of different variables to spei changes during 1989 2018 are given in fig 7 large scale negative contributions of relative humidity and temperature in fig 7 a and b indicate that the decrease in relative humidity and rise in temperature cause drying trends in northwest china the spatial distributions and proportions of r cr in precipitation and temperature during 1989 2018 are similar to the results during 1961 2018 but the contributions of relative humidity and wind speed present large differences the entire western northwest china showed serious drying trends due to the significant decline in relative humidity the recoveries of wind speed indicated wider and more serious drying effects in northern northwest china the dominant factors during 1989 2018 are given in fig 7 c the changes of spei in most areas were dominated by relative humidity 33 5 and precipitation 32 9 although many areas were still dominated by the wetting effect of increased precipitation drying trends caused by relative humidity temperature and wind speed have far exceeded the wetting trends of precipitation 4 discussion under global warming the assessments of change in dry wet conditions are complex because of the changes of intensities and distributions in hydro meteorological variables the regional differences are so evident that the traditional paradigm of dry gets drier wet gets wetter can no longer describe the changes in dry wet condition in different regions in our study spei was used to describe the variabilities of dry wet conditions in typical arid and semi arid area northwest china different from the above paradigm northwest china was getting wet based on spei during 1961 2018 which is consistent with warming wetting trend claimed in many previous studies however the latest studies showed a high probability of drying trends in northwest china in the recent three decades an abrupt shift of pet from decrease to increase happened in the 1990s liu and zhang 2013 wang et al 2019 xing et al 2016 which has increased the evaporative demand and led to a drying trend in northwest china increased pet can easily cause warming induced drying dai 2013 which is likely to weaken or reverse the wetting trend of increased precipitation our results confirmed this hypothesis and there were significant and quick drying trends during 1989 2018 the decline of terrestrial water storage based on the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mo et al 2016 xiong et al 2021 yi et al 2016 confirms the conclusion of increase in land dryness soil moisture reflects land dryness and the variability in soil moisture is strongly controlled by the variability in pet berg et al 2017 mcmillan and srinivasan 2015 an observed sharp decrease in soil moisture since the mid 1990s was associated with increasing pet han et al 2018 yao et al 2018 which supports that evaporative demand results in land dryness to disentangle different effects of meteorological factors with dramatic changes detrending was used to quantify their respective contributions to the drying trend our results showed the changes in precipitation and wind speed led to wetting trends during 1961 2018 but the changes in relative humidity and temperature led to drying trends during 1989 2018 the similar pattern is also found in iran and europe nouri and bannayan 2019 claimed drying trends dominated by precipitation and wind speed in iran stagge et al 2017 claimed increases in temperature and pet have increased drying in southern europe and counteracted wetting in northern europe the uncertainty of results came from two aspects inhomogeneities in meteorological data and limitations of the penman monteith equation meteorological data was collected from more than 2000 stations in china wu and gao 2013 which is more than 323 stations harris et al 2014 peng et al 2019 and 751 stations xu et al 2009 the density of stations in eastern china is quite dense while relatively sparse in northwest china thus the uncertainty of northwest china is larger than that in eastern china peng and zhou 2017 zhou et al 2016 the areas in desert hinterland and western qinghai showed greater uncertainty in this study wu and gao 2013 inhomogeneities due to non climatic shifts like station relocations li et al 2020 instrument changes bertrand et al 2021 zhang and wang 2020 and urbanization jiang et al 2020 can adversely affect the assessment and attribution of climate change zhang et al 2020b station relocation is the primary cause for the inhomogeneities of meteorological series and there are 1834 stations relocated at least once until 2011 cao et al 2016 another source of uncertainty is the penman monteith equation the drying bias due to neglecting the impact of increasing atmospheric co2 concentration has been reported recently lemordant et al 2018 yang et al 2020b in the future when atmospheric co2 concentration continues to increase it is necessary to estimate pet considering atmospheric co2 concentration yang et al 2019c intelligibly changes in precipitation and temperature are important drivers of changing dry wet condition but the effect of wind speed is non negligible liu et al 2014 for the whole northwest china wind speed plays an equally important role as precipitation in the transition from dry to wet and relative humidity in the transition from wet to dry reduced wind speed will drive the decline of pet bian et al 2020 lin et al 2018 during the entire study period the wind speed decreased by 0 012 m s y e a r p 0 01 and there was a sharp decrease before 1992 li et al 2018 a possible explanation is that increasing terrestrial surface roughness due to the large scale afforestation and forest increased from 2 26 in 1980 to 2 98 in 2000 liu and zhang 2013 vautard et al 2010 unfortunately recovery of surface wind speed in northwest china has been reported recently ge et al 2021 li et al 2018 which means increasing pet with much faster warming shi et al 2018 wang and chen 2014 and recovery of wind speed northwest china would show more drying trends in the future 5 conclusions in this study spei was used to analyze the variation of dryness in northwest china over northwest china the spei showed a wetting trend during 1961 2018 p 0 05 indicating an overall wetting condition there however a significant the transition from dry to wet during 1961 1989 and a transition from wet to dry during 1989 2018 were identified by the spei as for the spatial distributions of trends at each pixel there are about 30 of regions showed drying trends when focusing on the recent three decades abrupt and quick shifts to drying were identified during 1989 2018 and more droughts may occur in northwest china to understand the effects of meteorological variables on the wetting drying trend the detrending technique was used to quantify the contributions of different meteorological factors to spei changes in different periods as for the whole northwest china although temperature played the most important role in the drying trend the combined effects from precipitation and wind speed offset the drying trend during 1961 2018 additionally the area with the spei changes dominated by temperature 35 3 was largest followed by wind speed 28 7 precipitation 27 3 relative humidity 8 6 the significant decline in relative humidity and the recoveries of wind speed offset the wetting trend and resulted in a drying trend instead in the recent three decades notably if current climate trends continue i e the rapid increase in temperature along with decrease in relative humidity and recovery of wind speed drying trend would be expected to increase in northwest china in the future the spatial distribution of dominant factors explains the trends of spei and help understand that drier air dominated drying trends in western northwest china it is suggested that both water and energy supplies need to be considered to estimate the dryness on the land for addressing the drying trend in the

2974,the key to formulating a multi objective reservoir operation scheme is coordinating the high low priorities and achieving balance among various targets accordingly in the decision making process however the traditional decision making methods are either completely subjective or neglect the decision maker s preferences making it essential to optimize these methods to address such unsatisfactory aspects therefore through drawing on some universally acknowledged economic theories and studying the geometric relationships among the pareto solutions to such multi objective decision making problems the concepts of replacement rate profit loss sensitivity ratio and preference equilibrium degree are introduced deduced and elaborated on in this paper on the basis of them the preference decision method pdm entrusted with strict mathematical and physical connotations is constructed and derived in detail especially for addressing the bi objective and tri objective scenarios the pdm can quantify the complex internal feedback relationship among various targets providing objective support for decision makers in the subjective trade offs of the interests of multiple subjects and achieving the unity of subjective and objective furthermore the proposed method is applied to the wujiang cascade reservoirs in china through which the benefits of power generation water supply and ecological protection are enabled to be considered simultaneously the application shows that the pdm can effectively shrink the pareto set which greatly reduces the difficulty of decision making and the obtained results prove feasible and satisfactory in addition the pdm is based entirely on the pareto set itself making it simple to utilize and can be extended into solving other multi objective decision making problems keywords multi objective decision making trade off preference reservoir operation utility gini coefficient abbreviations rr replacement rate plsr profit loss

guarantee rate esd ecological satisfaction degree data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a reservoir can change the natural runoff process through water storage and discharge to alleviate the uneven temporal distribution of water resources wang et al 2016 with the growing population and awareness of environmental issues the functional requirements for reservoirs have been continuously expanding not only concerning the initial objective of power generation but also to those of water supply ecological protection flood control shipping and others bai et al 2015 yang et al 2016 liu et al 2017 de la cruz courtois et al 2021 wu et al 2022a however irreconcilable conflicts among these goals do exist leading to one goal often being achieved at the expense of others wang et al 2020 therefore it is rather tricky and of concern to find a comprehensive satisfactory scheme to achieve the best benefits of all objectives in the actual decision making process of reservoir operation the key to formulating a feasible reservoir operation scheme is to cope with the relationships among various competitive or coordinated targets that are difficult to quantify sort out the priorities and achieve balance among them which essentially turns into a multi objective decision making problem modp labadie 2004 ngo et al 2007 generally for addressing modps there are three available solving techniques priori progressive and posteriori coello coello et al 2002 the priori and progressive techniques can transform a multi objective problem mop into a single objective one yet with either of the two methods applied abundant information is omitted which theoretically could have been taken into consideration to some extent and the decision makers can hardly compare their final decisions with the other schemes to obtain a comparatively reliable support while the posteriori technique has gained an edge over them in that through this technique a more comprehensive decision making scheme set can be obtained with relatively less interference by subjective factors and higher computational efficiency thus it has been widely used in the current multi objective operation of reservoir groups yang et al 2020 the posteriori techniques include two processes multi objective optimization moo and multi criteria decision making mcd ridha et al 2021 with the development of multi objective evolutionary algorithms the pareto frontier emerges representing a set of non dominated solutions regarding conflicts and incomparability among objectives cohon 1978 and is considered the carrier and direct embodiment of multi dimensional targets interactive feedback relations how to obtain the pareto approximate of the optimization problem is something that the moo process has been working on in comparison the mcd process requires selecting and ranking a group of available choices leveraging the obtained information garg and kumar 2018 during the process a final choice will be made after a thorough review of the several indices of different implementable operation schemes manifesting various benefit combinations of the objectives mentioned beforehand the pareto sets carrying immense information gradually become the central processing target of mcd with the posteriori technique introduced and utilized according to real time information decision preferences and some other information some specific evaluation methods or screening tools are to be used to sort and optimize the pareto set and select one solution malekmohammadi et al 2011 such a solution represents a satisfactory scheme that meets the actual needs one evaluation method commonly applied to such kinds of problems is the simple additive weighting method maximum minimum weighting method saaty 2003 though intuitive the method can be somewhat subjective when assigning weights to different objectives in fact it isn t easy to establish a generally satisfactory weighting method because the benefits of different objectives can vary greatly in importance in different situations with the deepening of research new evaluation methods and theories such as analytic hierarchy process ahp li et al 2020 grey system gs li et al 2015 luo and wang 2012 vague set vs alhazaymeh and hassan 2015 şahin and liu 2017 set pair analysis spa garg and kumar 2018 and fuzzy decision method fdm baghapour et al 2020 have provided new ideas for addressing mcd unfortunately these decision making methods are subjective or have no precise physical meaning they fail to answer the critical question of how an increase or decrease in one benefit will lead to changes in other benefits leaving the decision makers in a chaotic state in addition formulating a qualified reservoir operation scheme requires reasonably considering the decision makers subjective preferences and providing them with enough objective information to assist them in clearly understanding the consequences and implications of their choice and preference it is a great challenge to quantify the trade offs among objectives of the cascade reservoir system smith et al 2019 which is essential and critical for decision makers and stakeholders to make more rational decisions on operation schemes concerning dealing with the relationships of different objectives and making trade offs visual analysis is one of the most basic tools that vividly visualize the trade offs among objectives in graphical form reed and kollat 2013 it can help identify key decision variables and guides the balanced regulation of multi objective benefits kim et al 2006 the visual analysis has been effectively applied in dealing with trade off problems such as water allocation fu et al 2013 reservoir operation hurford et al 2014 and sewage treatment meng et al 2016 nevertheless visual analysis usually fails to fully reveal the complex relationships among objectives or to assess their competitiveness objectively which means that further research is needed to quantify the interactive feedback among objectives some scholars have focused on the geometric properties of the distribution of pareto solutions in the objective space some scholars have made some explorations on enhancing visual analysis tang et al 2019 defined the conflict evaluation index by projecting the pareto frontier and measuring the distribution range of the projection to evaluate the intensity of competition quantitatively wu et al 2020 derived the substitutive relationship between power generation and ecological protection by fitting the mathematical expression of the frontier wang et al 2022 proposed two indicators competitiveness index and competition efficiency index to reconstruct the pareto set between the two objectives to reduce the decision difficulty regarding the choice of specific solutions the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis tzeng and huang 2011 method is widely used further based on the diminishing marginal substitution rate law researchers believe that the knee point of the pareto frontier has unique advantages li et al 2021 find the tangent point to the pareto front as the best compromise solution by constructing a linear spline utility function of the pareto front wu et al 2022b defined the ratio of the slope of the line between the scattered points as a multi objective trade off index to quantify the relationships among different objectives however these studies have done a lot of mathematical derivation which is a meaningful attempt still there is no strict physical connotation and cannot explain the practical significance of each step of the mathematical operation in addition through these methods decision makers can only be given a mathematically optimal choice without any opportunity to weigh trade offs subjectively more specifically the research on quantitative trade offs is still relatively preliminary mostly limited to the analysis of two dimensional relations and there is a lack of effective analytical means for high dimensional mcd in summary the existing technology for the mcd in reservoir operation is still relatively rough usually these decision methods are directly introduced into application situations and rarely combined with the interactive feedback relationships among the multiple objectives of the reservoir itself as a result it can be wholly subjective or the decision maker s preferences can not be considered however these explorations are compelling and inspiring by referring to the concepts of price performance ratio utility and gini coefficient in economics this paper deduces the trade offs among non inferior schemes themselves in detail it puts forward a novel practical ranking framework for mcd based on pareto sets namely the preference degree decision making method pdm compared to subjective methods represented by the ahp the pdm is equipped with strict mathematical and physical connotations moreover compared to objective methods based on knee points the pdm is capable of providing reliable support for decision makers to make decisions according to their preferences and comprehensively realizing the integration of subjective and objective aspects the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 shows the detailed derivation process of the proposed pdm for the basic bi objective situation and the extended tri objective case regarding mcd section 3 takes the wujiang river basin in southwest china as a study case and establishes a cascade operation model for decision making over three objectives power generation ecological protection and water supply section 4 applies the pdm to decision making on optimal reservoir operation and discusses its advantages over existing methods section 5 concludes the paper 2 methodology the trade offs of multiple objectives in mcd are similar to some economic problems in the underlying logic based on this understanding the pdm is proposed in this paper and its analytical steps are summarized and shown in the following fig 1 the corresponding mathematical derivation is carried out as below 2 1 pdm for bi objective optimization problems assuming that x n n 1 2 n is one of the non inferior solutions of a mop with a population size of n the pareto solution set of the problem is x x 1 x 2 x n x n the solutions to all actual problems whether their original objective form is min max or min min max max can eventually be transformed into a min min max max form by adding a positive or negative sign to the objective function based on this this paper s subsequent derivation of the quantification process for the pareto frontier is carried out in the objective space of the min min form in real life when people buy items they often consider how much more services can be obtained by spending an additional amount of money to measure the affordability of items which is the price performance ratio schindele et al 2020 comparably in terms of a bi objective optimization problem any non inferior solution xn corresponds to an objective function value f 1 n f 2 n of two dimensions to quantify the extent to which a change in the value of one objective function causes a change in another objective with reference to the price performance ratio a novel concept replacement rate was put forward in this paper denoted as r and the following definitions apply definition 1 replacement rate rr replacement rate r 1 r 2 is the absolute average tangent value of the intersection angles θ 1 θ 2 between the vectors formed by any point on the pareto front and both its two adjacent points separately and their corresponding f 1 axis f 2 axis components in particular for either of the two endpoints of the pareto front the vector is formed by the point itself and the nearest adjacent point and r 1 r 2 equals the absolute tangent value of the intersection angle between the vector and its corresponding f 1 axis f 2 axis component first all non inferior solutions are numbered with i i 1 2 n according to the order of values of the objective function f 1 sorted from small to large all of the functions corresponding to the i th solution are numbered with i as well and then the rr of the two objective functions corresponding to each solution numbered with i on the pareto frontier is 1 r 1 i tan θ 1 i f 2 2 f 2 1 f 1 2 f 1 1 i 1 1 2 f 2 i f 2 i 1 f 1 i f 1 i 1 f 2 i 1 f 2 i f 1 i 1 f 1 i i 2 3 n 1 f 2 n f 2 n 1 f 1 n f 1 n 1 i n 2 r 2 i tan θ 2 i f 1 2 f 1 1 f 2 2 f 2 1 i 1 1 2 f 1 i f 1 i 1 f 2 i f 2 i 1 f 1 i 1 f 1 i f 2 i 1 f 2 i i 2 3 n 1 f 1 n f 1 n 1 f 2 n f 2 n 1 i n where i is the number assigned to the non inferior solutions based on the ascending order of values of the objective function f 1 n is the total number of non inferior solutions r 1 i r 2 i is the rr of f 2 relative to f 1 f 1 relative to f 2 at the i th non inferior solution which hereinafter is described as the rr of f 1 f 2 θ 1 i θ 2 i is the intersection angle between the vectors formed by the i th non inferior solution point and both adjacent points separately and the f 1 axis f 2 axis components f 1 i f 2 i are respectively the values of the two objective functions corresponding to the i th non inferior solution taking the pareto frontier of the bi objective optimization benchmark test problem zdt2 as an example the geometric expression of the rr concept is shown in fig 2 below actually even if the absolute change of one objective function remains the same when the other objective function values change by one unit the relative impact considerably varies depending on the place of the objective function values where such change occurs that s why decision makers often consider the relative influence degree rather than the absolute value change in engineering practice which is similar to the law of diminishing marginal utility brewer and venaik 2010 in economics manifesting that when consumers consume a certain commodity incrementally the total utility may still increase whereas the unit utility of the goods is gradually decreasing therefore to meet the needs of examining the relative influence degree in multi objective decision making the concept profit loss sensitivity ratio was proposed and defined below denoted as δ with the concept of unit utility in economics used for reference definition 2 profit loss sensitivity ratio plsr profit loss sensitivity ratio is the ratio of the rr of one axis component f 1 or f 2 to the corresponding objective function value for a non inferior solution on the pareto frontier the formula is as follows 3 δ 1 i r 1 i f 1 i f 1 i 0 i 1 2 n 4 δ 2 i r 2 i f 2 i f 2 i 0 i 1 2 n where δ 1 i and δ 2 i are respectively the plsr of f 1 and f 2 at the i th non inferior solution which represents the sensitivity of the rr to the change of the objective function value considering the different units and orders of magnitude of each objective in the actual mops the plsr is made dimensionless through data normalization as follows 5 ε 1 i δ 1 i i 1 n δ 1 i i 1 2 n 6 ε 2 i δ 2 i i 1 n δ 2 i i 1 2 n where ε 1 i and ε 2 i are respectively the normalized plsr n plsr of f 1 and f 2 at the i th non inferior solution at this point with the concepts of price performance ratio and unit utility in economics utilized for reference the degree of gains or losses caused by each non inferior solution of mops can be quantitatively compared through the rr and plsr however there are too many individuals in the pareto set making it unrealistic to compare all of them in actual decision making therefore optimizing the decision making process and improving the simplicity of trade offs is necessary the concept of non dominated sorting is used for reference to simplify the scope of decision making the dominance relationship of either set of n plsrs ɛ 1 and ε 2 is compared a non inferior solution subset is acquired by secondary screening and finally the solution individuals most sensitive to profit and loss are obtained and included in the decision support set 7 x x u x x v x ε 1 v ε 1 u ε 2 v ε 2 u where x is the decision support set that is the subset of non inferior solutions after screening x is the original non inferior solution set xu and xv represent different non inferior solution individuals with different numbers according to the physical meaning of the plsr for an individual solution the obtained profit and loss percentage will change faster with a more considerable relative weight of plsr for one target thus the decision makers are prone to select and optimize this target to achieve greater benefits based on such understanding on the basis of the n plsr a concept preference degree is proposed in this paper denoted as ω the value range of which is 0 1 definition 3 preference degree pd preference degree is the relative weight of the n plsr for the two axis components of each solution in the decision support set the calculation formula is as follows 8 ω 1 m ε 1 m ε 1 m ε 2 m m 1 2 m 9 ω 2 m ε 2 m ε 1 m ε 2 m m 1 2 m where m is the scale of decision support set x m is the number assigned to the element in the decision support set based on the order of values of the objective function f 1 arranged in ascending order ω 1 m and ω 2 m are the pds of m th non inferior solution towards the objective function f 1 and f 2 respectively there is ω 1 m ω 2 m 1 the pd ω 1 m ω 2 m essentially reflects the extent to which the decision makers prefer to optimize one specific objective at each individual solution on the pareto frontier thus it can be used as the preference weight of different optimization objectives notwithstanding in actual decision making comparing different combinations of preference degrees one by one is rather time consuming and labour intensive leading to an index needed to unify the preference degrees towards different goals based on the lorenz curve the gini coefficient ceriani and verme 2012 is often used to express the degree of equality of income distribution in economics to be more specific assuming that the enclosed area between the actual income distribution curve and the absolute equality curve is a and the area at the lower right of the actual income distribution curve is b the quotient of a divided by a b is defined as gini coefficient enlightened by it the equilibrium degree of objective preference can be measured by calculating the proportion of the envelope area to unify the preference degrees towards different objectives therefore referring to the concept of gini coefficient in economics the concept of preference equilibrium degree was proposed in this paper denoted as e with its value range 0 1 definition 4 preference area pa the preference area is the rectangular area formed by a pd s two axis components as two lateral edges at a non inferior solution in particular if the two axis components of the preference degree are equal the area turns out to be the largest called the balanced preference area bpa the value range of pa is 0 0 25 and the geometric expression of the pa is shown in fig 3 definition 5 preference equilibrium degree ped the preference equilibrium degree is the quotient of actual pa divided by bpa calculated as follows 10 e m ω 1 m ω 2 m 1 4 where em represents the ped at m th non inferior solution with its value range 0 1 the higher the value the more the bias towards the two objectives converges the ped at each non inferior solution combined with the specific pd can be used for reference to provide a feasible and effective solution for decision making the economic concepts involved in the proposed method pdm and their mapping are shown in table 1 below 2 2 pdm for tri objective optimization problems based on the research on the bi objective optimization problems taking the min min min problem as an example the pdm was further developed and expanded in this paper to address the tri objective optimization decision making problems following the idea of coping with two objective optimization problems the individuals are numbered in the non inferior solution set x of the tri objective optimization problems whereas compared with the bi objective optimization problems the spatial distribution of the pareto frontier of the tri objective optimization problems is way more complex as for the bi objective problems a specific value of the objective function f 1 corresponds to a unique value of f 2 meaning that there will be a unique solution individual however in the tri objective problems a specific value of the objective function f 1 may correspond to multiple solution individuals for which the numbering method needs to be improved the new numbering system is implemented according to the order of distance values ln arranged in ascending order between the non inferior solution individuals x n f 1 n f 2 n f 3 n and the origin of spatial coordinates o 0 0 0 11 l n f 1 n 2 f 2 n 2 f 3 n 2 where ln is the spatial euclidean distance between the non inferior solution individual and the origin the rr is also used for tri objective optimization problems to quantitatively investigate the change degree of the other two objectives caused by the value change of one objective function in calculating the rr it is a precondition to decern one or two points adjacent to a specific point on the pareto front based on the new numbering system however compared with the bi objective problems where the adjacent points can be found simply by discerning the number assigned to the solution individuals the process is more complex for the tri objective optimization problems first the spatial euclidean distance between the point xi and the other points on the pareto front is calculated with 12 l i i o 1 3 f o i f o i 2 where lii is the euclidean distance between two solution individuals i and i o is the number of objective functions o 1 2 3 the two points with the shortest spatial euclidean distance from xi are selected denoted as the nearest point xj and the second nearest point xk then it is judged whether the sequent connection of xj xi and xk is strictly monotonicallyincreasing decreasing or not i e whether it meets the following requirements 13 f 1 j f 1 i f 1 k f 1 j f 1 i f 1 k f 2 j f 2 i f 2 k f 2 j f 2 i f 2 k f 3 j f 3 i f 3 k f 3 j f 3 i f 3 k if satisfied xi is called an internal point otherwise an external point in particular when an external point xi and its nearest point xj meet the requirement of f 1 i f 1 j f 2 i f 2 j f 3 i f 3 j the external point xi actually becomes a two dimensional 2d point assuming that x 1 is the set composed of all internal points x 2 of all external points and x 3 of all 2d points it is evident that the relationship between the three sets is as follows 14 x 1 x 2 x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 2 referring to the definition of the rr in the bi objective optimization problems the calculation rule of the tri objective rr is formulated as follows as for an internal point it is the average tangent value of the intersection angles between the vectors composed of the specific point and its nearest point second nearest point separately and the corresponding axis component respectively for an external point it is the tangent value of the intersection angle formed by the vector composed of the point and its nearest point and the corresponding axis component in particular for 2d points the rr of the objective dimensions with equal values is 0 15 r o i tan θ o ij tan θ o ik 2 x i x 1 tan θ o ij f o i f o j x i x 2 0 f o i f o j x i x 3 o 1 2 3 16 tan θ o ij a 1 a o 3 f o i f o j 2 f o i f o j where i is the number of a non inferior solution r o i is the rr of the o th objective relative to the other two objectives at the i th non inferior solution θ o i is the angle between the vector formed by the i th non inferior solution and its nearest point second nearest point separately and its o th axis components f o i is the value of the o th objective function at the i th non inferior solution taking the pareto frontier of the tri objective optimization benchmark test problem dtlz2 as an example the geometric expression of the concept of tri objective rr is shown in fig 4 furthermore the plsr for the tri objective optimization problems are calculated with 17 δ o i r o i f o i f o i 0 x i x o 1 2 3 18 ε o i δ o i i 1 n δ o i o 1 2 3 where δ o i is the plsr of the o th objective function at the i th non inferior solution and ε o i is the n plsr according to the non dominated sorting principle the decision support set via secondary screening is 19 x x u x x v x ε o v ε o u o 1 2 3 and the pd of each solution individual in the decision support set is 20 ω o m ε o m o 1 3 ε o m m 1 2 m o 1 2 3 where m is the scale of decision support set x m is the number assigned to an element in the decision support set based on the order of values arranged from small to large of its spatial euclidean distance from the origin ω o m is the pd of the m th non inferior solution towards the o th objective and there is o 1 3 ω o m 1 in the bi objective optimization decision making problems referring to the concept and calculation method of the gini coefficient the ideas of pa and ped are proposed and utilized in this paper to unify the different pds of the two objectives while to unify the pds for the tri objective optimization problems it is necessary to expand the planar idea of pa to a spatial one i e preference volume definition 6 preference volume pv preference volume is the cuboid volume formed by a pd s three axis components as three adjacent edges at a non inferior solution in particular if the three axis components of the preference degree are equal the volume turns out to be the largest called the balanced preference volume bpv the value range of pv is 0 1 27 and the geometric expression of the pv is shown in fig 5 furthermore as for the tri objective optimization problems the ped is the quotient of the actual pv and the bpv the formula of which is as follows 21 e m o 1 3 ω o m 1 27 where em is the ped of the m th non inferior solution also its value range is 0 1 and the higher the value the more the bias towards the three objectives converges the pdm proposed in this paper respectively for the bi objective and tri objective optimization problems are summarized and compared as shown in table 2 below 3 case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pdm the study applies the method to the operational decision making of the cascade reservoirs on the wujiang river to examine trade offs among power generation water supply and ecological protection 3 1 the study area the wujiang river basin is located at 104 18 109 22 e and 26 07 30 22 n with a total area of 87920km2 the river with its mainstream length of 1037km is the largest tributary on the south bank of the upper yangtze river and a representative river in southwest china the wujiang river basin has a natural drop of 2124m and a channel gradient of 0 205 rich in hydropower resources since the 1970s china has carried out large scale hydropower development in the wujiang river basin and planned a 12 level development scheme in the mainstream except for the baima navigation and hydropower project at the most downstream all the planned hydraulic engineering projects have been completed the geographical location and the water system distribution of the wujiang river basin are shown in fig 6 a out of the 12 reservoirs on the mainstream of the wujiang river five have the above seasonal regulation capacity and for the rest the capacity is daily for the runoff regulation the reservoirs with above seasonal capacity are comparatively worthy of investigation the basic information about these five reservoirs is shown in table 3 their generalized topological relationships with rivers and important hydrological stations are shown in fig 6 b according to the document water distribution plan of wujiang river basin issued by the ministry of water resources of prc the key monitoring sections and requirements for water supply of wujiang river basin are articulated wei and dong 2021 proposed four key sections about the ecological protection of the wujiang river and established the minimum flow requirements for maintaining a healthy ecological condition these key sections are also marked in fig 6 b 3 2 multi objective operation model of reservoir group the complex demand for power generation water supply and river ecological protection of the wujiang river basin can be abstracted into the following mathematical model composed of three objective functions and five constraints related to reservoir operation 3 2 1 objective functions 1 energy target the maximum total power generation pg of the cascade reservoirs is defined by 22 f 1 max e max i 1 i t 1 t n i t δ t 23 n i t k i q i t h i t where e kw h is

data of key hydrological stations in the wujiang river basin from the past 64 years 1956 2019 from the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china the study also reviewed the reliability consistency and representativeness of the data the flow of three stations respectively wujiangdu upstream midstream boundary section sinan midstream downstream boundary section and wulong basin outlet section were arranged by the p iii distribution zhang et al 2018 lei et al 2019 raynal villaseñor 2021 the flow values corresponding to the frequencies of 25 50 and 75 on the p iii curve are taken as the design values in wet normal and dry years respectively based on the flow situation of the upper middle and lower reaches three years 1960 1979 and 1976 in which the measured values are similar to the design values were selected as typical years to represent the conditions of dry normal and wet situations the detailed parameters of reservoirs were obtained from the management departments 4 results and discussion the simulation of the multi objective operation model in section 3 2 was carried out using the measured flow data of three typical years as input the discharge flows from individual reservoirs as the decision variable with a 10 day operation scale the solutions were dealt with through the improved va nsga iii algorithm ni et al 2019 to obtain the non inferior ones in dry normal and wet years 4 1 visual analysis drawing the non inferior solution points of the three objective functions in the three dimensional space the pareto frontiers of the mop of wujiang cascade reservoirs in typical dry normal and wet years are shown in figs 7 9 as below in terms of the interrelationship of the various objectives obviously there is an intense competition between the two objectives of pg vs esd in contrast the competitions between pg vs wsgr and wsgr vs esd although also observed are significantly weaker in addition looking more specifically at the benefit values for each objective as shown in fig 10 they played out differently under different hydrological conditions all three targets can be better optimized when the inflow is abundant of which the improvement of pg is the most obvious in particular the water supply target can be fully met in the wet year from this it can be inferred that inflow s positive role can be further exploited and augmented to the ecological benefit in a wet year and the water supply benefit in a normal year by reliably weighing through visual analysis it can be clearly understood that coordinating the three objectives of power generation water supply and ecological protection for the wujiang cascade reservoirs effectively involves a trade off between pg and esd considering the water supply target is more accessible to satisfy than the other two especially in a wet year when only two targets need to be traded off in comparison the trade offs among the three objectives can be more complex in a dry year 4 2 decision on operation schemes the pdm proposed in section 2 was applied to quantify the three objectives trade offs and decide the appropriate operation schemes all non inferior solutions were classified according to equation 13 and the corresponding results are marked in figs 7 and 8 the rr and n plsr of each solution were calculated in turn and the sub solution sets were filtered according to the principle of non dominated sorting as shown in fig 11 below comparing figs 7 9 reveals that the number of sub set solutions has been significantly reduced compared to the original solution set which greatly reduces the difficulty of decision making the pd to each target and the total ped of all solutions in the subsets were calculated according to equation 20 21 and equation 8 10 respectively as shown in table a1 a3 in the appendix suppose the decision maker prefers the benefits of the three objectives to be evenly distributed in that case the solution with the greatest ped value of e in table a1 a3 will be chosen as the final decision scheme otherwise if the decision maker has a stronger preference for any specific target the solution with a relatively more minor ped value of e and a more extensive pd to this target value of ω 1 or ω 2 or ω 3 will be chosen as the decision scheme the overall process is intuitive and easy to operate as an example the decision maker has no particular preference for any target the schemes 78 144 and 22 in table a1 a3 can be selected as the operation schemes for dry normal and wet years respectively the benefits obtained with the chosen schemes are shown in table 4 and the corresponding reservoirs water level processes are shown in fig 12 as a result by optimizing the operation of the five reservoirs through the proposed pdm in this paper the natural runoff can be fully used and the comprehensive benefits can be enhanced considerably the specific performance is shown as rationally increasing discharge during the non flood season and utilizing the inflow during the flood season to replenish the water storage for the continuous profit making function after the end of the flood season 4 3 discussion with existing technology as mentioned earlier many technologies are available for mcd in reservoir operation and the application of pdm shows unique advantages as shown in fig 11 pdm can effectively shrink the solution set and reduce the decision difficulty the ε dominance based technique kollat and reed 2007 and the competitiveness index method wang et al 2022 have made fruitful attempts on the practical limiting solution set the difference is that the ε dominance based technique improves the moo process for the evolutionary algorithm based on nsga ii using the ε dominance strategy to improve the algorithm s efficiency without involving decision making in comparison the competitiveness index method screens pareto solutions based on the competitive efficiency among objectives these methods limit the non inferior solutions to a smaller size than the pdm method still they can only retain a few solutions with the most conflicting benefits and will likely ignore some win win options many existing studies on the mcd process are inspired by the same economic idea of diminishing marginal utility as pdm such as the method of finding the knee area points of the pareto frontier li et al 2021 and quantifying individual linkage slope wu et al 2022b these methods are fruitful and have a solid mathematical theoretical basis in fact the shrunk solution set of the pdm is likely to contain the knee point solutions obtained by the above methods the difference is that these approaches are dedicated to providing a monotonous option to the decision maker weakening their subjective initiative however actual reservoir operation activities often require considering different external conditions and a monotonous theoretical optimal scheme cannot meet the practical needs the pdm takes a step forward relative to these methods by drawing on the idea of the gini coefficient two indicators pd and ped are proposed to quantify the degree of decision maker s bias toward specific goals at different solutions and provide an intuitive reference for decision makers subjective trade offs in addition the simplicity of practical engineering operation is also an advantage of the pdm over other methods overall the most significant advantage of the pdm over existing technologies is that it can provide precise and reliable objective support for decision maker s subjective preferences which is more in line with the significance of trade off in engineering practice finally the above case study is a deterministic simulation operation using runoffs of three historical years besides the pdm can also be applied to real time operation through the loop of hydrological forecast optimization decision making reservoir status update 5 conclusion aiming at the trade offs among objectives in mcd this paper proposed the concepts of rr plsr and ped and derived the pdm in the bi objective and tri objective scenarios the pdm is based on the geometric relationship among pareto solutions and uses universally acknowledged ideas of economics for reference the method tries to provide a solid support for decision maker s subjective preferences in a clear quantitative and objective manner and can achieve the unification of subjectivity and objectivity applying the pdm to the cascade reservoirs in wujiang river basin a multi objective operation model with power generation water supply and ecological protection was developed and solved and the results show that 1 under different hydrological conditions there are competitive relationships of different degrees among the various objectives of the cascade reservoirs in wujiang river basin with the most substantial competition lying between the two benefits of pg and esd and the intensity of the competition ascends with the increase of natural inflow 2 natural inflow has a significant influence on the benefit of each target at large favourably particularly on power generation moreover the positive effects of inflow can be more fully extended through reliable trade offs for the benefit of environmental protection in wet years and water supply in normal years 3 the pdm can effectively shrink the pareto solution set and reduce the difficulty of decision making the pd and ped can quantify the complex internal feedback relationship among different goals and assist decision makers in making trade offs on the interests of multiple subjects 4 the pdm is based entirely on the pareto set itself which requires no additional data making it simple to utilize and can be extended into solving other modps several improvements can be incorporated into our proposed method first when facing four five or even higher dimensional objectives problem how to further promote the pdm need more derivation in addition for different river sections in the upper middle and lower reaches of the cascade reservoir group system decision makers preferences tend to change at different stages in the full cycle of reservoir operation how to adapt to the spatial and temporal variability of decision makers preferences is also an issue worthy of continued further study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research was funded by the national key

2974,the key to formulating a multi objective reservoir operation scheme is coordinating the high low priorities and achieving balance among various targets accordingly in the decision making process however the traditional decision making methods are either completely subjective or neglect the decision maker s preferences making it essential to optimize these methods to address such unsatisfactory aspects therefore through drawing on some universally acknowledged economic theories and studying the geometric relationships among the pareto solutions to such multi objective decision making problems the concepts of replacement rate profit loss sensitivity ratio and preference equilibrium degree are introduced deduced and elaborated on in this paper on the basis of them the preference decision method pdm entrusted with strict mathematical and physical connotations is constructed and derived in detail especially for addressing the bi objective and tri objective scenarios the pdm can quantify the complex internal feedback relationship among various targets providing objective support for decision makers in the subjective trade offs of the interests of multiple subjects and achieving the unity of subjective and objective furthermore the proposed method is applied to the wujiang cascade reservoirs in china through which the benefits of power generation water supply and ecological protection are enabled to be considered simultaneously the application shows that the pdm can effectively shrink the pareto set which greatly reduces the difficulty of decision making and the obtained results prove feasible and satisfactory in addition the pdm is based entirely on the pareto set itself making it simple to utilize and can be extended into solving other multi objective decision making problems keywords multi objective decision making trade off preference reservoir operation utility gini coefficient abbreviations rr replacement rate plsr profit loss

guarantee rate esd ecological satisfaction degree data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a reservoir can change the natural runoff process through water storage and discharge to alleviate the uneven temporal distribution of water resources wang et al 2016 with the growing population and awareness of environmental issues the functional requirements for reservoirs have been continuously expanding not only concerning the initial objective of power generation but also to those of water supply ecological protection flood control shipping and others bai et al 2015 yang et al 2016 liu et al 2017 de la cruz courtois et al 2021 wu et al 2022a however irreconcilable conflicts among these goals do exist leading to one goal often being achieved at the expense of others wang et al 2020 therefore it is rather tricky and of concern to find a comprehensive satisfactory scheme to achieve the best benefits of all objectives in the actual decision making process of reservoir operation the key to formulating a feasible reservoir operation scheme is to cope with the relationships among various competitive or coordinated targets that are difficult to quantify sort out the priorities and achieve balance among them which essentially turns into a multi objective decision making problem modp labadie 2004 ngo et al 2007 generally for addressing modps there are three available solving techniques priori progressive and posteriori coello coello et al 2002 the priori and progressive techniques can transform a multi objective problem mop into a single objective one yet with either of the two methods applied abundant information is omitted which theoretically could have been taken into consideration to some extent and the decision makers can hardly compare their final decisions with the other schemes to obtain a comparatively reliable support while the posteriori technique has gained an edge over them in that through this technique a more comprehensive decision making scheme set can be obtained with relatively less interference by subjective factors and higher computational efficiency thus it has been widely used in the current multi objective operation of reservoir groups yang et al 2020 the posteriori techniques include two processes multi objective optimization moo and multi criteria decision making mcd ridha et al 2021 with the development of multi objective evolutionary algorithms the pareto frontier emerges representing a set of non dominated solutions regarding conflicts and incomparability among objectives cohon 1978 and is considered the carrier and direct embodiment of multi dimensional targets interactive feedback relations how to obtain the pareto approximate of the optimization problem is something that the moo process has been working on in comparison the mcd process requires selecting and ranking a group of available choices leveraging the obtained information garg and kumar 2018 during the process a final choice will be made after a thorough review of the several indices of different implementable operation schemes manifesting various benefit combinations of the objectives mentioned beforehand the pareto sets carrying immense information gradually become the central processing target of mcd with the posteriori technique introduced and utilized according to real time information decision preferences and some other information some specific evaluation methods or screening tools are to be used to sort and optimize the pareto set and select one solution malekmohammadi et al 2011 such a solution represents a satisfactory scheme that meets the actual needs one evaluation method commonly applied to such kinds of problems is the simple additive weighting method maximum minimum weighting method saaty 2003 though intuitive the method can be somewhat subjective when assigning weights to different objectives in fact it isn t easy to establish a generally satisfactory weighting method because the benefits of different objectives can vary greatly in importance in different situations with the deepening of research new evaluation methods and theories such as analytic hierarchy process ahp li et al 2020 grey system gs li et al 2015 luo and wang 2012 vague set vs alhazaymeh and hassan 2015 şahin and liu 2017 set pair analysis spa garg and kumar 2018 and fuzzy decision method fdm baghapour et al 2020 have provided new ideas for addressing mcd unfortunately these decision making methods are subjective or have no precise physical meaning they fail to answer the critical question of how an increase or decrease in one benefit will lead to changes in other benefits leaving the decision makers in a chaotic state in addition formulating a qualified reservoir operation scheme requires reasonably considering the decision makers subjective preferences and providing them with enough objective information to assist them in clearly understanding the consequences and implications of their choice and preference it is a great challenge to quantify the trade offs among objectives of the cascade reservoir system smith et al 2019 which is essential and critical for decision makers and stakeholders to make more rational decisions on operation schemes concerning dealing with the relationships of different objectives and making trade offs visual analysis is one of the most basic tools that vividly visualize the trade offs among objectives in graphical form reed and kollat 2013 it can help identify key decision variables and guides the balanced regulation of multi objective benefits kim et al 2006 the visual analysis has been effectively applied in dealing with trade off problems such as water allocation fu et al 2013 reservoir operation hurford et al 2014 and sewage treatment meng et al 2016 nevertheless visual analysis usually fails to fully reveal the complex relationships among objectives or to assess their competitiveness objectively which means that further research is needed to quantify the interactive feedback among objectives some scholars have focused on the geometric properties of the distribution of pareto solutions in the objective space some scholars have made some explorations on enhancing visual analysis tang et al 2019 defined the conflict evaluation index by projecting the pareto frontier and measuring the distribution range of the projection to evaluate the intensity of competition quantitatively wu et al 2020 derived the substitutive relationship between power generation and ecological protection by fitting the mathematical expression of the frontier wang et al 2022 proposed two indicators competitiveness index and competition efficiency index to reconstruct the pareto set between the two objectives to reduce the decision difficulty regarding the choice of specific solutions the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis tzeng and huang 2011 method is widely used further based on the diminishing marginal substitution rate law researchers believe that the knee point of the pareto frontier has unique advantages li et al 2021 find the tangent point to the pareto front as the best compromise solution by constructing a linear spline utility function of the pareto front wu et al 2022b defined the ratio of the slope of the line between the scattered points as a multi objective trade off index to quantify the relationships among different objectives however these studies have done a lot of mathematical derivation which is a meaningful attempt still there is no strict physical connotation and cannot explain the practical significance of each step of the mathematical operation in addition through these methods decision makers can only be given a mathematically optimal choice without any opportunity to weigh trade offs subjectively more specifically the research on quantitative trade offs is still relatively preliminary mostly limited to the analysis of two dimensional relations and there is a lack of effective analytical means for high dimensional mcd in summary the existing technology for the mcd in reservoir operation is still relatively rough usually these decision methods are directly introduced into application situations and rarely combined with the interactive feedback relationships among the multiple objectives of the reservoir itself as a result it can be wholly subjective or the decision maker s preferences can not be considered however these explorations are compelling and inspiring by referring to the concepts of price performance ratio utility and gini coefficient in economics this paper deduces the trade offs among non inferior schemes themselves in detail it puts forward a novel practical ranking framework for mcd based on pareto sets namely the preference degree decision making method pdm compared to subjective methods represented by the ahp the pdm is equipped with strict mathematical and physical connotations moreover compared to objective methods based on knee points the pdm is capable of providing reliable support for decision makers to make decisions according to their preferences and comprehensively realizing the integration of subjective and objective aspects the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 shows the detailed derivation process of the proposed pdm for the basic bi objective situation and the extended tri objective case regarding mcd section 3 takes the wujiang river basin in southwest china as a study case and establishes a cascade operation model for decision making over three objectives power generation ecological protection and water supply section 4 applies the pdm to decision making on optimal reservoir operation and discusses its advantages over existing methods section 5 concludes the paper 2 methodology the trade offs of multiple objectives in mcd are similar to some economic problems in the underlying logic based on this understanding the pdm is proposed in this paper and its analytical steps are summarized and shown in the following fig 1 the corresponding mathematical derivation is carried out as below 2 1 pdm for bi objective optimization problems assuming that x n n 1 2 n is one of the non inferior solutions of a mop with a population size of n the pareto solution set of the problem is x x 1 x 2 x n x n the solutions to all actual problems whether their original objective form is min max or min min max max can eventually be transformed into a min min max max form by adding a positive or negative sign to the objective function based on this this paper s subsequent derivation of the quantification process for the pareto frontier is carried out in the objective space of the min min form in real life when people buy items they often consider how much more services can be obtained by spending an additional amount of money to measure the affordability of items which is the price performance ratio schindele et al 2020 comparably in terms of a bi objective optimization problem any non inferior solution xn corresponds to an objective function value f 1 n f 2 n of two dimensions to quantify the extent to which a change in the value of one objective function causes a change in another objective with reference to the price performance ratio a novel concept replacement rate was put forward in this paper denoted as r and the following definitions apply definition 1 replacement rate rr replacement rate r 1 r 2 is the absolute average tangent value of the intersection angles θ 1 θ 2 between the vectors formed by any point on the pareto front and both its two adjacent points separately and their corresponding f 1 axis f 2 axis components in particular for either of the two endpoints of the pareto front the vector is formed by the point itself and the nearest adjacent point and r 1 r 2 equals the absolute tangent value of the intersection angle between the vector and its corresponding f 1 axis f 2 axis component first all non inferior solutions are numbered with i i 1 2 n according to the order of values of the objective function f 1 sorted from small to large all of the functions corresponding to the i th solution are numbered with i as well and then the rr of the two objective functions corresponding to each solution numbered with i on the pareto frontier is 1 r 1 i tan θ 1 i f 2 2 f 2 1 f 1 2 f 1 1 i 1 1 2 f 2 i f 2 i 1 f 1 i f 1 i 1 f 2 i 1 f 2 i f 1 i 1 f 1 i i 2 3 n 1 f 2 n f 2 n 1 f 1 n f 1 n 1 i n 2 r 2 i tan θ 2 i f 1 2 f 1 1 f 2 2 f 2 1 i 1 1 2 f 1 i f 1 i 1 f 2 i f 2 i 1 f 1 i 1 f 1 i f 2 i 1 f 2 i i 2 3 n 1 f 1 n f 1 n 1 f 2 n f 2 n 1 i n where i is the number assigned to the non inferior solutions based on the ascending order of values of the objective function f 1 n is the total number of non inferior solutions r 1 i r 2 i is the rr of f 2 relative to f 1 f 1 relative to f 2 at the i th non inferior solution which hereinafter is described as the rr of f 1 f 2 θ 1 i θ 2 i is the intersection angle between the vectors formed by the i th non inferior solution point and both adjacent points separately and the f 1 axis f 2 axis components f 1 i f 2 i are respectively the values of the two objective functions corresponding to the i th non inferior solution taking the pareto frontier of the bi objective optimization benchmark test problem zdt2 as an example the geometric expression of the rr concept is shown in fig 2 below actually even if the absolute change of one objective function remains the same when the other objective function values change by one unit the relative impact considerably varies depending on the place of the objective function values where such change occurs that s why decision makers often consider the relative influence degree rather than the absolute value change in engineering practice which is similar to the law of diminishing marginal utility brewer and venaik 2010 in economics manifesting that when consumers consume a certain commodity incrementally the total utility may still increase whereas the unit utility of the goods is gradually decreasing therefore to meet the needs of examining the relative influence degree in multi objective decision making the concept profit loss sensitivity ratio was proposed and defined below denoted as δ with the concept of unit utility in economics used for reference definition 2 profit loss sensitivity ratio plsr profit loss sensitivity ratio is the ratio of the rr of one axis component f 1 or f 2 to the corresponding objective function value for a non inferior solution on the pareto frontier the formula is as follows 3 δ 1 i r 1 i f 1 i f 1 i 0 i 1 2 n 4 δ 2 i r 2 i f 2 i f 2 i 0 i 1 2 n where δ 1 i and δ 2 i are respectively the plsr of f 1 and f 2 at the i th non inferior solution which represents the sensitivity of the rr to the change of the objective function value considering the different units and orders of magnitude of each objective in the actual mops the plsr is made dimensionless through data normalization as follows 5 ε 1 i δ 1 i i 1 n δ 1 i i 1 2 n 6 ε 2 i δ 2 i i 1 n δ 2 i i 1 2 n where ε 1 i and ε 2 i are respectively the normalized plsr n plsr of f 1 and f 2 at the i th non inferior solution at this point with the concepts of price performance ratio and unit utility in economics utilized for reference the degree of gains or losses caused by each non inferior solution of mops can be quantitatively compared through the rr and plsr however there are too many individuals in the pareto set making it unrealistic to compare all of them in actual decision making therefore optimizing the decision making process and improving the simplicity of trade offs is necessary the concept of non dominated sorting is used for reference to simplify the scope of decision making the dominance relationship of either set of n plsrs ɛ 1 and ε 2 is compared a non inferior solution subset is acquired by secondary screening and finally the solution individuals most sensitive to profit and loss are obtained and included in the decision support set 7 x x u x x v x ε 1 v ε 1 u ε 2 v ε 2 u where x is the decision support set that is the subset of non inferior solutions after screening x is the original non inferior solution set xu and xv represent different non inferior solution individuals with different numbers according to the physical meaning of the plsr for an individual solution the obtained profit and loss percentage will change faster with a more considerable relative weight of plsr for one target thus the decision makers are prone to select and optimize this target to achieve greater benefits based on such understanding on the basis of the n plsr a concept preference degree is proposed in this paper denoted as ω the value range of which is 0 1 definition 3 preference degree pd preference degree is the relative weight of the n plsr for the two axis components of each solution in the decision support set the calculation formula is as follows 8 ω 1 m ε 1 m ε 1 m ε 2 m m 1 2 m 9 ω 2 m ε 2 m ε 1 m ε 2 m m 1 2 m where m is the scale of decision support set x m is the number assigned to the element in the decision support set based on the order of values of the objective function f 1 arranged in ascending order ω 1 m and ω 2 m are the pds of m th non inferior solution towards the objective function f 1 and f 2 respectively there is ω 1 m ω 2 m 1 the pd ω 1 m ω 2 m essentially reflects the extent to which the decision makers prefer to optimize one specific objective at each individual solution on the pareto frontier thus it can be used as the preference weight of different optimization objectives notwithstanding in actual decision making comparing different combinations of preference degrees one by one is rather time consuming and labour intensive leading to an index needed to unify the preference degrees towards different goals based on the lorenz curve the gini coefficient ceriani and verme 2012 is often used to express the degree of equality of income distribution in economics to be more specific assuming that the enclosed area between the actual income distribution curve and the absolute equality curve is a and the area at the lower right of the actual income distribution curve is b the quotient of a divided by a b is defined as gini coefficient enlightened by it the equilibrium degree of objective preference can be measured by calculating the proportion of the envelope area to unify the preference degrees towards different objectives therefore referring to the concept of gini coefficient in economics the concept of preference equilibrium degree was proposed in this paper denoted as e with its value range 0 1 definition 4 preference area pa the preference area is the rectangular area formed by a pd s two axis components as two lateral edges at a non inferior solution in particular if the two axis components of the preference degree are equal the area turns out to be the largest called the balanced preference area bpa the value range of pa is 0 0 25 and the geometric expression of the pa is shown in fig 3 definition 5 preference equilibrium degree ped the preference equilibrium degree is the quotient of actual pa divided by bpa calculated as follows 10 e m ω 1 m ω 2 m 1 4 where em represents the ped at m th non inferior solution with its value range 0 1 the higher the value the more the bias towards the two objectives converges the ped at each non inferior solution combined with the specific pd can be used for reference to provide a feasible and effective solution for decision making the economic concepts involved in the proposed method pdm and their mapping are shown in table 1 below 2 2 pdm for tri objective optimization problems based on the research on the bi objective optimization problems taking the min min min problem as an example the pdm was further developed and expanded in this paper to address the tri objective optimization decision making problems following the idea of coping with two objective optimization problems the individuals are numbered in the non inferior solution set x of the tri objective optimization problems whereas compared with the bi objective optimization problems the spatial distribution of the pareto frontier of the tri objective optimization problems is way more complex as for the bi objective problems a specific value of the objective function f 1 corresponds to a unique value of f 2 meaning that there will be a unique solution individual however in the tri objective problems a specific value of the objective function f 1 may correspond to multiple solution individuals for which the numbering method needs to be improved the new numbering system is implemented according to the order of distance values ln arranged in ascending order between the non inferior solution individuals x n f 1 n f 2 n f 3 n and the origin of spatial coordinates o 0 0 0 11 l n f 1 n 2 f 2 n 2 f 3 n 2 where ln is the spatial euclidean distance between the non inferior solution individual and the origin the rr is also used for tri objective optimization problems to quantitatively investigate the change degree of the other two objectives caused by the value change of one objective function in calculating the rr it is a precondition to decern one or two points adjacent to a specific point on the pareto front based on the new numbering system however compared with the bi objective problems where the adjacent points can be found simply by discerning the number assigned to the solution individuals the process is more complex for the tri objective optimization problems first the spatial euclidean distance between the point xi and the other points on the pareto front is calculated with 12 l i i o 1 3 f o i f o i 2 where lii is the euclidean distance between two solution individuals i and i o is the number of objective functions o 1 2 3 the two points with the shortest spatial euclidean distance from xi are selected denoted as the nearest point xj and the second nearest point xk then it is judged whether the sequent connection of xj xi and xk is strictly monotonicallyincreasing decreasing or not i e whether it meets the following requirements 13 f 1 j f 1 i f 1 k f 1 j f 1 i f 1 k f 2 j f 2 i f 2 k f 2 j f 2 i f 2 k f 3 j f 3 i f 3 k f 3 j f 3 i f 3 k if satisfied xi is called an internal point otherwise an external point in particular when an external point xi and its nearest point xj meet the requirement of f 1 i f 1 j f 2 i f 2 j f 3 i f 3 j the external point xi actually becomes a two dimensional 2d point assuming that x 1 is the set composed of all internal points x 2 of all external points and x 3 of all 2d points it is evident that the relationship between the three sets is as follows 14 x 1 x 2 x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 2 referring to the definition of the rr in the bi objective optimization problems the calculation rule of the tri objective rr is formulated as follows as for an internal point it is the average tangent value of the intersection angles between the vectors composed of the specific point and its nearest point second nearest point separately and the corresponding axis component respectively for an external point it is the tangent value of the intersection angle formed by the vector composed of the point and its nearest point and the corresponding axis component in particular for 2d points the rr of the objective dimensions with equal values is 0 15 r o i tan θ o ij tan θ o ik 2 x i x 1 tan θ o ij f o i f o j x i x 2 0 f o i f o j x i x 3 o 1 2 3 16 tan θ o ij a 1 a o 3 f o i f o j 2 f o i f o j where i is the number of a non inferior solution r o i is the rr of the o th objective relative to the other two objectives at the i th non inferior solution θ o i is the angle between the vector formed by the i th non inferior solution and its nearest point second nearest point separately and its o th axis components f o i is the value of the o th objective function at the i th non inferior solution taking the pareto frontier of the tri objective optimization benchmark test problem dtlz2 as an example the geometric expression of the concept of tri objective rr is shown in fig 4 furthermore the plsr for the tri objective optimization problems are calculated with 17 δ o i r o i f o i f o i 0 x i x o 1 2 3 18 ε o i δ o i i 1 n δ o i o 1 2 3 where δ o i is the plsr of the o th objective function at the i th non inferior solution and ε o i is the n plsr according to the non dominated sorting principle the decision support set via secondary screening is 19 x x u x x v x ε o v ε o u o 1 2 3 and the pd of each solution individual in the decision support set is 20 ω o m ε o m o 1 3 ε o m m 1 2 m o 1 2 3 where m is the scale of decision support set x m is the number assigned to an element in the decision support set based on the order of values arranged from small to large of its spatial euclidean distance from the origin ω o m is the pd of the m th non inferior solution towards the o th objective and there is o 1 3 ω o m 1 in the bi objective optimization decision making problems referring to the concept and calculation method of the gini coefficient the ideas of pa and ped are proposed and utilized in this paper to unify the different pds of the two objectives while to unify the pds for the tri objective optimization problems it is necessary to expand the planar idea of pa to a spatial one i e preference volume definition 6 preference volume pv preference volume is the cuboid volume formed by a pd s three axis components as three adjacent edges at a non inferior solution in particular if the three axis components of the preference degree are equal the volume turns out to be the largest called the balanced preference volume bpv the value range of pv is 0 1 27 and the geometric expression of the pv is shown in fig 5 furthermore as for the tri objective optimization problems the ped is the quotient of the actual pv and the bpv the formula of which is as follows 21 e m o 1 3 ω o m 1 27 where em is the ped of the m th non inferior solution also its value range is 0 1 and the higher the value the more the bias towards the three objectives converges the pdm proposed in this paper respectively for the bi objective and tri objective optimization problems are summarized and compared as shown in table 2 below 3 case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pdm the study applies the method to the operational decision making of the cascade reservoirs on the wujiang river to examine trade offs among power generation water supply and ecological protection 3 1 the study area the wujiang river basin is located at 104 18 109 22 e and 26 07 30 22 n with a total area of 87920km2 the river with its mainstream length of 1037km is the largest tributary on the south bank of the upper yangtze river and a representative river in southwest china the wujiang river basin has a natural drop of 2124m and a channel gradient of 0 205 rich in hydropower resources since the 1970s china has carried out large scale hydropower development in the wujiang river basin and planned a 12 level development scheme in the mainstream except for the baima navigation and hydropower project at the most downstream all the planned hydraulic engineering projects have been completed the geographical location and the water system distribution of the wujiang river basin are shown in fig 6 a out of the 12 reservoirs on the mainstream of the wujiang river five have the above seasonal regulation capacity and for the rest the capacity is daily for the runoff regulation the reservoirs with above seasonal capacity are comparatively worthy of investigation the basic information about these five reservoirs is shown in table 3 their generalized topological relationships with rivers and important hydrological stations are shown in fig 6 b according to the document water distribution plan of wujiang river basin issued by the ministry of water resources of prc the key monitoring sections and requirements for water supply of wujiang river basin are articulated wei and dong 2021 proposed four key sections about the ecological protection of the wujiang river and established the minimum flow requirements for maintaining a healthy ecological condition these key sections are also marked in fig 6 b 3 2 multi objective operation model of reservoir group the complex demand for power generation water supply and river ecological protection of the wujiang river basin can be abstracted into the following mathematical model composed of three objective functions and five constraints related to reservoir operation 3 2 1 objective functions 1 energy target the maximum total power generation pg of the cascade reservoirs is defined by 22 f 1 max e max i 1 i t 1 t n i t δ t 23 n i t k i q i t h i t where e kw h is the total pg of the cascade reservoirs i and t are the total number of cascade reservoirs and the total period length respectively ni t kw is the output of the i th reservoir during the t th period qi t m3 s and hi t m are the corresponding discharge and water head respectively ki is the output coefficient of the i th reservoir and δt h is the length of a specific interval 2 water supply target the maximum water supply guarantee rate wsgr is 24 f 2 max g max m 1 m t 1 t g m t mt 25 g m t q m t d m t q m t d m t 1 q m t d m t where g is the total wsgr of the cascade reservoirs and m is the total number of key sections for water supply gm t is the wsgr of the m th section during the t th period and dm t m3 s is the corresponding water demand flow requirement designated by the water distribution plan of wujiang river basin mentioned above 3 ecological protection target the maximum ecological satisfaction degree esd is 26 f 3 max s max n 1 n t 1 t s n t nt 27 s n t q n t ec o n t q n t eco n t 1 q n t e c o n t where s is the total esd of the cascade reservoirs and n is the total number of key sections for ecological protection sn t is the esd of the n th section during the t th period and econ t m3 s is the corresponding optimal ecological flow which refers to the achievements of wei and dong 2021 3 2 2 constraint conditions 1 water balance constraint 28 v i t v i t 1 q i t q i t e i t δ t where vi t vi t 1 m3 are the storage capacity of the i th reservoir at the end and the beginning of the t th period respectively qi t qi t and ei t m3 s are the average inflow discharge and loss of the i th reservoir during the t th period respectively 2 water level constraint 29 z i t min z i t z i t max where zi t zi t min and zi t max m are the real time lower limit and upper limit water level of the i th reservoir at the end of the t th period respectively 3 discharge constraint 30 q i t min q i t q i t max where qi t min and qi t max m3 s are the minimum and maximum discharge of the i th reservoir during the t th period respectively generally as a function of the corresponding reservoir water level 4 output constraint 31 n i t n i t max where ni t max kw is the maximum output of the i th reservoir during the t th period which is equivalent to the installed capacity of the reservoir 5 discharge variation amplitude constraint 32 q i t q i t 1 δ q i where δqi m3 s is the maximum discharge variation amplitude of the i th reservoir which aims to control the discharge making it as stable as possible 3 3 datasets this study extracted the daily runoff data of key hydrological stations in the wujiang river basin from the past 64 years 1956 2019 from the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china the study also reviewed the reliability consistency and representativeness of the data the flow of three stations respectively wujiangdu upstream midstream boundary section sinan midstream downstream boundary section and wulong basin outlet section were arranged by the p iii distribution zhang et al 2018 lei et al 2019 raynal villaseñor 2021 the flow values corresponding to the frequencies of 25 50 and 75 on the p iii curve are taken as the design values in wet normal and dry years respectively based on the flow situation of the upper middle and lower reaches three years 1960 1979 and 1976 in which the measured values are similar to the design values were selected as typical years to represent the conditions of dry normal and wet situations the detailed parameters of reservoirs were obtained from the management departments 4 results and discussion the simulation of the multi objective operation model in section 3 2 was carried out using the measured flow data of three typical years as input the discharge flows from individual reservoirs as the decision variable with a 10 day operation scale the solutions were dealt with through the improved va nsga iii algorithm ni et al 2019 to obtain the non inferior ones in dry normal and wet years 4 1 visual analysis drawing the non inferior solution points of the three objective functions in the three dimensional space the pareto frontiers of the mop of wujiang cascade reservoirs in typical dry normal and wet years are shown in figs 7 9 as below in terms of the interrelationship of the various objectives obviously there is an intense competition between the two objectives of pg vs esd in contrast the competitions between pg vs wsgr and wsgr vs esd although also observed are significantly weaker in addition looking more specifically at the benefit values for each objective as shown in fig 10 they played out differently under different hydrological conditions all three targets can be better optimized when the inflow is abundant of which the improvement of pg is the most obvious in particular the water supply target can be fully met in the wet year from this it can be inferred that inflow s positive role can be further exploited and augmented to the ecological benefit in a wet year and the water supply benefit in a normal year by reliably weighing through visual analysis it can be clearly understood that coordinating the three objectives of power generation water supply and ecological protection for the wujiang cascade reservoirs effectively involves a trade off between pg and esd considering the water supply target is more accessible to satisfy than the other two especially in a wet year when only two targets need to be traded off in comparison the trade offs among the three objectives can be more complex in a dry year 4 2 decision on operation schemes the pdm proposed in section 2 was applied to quantify the three objectives trade offs and decide the appropriate operation schemes all non inferior solutions were classified according to equation 13 and the corresponding results are marked in figs 7 and 8 the rr and n plsr of each solution were calculated in turn and the sub solution sets were filtered according to the principle of non dominated sorting as shown in fig 11 below comparing figs 7 9 reveals that the number of sub set solutions has been significantly reduced compared to the original solution set which greatly reduces the difficulty of decision making the pd to each target and the total ped of all solutions in the subsets were calculated according to equation 20 21 and equation 8 10 respectively as shown in table a1 a3 in the appendix suppose the decision maker prefers the benefits of the three objectives to be evenly distributed in that case the solution with the greatest ped value of e in table a1 a3 will be chosen as the final decision scheme otherwise if the decision maker has a stronger preference for any specific target the solution with a relatively more minor ped value of e and a more extensive pd to this target value of ω 1 or ω 2 or ω 3 will be chosen as the decision scheme the overall process is intuitive and easy to operate as an example the decision maker has no particular preference for any target the schemes 78 144 and 22 in table a1 a3 can be selected as the operation schemes for dry normal and wet years respectively the benefits obtained with the chosen schemes are shown in table 4 and the corresponding reservoirs water level processes are shown in fig 12 as a result by optimizing the operation of the five reservoirs through the proposed pdm in this paper the natural runoff can be fully used and the comprehensive benefits can be enhanced considerably the specific performance is shown as rationally increasing discharge during the non flood season and utilizing the inflow during the flood season to replenish the water storage for the continuous profit making function after the end of the flood season 4 3 discussion with existing technology as mentioned earlier many technologies are available for mcd in reservoir operation and the application of pdm shows unique advantages as shown in fig 11 pdm can effectively shrink the solution set and reduce the decision difficulty the ε dominance based technique kollat and reed 2007 and the competitiveness index method wang et al 2022 have made fruitful attempts on the practical limiting solution set the difference is that the ε dominance based technique improves the moo process for the evolutionary algorithm based on nsga ii using the ε dominance strategy to improve the algorithm s efficiency without involving decision making in comparison the competitiveness index method screens pareto solutions based on the competitive efficiency among objectives these methods limit the non inferior solutions to a smaller size than the pdm method still they can only retain a few solutions with the most conflicting benefits and will likely ignore some win win options many existing studies on the mcd process are inspired by the same economic idea of diminishing marginal utility as pdm such as the method of finding the knee area points of the pareto frontier li et al 2021 and quantifying individual linkage slope wu et al 2022b these methods are fruitful and have a solid mathematical theoretical basis in fact the shrunk solution set of the pdm is likely to contain the knee point solutions obtained by the above methods the difference is that these approaches are dedicated to providing a monotonous option to the decision maker weakening their subjective initiative however actual reservoir operation activities often require considering different external conditions and a monotonous theoretical optimal scheme cannot meet the practical needs the pdm takes a step forward relative to these methods by drawing on the idea of the gini coefficient two indicators pd and ped are proposed to quantify the degree of decision maker s bias toward specific goals at different solutions and provide an intuitive reference for decision makers subjective trade offs in addition the simplicity of practical engineering operation is also an advantage of the pdm over other methods overall the most significant advantage of the pdm over existing technologies is that it can provide precise and reliable objective support for decision maker s subjective preferences which is more in line with the significance of trade off in engineering practice finally the above case study is a deterministic simulation operation using runoffs of three historical years besides the pdm can also be applied to real time operation through the loop of hydrological forecast optimization decision making reservoir status update 5 conclusion aiming at the trade offs among objectives in mcd this paper proposed the concepts of rr plsr and ped and derived the pdm in the bi objective and tri objective scenarios the pdm is based on the geometric relationship among pareto solutions and uses universally acknowledged ideas of economics for reference the method tries to provide a solid support for decision maker s subjective preferences in a clear quantitative and objective manner and can achieve the unification of subjectivity and objectivity applying the pdm to the cascade reservoirs in wujiang river basin a multi objective operation model with power generation water supply and ecological protection was developed and solved and the results show that 1 under different hydrological conditions there are competitive relationships of different degrees among the various objectives of the cascade reservoirs in wujiang river basin with the most substantial competition lying between the two benefits of pg and esd and the intensity of the competition ascends with the increase of natural inflow 2 natural inflow has a significant influence on the benefit of each target at large favourably particularly on power generation moreover the positive effects of inflow can be more fully extended through reliable trade offs for the benefit of environmental protection in wet years and water supply in normal years 3 the pdm can effectively shrink the pareto solution set and reduce the difficulty of decision making the pd and ped can quantify the complex internal feedback relationship among different goals and assist decision makers in making trade offs on the interests of multiple subjects 4 the pdm is based entirely on the pareto set itself which requires no additional data making it simple to utilize and can be extended into solving other modps several improvements can be incorporated into our proposed method first when facing four five or even higher dimensional objectives problem how to further promote the pdm need more derivation in addition for different river sections in the upper middle and lower reaches of the cascade reservoir group system decision makers preferences tend to change at different stages in the full cycle of reservoir operation how to adapt to the spatial and temporal variability of decision makers preferences is also an issue worthy of continued further study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research was funded by the national key
