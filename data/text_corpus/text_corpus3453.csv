17265,aquatic ecosystems are exposed to multiple stressors such as agricultural run off aro and climate change related increase of temperature we aimed to determine how aro and the frequency of its input can affect shallow lake ecosystems through direct and indirect effects on primary producers and primary consumers and whether warming can mitigate or reinforce the impact of aro we performed a set of microcosm experiments simulating aro using a cocktail of three organic pesticides terbuthylazine tebuconazole pirimicarb copper and nitrate two experiments were performed to determine the direct effect of aro on primary producers submerged macrophytes periphyton and phytoplankton and on the grazing snail lymnaea stagnalis respectively three different aro concentrations added as single doses or as multiple pulses at two different temperatures 22 c and 26 c were applied in a third experiment primary producers and consumers were exposed together to allow trophic interactions when functional groups were exposed alone aro had a direct positive effect on phytoplankton and a strong negative effect on l stagnalis when exposed together primary producer responses were contrasting as the negative effect of aro on grazers led to an indirect positive effect on periphyton periphyton in turn exerted a strong control on phytoplankton leading to an indirect negative effect of aro on phytoplankton macrophytes showed little response to the stressors multiple pulse exposure increased the effect of aro on l stagnalis and periphyton when compared with the same quantity of aro added as a single dose the increase in temperature had only limited effects our results highlight the importance of indirect effects of stressors here mediated by grazers and periphyton and the frequency of

ecosystems are severely affected by anthropogenic stressors barnosky et al 2011 butchart et al 2010 and aquatic ecosystems are particularly threatened reid et al 2019 in this context it is crucial to determine the mechanisms by which the impact of stressors on specific organisms can alter ecosystem state and functioning bruder et al 2019 aquatic ecosystems are exposed to multiple anthropogenic stressors jackson et al 2016 ormerod et al 2010 partially originating from local sources such as agricultural activities ippolito et al 2015 malaj et al 2014 stehle and schulz 2015 agricultural run off aro is not only responsible for high nutrient input but it also contains multiple xenobiotics such as herbicides insecticides fungicides and trace metals that might affect ecosystems and interact with other stressors in an unpredictable way schriever et al 2007 nutrient and pesticide input to adjacent waterbodies through aro is highly dependent on the strength and frequency of rain events and agricultural practices therefore aquatic ecosystems are frequently exposed to multiple pulses of nitrates and pesticides with variable intensity daouk et al 2013 liess et al 1999 reinert et al 2002 further complicating the assessment and prediction of aro effects existing studies on aro revealed severe effects on aquatic ecosystem processes such as primary production and ecosystem respiration peters et al 2013 multiple pulse exposure to pollutants and nutrients can modulate the effects compared to a single or continuous exposure davis et al 2019 reinert et al 2002 varga et al 2019 in addition to local stressors global warming affects aquatic ecosystems by influencing the metabolic rates of organisms brown et al 2004 gillooly et al 2001 as well as their sensitivity towards stressors cuco et al 2016 debecker et al 2017 delnat et al 2019 all the different stressors may have interactive effects but determining how multiple stressors interact is challenging jackson et al 2016 especially in complex systems where biotic interactions lead to indirect effects bruder et al 2019 shallow lakes are ideal ecosystems to address the aforementioned challenges as they are the most abundant waterbodies worldwide verpoorter et al 2014 often exposed to aro hijosa valsero et al 2016 and prone to warming adrian et al 2009 the state of a shallow lake ecosystem is shaped by biotic interactions among and between primary producers and higher trophic levels and thus they respond non linearly to nutrient loading with rapid shifts between two alternative stable states a macrophyte dominated clear water state and a phytoplankton dominated turbid state scheffer and van nes 2007 scheffer et al 1993 such shifts have severe consequences for several ecosystem functions hilt et al 2017 and services janssen et al 2020 both warming and exposure to aro have been shown to affect macrophytes mckee et al 2002 phytoplankton donald et al 2011 huisman et al 2018 paerl and huisman 2008 zhao et al 2019a periphyton piggott et al 2015 and primary consumers schaum et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 increasing temperature and nutrient loading were predicted to increase the probability of a shift toward the turbid state moss et al 2011 scheffer et al 2015 while the effects of other pollutants including pesticides trace metal elements trace organics pharmaceuticals and vanity products remained largely unexplored phillips et al 2016 combining expertise from ecology and ecotoxicology can help elucidating the complexity of stressor and biotic interactions in shallow lakes e g by using microcosm experiments providing a higher ecological realism than single species exposed to stressors such as pollutants such experiments will reveal direct and indirect effects on interacting functional groups in aquatic communities an essential prerequisite to predict and eventually mitigate the impact of global warming by controlling local stressors scheffer et al 2015 here we investigated in microcosms the combined effect of global warming and aro on two trophic levels primary producers and their consumers representative of shallow lake ecosystems we hypothesised that 1 aro and warming will affect primary producer and consumer development particularly we expected that aro will cause a shift towards a phytoplankton dominance and that warming will increase this aro effect we also expected that 2 direct effects on some organisms will affect others indirectly through biotic interactions we further hypothesise that 3 multiple pulses of aro will favour the overall resistance of the ecosystem in comparison to a single pulse treatment with the same overall amount of pollutant added to the microcosms because a more progressive input of toxicants would allow organisms to acclimate to this stressor the three microcosm experiments were performed mimicking aro containing nitrate copper and typical organic pesticides with different exposure modes addition of aro by a single or multiple pulses and warming following the ipcc rcp 8 5 scenario 4 c ipcc 2014 the effects of these stressors were evaluated on microcosms containing only the primary producers only the grazers or both with the overall aim to gain a mechanistic understanding of direct and indirect effects of two major environmental stressors affecting shallow aquatic ecosystems we used structural equation modelling to determine further causal linkages between these stressors and observed effects 2 material and methods three microcosm experiments were performed in experiments 1 and 2 respectively primary producers and grazers were exposed independent of each other to aro and warming while in experiment 3 they were exposed together to allow for trophic interactions the microcosms were incubated at two different temperatures and exposed to a cocktail of pesticides copper and nitrate designed to mimic the effect of aro see table 1 for aro composition six different aro treatments were used a control without aro three treatments corresponding to the aro at the lowest concentration x twice the lowest concentration 2x and thrice the lowest concentration 3x as a single addition at the beginning of the experiment two treatments with two or three pulses of aro at the lowest concentration x with four day intervals between each addition multiple pulse treatments xx and xxx with the same final amount of aro as in 2x and 3x respectively target temperatures were set at 22 c controls representing typical temperate lake summer temperatures e g mckee et al 2002 sand jensen et al 2019 and 26 c representing the future climate warming scenario we therefore used 12 different combinations of aro and temperature cold control heated control cold 1x heated 1x cold 2x heated 2x cold 3x heated 3x cold xx heated xx cold xxx heated xxx with 5 replicates for each condition in experiment 2 with grazers alone only the 1x and 3x treatments at both temperatures were used in addition the concentration of nitrates was reduced since nitrates would not be consumed in the absence of primary producers table 1 the aro cocktail contained terbuthylazine cas number 5915 41 3 a triazine photosynthesis inhibiting herbicide lorente et al 2015 tebuconazole cas number 107534 96 3 a triazole fungicide known to affect biofilm and phytoplankton artigas et al 2014 pirimicarb cas number 23103

al 2018 all pesticides were pestanal analytical standards merck darmstadt germany concentrations were based on published ec values ec10 20 50 for each organism group available ssd data and some unpublished data on the toxicity of all aro components from these data we identified an effective concentration for each aro pollutant excluding nitrate equivalent to the ec20 for chronic exposure for the most sensitive group which was used as the highest concentration in the subsequent experiments table 1 stock solutions of organic pesticides were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso cas 67 68 5 merck the same amount of dmso was added in all microcosms at a final concentration of 0 125 copper and nitrate kno3 solutions were prepared in milliq water 2 1 experiment 1 primary producers alone in experiment 1 8 l microcosms contained submerged macrophytes myriophyllum spicatum l elodea nuttallii michx and potamogeton perfoliatus l planted in artificial sediments oecd tg 239 2014 modified to replace nutrient salts by 5 g kg 1 nettle powder as fertilizer and ten strains of microalgae si table s1 macrophytes were introduced first to allow rooting before being submitted to competition with phytoplankton and periphyton algae were introduced in the microcosms 9 days after macrophytes and 8 days before aro addition and temperature increase just after a complete water renewal to remove initial differences in algae and nutrient levels that had developed in the microcosms achieved temperatures were 22 5 0 4 c unheated and 25 7 0 4 c heated microcosms microcosms were maintained during 28 days after aro addition with regular water and nutrient addition until final sampling air temperature was maintained at 22 c light at 70 µmol m 2 s 1 16 8 h light dark cycle translucent polypropylene strips were placed in each microcosm for periphyton development monitoring more information on microcosm settings are provided in the supplementary material 2 2 experiment 2 grazers alone the pond snail lymnaea stagnalis was exposed to aro at 22 0 2 c and 26 0 2 c in the absence of any primary producer this species was selected because it is commonly found in shallow freshwater ecosystems feeding primarily on benthic algae and aquatic plants elger et al 2009 it is also a good model in ecotoxicology amorim et al 2019 recently normalized as oecd test guideline oecd 2016 lymnaea stagnalis was obtained from a nearby pond and bred in the laboratory for several generations to obtain a parasite free population individuals were selected to minimise size differences measured and weighed mean shell length sd 13 7 1 3 mm mean total weight 202 58 mg each snail was placed in a 12 cm diameter 30 cm high cylindrical glass aquarium filled with 1 l of volvic water with temperature control as in experiment 1 snails were starved for 12 h before simultaneous addition of aro and ten pre weighed 12 mm diameter lettuce discs organically grown after 24 h the remaining leaf discs were collected and freeze dried additional lettuce discs were used to determine initial dry mass and the dry mass of lettuce consumed by each snail was determined the snails were then fed ad libitum with lettuce for 21 days water evaporation in the aquaria was compensated by addition of deionised water twice a week the light cycle was 16 8 light dark with only 5 µmol m 2 s 1 irradiance to control possible algal development at the end of the experiment snails were starved for 12 h before a new feeding test was performed with 10 pre weighed 14 mm diameter lettuce discs and stopped after 16 h to avoid complete consumption of the food provided the snails were then measured and weighed 2 3 experiment 3 primary producers and consumers we used the same experimental set up as in experiment 1 but added one individual of l stagnalis one individual of zebra mussel dreissena polymorpha and twenty daphnia magna neonates in each microcosm snail individuals collected as in experiment 2 had an initial mean sd shell length of 18 7 2 2 mm and a mean total fresh mass of 0 4 0 1 g including shell zebra mussels collected in a lake were placed in aquaria for 1 week before being transferred to the microcosms and measured using an electronic calliper 16 0 1 2 mm individuals were selected to be as homogenous in size as possible d magna were bred at the laboratory macrophytes algae and primary consumers were introduced in the mesocosms 10 7 and 3 days before addition of aro respectively to allow for settlement without stressors in addition several adjustments were made due to observations in the first experiment and changes in material availability the organic pesticides were prepared as a 10 fold more concentrated solution and therefore the amount of dmso added to the microcosms was ten times lower 0 01 caco3 at 7 5 g kg 1 was added in the sediment of each microcosm as a buffer to limit potential effects of acidity on the primary consumers an additional plastic strip was added mean water temperatures were 21 4 0 3 c and 23 7 0 3 c in the non heated and heated microcosms respectively final sampling was done 21 days after the addition of aro as it corresponded to the maximal development of phytoplankton in experiment 1 2 4 measured parameters at the end of each experiment water was collected and filtered at 0 7 µm gf f in the filtered water concentrations of nitrate and dissolved phosphorus were determined by ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 sunnyvale ca usa and by ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method respectively afnor 1990 the plastic strips were cut at 20 cm from the bottom and all l stagnalis eggs and juveniles present on the strips were collected and counted periphyton on these strips was scraped and collected with 20 ml of volvic water from the resulting suspension subsamples of 1 5 ml were centrifuged 10000 g 10 min in 2 ml tubes the filters and pellets were stored at 80 c until photosynthetic pigment analysis phytoplankton and periphyton pigments were extracted to estimate total planktonic and periphytic algae biomass and the proportion of diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria pigment extraction was carried out on periphyton and phytoplankton samples after freeze drying by the addition of 2 ml methanol buffered with 2 ammonium acetate 1 m followed by an initial sonication step 3 min at 4 c and 15 min of incubation at 20 c and then a second sonication step pigment extracts were recovered after centrifugation 10000 g 5 min at 2 c the extraction steps were repeated until obtained extracts were no longer visibly coloured all the extracts of the same sample were pooled extracts were filtered through a 0 2 μm ptfe membrane syringe filter vwr international united states and analysed by hplc hplc analysis of pigments was performed as described by capdeville et al 2019 pigments specific to a particular group of primary producer diatoms fucoxanthin diatoxathin and diadinoxanthin green algae chlorophyll b lutein violaxanthin and neoxanthin cyanobacteria zeaxanthin echinenone and myxoxanthophyll were used to assess variation of the different groups of microalgae mackey et al 1996 majdi et al 2011 the total p concentration in periphyton biomass was determined following the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method after persulphate digestion in acidic conditions of freeze dried periphyton subsamples following afnor guidelines afnor 1990 macrophytes were handled as described in gross et al 2018 macrophytes were removed from the sediments and rinsed in water to remove attached particles and epiphytes all the plants of one species were spread in a large tray equipped with a ruler and a picture was taken roots and aboveground parts were separated and rapidly dried aboveground parts were then weighed to estimate macrophyte biomass visible signs of macrophyte consumption by grazers were recorded based on the pictures taken in experiment 3 adult l stagnalis were collected weighed and measured individuals of d polymorpha were collected and measured the presence of dead l stagnalis or d polymorpha was recorded due to a rapid disappearance of d magna in all microcosms no measurement was possible 2 5 statistics aro concentration exposure mode single or multiple pulses of aro addition and temperature effects on the different measured parameters were analysed using an ancova with aro concentration as a continuous variable and temperature and exposure mode as categorical independent variables the effect of exposure mode was analysed using only 2x xx and 3x xxx data with contrast analysis the magnitude of the effects was measured using hedges g hedges 1981 effect size calculated from t statistics derived from the ancova according to berben et al 2012 using the r package esc 2 6 structural equation modelling to explore the simultaneous effect of aro and warming on the interactions between macrophytes phytoplankton periphyton and grazers we built a path analysis subjected to structural equation modelling sem grace et al 2010 sem has been developed as a powerful tool for inferring cause effect relationships among variables via proposed hypotheses tested against data grace et al 2012 grace and irvine 2020 furthermore sem permits the evaluation of direct and indirect effects within a network of variables bruder et al 2019 this approach has been successfully applied to identify the mechanistic pathway underlying the effect of different stressors on aquatic ecosystems alexander et al 2016 2013 majdi et al 2014 rodrigues et al 2018 indeed as a framework for quantitative analyses sem is an extension of univariate mediation analyses taking into account the effect of variable x on variable z through its effect on y grace and irvine 2020 reisner et al 2013 using a priori knowledge we built a full model of cause effect relationships based on hypothetical pathways supported by literature table 1 notably the full model included a direct pathway between aro exposure and phytoplankton biomass and several indirect pathways via competition with periphyton or macrophytes see supplementary figure s6 the hypothetical relationships between variables table 1 was then tested on the correlation matrix of experimental data grace and irvine 2020 reisner et al 2013 we considered all available variables to investigate the interactions among trophic levels using a priori knowledge a full path analysis model was created including simultaneously several hypothetical pathways table 2 through which aro and warming could affect macrophytes phytoplankton periphyton and grazers we only used the biomasses of macrophytes phytoplankton periphyton and grazers from experiment 3 with primary producers and consumers to perform this analysis for the primary consumers only l stagnalis size increase was used as d magna did not develop and no growth was observed on d polymorpha the different directions and kind of interactions among trophic levels were tested then successive full models were simplified by step wise exclusion of variables and or linkages with non significant weights and non significant co variance as estimated by akaike index criterion aic until a minimal adequate model showing specific linkages remained the best model was selected based on its coherence with the direct effect observed in experiments 1 and 2 the adequacy of the final model was determined using quality indicators such as chi² root mean square error of approximation rmsea standardised root mean square residual srmr adjusted goodness of fit index agfi and comparative fit index cfi fan et al 2016 sem was performed using the r package sem 3 results 3 1 experiment 1 effects of stressors on primary producers without consumers aro exposure and elevated temperature had no effect on total macrophyte aboveground biomass fig 1 the exposure mode did not change the effect on macrophytes fig 1 the mean final macrophyte dry mass per microcosm was 0 61 0 24 g with values for individual microcosms ranging from 0 11 to 1 23 g supplementary material fig s1 phytoplankton biomass varied between 2 and 238 µg l 1 chl a and increased with increasing concentrations of aro p 0 041 fig 1 clear water states with low phytoplankton 50 µg l 1 of chl a were observed in all treatments but highly turbid water with high phytoplankton 100 µg l 1 of chl a was observed only at the two higher aro concentrations the exposure mode did not change the effect of aro on phytoplankton warming had no significant effect on phytoplankton fig 1 but favoured green algae fig 2 aro exposure and warming had no significant effect on periphyton biomass with a mean value of 1 08 0 71 µg cm 2 of chl a however we observed a trend for higher periphyton biomass p 0 060 with aro and a higher periphyton biomass with multiple pulses as compared to single additions of the aro p 0 046 fig 1 aro induced an increase of the cyanobacterial pigment chl a ratio in both periphyton and phytoplankton fig 2 aro had no significant effect on the total amount of p contained in periphyton supplementary material fig s5 at the end of the experiment concentrations of soluble reactive phosphate p 0 001 and nitrates p 0 001 were significantly higher in microcosm water with higher aro additions repeated addition of aro resulted in significantly lower dissolved phosphate concentrations compared to treatments with single aro additions p 0 04 while only a marginal difference was recorded for nitrate concentrations p 0 07 fig 1 3 2 experiment 2 effects of stressors on grazers aro exposure strongly reduced l stagnalis growth with a significant effect on its increase in mass and length fig 1 the snail mass increased by 603 32 mg without aro and by only 184 44 mg at the highest aro concentration warming positively influenced length increase but had no effect on snail mass fig 1 aro induced a significant reduction p 0 001 of the consumption rates of l stagnalis at the beginning of the exposure from 8 14 0 79 mg day 1 in the controls to 2 68 0 62 mg day 1 in the 3x treatment similarly after 3 weeks of exposure consumption rates of l stagnalis were 35 lower when exposed to the highest aro dose from 17 9 1 9 mg day 1 in the control to 11 6 2 4 mg day 1 at the 3x aro concentration no effect of warming on consumption rate was observed fig 1 3 3 experiment 3 effects of stressors on interacting primary producers and consumers macrophyte biomass did not respond to aro addition independent of the exposure mode nor warming fig 1 in this experiment aro concentration negatively affected phytoplankton biomass fig 1 and these effects were stronger at the lower temperature indicating an interaction between aro exposure and warming fig 1 the highest phytoplankton biomasses were recorded in the cold control microcosms cold 84 8 36 0 µg l 1 chl a warm 45 0 14 4 µg l 1 chl a conversely aro concentration caused a strong increase of periphyton biomass fig 1 periphyton biomass was very low in control conditions 0 22 0 07 µg cm 2 chl a and 0 38 0 19 µg cm 2 chl a for cold and warm temperatures respectively but was significantly higher with aro especially when added as multiple pulses fig 1 at the highest aro concentration periphyton biomass reached 2 90 0 61 µg cm 2 chl a cold and 3 51 0 67 µg cm 2 chl a when aro was added as multiple pulses xxx while it reached only 2 05 0 60 µg chl a cm 2 in cold and 2 11 0 78 µg chl a cm 2 in warm when aro was added as a single dose 3x aro and particularly exposure to multiple pulses increased the p content of periphyton p 0 001 and p 0 019 warming did not significantly affect final periphyton biomass p 0 48 d magna neonates disappeared in all microcosms except six microcosms where d magna population develop but also disappeared before the end of the experiment aro strongly affected the mussels all of which died at the higher aro concentration independent of frequency of addition while they survived in all control microcosms no clear increase in mussel size was observed in any of the microcosms where they remained alive the snails survived in all the microcosms except one a noticeable size increase 65 8 35 4 and the production of a high number of eggs up to 489 eggs in one microcosm but several microcosms with no visible eggs were observed juvenile snails were also observed principally in the controls supplementary material aro strongly reduced the growth of l stagnalis fig 1 multiple pulses led to a higher reduction of growth than a single addition of aro fig 1 warming had no significant effect on snail growth or reproduction the number of snail eggs was not affected by aro treatments but the number of juveniles was strongly reduced by aro concentration independent of the exposure mode fig 1 damage due to snail feeding on p perfoliatus was observed in 80 of the controls in 44 20 and 30 of the microcosms in the 1x 2x and 3x treatments and in 0 of the microcosms in the multiple pulses xx and xxx treatments aro and warming induced a decrease of the proportion of green algae and an increase of diatoms in the periphyton fig 2 aro also caused an increase of the diatom pigment in the phytoplankton warming negatively affected the growth of m spicatum and e nuttallii but not of p perfoliatus repeated addition of aro had a negative effect on macrophytes when compared with a single addition fig 2 nitrate concentrations at the end of the experiment increased significantly with increasing aro concentrations p 0 001 this effect was stronger in treatments with repeated aro addition as compared to single additions p 0 001 fig 1 concentrations of soluble reactive phosphate were lower in treatments with multiple pulses as compared to single additions warming led to significantly lower dissolved phosphate concentrations p 0 02 fig 1 3 4 structural equation modelling a first sem model was constructed including all possible relationships among measured variables and between the measured variables and experimental parameters table 2 supplementary material fig s6 we did not find a significant relationship between warming and any measured parameter in the sem performed and therefore removed warming effects in the model in the resulting model supplementary material fig s6 only periphyton biomass and snail growth were directly affected by aro to explore further the direct and indirect effects of aro on macrophyte or phytoplankton dominance we used a third model considering only the effect of periphyton on phytoplankton and of periphyton on macrophytes without the respective reciprocal effects fig 3 our model showed a strong positive effect of aro concentration on periphyton development not only directly path 0 59 p 0 001 fig 3 but also indirectly through the negative effect of aro on periphyton grazers fig 3 indeed aro decreased grazer growth which in turn reduced grazer consumption of periphyton leading finally to an increased periphyton development fig 3 we also found a strong negative effect of periphyton on phytoplankton development path 0 69 p 0 001 fig 3 therefore phytoplankton development was indirectly affected by aro through its effect on periphyton our model further indicated no significant relationship between macrophyte biomass and other parameters 4 discussion the combination of experiments with one and two trophic levels allowed us to assess direct and indirect effects of two major environmental stressors climate warming and agricultural run off aro on the functioning of shallow aquatic systems confirming our first hypothesis we showed direct effects of aro on primary producers and primary consumers we further revealed the structuring role of periphyton and their grazers l stagnalis in these systems often described only by the alternative dominance of submerged macrophytes or phytoplankton scheffer and van nes 2007 scheffer et al 1993 repeated exposure to aro as can be expected for shallow aquatic systems in an agricultural landscape enhanced these effects in contrast to our expectations warming by approx 3 5 c did not enhance the negative effects probably because our tested temperature increase did not affect primary producers directly our results underline the importance to increase ecological complexity when evaluating the effect of agricultural run off including pesticides on aquatic systems as single species tests would not be able to reveal all direct and indirect effects in the following we will detail how the results matched with our initial hypotheses 4 1 direct effects of aro and warming on single trophic levels to test our first hypothesis experiments 1 and 2 were designed to determine the effect of the stressors without trophic interactions we observed a positive effect of aro on phytoplankton growth this positive effect may be linked to the presence of nitrate in the aro because it is consistent with what can be expected with nitrate addition in p rich environments donald et al 2011 leavitt et al 2006 paerl and scott 2010 the low amount of remaining nitrate at the end of the experiment further supports a possible effect of nitrate this increase in phytoplankton biomass did not lead to a strong negative competitive effect on macrophytes as could be expected and there was no shift to a typical phytoplankton dominated state however such shifts can be expected under in situ conditions when higher water depth and longer duration result in significant shading of macrophytes by phytoplankton the most remarkable direct effect of aro was a strong inhibition of growth and feeding of the snail l stagnalis this is consistent with the known effect of pesticides and copper on this species amorim et al 2019 tufi et al 2016 indeed tufi et al 2016 observed acetylcholinesterase inhibition on l stagnalis exposed to 3 62 µg l 1 of pirimicarb in our experiment pirimicarb concentration ranged from 5 to 15 µg l 1 tebuconazole and copper are linked to embryotoxicity in terrestrial snails helix aspersa druart et al 2012 the highest concentration of cu used in our study 42 µg l 1 is in the range of the estimated ec50 on juvenile l stagnalis growth rate in a 28 day experiment vlaeminck et al 2019 nitrate cannot be responsible for the negative effect observed because the concentration in our experiment was more than 50 fold below the toxic concentration for any freshwater mollusc soucek and dickinson 2012 the hypothesis that warming will promote phytoplankton dominance could not be confirmed warming did not affect primary producers nor snail feeding activity this result is surprising because warming in the range of our experiments brings both chlorophytes and cyanobacteria closer to their optimum temperature lürling et al 2013 and snail activity was expected to increase with warming in the tested range schaum et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 however a lack of warming effects on macrophytes was also reported in other studies for instance mckee et al 2002 observed no temperature induced change in the development of macrophytes in a 2 year mesocosm experiment with a 3 c warming above ambient temperature similarly feuchtmayr et al 2019 found no effect on primary producers using a 4 c temperature elevation in a 1 year experiment where temperature followed natural variations primary producers may have been driven more by nutrient limitation although we regularly added nutrients than by temperature indeed an antagonistic interaction between warming and nutrient limitation have been observed in several studies birk et al 2020 richardson et al 2019 also studies with an impact of temperature on grazers schaum et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 used a higher temperature difference than our study 4 2 importance of indirect effects mediated by biotic interactions in a more complex system in experiment 3 including both primary producers and grazers the net effect of aro on phytoplankton development was negative and thus opposite to the single trophic level experiment probably due to the toxic effects of aro on periphyton grazers that released periphyton from grazing pressure by this mechanism aro had an indirect positive effect on periphyton in addition to the direct positive effect of aro on periphyton indicated by the sem model a strong negative relationship was also observed between periphyton and phytoplankton probably due to competition between the two functional groups for nutrients more specifically for phosphorus because a decrease in phytoplankton biomass was observed while nitrate was added with the aro the negative effect of aro on l stagnalis was reduced in experiment 3 with primary producers and grazers where the microcosms also included primary producers compared to experiment 2 grazers alone different factors may explain this reduced effect notably the other organisms present may also have led to a reduced exposure of snails due to increased adsorption and degradation of toxicants periphyton also represents a higher quality food than lettuce leading to a decrease in the sensitivity to toxicants fidder et al 2018 vlaeminck et al 2019 beside effects of food quality the available food in terms of periphyton biomass in the control microcosms was very low snail growth may have been food limited thus reducing the magnitude of the observed effect of aro this is supported by the fact that l stagnalis grazing on p perfoliatus was more frequently observed in the control microcosms than in treatments with higher periphyton biomass indicating a limitation in the availability of periphyton that they preferentially graze this effect of resource limitation on snail growth may have led to an underestimation of aro effects on l stagnalis this may have also resulted in an underestimation of the indirect effect of aro on periphyton mediated by snail grazing as well as a lower direct effect than estimated with the sem moreover this is supported by the fact that aro did not strongly affect periphyton in experiment 1 primary producers only so a strong direct effect is unlikely the inhibition of phytoplankton development by periphyton that we observed is consistent with other mesocosm studies that attributed this inhibition to allelopathic effects of filamentous algae trochine et al 2011 or to nutrient competition kazanjian et al 2018 indeed a higher periphyton biomass in aro treatments retained more p which was not available for phytoplankton development the role of periphyton and their grazers is not considered in classical models of alternative stable states in shallow eutrophic lakes scheffer and van nes 2007 scheffer et al 1993 yet shading effects of periphyton on macrophytes jones and sayer 2003 phillips et al 2016 roberts et al 2003 and positive effects of snail grazing on macrophytes are well known mormul et al 2018 our results contrasted with theory predicting the increase of phytoplankton biomass and the regression of macrophytes in shallow lakes as a result of eutrophication and warming kosten et al 2012 mooij et al 2007 moss et al 2011 scheffer and van nes 2007 however they support modelling studies genkai kato et al 2012 jäger and diehl 2014 indicating that also periphyton can control the development of phytoplankton this suggests a key role of periphyton and their grazers in macrophyte phytoplankton interactions as already outlined by phillips et al 1978 reinforced in phillips et al 2016 we therefore consider that periphyton should receive more attention among the steering factors controlling alternative stable states in shallow lakes we show here that while some stressors are expected leading to higher phytoplankton abundance due to direct effects complex interactions can lead to completely different results generally the monitoring of lake ecological quality is based on an indicator of eutrophication including for example measurement of phytoplankton chl a laplace treyture and feret 2016 the complex effect of aro observed in this study can remain undetected by lake monitoring programs although the functioning of the system has been truly altered similarly while different environmental parameters are used to predict the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms zhao et al 2019a biotic interactions are not included such indirect effects must be take into account and therefore multiple components of the ecosystems should be used for ecosystem health assessment zhao et al 2019b together with a good understanding of mechanistic pathways linking stressors to observed effects 4 3 aro arriving in multiple pulses increases effects in our third hypothesis we expected that exposure to multiple pulses compared to a single addition of the same quantity of pollutants would allow the system to remain below a critical threshold thus allowing the organisms to acclimate and reducing the possibility of a shift towards the dominance by phytoplankton the stronger negative effect of multiple pulses on snail growth might be due to a delayed recovery after multiple exposures the positive effect on periphyton development is most probably an indirect effect caused via the direct negative effects on grazers however a similar nearly significant trend was observed in the first experiment therefore the positive effect on biofilm might be partially a direct effect of aro particularly the recurrent nitrate a few studies have considered single or repeated additions of toxicants pulses of herbicide have been suggested to modulate the impact on macrophytes and algae of a subsequent exposure while it depends strongly on the ability of the organisms to recover from previous exposure vallotton et al 2008 2009 varga et al 2019 the stronger effect of the multiple pulse exposure on the grazers and periphyton can be due to a rapid degradation of the pesticides or an interaction between pesticides or copper and compounds present in the microcosms e g extracellular polymeric substances produced by biofilm or changes in copper redox states coutaud et al 2018 that limit the aro effect in an experiment with similar microcosms using aro concentrations equivalent to our 3x treatment but with only the primary producers present 54 of terbuthylazine 67 of pirimicarb and 88 of tebuconazole were recovered in the water after 20 days data not shown it is therefore important to consider that aro input to lakes as multiple pulses can possibly increase the effect of agricultural run off indeed multiple pulses can better reflect the real contamination patterns of aquatic ecosystems daouk et al 2013 reinert et al 2002 5 conclusion shallow lakes are complex ecosystems influenced by a strong benthic pelagic coupling they are considered in a good ecological status when dominated by submerged macrophytes while dominance of phytoplankton or a massive development of periphytic algae are signs of degradation a few studies have already addressed of the potential of eutrophication and or climate warming for shifts between alternative stable states typical for these systems yet our study is the first to investigate the impact of single or multiple pulses of agricultural run off composed of organic and inorganic pesticides and nitrates in the context of climate warming we tested the first two trophic levels primary producers and primary consumers and show that negative effects can foster either phytoplankton or periphyton development our findings underline the importance to go beyond simple laboratory systems using only single species or functional groups single species tests cannot account for the complexity in these systems due to multiple direct and indirect effects acting in parallel our series of microcosm experiments based on individual and combined trophic levels coupled with sem allowed us to disentangle direct and indirect effects of two major global stressors climate warming and agricultural run off aro on the development of macrophytes phytoplankton and periphytic algae we showed that direct positive effects of aro on phytoplankton were completely reversed by indirect effects mediated by biotic interactions such as the competition between periphyton and phytoplankton or herbivory by grazers on periphyton effect of aro on grazers such as l stagnalis strongly affected the balance between functional groups of primary producers and this effect was enhanced when aro arrived in multiple pulses experiments with more complex systems allowing to take into account

17265,aquatic ecosystems are exposed to multiple stressors such as agricultural run off aro and climate change related increase of temperature we aimed to determine how aro and the frequency of its input can affect shallow lake ecosystems through direct and indirect effects on primary producers and primary consumers and whether warming can mitigate or reinforce the impact of aro we performed a set of microcosm experiments simulating aro using a cocktail of three organic pesticides terbuthylazine tebuconazole pirimicarb copper and nitrate two experiments were performed to determine the direct effect of aro on primary producers submerged macrophytes periphyton and phytoplankton and on the grazing snail lymnaea stagnalis respectively three different aro concentrations added as single doses or as multiple pulses at two different temperatures 22 c and 26 c were applied in a third experiment primary producers and consumers were exposed together to allow trophic interactions when functional groups were exposed alone aro had a direct positive effect on phytoplankton and a strong negative effect on l stagnalis when exposed together primary producer responses were contrasting as the negative effect of aro on grazers led to an indirect positive effect on periphyton periphyton in turn exerted a strong control on phytoplankton leading to an indirect negative effect of aro on phytoplankton macrophytes showed little response to the stressors multiple pulse exposure increased the effect of aro on l stagnalis and periphyton when compared with the same quantity of aro added as a single dose the increase in temperature had only limited effects our results highlight the importance of indirect effects of stressors here mediated by grazers and periphyton and the frequency of the aro input in aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords multiple stressors aquatic ecosystems agricultural run off global warming biotic interactions 1 introduction ecosystems are severely affected by anthropogenic stressors barnosky et al 2011 butchart et al 2010 and aquatic ecosystems are particularly threatened reid et al 2019 in this context it is crucial to determine the mechanisms by which the impact of stressors on specific organisms can alter ecosystem state and functioning bruder et al 2019 aquatic ecosystems are exposed to multiple anthropogenic stressors jackson et al 2016 ormerod et al 2010 partially originating from local sources such as agricultural activities ippolito et al 2015 malaj et al 2014 stehle and schulz 2015 agricultural run off aro is not only responsible for high nutrient input but it also contains multiple xenobiotics such as herbicides insecticides fungicides and trace metals that might affect ecosystems and interact with other stressors in an unpredictable way schriever et al 2007 nutrient and pesticide input to adjacent waterbodies through aro is highly dependent on the strength and frequency of rain events and agricultural practices therefore aquatic ecosystems are frequently exposed to multiple pulses of nitrates and pesticides with variable intensity daouk et al 2013 liess et al 1999 reinert et al 2002 further complicating the assessment and prediction of aro effects existing studies on aro revealed severe effects on aquatic ecosystem processes such as primary production and ecosystem respiration peters et al 2013 multiple pulse exposure to pollutants and nutrients can modulate the effects compared to a single or continuous exposure davis et al 2019 reinert et al 2002 varga et al 2019 in addition to local stressors global warming affects aquatic ecosystems by influencing the metabolic rates of organisms brown et al 2004 gillooly et al 2001 as well as their sensitivity towards stressors cuco et al 2016 debecker et al 2017 delnat et al 2019 all the different stressors may have interactive effects but determining how multiple stressors interact is challenging jackson et al 2016 especially in complex systems where biotic interactions lead to indirect effects bruder et al 2019 shallow lakes are ideal ecosystems to address the aforementioned challenges as they are the most abundant waterbodies worldwide verpoorter et al 2014 often exposed to aro hijosa valsero et al 2016 and prone to warming adrian et al 2009 the state of a shallow lake ecosystem is shaped by biotic interactions among and between primary producers and higher trophic levels and thus they respond non linearly to nutrient loading with rapid shifts between two alternative stable states a macrophyte dominated clear water state and a phytoplankton dominated turbid state scheffer and van nes 2007 scheffer et al 1993 such shifts have severe consequences for several ecosystem functions hilt et al 2017 and services janssen et al 2020 both warming and exposure to aro have been shown to affect macrophytes mckee et al 2002 phytoplankton donald et al 2011 huisman et al 2018 paerl and huisman 2008 zhao et al 2019a periphyton piggott et al 2015 and primary consumers schaum et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 increasing temperature and nutrient loading were predicted to increase the probability of a shift toward the turbid state moss et al 2011 scheffer et al 2015 while the effects of other pollutants including pesticides trace metal elements trace organics pharmaceuticals and vanity products remained largely unexplored phillips et al 2016 combining expertise from ecology and ecotoxicology can help elucidating the complexity of stressor and biotic interactions in shallow lakes e g by using microcosm experiments providing a higher ecological realism than single species exposed to stressors such as pollutants such experiments will reveal direct and indirect effects on interacting functional groups in aquatic communities an essential prerequisite to predict and eventually mitigate the impact of global warming by controlling local stressors scheffer et al 2015 here we investigated in microcosms the combined effect of global warming and aro on two trophic levels primary producers and their consumers representative of shallow lake ecosystems we hypothesised that 1 aro and warming will affect primary producer and consumer development particularly we expected that aro will cause a shift towards a phytoplankton dominance and that warming will increase this aro effect we also expected that 2 direct effects on some organisms will affect others indirectly through biotic interactions we further hypothesise that 3 multiple pulses of aro will favour the overall resistance of the ecosystem in comparison to a single pulse treatment with the same overall amount of pollutant added to the microcosms because a more progressive input of toxicants would allow organisms to acclimate to this stressor the three microcosm experiments were performed mimicking aro containing nitrate copper and typical organic pesticides with different exposure modes addition of aro by a single or multiple pulses and warming following the ipcc rcp 8 5 scenario 4 c ipcc 2014 the effects of these stressors were evaluated on microcosms containing only the primary producers only the grazers or both with the overall aim to gain a mechanistic understanding of direct and indirect effects of two major environmental stressors affecting shallow aquatic ecosystems we used structural equation modelling to determine further causal linkages between these stressors and observed effects 2 material and methods three microcosm experiments were performed in experiments 1 and 2 respectively primary producers and grazers were exposed independent of each other to aro and warming while in experiment 3 they were exposed together to allow for trophic interactions the microcosms were incubated at two different temperatures and exposed to a cocktail of pesticides copper and nitrate designed to mimic the effect of aro see table 1 for aro composition six different aro treatments were used a control without aro three treatments corresponding to the aro at the lowest concentration x twice the lowest concentration 2x and thrice the lowest concentration 3x as a single addition at the beginning of the experiment two treatments with two or three pulses of aro at the lowest concentration x with four day intervals between each addition multiple pulse treatments xx and xxx with the same final amount of aro as in 2x and 3x respectively target temperatures were set at 22 c controls representing typical temperate lake summer temperatures e g mckee et al 2002 sand jensen et al 2019 and 26 c representing the future climate warming scenario we therefore used 12 different combinations of aro and temperature cold control heated control cold 1x heated 1x cold 2x heated 2x cold 3x heated 3x cold xx heated xx cold xxx heated xxx with 5 replicates for each condition in experiment 2 with grazers alone only the 1x and 3x treatments at both temperatures were used in addition the concentration of nitrates was reduced since nitrates would not be consumed in the absence of primary producers table 1 the aro cocktail contained terbuthylazine cas number 5915 41 3 a triazine photosynthesis inhibiting herbicide lorente et al 2015 tebuconazole cas number 107534 96 3 a triazole fungicide known to affect biofilm and phytoplankton artigas et al 2014 pirimicarb cas number 23103

al 2018 all pesticides were pestanal analytical standards merck darmstadt germany concentrations were based on published ec values ec10 20 50 for each organism group available ssd data and some unpublished data on the toxicity of all aro components from these data we identified an effective concentration for each aro pollutant excluding nitrate equivalent to the ec20 for chronic exposure for the most sensitive group which was used as the highest concentration in the subsequent experiments table 1 stock solutions of organic pesticides were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso cas 67 68 5 merck the same amount of dmso was added in all microcosms at a final concentration of 0 125 copper and nitrate kno3 solutions were prepared in milliq water 2 1 experiment 1 primary producers alone in experiment 1 8 l microcosms contained submerged macrophytes myriophyllum spicatum l elodea nuttallii michx and potamogeton perfoliatus l planted in artificial sediments oecd tg 239 2014 modified to replace nutrient salts by 5 g kg 1 nettle powder as fertilizer and ten strains of microalgae si table s1 macrophytes were introduced first to allow rooting before being submitted to competition with phytoplankton and periphyton algae were introduced in the microcosms 9 days after macrophytes and 8 days before aro addition and temperature increase just after a complete water renewal to remove initial differences in algae and nutrient levels that had developed in the microcosms achieved temperatures were 22 5 0 4 c unheated and 25 7 0 4 c heated microcosms microcosms were maintained during 28 days after aro addition with regular water and nutrient addition until final sampling air temperature was maintained at 22 c light at 70 µmol m 2 s 1 16 8 h light dark cycle translucent polypropylene strips were placed in each microcosm for periphyton development monitoring more information on microcosm settings are provided in the supplementary material 2 2 experiment 2 grazers alone the pond snail lymnaea stagnalis was exposed to aro at 22 0 2 c and 26 0 2 c in the absence of any primary producer this species was selected because it is commonly found in shallow freshwater ecosystems feeding primarily on benthic algae and aquatic plants elger et al 2009 it is also a good model in ecotoxicology amorim et al 2019 recently normalized as oecd test guideline oecd 2016 lymnaea stagnalis was obtained from a nearby pond and bred in the laboratory for several generations to obtain a parasite free population individuals were selected to minimise size differences measured and weighed mean shell length sd 13 7 1 3 mm mean total weight 202 58 mg each snail was placed in a 12 cm diameter 30 cm high cylindrical glass aquarium filled with 1 l of volvic water with temperature control as in experiment 1 snails were starved for 12 h before simultaneous addition of aro and ten pre weighed 12 mm diameter lettuce discs organically grown after 24 h the remaining leaf discs were collected and freeze dried additional lettuce discs were used to determine initial dry mass and the dry mass of lettuce consumed by each snail was determined the snails were then fed ad libitum with lettuce for 21 days water evaporation in the aquaria was compensated by addition of deionised water twice a week the light cycle was 16 8 light dark with only 5 µmol m 2 s 1 irradiance to control possible algal development at the end of the experiment snails were starved for 12 h before a new feeding test was performed with 10 pre weighed 14 mm diameter lettuce discs and stopped after 16 h to avoid complete consumption of the food provided the snails were then measured and weighed 2 3 experiment 3 primary producers and consumers we used the same experimental set up as in experiment 1 but added one individual of l stagnalis one individual of zebra mussel dreissena polymorpha and twenty daphnia magna neonates in each microcosm snail individuals collected as in experiment 2 had an initial mean sd shell length of 18 7 2 2 mm and a mean total fresh mass of 0 4 0 1 g including shell zebra mussels collected in a lake were placed in aquaria for 1 week before being transferred to the microcosms and measured using an electronic calliper 16 0 1 2 mm individuals were selected to be as homogenous in size as possible d magna were bred at the laboratory macrophytes algae and primary consumers were introduced in the mesocosms 10 7 and 3 days before addition of aro respectively to allow for settlement without stressors in addition several adjustments were made due to observations in the first experiment and changes in material availability the organic pesticides were prepared as a 10 fold more concentrated solution and therefore the amount of dmso added to the microcosms was ten times lower 0 01 caco3 at 7 5 g kg 1 was added in the sediment of each microcosm as a buffer to limit potential effects of acidity on the primary consumers an additional plastic strip was added mean water temperatures were 21 4 0 3 c and 23 7 0 3 c in the non heated and heated microcosms respectively final sampling was done 21 days after the addition of aro as it corresponded to the maximal development of phytoplankton in experiment 1 2 4 measured parameters at the end of each experiment water was collected and filtered at 0 7 µm gf f in the filtered water concentrations of nitrate and dissolved phosphorus were determined by ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 sunnyvale ca usa and by ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method respectively afnor 1990 the plastic strips were cut at 20 cm from the bottom and all l stagnalis eggs and juveniles present on the strips were collected and counted periphyton on these strips was scraped and collected with 20 ml of volvic water from the resulting suspension subsamples of 1 5 ml were centrifuged 10000 g 10 min in 2 ml tubes the filters and pellets were stored at 80 c until photosynthetic pigment analysis phytoplankton and periphyton pigments were extracted to estimate total planktonic and periphytic algae biomass and the proportion of diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria pigment extraction was carried out on periphyton and phytoplankton samples after freeze drying by the addition of 2 ml methanol buffered with 2 ammonium acetate 1 m followed by an initial sonication step 3 min at 4 c and 15 min of incubation at 20 c and then a second sonication step pigment extracts were recovered after centrifugation 10000 g 5 min at 2 c the extraction steps were repeated until obtained extracts were no longer visibly coloured all the extracts of the same sample were pooled extracts were filtered through a 0 2 μm ptfe membrane syringe filter vwr international united states and analysed by hplc hplc analysis of pigments was performed as described by capdeville et al 2019 pigments specific to a particular group of primary producer diatoms fucoxanthin diatoxathin and diadinoxanthin green algae chlorophyll b lutein violaxanthin and neoxanthin cyanobacteria zeaxanthin echinenone and myxoxanthophyll were used to assess variation of the different groups of microalgae mackey et al 1996 majdi et al 2011 the total p concentration in periphyton biomass was determined following the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method after persulphate digestion in acidic conditions of freeze dried periphyton subsamples following afnor guidelines afnor 1990 macrophytes were handled as described in gross et al 2018 macrophytes were removed from the sediments and rinsed in water to remove attached particles and epiphytes all the plants of one species were spread in a large tray equipped with a ruler and a picture was taken roots and aboveground parts were separated and rapidly dried aboveground parts were then weighed to estimate macrophyte biomass visible signs of macrophyte consumption by grazers were recorded based on the pictures taken in experiment 3 adult l stagnalis were collected weighed and measured individuals of d polymorpha were collected and measured the presence of dead l stagnalis or d polymorpha was recorded due to a rapid disappearance of d magna in all microcosms no measurement was possible 2 5 statistics aro concentration exposure mode single or multiple pulses of aro addition and temperature effects on the different measured parameters were analysed using an ancova with aro concentration as a continuous variable and temperature and exposure mode as categorical independent variables the effect of exposure mode was analysed using only 2x xx and 3x xxx data with contrast analysis the magnitude of the effects was measured using hedges g hedges 1981 effect size calculated from t statistics derived from the ancova according to berben et al 2012 using the r package esc 2 6 structural equation modelling to explore the simultaneous effect of aro and warming on the interactions between macrophytes phytoplankton periphyton and grazers we built a path analysis subjected to structural equation modelling sem grace et al 2010 sem has been developed as a powerful tool for inferring cause effect relationships among variables via proposed hypotheses tested against data grace et al 2012 grace and irvine 2020 furthermore sem permits the evaluation of direct and indirect effects within a network of variables bruder et al 2019 this approach has been successfully applied to identify the mechanistic pathway underlying the effect of different stressors on aquatic ecosystems alexander et al 2016 2013 majdi et al 2014 rodrigues et al 2018 indeed as a framework for quantitative analyses sem is an extension of univariate mediation analyses taking into account the effect of variable x on variable z through its effect on y grace and irvine 2020 reisner et al 2013 using a priori knowledge we built a full model of cause effect relationships based on hypothetical pathways supported by literature table 1 notably the full model included a direct pathway between aro exposure and phytoplankton biomass and several indirect pathways via competition with periphyton or macrophytes see supplementary figure s6 the hypothetical relationships between variables table 1 was then tested on the correlation matrix of experimental data grace and irvine 2020 reisner et al 2013 we considered all available variables to investigate the interactions among trophic levels using a priori knowledge a full path analysis model was created including simultaneously several hypothetical pathways table 2 through which aro and warming could affect macrophytes phytoplankton periphyton and grazers we only used the biomasses of macrophytes phytoplankton periphyton and grazers from experiment 3 with primary producers and consumers to perform this analysis for the primary consumers only l stagnalis size increase was used as d magna did not develop and no growth was observed on d polymorpha the different directions and kind of interactions among trophic levels were tested then successive full models were simplified by step wise exclusion of variables and or linkages with non significant weights and non significant co variance as estimated by akaike index criterion aic until a minimal adequate model showing specific linkages remained the best model was selected based on its coherence with the direct effect observed in experiments 1 and 2 the adequacy of the final model was determined using quality indicators such as chi² root mean square error of approximation rmsea standardised root mean square residual srmr adjusted goodness of fit index agfi and comparative fit index cfi fan et al 2016 sem was performed using the r package sem 3 results 3 1 experiment 1 effects of stressors on primary producers without consumers aro exposure and elevated temperature had no effect on total macrophyte aboveground biomass fig 1 the exposure mode did not change the effect on macrophytes fig 1 the mean final macrophyte dry mass per microcosm was 0 61 0 24 g with values for individual microcosms ranging from 0 11 to 1 23 g supplementary material fig s1 phytoplankton biomass varied between 2 and 238 µg l 1 chl a and increased with increasing concentrations of aro p 0 041 fig 1 clear water states with low phytoplankton 50 µg l 1 of chl a were observed in all treatments but highly turbid water with high phytoplankton 100 µg l 1 of chl a was observed only at the two higher aro concentrations the exposure mode did not change the effect of aro on phytoplankton warming had no significant effect on phytoplankton fig 1 but favoured green algae fig 2 aro exposure and warming had no significant effect on periphyton biomass with a mean value of 1 08 0 71 µg cm 2 of chl a however we observed a trend for higher periphyton biomass p 0 060 with aro and a higher periphyton biomass with multiple pulses as compared to single additions of the aro p 0 046 fig 1 aro induced an increase of the cyanobacterial pigment chl a ratio in both periphyton and phytoplankton fig 2 aro had no significant effect on the total amount of p contained in periphyton supplementary material fig s5 at the end of the experiment concentrations of soluble reactive phosphate p 0 001 and nitrates p 0 001 were significantly higher in microcosm water with higher aro additions repeated addition of aro resulted in significantly lower dissolved phosphate concentrations compared to treatments with single aro additions p 0 04 while only a marginal difference was recorded for nitrate concentrations p 0 07 fig 1 3 2 experiment 2 effects of stressors on grazers aro exposure strongly reduced l stagnalis growth with a significant effect on its increase in mass and length fig 1 the snail mass increased by 603 32 mg without aro and by only 184 44 mg at the highest aro concentration warming positively influenced length increase but had no effect on snail mass fig 1 aro induced a significant reduction p 0 001 of the consumption rates of l stagnalis at the beginning of the exposure from 8 14 0 79 mg day 1 in the controls to 2 68 0 62 mg day 1 in the 3x treatment similarly after 3 weeks of exposure consumption rates of l stagnalis were 35 lower when exposed to the highest aro dose from 17 9 1 9 mg day 1 in the control to 11 6 2 4 mg day 1 at the 3x aro concentration no effect of warming on consumption rate was observed fig 1 3 3 experiment 3 effects of stressors on interacting primary producers and consumers macrophyte biomass did not respond to aro addition independent of the exposure mode nor warming fig 1 in this experiment aro concentration negatively affected phytoplankton biomass fig 1 and these effects were stronger at the lower temperature indicating an interaction between aro exposure and warming fig 1 the highest phytoplankton biomasses were recorded in the cold control microcosms cold 84 8 36 0 µg l 1 chl a warm 45 0 14 4 µg l 1 chl a conversely aro concentration caused a strong increase of periphyton biomass fig 1 periphyton biomass was very low in control conditions 0 22 0 07 µg cm 2 chl a and 0 38 0 19 µg cm 2 chl a for cold and warm temperatures respectively but was significantly higher with aro especially when added as multiple pulses fig 1 at the highest aro concentration periphyton biomass reached 2 90 0 61 µg cm 2 chl a cold and 3 51 0 67 µg cm 2 chl a when aro was added as multiple pulses xxx while it reached only 2 05 0 60 µg chl a cm 2 in cold and 2 11 0 78 µg chl a cm 2 in warm when aro was added as a single dose 3x aro and particularly exposure to multiple pulses increased the p content of periphyton p 0 001 and p 0 019 warming did not significantly affect final periphyton biomass p 0 48 d magna neonates disappeared in all microcosms except six microcosms where d magna population develop but also disappeared before the end of the experiment aro strongly affected the mussels all of which died at the higher aro concentration independent of frequency of addition while they survived in all control microcosms no clear increase in mussel size was observed in any of the microcosms where they remained alive the snails survived in all the microcosms except one a noticeable size increase 65 8 35 4 and the production of a high number of eggs up to 489 eggs in one microcosm but several microcosms with no visible eggs were observed juvenile snails were also observed principally in the controls supplementary material aro strongly reduced the growth of l stagnalis fig 1 multiple pulses led to a higher reduction of growth than a single addition of aro fig 1 warming had no significant effect on snail growth or reproduction the number of snail eggs was not affected by aro treatments but the number of juveniles was strongly reduced by aro concentration independent of the exposure mode fig 1 damage due to snail feeding on p perfoliatus was observed in 80 of the controls in 44 20 and 30 of the microcosms in the 1x 2x and 3x treatments and in 0 of the microcosms in the multiple pulses xx and xxx treatments aro and warming induced a decrease of the proportion of green algae and an increase of diatoms in the periphyton fig 2 aro also caused an increase of the diatom pigment in the phytoplankton warming negatively affected the growth of m spicatum and e nuttallii but not of p perfoliatus repeated addition of aro had a negative effect on macrophytes when compared with a single addition fig 2 nitrate concentrations at the end of the experiment increased significantly with increasing aro concentrations p 0 001 this effect was stronger in treatments with repeated aro addition as compared to single additions p 0 001 fig 1 concentrations of soluble reactive phosphate were lower in treatments with multiple pulses as compared to single additions warming led to significantly lower dissolved phosphate concentrations p 0 02 fig 1 3 4 structural equation modelling a first sem model was constructed including all possible relationships among measured variables and between the measured variables and experimental parameters table 2 supplementary material fig s6 we did not find a significant relationship between warming and any measured parameter in the sem performed and therefore removed warming effects in the model in the resulting model supplementary material fig s6 only periphyton biomass and snail growth were directly affected by aro to explore further the direct and indirect effects of aro on macrophyte or phytoplankton dominance we used a third model considering only the effect of periphyton on phytoplankton and of periphyton on macrophytes without the respective reciprocal effects fig 3 our model showed a strong positive effect of aro concentration on periphyton development not only directly path 0 59 p 0 001 fig 3 but also indirectly through the negative effect of aro on periphyton grazers fig 3 indeed aro decreased grazer growth which in turn reduced grazer consumption of periphyton leading finally to an increased periphyton development fig 3 we also found a strong negative effect of periphyton on phytoplankton development path 0 69 p 0 001 fig 3 therefore phytoplankton development was indirectly affected by aro through its effect on periphyton our model further indicated no significant relationship between macrophyte biomass and other parameters 4 discussion the combination of experiments with one and two trophic levels allowed us to assess direct and indirect effects of two major environmental stressors climate warming and agricultural run off aro on the functioning of shallow aquatic systems confirming our first hypothesis we showed direct effects of aro on primary producers and primary consumers we further revealed the structuring role of periphyton and their grazers l stagnalis in these systems often described only by the alternative dominance of submerged macrophytes or phytoplankton scheffer and van nes 2007 scheffer et al 1993 repeated exposure to aro as can be expected for shallow aquatic systems in an agricultural landscape enhanced these effects in contrast to our expectations warming by approx 3 5 c did not enhance the negative effects probably because our tested temperature increase did not affect primary producers directly our results underline the importance to increase ecological complexity when evaluating the effect of agricultural run off including pesticides on aquatic systems as single species tests would not be able to reveal all direct and indirect effects in the following we will detail how the results matched with our initial hypotheses 4 1 direct effects of aro and warming on single trophic levels to test our first hypothesis experiments 1 and 2 were designed to determine the effect of the stressors without trophic interactions we observed a positive effect of aro on phytoplankton growth this positive effect may be linked to the presence of nitrate in the aro because it is consistent with what can be expected with nitrate addition in p rich environments donald et al 2011 leavitt et al 2006 paerl and scott 2010 the low amount of remaining nitrate at the end of the experiment further supports a possible effect of nitrate this increase in phytoplankton biomass did not lead to a strong negative competitive effect on macrophytes as could be expected and there was no shift to a typical phytoplankton dominated state however such shifts can be expected under in situ conditions when higher water depth and longer duration result in significant shading of macrophytes by phytoplankton the most remarkable direct effect of aro was a strong inhibition of growth and feeding of the snail l stagnalis this is consistent with the known effect of pesticides and copper on this species amorim et al 2019 tufi et al 2016 indeed tufi et al 2016 observed acetylcholinesterase inhibition on l stagnalis exposed to 3 62 µg l 1 of pirimicarb in our experiment pirimicarb concentration ranged from 5 to 15 µg l 1 tebuconazole and copper are linked to embryotoxicity in terrestrial snails helix aspersa druart et al 2012 the highest concentration of cu used in our study 42 µg l 1 is in the range of the estimated ec50 on juvenile l stagnalis growth rate in a 28 day experiment vlaeminck et al 2019 nitrate cannot be responsible for the negative effect observed because the concentration in our experiment was more than 50 fold below the toxic concentration for any freshwater mollusc soucek and dickinson 2012 the hypothesis that warming will promote phytoplankton dominance could not be confirmed warming did not affect primary producers nor snail feeding activity this result is surprising because warming in the range of our experiments brings both chlorophytes and cyanobacteria closer to their optimum temperature lürling et al 2013 and snail activity was expected to increase with warming in the tested range schaum et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 however a lack of warming effects on macrophytes was also reported in other studies for instance mckee et al 2002 observed no temperature induced change in the development of macrophytes in a 2 year mesocosm experiment with a 3 c warming above ambient temperature similarly feuchtmayr et al 2019 found no effect on primary producers using a 4 c temperature elevation in a 1 year experiment where temperature followed natural variations primary producers may have been driven more by nutrient limitation although we regularly added nutrients than by temperature indeed an antagonistic interaction between warming and nutrient limitation have been observed in several studies birk et al 2020 richardson et al 2019 also studies with an impact of temperature on grazers schaum et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 used a higher temperature difference than our study 4 2 importance of indirect effects mediated by biotic interactions in a more complex system in experiment 3 including both primary producers and grazers the net effect of aro on phytoplankton development was negative and thus opposite to the single trophic level experiment probably due to the toxic effects of aro on periphyton grazers that released periphyton from grazing pressure by this mechanism aro had an indirect positive effect on periphyton in addition to the direct positive effect of aro on periphyton indicated by the sem model a strong negative relationship was also observed between periphyton and phytoplankton probably due to competition between the two functional groups for nutrients more specifically for phosphorus because a decrease in phytoplankton biomass was observed while nitrate was added with the aro the negative effect of aro on l stagnalis was reduced in experiment 3 with primary producers and grazers where the microcosms also included primary producers compared to experiment 2 grazers alone different factors may explain this reduced effect notably the other organisms present may also have led to a reduced exposure of snails due to increased adsorption and degradation of toxicants periphyton also represents a higher quality food than lettuce leading to a decrease in the sensitivity to toxicants fidder et al 2018 vlaeminck et al 2019 beside effects of food quality the available food in terms of periphyton biomass in the control microcosms was very low snail growth may have been food limited thus reducing the magnitude of the observed effect of aro this is supported by the fact that l stagnalis grazing on p perfoliatus was more frequently observed in the control microcosms than in treatments with higher periphyton biomass indicating a limitation in the availability of periphyton that they preferentially graze this effect of resource limitation on snail growth may have led to an underestimation of aro effects on l stagnalis this may have also resulted in an underestimation of the indirect effect of aro on periphyton mediated by snail grazing as well as a lower direct effect than estimated with the sem moreover this is supported by the fact that aro did not strongly affect periphyton in experiment 1 primary producers only so a strong direct effect is unlikely the inhibition of phytoplankton development by periphyton that we observed is consistent with other mesocosm studies that attributed this inhibition to allelopathic effects of filamentous algae trochine et al 2011 or to nutrient competition kazanjian et al 2018 indeed a higher periphyton biomass in aro treatments retained more p which was not available for phytoplankton development the role of periphyton and their grazers is not considered in classical models of alternative stable states in shallow eutrophic lakes scheffer and van nes 2007 scheffer et al 1993 yet shading effects of periphyton on macrophytes jones and sayer 2003 phillips et al 2016 roberts et al 2003 and positive effects of snail grazing on macrophytes are well known mormul et al 2018 our results contrasted with theory predicting the increase of phytoplankton biomass and the regression of macrophytes in shallow lakes as a result of eutrophication and warming kosten et al 2012 mooij et al 2007 moss et al 2011 scheffer and van nes 2007 however they support modelling studies genkai kato et al 2012 jäger and diehl 2014 indicating that also periphyton can control the development of phytoplankton this suggests a key role of periphyton and their grazers in macrophyte phytoplankton interactions as already outlined by phillips et al 1978 reinforced in phillips et al 2016 we therefore consider that periphyton should receive more attention among the steering factors controlling alternative stable states in shallow lakes we show here that while some stressors are expected leading to higher phytoplankton abundance due to direct effects complex interactions can lead to completely different results generally the monitoring of lake ecological quality is based on an indicator of eutrophication including for example measurement of phytoplankton chl a laplace treyture and feret 2016 the complex effect of aro observed in this study can remain undetected by lake monitoring programs although the functioning of the system has been truly altered similarly while different environmental parameters are used to predict the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms zhao et al 2019a biotic interactions are not included such indirect effects must be take into account and therefore multiple components of the ecosystems should be used for ecosystem health assessment zhao et al 2019b together with a good understanding of mechanistic pathways linking stressors to observed effects 4 3 aro arriving in multiple pulses increases effects in our third hypothesis we expected that exposure to multiple pulses compared to a single addition of the same quantity of pollutants would allow the system to remain below a critical threshold thus allowing the organisms to acclimate and reducing the possibility of a shift towards the dominance by phytoplankton the stronger negative effect of multiple pulses on snail growth might be due to a delayed recovery after multiple exposures the positive effect on periphyton development is most probably an indirect effect caused via the direct negative effects on grazers however a similar nearly significant trend was observed in the first experiment therefore the positive effect on biofilm might be partially a direct effect of aro particularly the recurrent nitrate a few studies have considered single or repeated additions of toxicants pulses of herbicide have been suggested to modulate the impact on macrophytes and algae of a subsequent exposure while it depends strongly on the ability of the organisms to recover from previous exposure vallotton et al 2008 2009 varga et al 2019 the stronger effect of the multiple pulse exposure on the grazers and periphyton can be due to a rapid degradation of the pesticides or an interaction between pesticides or copper and compounds present in the microcosms e g extracellular polymeric substances produced by biofilm or changes in copper redox states coutaud et al 2018 that limit the aro effect in an experiment with similar microcosms using aro concentrations equivalent to our 3x treatment but with only the primary producers present 54 of terbuthylazine 67 of pirimicarb and 88 of tebuconazole were recovered in the water after 20 days data not shown it is therefore important to consider that aro input to lakes as multiple pulses can possibly increase the effect of agricultural run off indeed multiple pulses can better reflect the real contamination patterns of aquatic ecosystems daouk et al 2013 reinert et al 2002 5 conclusion shallow lakes are complex ecosystems influenced by a strong benthic pelagic coupling they are considered in a good ecological status when dominated by submerged macrophytes while dominance of phytoplankton or a massive development of periphytic algae are signs of degradation a few studies have already addressed of the potential of eutrophication and or climate warming for shifts between alternative stable states typical for these systems yet our study is the first to investigate the impact of single or multiple pulses of agricultural run off composed of organic and inorganic pesticides and nitrates in the context of climate warming we tested the first two trophic levels primary producers and primary consumers and show that negative effects can foster either phytoplankton or periphyton development our findings underline the importance to go beyond simple laboratory systems using only single species or functional groups single species tests cannot account for the complexity in these systems due to multiple direct and indirect effects acting in parallel our series of microcosm experiments based on individual and combined trophic levels coupled with sem allowed us to disentangle direct and indirect effects of two major global stressors climate warming and agricultural run off aro on the development of macrophytes phytoplankton and periphytic algae we showed that direct positive effects of aro on phytoplankton were completely reversed by indirect effects mediated by biotic interactions such as the competition between periphyton and phytoplankton or herbivory by grazers on periphyton effect of aro on grazers such as l stagnalis strongly affected the balance between functional groups of primary producers and this effect was enhanced when aro arrived in multiple pulses experiments with more complex systems allowing to take into account biotic interactions and different scenarios of stressor exposure are a more reliable basis for ecosystem assessment and management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

17266,aeration is a major contributor to the high energy demand in municipal wastewater treatment plants thus it is important to understand the dynamic impact of wastewater characteristics on oxygen transfer efficiency to develop suitable control strategies for minimizing energy consumption since aeration efficiency is influenced by the biodegradation of pollutants in the influent the real time impact of acetate as a readily biodegradable substrate and cellulose as a slowly biodegradable substrate were studied at different operational conditions cellulose in the influent wastewater can be removed efficiently using primary treatment technologies such as the rotating belt filter rbf at an ambient do of 2 mg l 1 and air flow of 1 02 m3 h 1 0 6 scfm the α factor was more sensitive to readily biodegradable substrates than to cellulose on average α factor decreased by 48 and 19 due to the addition of acetate and cellulose respectively at a do of 4 mg l 1 and air flow of 1 7 m3 h 1 1 scfm α factor remained constant irrespective of cellulose and acetate concentrations without active biomass α factor decreased by 47 and 43 at a do of 2 mg l 1 air flow of 1 02 m3 h 1 and high do of 5 mg l 1 air flow of 1 7 m3 h 1 respectively an inverse correlation between α factor and scod was defined and incorporated into a dynamic model to estimate the real time airflow rates associated with the improvement of the oxygen transfer efficiency due to biodegradation finally the rbf operated with a 158 μm mesh selectively removed cellulose thus reducing air requirements and energy by 25

0 kwh m 3 and might reach up to 8 33 kwh m 3 depending on influent wastewater characteristics treatment plant capacity used technology and disposal methods gude 2015 singh et al 2016 tao and chengwen 2012 in general more than half of the treatment plant s net energy consumption is attributed to aeration except for site specific pumping reardon 1995 rosso et al 2011 rosso and stenstrom 2006 thus to optimize the aeration energy it is important to precisely quantify the oxygen transfer efficiency ote and understand the main factors that influence the ote the oxygen transfer rate in wastewater is commonly evaluated using the α factor the α factor for fine bubble diffusers varies between 0 25 to 0 65 inter alia baquero rodríguez et al 2018 several design factors have been reported to impact the aeration efficiency including diffuser type distribution and depth airflow rate as well as aerobic reactor design in addition other operational factors were reported to impact the aeration efficiency such as influent wastewater characteristics solids retention time srt nutrient removal processes and temperature baquero rodríguez et al 2018 gillot and héduit 2008 leu et al 2009 rosso et al 2011 wagner and pöpel 1998 cellulose from toilet paper is one of the particulate organic substrates in raw municipal wastewater that can be efficiently removed by primary treatment processes such as primary clarification pc and the rbf ahmed et al 2019 ruiken et al 2013 the rbf removes total suspended solids tss and biochemical oxygen demand bod by up to 80 and 20 respectively chakraborty 2015 franchi et al 2015 in addition the rbf has been demonstrated to selectively remove cellulose which represents 35 of the raw municipal wastewater suspended solids producing cellulose rich sludge ahmed et al 2019 ruiken et al 2013 readily biodegradable substrates which include surface active agents dramatically reduce oxygen transfer efficiency due to their rapid accumulation on the bubble surface rosso et al 2008 wagner and pöpel 1996 thus the use of a pre denitrification stage is often advantageous rosso and stenstrom 2005 fine bubbles have a rise velocity of 10 1 m s 1 and a higher specific surface area when compared to coarse bubbles with a velocity of 10 m s 1 hence fine bubbles are prone to higher surfactant accumulation rosso et al 2006 previous results showed that ote was reduced by 30 70 of the clean water value because of the accumulation of surfactants on the bubble interface reducing surface tension internal gas circulation and resulting gas liquid interfacial renewal as well as gas diffusivity into the liquid eckenfelder et al 1956 rosso huo and stenstrom 2006 wagner and pöpel 1998 mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentrations inversely correlate with the α factor in membrane bioreactors mbr where mlss concentrations vary between 8 g l 1 to 30 g l 1 cornel et al 2003 krampe and krauth 2003 henkel et al 2011 developed an inverse correlation between mlss and α factor in activated sludge systems from five studies where mlss concentrations ranged between 2 g l 1 and 14 g l 1 rosso iranpour and stenstrom 2005 using off gas transfer efficiency measurements from 26 treatment plants over fifteen years showed that α factor increases with the srt increase due to a combination of mlss concentration and sludge characteristics their findings were confirmed by gillot and héduit 2008 baquero rodríguez et al 2018 combined the data from the aforementioned studies and concluded that mlss concentrations below 6 g l 1 impacted the α factor beneficially due to the increased biosorption provided by the biomass however mlss concentrations more than 7 g l 1 are associated with a dramatic decrease in α factor due to the substantially different rheology of the thick sludge i e the shear thinning nature of the solid suspension increases bubble coalescence and decreases the gas transfer interfacial area when compared to clean water baquero rodríguez et al 2018 apparently except for the cases with high mlss concentrations 7 g l 1 there is no robust relationship between α factor and mlss since at the same mlss concentration a wide spread of α factors was observed process models for activated sludge systems have historically relied upon constant inputs for the α factor henze et al 1987 jiang et al 2017 metcalf eddy et al 2002 henze et al 2000 the use of constant values to characterize the α factor conflicts with the now known change of the oxygen transfer efficiency due to the dynamic influent wastewater characteristics leu et al 2009 and operating conditions e g srt and real time concentrations of different parameters inside the reactor due to biodegradation assuming a constant α factor as commonly practiced leads to overestimation or underestimation of air requirements several research contributions were established to improve aeration modeling wagner and pöpel 1998 correlated oxygen transfer efficiency parameters including standard oxygen transfer rates sotr and oxygen mass transfer coefficient kla to airflow rate and diffusers submergence rosso iranpour and stenstrom 2005 normalized the srt air flow rate diffuser and tank geometry to reduce process data and create empirical correlations for standard oxygen transfer efficiency in process water αsote and α factors however the correlations are marred by the variability inherent in full scale measurements usually reported as daily averages gillot et al 2005 and rosso et al 2006 attempted to reduce the variability in process data by performing dimensional analysis and producing correlations that relied on different entities such as the superficial gas velocity and the dynamic surface tension respectively gillot and héduit 2008 defined a new composite variable equivalent contact time which is a function of srt kla and airflow rates to predict the α factor in fine pore aeration systems pittoors et al 2014 developed a mathematical model for the oxygen transfer efficiency in clean water and activated sludge that correlates kla to nine operating variables including reactor volume height diameter surface area airflow rate diffusers surface area and depth bubble size and dynamic viscosity the model was validated using experimental measurements from a cylindrical batch reactor 2 7 9 3 l the aforementioned studies successfully provided relationships to predict α factor from other aeration parameters however none of them were able to truly address the dynamic behavior of the oxygen transfer efficiency and hence the α factor most recently jiang et al 2017 developed a dynamic aeration model that described the change in oxygen transfer efficiency as a function of the influent cod their results showed that the α factor decreased exponentially with the total cod applied to secondary treatment however their work did not distinguish between the cod fractions involved in affecting the α factor the impact of influent organic loading rates on aeration efficiency has been addressed experimentally in several studies e g gori et al 2011 jiang et al 2017 leu et al 2009 rosso iranpour and stenstrom 2005 however the real time impact of biodegradation of these organics during the aeration process is a clear knowledge gap in addition the impact of cellulose on aeration efficiency has never been studied before furthermore the role of biomass in oxygen transfer is not completely understood campbell et al 2019 cornel et al 2003 germain et al 2007 henkel et al 2011 krampe and krauth 2003 rosso iranpour and stenstrom 2005 therefore the two goals of this study are i to evaluate the impact of cellulose organic loading rates and biomass on the oxygen transfer efficiency ii to develop a dynamic aeration model incorporating α factor and sotr as a function of readily and slowly biodegradable substrates the aeration model developed by jiang et al 2017 was combined with the asm1cl model developed by reijken et al 2018 to estimate the real time airflow rate due to biodegradation of the organics while satisfying the sotr required for treatment 2 methodology 2 1 sequencing batch pilot reactors design two identical pilot sequencing batch reactors sbrs with an operating volume of 850 l diameter of 0 6 m and depth of 3 0 m were built in a wastewater treatment plant in london on canada fig 1 each reactor was equipped with a 7 epdm fine pore membrane diffuser disk mounted on the floor one reactor was fed with raw wastewater and the other was fed with the rbf salsnes sf2000 mesh opening 0 158 mm screened wastewater both reactors were operated two cycles per day 12 hrs per cycle each cycle consisted of 15 min filling 4 5 h anoxic 5 h aerobic 2 h settling 15 min decanting process variables were monitored online through two sets of sensors installed in each reactor including ph ysi digital sensolyt ph orp ysi digital sensolyt orp do ysi trioxmatic 700 iq electrochemical do sensor and ammonia horiba hc 200nh japan both reactors were operated at an srt of 10 days in addition the air delivery was controlled in both reactors using an electric on off valve that intermittently released a constant air flow the electric valve was programmed to operate within a do setpoint of 1 5 0 5 mg l 1 to monitor the sbrs performance the influent and effluent samples from both reactors were collected and analyzed weekly additionally the reactors mlss and mlvss concentrations were measured weekly 2 2 oxygen transfer efficiency testing the sbr fed with the rbf screened wastewater was tested for oxygen transfer efficiency at two different fill ratios of 60 and 80 while maintaining the same srt of 10 days fig 2 a and 2b since the rbf removes cellulose efficiently selecting the sbr fed by the rbf effluent was beneficial to distinguish the impact of cellulose additional experiments were conducted by adding sodium acetate to increase the scod concentration inside the sbr by 100 mgcod l 1 and 200 mgcod l 1 alpha cellulose was added to increase the cellulose content of the reactor by 100 mgcellulose l 1 and 200 mgcellulose l 1 moreover to assess the effects of dissolved contaminants on oxygen transfer and to subsequently verify the hypothesis that the activated sludge biomass adsorbs the contaminants and alleviates the effects of organics on oxygen transfer tests using the rbf effluent without active biomass at the same cellulose and acetate concentrations were performed fig 2c for the tests without active biomass the biomass was removed from the system and transferred to a storage tank for the duration of the test and then returned to the sbr furthermore the oxygen transfer efficiency in the secondary effluent only was also measured at the end of the treatment cycle after removing the settled active biomass fig 2d two control strategies were applied to all testing scenarios a relatively high airflow of 1 7 m3 h 1 1 scfm to maintain an average do of 4 0 mg l 1 and a low airflow of 1 02 m3 h 1 0 6 scfm to maintain an average do of 2 mg l 1 table 1 summarizes the testing scenarios 2 3 oxygen transfer efficiency measurements oxygen transfer was measured in clean water and secondary effluent using the unsteady state method asce 1993 oxygen transfer under process conditions was measured via off gas measurements redmon et al 1983 asce 1997 as oxygen transfer efficiency ote eq 1 and

off gas measurement was then calculated by dividing the otr by the volume of the water column below the hood eq 2 although the air on off approach was used to control the do inside the reactor all ote

ammonia concentrations were tracked online using horiba hc 200nh ammonia sensors 2 5 model structure fig 3 shows the model structure developed by combining asm1cl reijken et al 2018 and the first module of the aeration model developed by jiang et al 2017 asm1cl is a development of asm1 henze 1992 incorporating the first order hydrolysis of cellulose the model was used to estimate the real time airflow required due to the biodegradation of the influent substrates for both sbrs as well as other scenarios with the addition of cellulose and acetate the hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable substrates in asm1 is impacted by the oxygen and nitrate concentrations as well as the ratio of slowly biodegradable substrate to heterotrophic biomass in fact this process represents a variety of interconnected processes including hydrolysis and microorganism lysis henze et al 2000 for simplicity and to avoid the impact of oxygen as well as the denitrification process the hydrolysis rate of cellulose was modeled using asm 3 kinetics as shown in equation 4 below since the default value of asm3 half saturation coefficient of hydrolysis of xs kx at 20 c of 1 gcod gcodbiomass 1 is significantly higher than xcl xh in this study which ranged from 0 03 g cod g cod biomass 1 in sbr2 to 0 12 g cod g cod biomass 1 in sbr1 the model is simplified to the first order model shown in

and sn were used to estimate the inputs to asm1cl soluble inerts si were assumed to be equal to the measured sbr effluent scod since there were no measurements for the effluent biochemical oxygen demand bod this assumption is quite reasonable as from operational experience it was observed that readily biodegradable substrates were biodegraded within two hours only influent readily biodegradable substrates concentration ss was initially estimated to be equal to the difference between influent and effluent scod then si and ss were calibrated to match the measured scod effluent the ss fraction was also verified using the our at high air flow rates and elevated do concentrations to allow for respiration influent cellulose xcl in the raw wastewater was determined to be 33 of

agreement with the typical phosphorus contents of biosolids in enhanced biological phosphorus removal systems ebpr zaman et al 2019 3 2 oxygen transfer studies fig 4 shows the real time change in α factor ote and our due to the addition of 100 mgacetate l 1 and 100 mgcellulose l 1 alpha cellulose was added after all readily biodegradable substrates acetate had been consumed as expected the α factor ote and our were low at the beginning of the cycle and improved with the biodegradation of the acetate and cellulose anionic surfactants were measured and were found to follow the scod and α factor increased with surfactants degradation fig 5 surfactants are characterized by their hydrophilic heads that accumulate on the gas liquid interface and the hydrophobic tails that remain inside the bubbles hindering the gas side mass transfer film renewal rate baquero rodríguez et al 2018 rosso and stenstrom 2006 apparently α factor improved with the anionic surfactant biodegradation 3 2 1 acetate test table 2 shows the oxygen transfer parameters at different testing scenarios control strategies and acetate loading rates with active biomass reported values for the αsote ote our from off gas and α factor represent the flow weighted averages at the high airflow and high do the addition of acetate did not impact the α factor and our significantly at the low air flow and do of 2 mg l 1 the addition of acetate to increase scod by 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 reduced the our off gas by 49 and 57 which hence reduced the α factor by 43 and 57 respectively it must be noted that increasing the filling ratio from 60 to 80 while maintaining the same biomass concentration did not impact oxygen transfer efficiency at both air flows and do control strategies the our measured from the off gas was then compared with the our measured by respiration table 2 the our from respiration was calculated using the rate of the change in the do with time i e ddo dt inside the reactor while the process air was off the reported values in the table represent the average standard deviation of our respiration corresponding to the off gas measurements at different times within the treatment cycle our from the off gas measurements gas phase was comparable to our measured from the respiration liquid phase when acetate was added however for the control cases without the addition of acetate or cellulose the measured our from both gas and liquid phases were not comparable the addition of acetate as a readily biodegradable substrate hinders nitrification this happened since high acetate concentrations were found to associate with high surfactant concentrations fig 5 that hindered the ote and hence nitrification the nitrogenous our nour was calculated using the real time change in ammonia i e dnh4 dt multiplied by 4 57 gcod g nh4 n 1 in the control cases the summation of our due to carbon oxidation and nour was comparable to the our off gas since the our off gas phase was measured while air was on and the our respiration was measured while the air was off the monitored ammonia and airflow rates were plotted in fig 6 considering the two phases after adding acetate and cellulose cellulose was added 3 h after the addition of acetate to ensure that all the acetate had been biodegraded the addition of acetate reduced the nitrification rate and when the air was on a very small ammonia release 0 5 mg l 1 was observed fig 6a once acetate and surfactants were biodegraded nitrification started to recover also nitrification was observed to be higher when the air was on than when the air was off fig 6c confirming that the observed difference between measured our from respiration and our from off gas was due to nitrification it must be asserted that in the case of the acetate nour was negligible 10 mg l 1 h 1 due to an overall low nitrification rate and subsequently the our from off gas balanced with the our from respiration the difference between the high and low do can be explained using our measurements at the high airflow and high do the addition of acetate increased the our from respiration indicating that the high do initiates higher substrate utilization rates when compared to the control case and therefore the impact on the α factor was negligible at the low air flow and low do the addition of acetate to increase scod by 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 reduced nour by 61 and 74 when compared to the control case and therefore the α factor on average decreased by 48 3 2 2 cellulose test table 3 shows the oxygen transfer values for the different testing scenarios control strategies and cellulose loading rates with active biomass similar to what was observed for acetate at the high air flow and high do the addition of cellulose impacted neither the α factor nor the our at the low air flow and low do increasing the cellulose concentrations by 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 reduced the α factor by 16 and 25 respectively the addition of cellulose had a lower impact on aeration efficiency when compared to acetate confirming the sensitivity of the aeration efficiency to acetate the our measured from the gas phase i e off gas tests was higher than the our in the liquid phase i e respiration tests in all cases analogously to the acetate cases the nour was calculated and the summation of the our in the liquid phase and the nour was comparable to the our in the gas phase this happened since cellulose was added after all rbcod was consumed since nitrification was confirmed to be more active when the air is on than when the air is off fig 6 the our from off gas measured when the air was on balanced with the summation of the our from respiration measured when the air was off and the nour similar to the tests with the acetate at the low air flow and low do on average the nour decreased by 30 leading to an average reduction of 19 in the α factor due to alpha cellulose addition results obtained from the tests with the cellulose were compared with the long term off gas measurements recorded from both sbrs with and without primary treatment table 4 shows the impact of the rbf on oxygen transfer the values reported for αsote ote our from off gas and α factor are presented as airflow weighted averages the influent cellulose represented on average 35 of the raw wastewater tss as reported in a previous study ahmed et al 2019 meaning that influent cellulose in this study was 125 mg l 1 the rbf removed 80 of the influent cellulose ahmed et al 2019 which corresponds to 100 mgcellulose l 1 while maintaining comparable airflow and do in both sbrs the sbr fed with the raw wastewater had an α factor of 0 53 compared to 0 58 for the sbr fed by the rbf screened wastewater 9 4 difference in both reactors on average the α factor ranged between 0 30 at the beginning of the cycle to 0 60 at the end of the cycle the significance of the observed differences in α factor for both sbrs was evaluated using the standard t test approach at the 95 confidence level and the observed difference was insignificant since both sbrs were running at the same effluent scod concentrations and hence scod would have impacted α factor equally the addition of 100 mgalpha cellulose l 1 to sbr2 reduced the α factor by 16 table 3 however in sbr1 the impact of the same concentration of cellulose on the α factor was insignificant due to the higher biomass concentrations in sbr1 than sbr2 2950 mg l 1 vs 2055 mg l 1 associated with higher biodegradation rate and hence more rapid increase in α factor additionally energy as kwh cycle 1 and kwh kgthod 1 were calculated based on the air flow and the removed load from both sbrs using eq 17 table 4 sbr2 showed less energy consumption per cycle than sbr1 25 the energy consumption per thod showed a saving of 6 7 compared to the 8 6 improvement in the α factor due to the rbf table 4 17 e b h p δ t w r t 1 29 7 n e p 2 p 1 n 1 δ t where bhp blower

rbf effluent on oxygen transfer was quantified as α factor decrease by 47 from 0 68 to 0 36 at high air flow and high do and by 43 from 0 56 to 0 32 at low air flow and low do similar to the case with active biomass at the high air flow and high do the addition of acetate marginally impacted both our and α factor relative to the case with only the rbf effluent at the low air flow and low do increasing scod concentration by 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1decreased the α factor by 25 and 44 respectively the presence of active biomass which targets all biodegradable substrates increases the our and improves the oxygen transfer efficiency when compared to the case without active biomass at the high air flow and high do the addition of cellulose did not impact the nour however it increased the our from off gas and the our from respiration by 27 and 30 respectively indicating that the addition of cellulose while maintaining high do enhanced the substrates utilization rate which subsequently improved asote and α factor by 25 and 23 respectively at the low air flow and low do the addition of cellulose had a negligible impact on α factor and the our off gas this happened since in both cases i e the rbf effluent only and the rbf effluent with the addition of cellulose scod concentrations were high due to the very low biodegradation rates and the scod effect on the α factor was more predominant than the effect of cellulose 3 2 4 oxygen transfer efficiency in secondary effluent oxygen transfer in the secondary effluent was measured and showed α factors of 0 69 and 0 57 at the high and low air flows respectively confirming that the suppressed transfer efficiency observed at the end of the cycle was limited by the secondary effluent water quality in fact even though the overwhelming majority of the load was removed by the end of a secondary process to at least meet the secondary bod tss standards of 30 30 mg l 1 the values of the α factor are usually far from reaching such high levels in fact the residual concentration of organics in the water not necessarily from the primary effluent but by products of microbial metabolism tseng et al 2013 still affects persistently the oxygen transfer the attribution of this inability to recover the oxygen transfer in full should therefore not be placed solely on the presence of the suspended biomass henkel et al 2009 fig 7 summarizes the α factor improvement due to the biomass effect it is interesting to note that biodegradation and biosorption increased the α factor from 0 30 in the rbf effluent to 0 56 in the secondary effluent with biomass the removal of biomass yielded a marginal increase in α factor from 0 56 to 0 60 3 3 aeration model results 3 3 1 model calibration the kinetic coefficients were calibrated using the in cycle measurements of mlvss scod and ammonia in the sbr2 table s2 our respiration profiles from three different cycles were used to verify ss and si fractions fig s5 the concentrations of ss were estimated using eq 18 the tested cycles from sbr2 filtered had an average tcod of 412 mg l 1 scod of 215 mg l 1 and an estimated ss of 190 mg l 1 which constitutes 46 of the tcod and 89 of the scod the corresponding values in the calibrated model were 47 of tcod and 86 of scod 18 i n f l u e n t s s o u r f o r a r e a a m g l 1 y h v a c t i v a t e d s l u d g e l v w a s t e w a t e r l v w a s t e w a t e r l the model mlvss values were calibrated to match the mlvss measured during the aeration cycle fig s6 the heterotrophic maximum specific growth rate μh and the carbonaceous substrate half saturation constant ks were calibrated to match the scod profiles fig s7 the autotrophic maximum specific growth rate μa and the ammonium half saturation constant knh3n were calibrated to match ammonia profiles fig s8 the hydrolysis rate of the cellulose was calculated using the measured cellulose from both tests with the addition of 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 assuming first order biodegradation kinetics and the average kcl was 4 1 d 1 fig s9 3 3 2 experimental correlation between α factor and scod a negative correlation between α factor and scod in the sbr was identified with a coefficient of determination of 0 75 fig 8 this correlation appears to be a combination of two linear correlations for scod more than 75 mg l 1 the improvement of the α factor due to the decrease in scod was slow due to the presence of surfactants that negatively affected the oxygen transfer process for scod less than 75 mg l 1 the α factor dramatically increased with the scod decrease confirming the higher sensitivity of the α factor to scod the estimated relationship between α factor and scod eq 19 was then integrated into the model to estimate the α factor as a function of the state variable scod with time 19 α 4 275 s c o d 0 557 3 3 3 model validation the developed model was used as a predictive tool to quantify the air flow required to mitigate the reduction in oxygen transfer efficiency due to the organic loading both sbrs were modeled sbr1 without primary treatment influent characteristics of cod 643 mg l 1 scod 255 mg l 1 tn 35 mg l 1 and nh4 24 mg l 1 sbr2 with rbf treatment influent characteristic of cod 465 mg l 1 scod 255 mg l 1 tn 34 mg l 1 and nh4 20 mg l 1 both sbrs were modeled to target a do set point of 2 mg l 1 initial inputs to each scenario are shown in tables s3 s4 s5 and s6 fig 9a shows the modeled vs measured temporal variation of the α factor due to changes in the sbr scod concentrations the measured and modeled α factors for both reactors were comparable with an average percentage error of 4 2 and 3 7 for sbr1 and sbr2 respectively the α factor was very low at the beginning of the aeration cycle for both sbrs due to the high concentration of the scod which necessitates applying high air flow rates to mitigate the reduction in oxygen transfer efficiency the α factor recovered with time due to the biodegradation of the readily biodegradable substrates as expected the α factor in the sbr1 recovered faster due to a higher biomass concentration of 3000 mg l 1 when compared to all other modeled scenarios with an average biomass concentration of 2000 mg l 1 fig 9b shows the temporal variation of the modeled versus measured 30 min moving average air flow rate the measured and modeled air flow rates for both reactors were comparable with an average percent error of 6 3 and 5 9 for sbr1 and sbr2 respectively the moving average air flow correlates with the actual organic and nitrogen loading rates removed through the cycle the air requirements for both reactors were high at the beginning of the cycle and decreased with the time due to the biodegradation of the organics sbr2 had lower air flow requirements when compared to sbr 1 due to the partial removal of cellulose and slowly biodegradable substrate by the rbf the presence of cellulose in the influent reduces the α factor on one hand and increases the oxygen requirements on the other hand additionally sbr2 with the addition of 100 mgacetate l 1 and sbr2 with the addition of 100 mgcellulose l 1 were modeled table 6 summarizes the average α factor required air flow and energy consumption for the four modeled scenarios on average sbr 2 had a lower air flow requirement of 0 90 m3 hr 1 0 53 scfm when compared to sbr1 1 19 m3 hr 1 0 70 scfm leading to an overall energy saving of 25 per cycle due to the rbf which was identical to what was observed experimentally the energy saving per kgo2 consumed per day was 8 5 which was comparable to the 6 7 that was achieved experimentally the addition of acetate required more air flow as oxygen requirements increased and more air was required to maintain the same oxygen transfer rate the addition of acetate increased the required airflow in the sbr2 by 50 when compared to its absence the addition of cellulose impacted both the α factor and the sotr increasing the required air flow rate by 33 sbr2 100 mgcellulose l 1 had a higher air flow requirement of 1 34 m3 h 1 0 79 scfm than sbr1 1 19 m3 h 1 0 7 scfm due to the higher biomass concentration in sbr1 than sbr2 100 mgcellulose l 1 the addition of acetate required more air compared to other scenarios since all the added acetate is readily biodegradable the addition of cellulose showed a lower impact on the α factor and hence air flow since most of the added cellulose is slowly biodegradable and a reduced amount of additional air was required when compared to the case with acetate the validation proved that the established correlation eq 19 can be used as a design tool to predict the dynamic α factor and subsequently dynamic air flow rates in sbr systems in continuous flow systems with plug flow reactors the α factor change induced by biodegradation can be estimated using eq 19 and used to design a tapered aeration system that is more efficient than uniform aeration in plug flow reactors in continuous flow systems with completely mixed reactors this approach should be valid as it will estimate uniform and high α factor throughout the whole reactor due to low scod concentrations this is consistent with the literature since completely mixed reactors are characterized by their high α factors gillot and héduit 2000 mahendraker et al 2005 rieth et al 1990 relative to plug flow reactors 4 summary and conclusions based on the results reported in the manuscript the following conclusions could be drawn in an sbr a regular increase in α factor with reaction time should be expected hence during sbr design a variable α factor should be used the presence of active biomass improves the α factor due to enhanced biodegradation at the low air flow and low do with active biomass the α factor decreased due to the presence of acetate and cellulose by 48 and 19 respectively at the high air flow and high do with active biomass the α factor was constant irrespective of cellulose and acetate concentrations without active biomass the α factor decreased due to the addition of acetate in both cases i e the high and low air flows with biomass the α factor increased with the biodegradation of surfactants and scod peaking at 0 56 despite the removal of the vast majority of the organic and nitrogen load the highest α factor value achievable in the sbr secondary effluent without biomass was 0 60 this indicated that biomass has a marginal beneficial impact on the α factor in secondary effluents while the residual contaminants cause the depression of alpha a dynamic model was developed to calculate the required real time air flow rate as a function of the change in scod the rbf reduced the required airflow and hence energy by 25 due to the removal of cellulose along with other slowly biodegradable substrates compared to no primary treatment the dynamic model indicated that the addition of 100 mgacetate l 1 to sbr2 with an initial scod concentration of 135 mg l 1 and cellulose concentration of 25 mg l 1 increased the airflow requirements by 50 to compensate for the reduction in α factor similarly the addition of 100 mg cellulose l 1 to sbr2 increased the air requirements by

17266,aeration is a major contributor to the high energy demand in municipal wastewater treatment plants thus it is important to understand the dynamic impact of wastewater characteristics on oxygen transfer efficiency to develop suitable control strategies for minimizing energy consumption since aeration efficiency is influenced by the biodegradation of pollutants in the influent the real time impact of acetate as a readily biodegradable substrate and cellulose as a slowly biodegradable substrate were studied at different operational conditions cellulose in the influent wastewater can be removed efficiently using primary treatment technologies such as the rotating belt filter rbf at an ambient do of 2 mg l 1 and air flow of 1 02 m3 h 1 0 6 scfm the α factor was more sensitive to readily biodegradable substrates than to cellulose on average α factor decreased by 48 and 19 due to the addition of acetate and cellulose respectively at a do of 4 mg l 1 and air flow of 1 7 m3 h 1 1 scfm α factor remained constant irrespective of cellulose and acetate concentrations without active biomass α factor decreased by 47 and 43 at a do of 2 mg l 1 air flow of 1 02 m3 h 1 and high do of 5 mg l 1 air flow of 1 7 m3 h 1 respectively an inverse correlation between α factor and scod was defined and incorporated into a dynamic model to estimate the real time airflow rates associated with the improvement of the oxygen transfer efficiency due to biodegradation finally the rbf operated with a 158 μm mesh selectively removed cellulose thus reducing air requirements and energy by 25

2012 in general more than half of the treatment plant s net energy consumption is attributed to aeration except for site specific pumping reardon 1995 rosso et al 2011 rosso and stenstrom 2006 thus to optimize the aeration energy it is important to precisely quantify the oxygen transfer efficiency ote and understand the main factors that influence the ote the oxygen transfer rate in wastewater is commonly evaluated using the α factor the α factor for fine bubble diffusers varies between 0 25 to 0 65 inter alia baquero rodríguez et al 2018 several design factors have been reported to impact the aeration efficiency including diffuser type distribution and depth airflow rate as well as aerobic reactor design in addition other operational factors were reported to impact the aeration efficiency such as influent wastewater characteristics solids retention time srt nutrient removal processes and temperature baquero rodríguez et al 2018 gillot and héduit 2008 leu et al 2009 rosso et al 2011 wagner and pöpel 1998 cellulose from toilet paper is one of the particulate organic substrates in raw municipal wastewater that can be efficiently removed by primary treatment processes such as primary clarification pc and the rbf ahmed et al 2019 ruiken et al 2013 the rbf removes total suspended solids tss and biochemical oxygen demand bod by up to 80 and 20 respectively chakraborty 2015 franchi et al 2015 in addition the rbf has been demonstrated to selectively remove cellulose which represents 35 of the raw municipal wastewater suspended solids producing cellulose rich sludge ahmed et al 2019 ruiken et al 2013 readily biodegradable substrates which include surface active agents dramatically reduce oxygen transfer efficiency due to their rapid accumulation on the bubble surface rosso et al 2008 wagner and pöpel 1996 thus the use of a pre denitrification stage is often advantageous rosso and stenstrom 2005 fine bubbles have a rise velocity of 10 1 m s 1 and a higher specific surface area when compared to coarse bubbles with a velocity of 10 m s 1 hence fine bubbles are prone to higher surfactant accumulation rosso et al 2006 previous results showed that ote was reduced by 30 70 of the clean water value because of the accumulation of surfactants on the bubble interface reducing surface tension internal gas circulation and resulting gas liquid interfacial renewal as well as gas diffusivity into the liquid eckenfelder et al 1956 rosso huo and stenstrom 2006 wagner and pöpel 1998 mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentrations inversely correlate with the α factor in membrane bioreactors mbr where mlss concentrations vary between 8 g l 1 to 30 g l 1 cornel et al 2003 krampe and krauth 2003 henkel et al 2011 developed an inverse correlation between mlss and α factor in activated sludge systems from five studies where mlss concentrations ranged between 2 g l 1 and 14 g l 1 rosso iranpour and stenstrom 2005 using off gas transfer efficiency measurements from 26 treatment plants over fifteen years showed that α factor increases with the srt increase due to a combination of mlss concentration and sludge characteristics their findings were confirmed by gillot and héduit 2008 baquero rodríguez et al 2018 combined the data from the aforementioned studies and concluded that mlss concentrations below 6 g l 1 impacted the α factor beneficially due to the increased biosorption provided by the biomass however mlss concentrations more than 7 g l 1 are associated with a dramatic decrease in α factor due to the substantially different rheology of the thick sludge i e the shear thinning nature of the solid suspension increases bubble coalescence and decreases the gas transfer interfacial area when compared to clean water baquero rodríguez et al 2018 apparently except for the cases with high mlss concentrations 7 g l 1 there is no robust relationship between α factor and mlss since at the same mlss concentration a wide spread of α factors was observed process models for activated sludge systems have historically relied upon constant inputs for the α factor henze et al 1987 jiang et al 2017 metcalf eddy et al 2002 henze et al 2000 the use of constant values to characterize the α factor conflicts with the now known change of the oxygen transfer efficiency due to the dynamic influent wastewater characteristics leu et al 2009 and operating conditions e g srt and real time concentrations of different parameters inside the reactor due to biodegradation assuming a constant α factor as commonly practiced leads to overestimation or underestimation of air requirements several research contributions were established to improve aeration modeling wagner and pöpel 1998 correlated oxygen transfer efficiency parameters including standard oxygen transfer rates sotr and oxygen mass transfer coefficient kla to airflow rate and diffusers submergence rosso iranpour and stenstrom 2005 normalized the srt air flow rate diffuser and tank geometry to reduce process data and create empirical correlations for standard oxygen transfer efficiency in process water αsote and α factors however the correlations are marred by the variability inherent in full scale measurements usually reported as daily averages gillot et al 2005 and rosso et al 2006 attempted to reduce the variability in process data by performing dimensional analysis and producing correlations that relied on different entities such as the superficial gas velocity and the dynamic surface tension respectively gillot and héduit 2008 defined a new composite variable equivalent contact time which is a function of srt kla and airflow rates to predict the α factor in fine pore aeration systems pittoors et al 2014 developed a mathematical model for the oxygen transfer efficiency in clean water and activated sludge that correlates kla to nine operating variables including reactor volume height diameter surface area airflow rate diffusers surface area and depth bubble size and dynamic viscosity the model was validated using experimental measurements from a cylindrical batch reactor 2 7 9 3 l the aforementioned studies successfully provided relationships to predict α factor from other aeration parameters however none of them were able to truly address the dynamic behavior of the oxygen transfer efficiency and hence the α factor most recently jiang et al 2017 developed a dynamic aeration model that described the change in oxygen transfer efficiency as a function of the influent cod their results showed that the α factor decreased exponentially with the total cod applied to secondary treatment however their work did not distinguish between the cod fractions involved in affecting the α factor the impact of influent organic loading rates on aeration efficiency has been addressed experimentally in several studies e g gori et al 2011 jiang et al 2017 leu et al 2009 rosso iranpour and stenstrom 2005 however the real time impact of biodegradation of these organics during the aeration process is a clear knowledge gap in addition the impact of cellulose on aeration efficiency has never been studied before furthermore the role of biomass in oxygen transfer is not completely understood campbell et al 2019 cornel et al 2003 germain et al 2007 henkel et al 2011 krampe and krauth 2003 rosso iranpour and stenstrom 2005 therefore the two goals of this study are i to evaluate the impact of cellulose organic loading rates and biomass on the oxygen transfer efficiency ii to develop a dynamic aeration model incorporating α factor and sotr as a function of readily and slowly biodegradable substrates the aeration model developed by jiang et al 2017 was combined with the asm1cl model developed by reijken et al 2018 to estimate the real time airflow rate due to biodegradation of the organics while satisfying the sotr required for treatment 2 methodology 2 1 sequencing batch pilot reactors design two identical pilot sequencing batch reactors sbrs with an operating volume of 850 l diameter of 0 6 m and depth of 3 0 m were built in a wastewater treatment plant in london on canada fig 1 each reactor was equipped with a 7 epdm fine pore membrane diffuser disk mounted on the floor one reactor was fed with raw wastewater and the other was fed with the rbf salsnes sf2000 mesh opening 0 158 mm screened wastewater both reactors were operated two cycles per day 12 hrs per cycle each cycle consisted of 15 min filling 4 5 h anoxic 5 h aerobic 2 h settling 15 min decanting process variables were monitored online through two sets of sensors installed in each reactor including ph ysi digital sensolyt ph orp ysi digital sensolyt orp do ysi trioxmatic 700 iq electrochemical do sensor and ammonia horiba hc 200nh japan both reactors were operated at an srt of 10 days in addition the air delivery was controlled in both reactors using an electric on off valve that intermittently released a constant air flow the electric valve was programmed to operate within a do setpoint of 1 5 0 5 mg l 1 to monitor the sbrs performance the influent and effluent samples from both reactors were collected and analyzed weekly additionally the reactors mlss and mlvss concentrations were measured weekly 2 2 oxygen transfer efficiency testing the sbr fed with the rbf screened wastewater was tested for oxygen transfer efficiency at two different fill ratios of 60 and 80 while maintaining the same srt of 10 days fig 2 a and 2b since the rbf removes cellulose efficiently selecting the sbr fed by the rbf effluent was beneficial to distinguish the impact of cellulose additional experiments were conducted by adding sodium acetate to increase the scod concentration inside the sbr by 100 mgcod l 1 and 200 mgcod l 1 alpha cellulose was added to increase the cellulose content of the reactor by 100 mgcellulose l 1 and 200 mgcellulose l 1 moreover to assess the effects of dissolved contaminants on oxygen transfer and to subsequently verify the hypothesis that the activated sludge biomass adsorbs the contaminants and alleviates the effects of organics on oxygen transfer tests using the rbf effluent without active biomass at the same cellulose and acetate concentrations were performed fig 2c for the tests without active biomass the biomass was removed from the system and transferred to a storage tank for the duration of the test and then returned to the sbr furthermore the oxygen transfer efficiency in the secondary effluent only was also measured at the end of the treatment cycle after removing the settled active biomass fig 2d two control strategies were applied to all testing scenarios a relatively high airflow of 1 7 m3 h 1 1 scfm to maintain an average do of 4 0 mg l 1 and a low airflow of 1 02 m3 h 1 0 6 scfm to maintain an average do of 2 mg l 1 table 1 summarizes the testing scenarios 2 3 oxygen transfer efficiency measurements oxygen transfer was measured in clean water and secondary effluent using the unsteady state method asce 1993 oxygen transfer under process conditions was measured via off gas measurements redmon et al 1983 asce 1997 as oxygen transfer efficiency ote eq 1 and oxygen uptake rate our mg l 1 h 1 eq 2 1 ote mass o 2 i n mass o 2 o u t mass o 2 i n x 100 the airflow rate was measured using a hot wire anemometer to measure air velocity which was used to calculate the airflow rate given the cross sectional area of the airflow pipe the product of the airflow rate and the gas transfer efficiency yields the oxygen transfer rate otr the our based on the off gas measurement was then calculated by dividing the otr by the volume of the water column below the hood eq 2 although the air on off approach was used to control the do inside the reactor all ote

ammonia concentrations were tracked online using horiba hc 200nh ammonia sensors 2 5 model structure fig 3 shows the model structure developed by combining asm1cl reijken et al 2018 and the first module of the aeration model developed by jiang et al 2017 asm1cl is a development of asm1 henze 1992 incorporating the first order hydrolysis of cellulose the model was used to estimate the real time airflow required due to the biodegradation of the influent substrates for both sbrs as well as other scenarios with the addition of cellulose and acetate the hydrolysis of slowly biodegradable substrates in asm1 is impacted by the oxygen and nitrate concentrations as well as the ratio of slowly biodegradable substrate to heterotrophic biomass in fact this process represents a variety of interconnected processes including hydrolysis and microorganism lysis henze et al 2000 for simplicity and to avoid the impact of oxygen as well as the denitrification process the hydrolysis rate of cellulose was modeled using asm 3 kinetics as shown in equation 4 below since the default value of asm3 half saturation coefficient of hydrolysis of xs kx at 20 c of 1 gcod gcodbiomass 1 is significantly higher than xcl xh in this study which ranged from 0 03 g cod g cod biomass 1 in sbr2 to 0 12 g cod g cod biomass 1 in sbr1 the model is simplified to the first order model shown in equation 5 consistent with the observation of reijken et al 2018 4 d x c l d t k c l k c l x h k x k c l x h x h 5 d x c l d t k c l x c l influent and effluent measurements of the cod scod ammonia tn and sn were used to estimate the inputs to asm1cl soluble inerts si were assumed to be equal to the measured sbr effluent scod since there were no measurements for the effluent biochemical oxygen demand bod this assumption is quite reasonable as from operational experience it was observed that readily biodegradable substrates were biodegraded within two hours only influent readily biodegradable substrates concentration ss was initially estimated to be equal to the difference between influent and effluent scod then si and ss were calibrated to match the measured scod effluent the ss fraction was also verified using the our at high air flow rates and elevated do concentrations to allow for respiration influent cellulose xcl in the raw wastewater was determined to be 33 of

respectively both sbrs achieved comparable cod tn ammonia and tp removal efficiencies of 95 75 98 and 92 respectively in addition due to the cod removal by the rbf 30 less solids production was observed in sbr2 fed with the rbf effluent when compared to sbr1 fed with the raw wastewater table s1 in the supplementary information shows the influent and effluent wastewater characteristics for both sbrs at a steady state after being operated for one month figure s4 shows the effluent cod tn and tp for both reactors during the testing period both sbrs were achieving steady state conditions

of mlvss in sbr1 and sbr2 which matches the typical nitrogen content of biosolids phosphorus mass balance revealed a phosphorus content of 4 and 4 50 of mlvss in sbr1 and sbr2 which is in close agreement with the typical phosphorus contents of biosolids in enhanced biological phosphorus removal systems ebpr zaman et al 2019 3 2 oxygen transfer studies fig 4 shows the real time change in α factor ote and our due to the addition of 100 mgacetate l 1 and 100 mgcellulose l 1 alpha cellulose was added after all readily biodegradable substrates acetate had been consumed as expected the α factor ote and our were low at the beginning of the cycle and improved with the biodegradation of the acetate and cellulose anionic surfactants were measured and were found to follow the scod and α factor increased with surfactants degradation fig 5 surfactants are characterized by their hydrophilic heads that accumulate on the gas liquid interface and the hydrophobic tails that remain inside the bubbles hindering the gas side mass transfer film renewal rate baquero rodríguez et al 2018 rosso and stenstrom 2006 apparently α factor improved with the anionic surfactant biodegradation 3 2 1 acetate test table 2 shows the oxygen transfer parameters at different testing scenarios control strategies and acetate loading rates with active biomass reported values for the αsote ote our from off gas and α factor represent the flow weighted averages at the high airflow and high do the addition of acetate did not impact the α factor and our significantly at the low air flow and do of 2 mg l 1 the addition of acetate to increase scod by 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 reduced the our off gas by 49 and 57 which hence reduced the α factor by 43 and 57 respectively it must be noted that increasing the filling ratio from 60 to 80 while maintaining the same biomass concentration did not impact oxygen transfer efficiency at both air flows and do control strategies the our measured from the off gas was then compared with the our measured by respiration table 2 the our from respiration was calculated using the rate of the change in the do with time i e ddo dt inside the reactor while the process air was off the reported values in the table represent the average standard deviation of our respiration corresponding to the off gas measurements at different times within the treatment cycle our from the off gas measurements gas phase was comparable to our measured from the respiration liquid phase when acetate was added however for the control cases without the addition of acetate or cellulose the measured our from both gas and liquid phases were not comparable the addition of acetate as a readily biodegradable substrate hinders nitrification this happened since high acetate concentrations were found to associate with high surfactant concentrations fig 5 that hindered the ote and hence nitrification the nitrogenous our nour was calculated using the real time change in ammonia i e dnh4 dt multiplied by 4 57 gcod g nh4 n 1 in the control cases the summation of our due to carbon oxidation and nour was comparable to the our off gas since the our off gas phase was measured while air was on and the our respiration was measured while the air was off the monitored ammonia and airflow rates were plotted in fig 6 considering the two phases after adding acetate and cellulose cellulose was added 3 h after the addition of acetate to ensure that all the acetate had been biodegraded the addition of acetate reduced the nitrification rate and when the air was on a very small ammonia release 0 5 mg l 1 was observed fig 6a once acetate and surfactants were biodegraded nitrification started to recover also nitrification was observed to be higher when the air was on than when the air was off fig 6c confirming that the observed difference between measured our from respiration and our from off gas was due to nitrification it must be asserted that in the case of the acetate nour was negligible 10 mg l 1 h 1 due to an overall low nitrification rate and subsequently the our from off gas balanced with the our from respiration the difference between the high and low do can be explained using our measurements at the high airflow and high do the addition of acetate increased the our from respiration indicating that the high do initiates higher substrate utilization rates when compared to the control case and therefore the impact on the α factor was negligible at the low air flow and low do the addition of acetate to increase scod by 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 reduced nour by 61 and 74 when compared to the control case and therefore the α factor on average decreased by 48 3 2 2 cellulose test table 3 shows the oxygen transfer values for the different testing scenarios control strategies and cellulose loading rates with active biomass similar to what was observed for acetate at the high air flow and high do the addition of cellulose impacted neither the α factor nor the our at the low air flow and low do increasing the cellulose concentrations by 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 reduced the α factor by 16 and 25 respectively the addition of cellulose had a lower impact on aeration efficiency when compared to acetate confirming the sensitivity of the aeration efficiency to acetate the our measured from the gas phase i e off gas tests was higher than the our in the liquid phase i e respiration tests in all cases analogously to the acetate cases the nour was calculated and the summation of the our in the liquid phase and the nour was comparable to the our in the gas phase this happened since cellulose was added after all rbcod was consumed since nitrification was confirmed to be more active when the air is on than when the air is off fig 6 the our from off gas measured when the air was on balanced with the summation of the our from respiration measured when the air was off and the nour similar to the tests with the acetate at the low air flow and low do on average the nour decreased by 30 leading to an average reduction of 19 in the α factor due to alpha cellulose addition results obtained from the tests with the cellulose were compared with the long term off gas measurements recorded from both sbrs with and without primary treatment table 4 shows the impact of the rbf on oxygen transfer the values reported for αsote ote our from off gas and α factor are presented as airflow weighted averages the influent cellulose represented on average 35 of the raw wastewater tss as reported in a previous study ahmed et al 2019 meaning that influent cellulose in this study was 125 mg l 1 the rbf removed 80 of the influent cellulose ahmed et al 2019 which corresponds to 100 mgcellulose l 1 while maintaining comparable airflow and do in both sbrs the sbr fed with the raw wastewater had an α factor of 0 53 compared to 0 58 for the sbr fed by the rbf screened wastewater 9 4 difference in both reactors on average the α factor ranged between 0 30 at the beginning of the cycle to 0 60 at the end of the cycle the significance of the observed differences in α factor for both sbrs was evaluated using the standard t test approach at the 95 confidence level and the observed difference was insignificant since both sbrs were running at the same effluent scod concentrations and hence scod would have impacted α factor equally the addition of 100 mgalpha cellulose l 1 to sbr2 reduced the α factor by 16 table 3 however in sbr1 the impact of the same concentration of cellulose on the α factor was insignificant due to the higher biomass concentrations in sbr1 than sbr2 2950 mg l 1 vs 2055 mg l 1 associated with higher biodegradation rate and hence more rapid increase in α factor additionally energy as kwh cycle 1 and kwh kgthod 1 were calculated based on the air flow and the removed load from both sbrs using eq 17 table 4 sbr2 showed less energy consumption per cycle than sbr1 25 the energy consumption per thod showed a saving of 6 7 compared to the 8 6 improvement in the α factor due to the rbf table 4 17 e b h p δ t w r t 1 29 7 n e p 2 p 1 n 1 δ t where bhp blower

rbf effluent on oxygen transfer was quantified as α factor decrease by 47 from 0 68 to 0 36 at high air flow and high do and by 43 from 0 56 to 0 32 at low air flow and low do similar to the case with active biomass at the high air flow and high do the addition of acetate marginally impacted both our and α factor relative to the case with only the rbf effluent at the low air flow and low do increasing scod concentration by 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1decreased the α factor by 25 and 44 respectively the presence of active biomass which targets all biodegradable substrates increases the our and improves the oxygen transfer efficiency when compared to the case without active biomass at the high air flow and high do the addition of cellulose did not impact the nour however it increased the our from off gas and the our from respiration by 27 and 30 respectively indicating that the addition of cellulose while maintaining high do enhanced the substrates utilization rate which subsequently improved asote and α factor by 25 and 23 respectively at the low air flow and low do the addition of cellulose had a negligible impact on α factor and the our off gas this happened since in both cases i e the rbf effluent only and the rbf effluent with the addition of cellulose scod concentrations were high due to the very low biodegradation rates and the scod effect on the α factor was more predominant than the effect of cellulose 3 2 4 oxygen transfer efficiency in secondary effluent oxygen transfer in the secondary effluent was measured and showed α factors of 0 69 and 0 57 at the high and low air flows respectively confirming that the suppressed transfer efficiency observed at the end of the cycle was limited by the secondary effluent water quality in fact even though the overwhelming majority of the load was removed by the end of a secondary process to at least meet the secondary bod tss standards of 30 30 mg l 1 the values of the α factor are usually far from reaching such high levels in fact the residual concentration of organics in the water not necessarily from the primary effluent but by products of microbial metabolism tseng et al 2013 still affects persistently the oxygen transfer the attribution of this inability to recover the oxygen transfer in full should therefore not be placed solely on the presence of the suspended biomass henkel et al 2009 fig 7 summarizes the α factor improvement due to the biomass effect it is interesting to note that biodegradation and biosorption increased the α factor from 0 30 in the rbf effluent to 0 56 in the secondary effluent with biomass the removal of biomass yielded a marginal increase in α factor from 0 56 to 0 60 3 3 aeration model results 3 3 1 model calibration the kinetic coefficients were calibrated using the in cycle measurements of mlvss scod and ammonia in the sbr2 table s2 our respiration profiles from three different cycles were used to verify ss and si fractions fig s5 the concentrations of ss were estimated using eq 18 the tested cycles from sbr2 filtered had an average tcod of 412 mg l 1 scod of 215 mg l 1 and an estimated ss of 190 mg l 1 which constitutes 46 of the tcod and 89 of the scod the corresponding values in the calibrated model were 47 of tcod and 86 of scod 18 i n f l u e n t s s o u r f o r a r e a a m g l 1 y h v a c t i v a t e d s l u d g e l v w a s t e w a t e r l v w a s t e w a t e r l the model mlvss values were calibrated to match the mlvss measured during the aeration cycle fig s6 the heterotrophic maximum specific growth rate μh and the carbonaceous substrate half saturation constant ks were calibrated to match the scod profiles fig s7 the autotrophic maximum specific growth rate μa and the ammonium half saturation constant knh3n were calibrated to match ammonia profiles fig s8 the hydrolysis rate of the cellulose was calculated using the measured cellulose from both tests with the addition of 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 assuming first order biodegradation kinetics and the average kcl was 4 1 d 1 fig s9 3 3 2 experimental correlation between α factor and scod a negative correlation between α factor and scod in the sbr was identified with a coefficient of determination of 0 75 fig 8 this correlation appears to be a combination of two linear correlations for scod more than 75 mg l 1 the improvement of the α factor due to the decrease in scod was slow due to the presence of surfactants that negatively affected the oxygen transfer process for scod less than 75 mg l 1 the α factor dramatically increased with the scod decrease confirming the higher sensitivity of the α factor to scod the estimated relationship between α factor and scod eq 19 was then integrated into the model to estimate the α factor as a function of the state variable scod with time 19 α 4 275 s c o d 0 557 3 3 3 model validation the developed model was used as a predictive tool to quantify the air flow required to mitigate the reduction in oxygen transfer efficiency due to the organic loading both sbrs were modeled sbr1 without primary treatment influent characteristics of cod 643 mg l 1 scod 255 mg l 1 tn 35 mg l 1 and nh4 24 mg l 1 sbr2 with rbf treatment influent characteristic of cod 465 mg l 1 scod 255 mg l 1 tn 34 mg l 1 and nh4 20 mg l 1 both sbrs were modeled to target a do set point of 2 mg l 1 initial inputs to each scenario are shown in tables s3 s4 s5 and s6 fig 9a shows the modeled vs measured temporal variation of the α factor due to changes in the sbr scod concentrations the measured and modeled α factors for both reactors were comparable with an average percentage error of 4 2 and 3 7 for sbr1 and sbr2 respectively the α factor was very low at the beginning of the aeration cycle for both sbrs due to the high concentration of the scod which necessitates applying high air flow rates to mitigate the reduction in oxygen transfer efficiency the α factor recovered with time due to the biodegradation of the readily biodegradable substrates as expected the α factor in the sbr1 recovered faster due to a higher biomass concentration of 3000 mg l 1 when compared to all other modeled scenarios with an average biomass concentration of 2000 mg l 1 fig 9b shows the temporal variation of the modeled versus measured 30 min moving average air flow rate the measured and modeled air flow rates for both reactors were comparable with an average percent error of 6 3 and 5 9 for sbr1 and sbr2 respectively the moving average air flow correlates with the actual organic and nitrogen loading rates removed through the cycle the air requirements for both reactors were high at the beginning of the cycle and decreased with the time due to the biodegradation of the organics sbr2 had lower air flow requirements when compared to sbr 1 due to the partial removal of cellulose and slowly biodegradable substrate by the rbf the presence of cellulose in the influent reduces the α factor on one hand and increases the oxygen requirements on the other hand additionally sbr2 with the addition of 100 mgacetate l 1 and sbr2 with the addition of 100 mgcellulose l 1 were modeled table 6 summarizes the average α factor required air flow and energy consumption for the four modeled scenarios on average sbr 2 had a lower air flow requirement of 0 90 m3 hr 1 0 53 scfm when compared to sbr1 1 19 m3 hr 1 0 70 scfm leading to an overall energy saving of 25 per cycle due to the rbf which was identical to what was observed experimentally the energy saving per kgo2 consumed per day was 8 5 which was comparable to the 6 7 that was achieved experimentally the addition of acetate required more air flow as oxygen requirements increased and more air was required to maintain the same oxygen transfer rate the addition of acetate increased the required airflow in the sbr2 by 50 when compared to its absence the addition of cellulose impacted both the α factor and the sotr increasing the required air flow rate by 33 sbr2 100 mgcellulose l 1 had a higher air flow requirement of 1 34 m3 h 1 0 79 scfm than sbr1 1 19 m3 h 1 0 7 scfm due to the higher biomass concentration in sbr1 than sbr2 100 mgcellulose l 1 the addition of acetate required more air compared to other scenarios since all the added acetate is readily biodegradable the addition of cellulose showed a lower impact on the α factor and hence air flow since most of the added cellulose is slowly biodegradable and a reduced amount of additional air was required when compared to the case with acetate the validation proved that the established correlation eq 19 can be used as a design tool to predict the dynamic α factor and subsequently dynamic air flow rates in sbr systems in continuous flow systems with plug flow reactors the α factor change induced by biodegradation can be estimated using eq 19 and used to design a tapered aeration system that is more efficient than uniform aeration in plug flow reactors in continuous flow systems with completely mixed reactors this approach should be valid as it will estimate uniform and high α factor throughout the whole reactor due to low scod concentrations this is consistent with the literature since completely mixed reactors are characterized by their high α factors gillot and héduit 2000 mahendraker et al 2005 rieth et al 1990 relative to plug flow reactors 4 summary and conclusions based on the results reported in the manuscript the following conclusions could be drawn in an sbr a regular increase in α factor with reaction time should be expected hence during sbr design a variable α factor should be used the presence of active biomass improves the α factor due to enhanced biodegradation at the low air flow and low do with active biomass the α factor decreased due to the presence of acetate and cellulose by 48 and 19 respectively at the high air flow and high do with active biomass the α factor was constant irrespective of cellulose and acetate concentrations without active biomass the α factor decreased due to the addition of acetate in both cases i e the high and low air flows with biomass the α factor increased with the biodegradation of surfactants and scod peaking at 0 56 despite the removal of the vast majority of the organic and nitrogen load the highest α factor value achievable in the sbr secondary effluent without biomass was 0 60 this indicated that biomass has a marginal beneficial impact on the α factor in secondary effluents while the residual contaminants cause the depression of alpha a dynamic model was developed to calculate the required real time air flow rate as a function of the change in scod the rbf reduced the required airflow and hence energy by 25 due to the removal of cellulose along with other slowly biodegradable substrates compared to no primary treatment the dynamic model indicated that the addition of 100 mgacetate l 1 to sbr2 with an initial scod concentration of 135 mg l 1 and cellulose concentration of 25 mg l 1 increased the airflow requirements by 50 to compensate for the reduction in α factor similarly the addition of 100 mg cellulose l 1 to sbr2 increased the air requirements by

17267,identifying sewage contamination via microbial source tracking mst marker genes has proven useful for effective water quality management worldwide however performance evaluations for these marker genes in tropical areas are limited therefore this research evaluated four human associated mst marker genes human polyomaviruses jc and bk viruses hpyvs bacteriophage crassphage cpq 056 lachnospiraceae lachno3 and bacteroides bacv6 21 for tracking sewage pollution in aquatic environments of thailand the viral marker genes hpyv and crassphage were highly sensitive and specific to sewage from onsite wastewater treatment plants owtps n 19 with no cross detection in 120 composite swine cattle chicken duck goat sheep and buffalo fecal samples the bacterial marker genes lachno3 and bacv6 21 demonstrated high sensitivity but moderate specificity however using both markers could improve specificity to 0 80 max value of 1 00 the most abundant markers in owtp samples were lachno3

abundance of viral markers were further investigated in environmental waters in which hpyvs showed greater levels up to 4 33 log10 copies 100 ml and greater detection rates 92 7 in two coastal beaches n 41 than crassphage up to 3 51 log10 copies 100 ml and 56 1 hpyvs were also found at slightly lower levels up to 5 10 log10 copies 100 ml but at higher detection rates 92 6 in a freshwater canal n 27 than crassphage up to 5 21 log10 copies 100 ml and 88 9 hpyvs and crassphage marker genes were identified as highly sensitive and specific for tracking sewage pollution in aquatic environments of

been suggested as an indicator of human fecal pollution in environmental waters farkas et al 2020 and as a viral indicator of untreated sewage tandukar et al 2020 recently crassphage monitoring has been expanded to investigate fomite and hand contamination to potentially prevent pathogenic microbial fecal oral transmission park et al 2020 in the usa and australia human associated bacteria in the

previously described somnark et al 2018b the purpose of pooling fecal and sewage samples was to screen many individuals at a time to reduce sample processing time and associated costs pooled sample testing also tighten the criteria for specificity values which reflects marker distribution at facility levels as previously discussed somnark et al 2018b 2 2 influent and effluent samples from centralized wastewater treatment plants cwtps in addition to owtps the abundance of mst markers was characterized in cwtp inf and cwtp eff samples from two cwtps in chonburi province receiving both

sampling sites and transported to the laboratory on ice field duplicates were collected to examine the reproducibility of the laboratory protocols in the three freshwater and four seawater samples 2 4 water filtration and dna extraction water samples were kept at 5 c and fecal samples at 20 c for no more than three days until filtration and dna extraction were performed two hundred ml of owtp inf were filtered with a 0 22 µm pore size mixed cellulose ester membrane merck millipore billerica ma usa dna was extracted from the filtered membranes and from 150 200 mg of the nonhuman fecal samples using the zr fecal dna miniprep kit zymo research irvine ca usa as previously described kongprajug et al 2020 five hundred ml of the cwtp inf and cwtp eff samples were adjusted to a ph of 3 5 0 2 followed by filtration with a 0 45 µm pore size hawp membrane merck millipore ten liters of seawater samples were preacidified as described above and 1 5 l of each sample were separately filtered filtered membranes were extracted using a quick dna fecal soil microbe miniprep kit zymo research usa and dna extracts of the same sample were combined one liter of freshwater samples was preacidified and 0 5 l was separately filtered dna was extracted with a zymobiomics dna microprep kit zymo research usa and extracts from the same samples were combined the dna concentration was measured with a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo scientific usa and the dna was stored at 80 c until use thirty method blanks were analyzed by processing sterile laboratory water through all steps as quality controls 2 5 qpcr assays and inhibition test the following human associated qpcr primers were used hpyvs mcquaig et al 2009 crassphage cpq 056 stachler et al 2017 lachno3 feng et al 2018 and bacv6 21 feng and mclellan 2019 tables s1 and s2 the qpcr analysis was conducted according to the minimum information for publication of quantitative real time pcr experiments miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 the qpcr reactions were performed with a quantstudio 3 real time pcr system applied biosystems thermo fisher scientific usa for each instrumental run containing unknown samples the dna standard at a concentration of 5 104 5 105 copies per reaction was run in triplicate as a calibration control according to a mixed model kongprajug et al 2020 2019a sivaganesan et al 2010 no template controls ntcs in triplicate were also included in every run the qpcr results were analyzed using quantstudio design analysis software with an automatic baseline and manual adjustment of the threshold values for the hpyv 0 025 crassphage 0 036 lachno3 0 036 and bacv6 21 0 080 different synthetic plasmid standards invitrogen thermo fisher scientific usa containing each marker gene were used to develop standard curves with a mixed model method kongprajug et al 2020 sivaganesan et al 2010 the standard curves were obtained from four replicates of individual instrumental runs each with a triplicate of six ten fold concentrations ranging from 5 101 to 5 106 gene copies reaction the assay limit of detection alod was defined as the lowest concentration in copies reactions of the ten standard replicates that showed a standard deviation of cq 0 5 the assay limit of quantification aloq was considered to be the lowest concentration in copies reactions of the target gene that could be correctly quantified in this case the lowest concentration in the standard curve haugland et al 2010 kongprajug et al 2020 the standard curve performance characteristics qpcr efficiencies alod and aloq for this study are reported in table s3 the method limit of quantification mloq for each sample was calculated as copies 100 ml by incorporating the sample s filtration volume and dna extracted volume in negatively detected environmental samples the mloq ranged from 1 94 2 40 log10 copies 100 ml for hpyvs and from 1 80 3 00 log10 copies 100 ml for crassphage one negative cwtp eff sample had an mloq of 3 29 log10 copies 100 ml inhibition analysis was performed with the dilution method owtp inf dna extracts were diluted to 5 10 and 20 ng and analyzed in duplicate via the hf183 bfdrev assay as previously described kongprajug et al 2020 three dilutions 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 µl of templates from the cwtps and the other environmental samples were examined with the hpyv and crassphage assays cq values for each dilution were plotted against dna concentration and an r 2 of 0 90 suggested significant inhibition the results indicated that qpcr inhibition was not observed in 24 cwtp and 41 seawater samples nor was it found in 19 owtp samples using the hf183 bfdrev assay as previously reported kongprajug et al 2020 however four of 27 freshwater dna samples 14 8 had inhibition therefore to mimimize the inhibition effect the lowest dilution of the dna template was used for the calculations three field blanks and three method blanks processed with the freshwater samples were also analyzed with hpyv and crassphage assays and eight field blanks and ten method blanks examined with the seawater and cwtp samples were tested with the genbac3 assay tables s1 and s2 all field blanks and method blanks were negative showing that no cross contamination occurred in field and laboratory processing steps moreover reproducibility of the laboratory protocols using the hpyv and crassphage assays showed acceptable coefficients of variation in all representative environmental water samples 1 28 19 45 table s4 2 6 qualitative performance measures owtp samples rather than cwtp samples were used to test the assays performances thereby ensuring no stormwater or nonhuman cross contamination five performance criteria were compared for each assay with true positive tp denoting the number of positive target samples true negative tn the number of negative nontarget samples false positive fp the number of positive nontarget samples and false negative fn the number of negative target samples sensitivity was determined by tp tp fn specificity by tn tn fp accuracy by tp tn tp fp tn fn positive predictive value by tp tp fp and negative predictive value by tn tn fn in addition this study selected the previously published crassphage marker gene results for the archived sewage and nonhuman fecal sample sets but the qualitative performance criteria were recalculated for comparison with the hpyv lachno3 and bacv6 21 markers kongprajug et al 2019b 2 7 statistical analyses statistical analyses were carried out using an r statistical program r core team 2019 a chi squared test of two proportions was used to compare significant differences between the assays performance measures significant differences in abundance were tested with one way analysis of variance anova using holm sidak s multiple comparisons datasets containing nondetects were analyzed via nonparametric survival analysis helsel 2012 the significance of differences for datasets containing nondetects was examined via the generalized wilcoxon test peto prentice test for multiple comparisons with holm s bias correction a paired sample comparison for data containing nondetects was also conducted with the paired prentice wilcoxon test correlation analysis was performed using kendall s tau on u score rank and water samples were grouped using principal component analysis and k means clustering the optimum number of clusters was determined by 30 indices using the nbclust package charrad et al 2014 3 results 3 1 qualitative performance measures for all assays all qpcr positive samples contained target genes concentrations that were greater than their corresponding aloq values the hpyv and crassphage viral markers were absolute host specific and sensitive both were detected in all sewage samples and absent in all animal fecal samples tables 1 and s5 the lachno3 and bacv6 21 bacterial markers exhibited comparable sensitivity and negative predictive value to the viral markers chi squared test of two proportions p 0 05 but they had significantly lower specificity accuracy and positive predictive value p 0 05 one negative sewage sample in the bacv6 21 assay presented 5 90 6 53 and 7 05 log10 copies 100 ml for hpyvs crassphage and lachno3 respectively the low specificity of the bacterial markers was found by cross detection in all nonhuman feces excluding duck and buffalo samples for the lachno3 and goat and sheep samples for the bacv6 21 high cross detection rates were observed for the lachno3 marker in swine 73 0 and cattle 36 4 and for the bacv6 21 marker in swine 52 6 which resulted in relatively low accuracy and positive predictive values one cattle one chicken and 14 swine fecal samples showed false positive results for both the lachno3 and bacv6 21 markers the tandem application of lachno3 and bacv6 21 could improve sewage specificity to 0 855 accuracy to 0 868 and positive predictive value to 0 529 3 2 marker abundance in human sewage and nonhuman fecal samples the abundance levels in owtp inf n 19 were highest for both bacterial markers lachno3 5 42 8 02 log10 copies 100 ml and bacv6 21 nondetect 8 05 log10 copies 100 ml fig 1 and table s6 hpyvs 3 66 6 53 log10 copies 100 ml showed significantly lower abundance than crassphage 5 28 7 38 log10 copies 100 ml and both were significantly lower than the bacterial markers paired prentice wilcoxon test p 0 001 the swine fecal samples showed cross detection with the lachno3 n 27 and bacv6 21 n 20 markers of up to 9 12 and 7 66 log10 copies g feces respectively the chicken fecal samples presented lachno3 n 1 and bacv6 21 n 4 markers of up to 8 21 and 8 07 log10 copies g feces respectively 3 3 hpyvs and crassphage in cwtp samples further investigation of the highly host associated hpyvs and crassphage revealed a 100 positive presence in all cwtp inf and cwtp eff samples from the two cwtps except for one cwtp2 eff hpyv sample fig 2 and table s7 no significant difference in hpyv abundance was observed between cwtp1 inf 4 38 6 03 log10 copies 100 ml and cwtp2 inf 5 69 6 02 log10 copies 100 ml and between cwtp1 eff 3 91 4 86 log10 copies 100 ml and cwtp2 eff nondetect nonnondetect5 09 log10 copies 100 ml p 0 05 the generalized wilcoxon test with holm s bias correction cwtp1 did not significantly remove hpyvs with log10 reduction values ranging from 0 25 1 26 on the other hand hpyv levels in cwtp2 eff were significantly lower than in cwtp2 inf p 0 05 the generalized wilcoxon test with holm s bias correction with a 0 86 to a 2 40 log10 reduction there were also no significant differences in hpyv levels for owtp inf and cwtp inf sewage samples p 0 05 one way anova with holm sidak s multiple comparisons as with hpyvs crassphage demonstrated similar abundance in both cwtp1 inf and cwtp2 inf 5 04 7 16 and 6 19 7 16 log10 copies 100 ml and in both cwtp1 eff and cwtp2 eff 4 64 5 81 and 3 96 5 96 log10 copies 100 ml cwtp1 could not reduce crassphage 0 01 0 96 log10 reduction while cwtp2 could significantly decrease its abundance 1 15 2 52 log10 reduction crassphage abundance also showed no significant differencent abundance levels between owtp inf and cwtp inf samples crassphage was found at significantly greater abundance levels than hpyvs in all samples except cwtp1 inf p 0 05 paired prentice wilcoxon test fig 2 the hpyvs and crasssphage in cwtps were moderately correlated showing a kendall s tau value of 0 483 p 0 05 fig 3 a 3 4 hpyvs and crassphage in environmental water samples hpyvs were present in most beach a 94 1 beach b 91 7 and freshwater c 92 6 samples while crassphage was positive at a lower rate beach a 41 2 beach b 66 7 freshwater c 88 9 fig 2 and table s7 hpyvs were found at similar abundance levels at beaches a and b ranging from nondetect 4 12 log10 copies 100 ml and from nondetect 4 33 log10 copies 100 ml respectively however hpyv abundance was significantly higher in freshwater c samples nondetect to 5 10 log10 copies 100 ml crassphage markers were significantly lower in beach a nondetect 2 68 log10 copies 100 ml than in beach b samples nondetect 3 51 log10 copies 100 ml p 0 05 the generalized wilcoxon test with holm s bias correction and both beaches showed a significantly lower abundance of crassphage than did freshwater c samples nondetect 5 21 log10 copies 100 ml hpyv levels were significantly higher than crassphage levels in beaches a and b but lower than crassphage in freshwater c p 0 05 paired prentice wilcoxon test fig 2 in 38 hpyv positive beach samples 22 were also crassphage positive while one hpyv negative sample was crassphage positive when using crassphage as a screening parameter a crassphage positive sample could provide 96 confidence of hpyv presence positive predictive value 0 96 however a crassphage negative sample could provide only 11 confidence of hpyv absence negative predictive value 0 11 in freshwater samples 23 of 25 hpyv positive samples were also crassphage positive while only one hpyv negative sample was crassphage positive therefore crassphage provided a positive predictive value of 0 96 and a negative predictive value of 0 33 for hpyvs two crassphage negative freshwater samples showed 2 75 and 3 45 log10 copies 100 ml for hpyvs while one hpyv negative sample contained 4 19 log10 copies 100 ml of crassphage a moderate correlation was also observed between the two markers kendall s tau 0 453 p 0 001 fig 3b when separately calculated a moderate correlation was observed for freshwater c kendall s tau 0 558 p 0 05 while no significant correlation was shown for the beach samples cluster analysis indicated two optimal clusters the first dimension constituted the highest variance 80 6 with an eigenvalue of 1 612 while the second dimension showed a 19 4 variance with an eigenvalue of 0 388 fig 4 the two clusters placed most freshwater samples designated as mps into the high contamination group while most of the seawater samples labeled a through g were placed in the low contamination group samples were clustered into the low contamination group when 1 hpyvs were 2 78 log10 copies 100 ml or 2 when hpyvs were 2 78 but crassphage was 2 60 log10 copies 100 ml the distributions of both clusters were illustrated in box plots with the high contamination group representing hpyvs from 2 79 5 10 log10 copies 100 ml median 3 82 log10 copies 100 ml and crassphage from 2 10 5 21 log10 copies 100 ml median 4 30 log10 copies 100 ml fig 5 the low contamination cluster contained samples with hpyv levels up to 4 12 log10 copies 100 ml median 2 54 log10 copies 100 ml and crassphage up to 4 19 log10 copies 100 ml median 2 05 log10 copies 100 ml 4 discussion 4 1 higher human specificity of the two viral markers than of the two bacterial markers the hpyv marker targeting both bk and jc viruses has shown 100 specificity for owtp inf with no cross detection in any of the nonhuman fecal samples in this study or in other geographical regions ahmed et al 2019a mcquaig et al 2009 staley et al 2012 exceptions have been found only in one of 30 bird fecal samples and one of ten pig wastewater samples in australia ahmed et al 2019a 2010 crassphage showed excellent specificity in this study however previous reports have indicated cross detection in one composite swine sample from earlier work in thailand kongprajug et al 2019b and in dog cat gull poultry and cattle samples from other geographical regions ahmed et al 2018b 2018a stachler et al 2017 overall the results indicate that using individual viral markers either hpyvs or crassphage or in combination offers the highest specificity and sensitivity for sewage pollution tracking a similar trend showing higher specificity among viral markers than among bacterial markers has also been observed in southeast queensland australia ahmed et al 2019a this could be explained by the co presence of certain gut bacterial genera in animals and humans feng et al 2020 lachno3 and bacv6 21 have demonstrated relatively low specificity however simultaneously applying both bacterial markers could improve their separate specificities to 0 80 bacv6 21 has shown high sensitivity and specificity for humans and could not be detected in nonhuman fecal samples cat cattle deer dog pig chicken and gull in the usa feng and mclellan 2019 however cross detection has been reported in cattle chicken pig buffalo and duck fecal samples in thailand at two to eight orders of magnitude g this study and in bird cow chicken dog emu and sheep fecal samples in australia at two to nine orders of magnitude g of feces ahmed et al 2019a these contradictory results emphasize geographical differences in mst marker genes performance such cross detection with nonhuman fecal samples have mainly limited the application of bacterial markers in areas especially where fecal pollution occurs from both human and nonhuman sources the low specificity of lachno3 is due to its high cross detection in cattle pigs sheep and goats lachno3 has also been detected in nonhuman fecal samples in australia including bird cat deer and horse at four to seven orders of magnitude g of feces ahmed et al 2019a originally lachno3 was designed from highly sewage associated dna regions as identified by metagenomics data and it demonstrated no cross reactivity in ten cattle and nine pig samples from the milwaukee area of the usa feng et al 2018 however cattle being raised in thailand with exposure to different diets and environmental stressors may affect the animals gut microbiomes mach et al 2020 shanks et al 2014 2011 this has been supported by another marker targeting the lachnospiraceae 16s v6 region which has shown diverse prevalence in cattle with different feeding diets and across different cattle types i e dairy and beef cattle feng et al 2018 newton et al 2011 other than the intrinsic presence of marker sequence in nontargeted samples low assay specificity could also be caused by nonspecific pcr amplification feng et al 2020 in a previous study the cross reactivity of lachno3 with animal feces was likely caused by nonspecific qpcr amplification as supported by an absence of lachno3 in the metagenomic analysis feng et al 2018 lachnospiraceae has been reported as adversely increased nonspecific pcr amplification by lowering the annealing temperature which could in turn increase pcr efficiency feng et al 2018 in this study the annealing temperature of the lachno3 qpcr cycling condition was adjusted from 64 c as originally designed to 60 c for the following reasons 1 the master mix reagent used in this study i e 2x itaq universal probes supermix biorad usa was recommended for use at 60 c according to the manufacturer s instructions and 2 higher pcr efficiency as shown by the steeper slope of the amplification plot was observed at 60 c compared to 64 c according to a preliminary test figure s1 the corresponding pcr efficiency for the lachno3 assay in this research was 94 3 which is similar to that in the original study 95 5 feng et al 2018 the variation in the optimal annealing temperature between this study and the original study may have been caused by the different qpcr reagents and apparatuses used bacich et al 2011 burgos et al 2002 nshimyimana et al 2017 siefring et al 2008 4 2 higher abundance of the two bacterial markers than of the two viral markers in owtp samples though they expressed inferior human source specificity both lachno3 and bacv6 21 demonstrated higher abundance in owtp inf than did the hpyvs and crassphage viral markers lachno3 has been detected in cwtp inf in the usa and australia at five and eight orders of magnitude 100 ml respectively ahmed et al 2019a feng et al 2018 these measures are similar to the range found in thailand the abundance of the bacv6 21 marker in cwtp inf has been found to be six to eight orders of magnitude 100 ml in the usa feng and mclellan 2019 and approximately eight orders of magnitude 100 ml in australia ahmed et al 2019a also in a similar range to owtp inf in thailand a higher abundance of bacterial markers than of viral markers was observed in cwtp inf and in human feces ahmed et al 2019a although faster decay rates of bacterial than of viral dna markers have been reported in both freshwater and seawater ahmed et al 2019b ballesté et al 2019 greaves et al 2020 the higher abundance of bacterial markers in sewage could be due to the higher excretion rates of gut bacteria than of enteric viruses or to the better adsorption of viruses to particulate matters potentially caused by the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions chahal et al 2016 horswell et al 2010 4 3 suitability of hpyv and crassphage as human associated mst markers 4 3 1 higher abundance and removal of crassphage than of hpyvs in cwtp samples hpyvs both bk and jc viruses have exhibited 100 sensitivity to untreated sewage as shown in this study and in other geographical locations rachmadi et al 2016 however less sensitivity to individual urine samples has been reported mcquaig et al 2009 hpyvs were present in owtp inf and cwtp inf in thailand expressed as copies 100 ml three to six orders at levels comparable to those detected in cwtp inf in australia five to six orders ahmed et al 2019a japan four orders hata et al 2013 and the usa four to six orders kitajima et al 2014 korajkic et al 2020 mcquaig et al 2009 schmitz et al 2016 staley et al 2012 tandukar et al 2020 wu et al 2020 no significant differences were observed between hpyvs from septic tanks and cwtp inf in the usa mcquaig et al 2009 crassphage cpq 056 in both owtp inf and cwtp inf in this study five to seven orders expressed as copies 100 ml was equally abundant as that found in cwtp inf from indiana usa wu et al 2020 but higher than that found in cwtp inf from elsewhere in the usa two to four orders stachler et al 2017 and slightly lower than that found in cwtp inf from australia eight orders ahmed et al 2018a 2018b and from two other studies in new orleans and across the usa up to nine orders korajkic et al 2020 tandukar et al 2020 crassphage cpq 056 was reported as up to six orders expressed as copies 100 ml in a secondary treated effluent in louisiana usa tandukar et al 2020 another crassphage marker detected with a crass up lp assay reported as four to six orders and expressed as copies 100 ml in cwtp eff samples from spain ballesté et al 2019 relatively similar ranges of both hpyvs and crassphage from different geographical regions underscore their usefulness as global sewage indicators neither wastewater treatment capacity nor wastewater volume received affected the concentrations of hpyvs and crassphage as previously stated crank et al 2020 however differences in reported quantity could result from intrinsic factors such as different gut microbial levels due to diets and lifestyles honap et al 2020 mah et al 2008 turnbaugh et al 2009 and extrinsic factors such as temperature ph total suspended solids sewer pipe condition and retention time ahmed et al 2019b booncharoen et al 2018 okadera et al 2020 comparisons among different studies could also present confounding biases due to different field and laboratory protocols analytical instruments and data analysis methods which could affect each virus at different levels agetsuma yanagihara et al 2017 crank et al 2020 kongprajug et al 2020 petcharat et al 2020 shanks et al 2012 this study presented hpyvs and crassphage removals through wastewater treatment processes through secondary sedimentation of 2 40 and 2 52 log10 removal respectively in an activated sludge treatment plant cwtp2 the oxidation ditch treatment plant cwtp1 removed neither viral marker different treatment processes could be one of the factors affecting removal efficiency as it has been previously reported that activated sludge treatment facilities more significantly reduce crassphage levels than do biofilter treatment plants farkas et al 2019 various maximum removal levels of hpyvs in treatment facilities at points prior to the disinfection process have been reported ranging from 1 33 log10 removal in indiana usa wu et al 2020 to 2 9 log10 removals in japan and louisiana usa hata et al 2013 tandukar et al 2020 crassphage has been removed at 2 48 log10 removal by a wastewater treatment facility in indiana usa wu et al 2020 as similarly observed in this study crassphage has been present in cwtp inf at higher concentrations than hpyvs crank et al 2020 farkas et al 2019 2018 tandukar et al 2020 and has been more significantly reduced than hpyvs through wastewater treatment plants in indiana and louisiana usa tandukar et al 2020 wu et al 2020 the difference in removal efficiency between the two markers could be caused by the varying behaviors of each virus as demonstrated by the effect concentration methods have on crassphage but not on hpyvs crank et al 2020 moderate to high correlations between the two markers have been observed in indiana usa pearson correlation coefficient of 0 87 wu et al 2020 louisiana usa pearson correlation coefficient of 0 89 and 0 91 in cwtp inf with jc and bk respectively tandukar et al 2020 the uk spearman correlation coefficient of 0 50 and 0 67 in cwtp inf and cwtp eff respectively farkas et al 2019 and italy spearman s rank correlation coefficients of 0 74 and 0 85 depending on two different concentration methods crank et al 2020 overall the present study promotes the suitability of crassphage as a sewage associated indicator due to its consistently high abundance 4 3 2 higher abundance in seawater and higher positive rate in freshwater of hpyvs than of crassphage a significantly higher abundance of crassphage than of hpyvs in freshwater at water temperatures of 28 4 35 4 c has been observed in this study conforming to other researches conducted also in freshwater in an impacted stream in pennsylvania usa crassphage cpq 056 assay and hpyvs were reported at four to six and one to four orders expressed as copies 100 ml respectively with no significant correlation observed stachler et al 2018 another study in the uk represented two to six orders of crassphage cpq 056 and up to three orders of hpyvs jc in freshwater with moderate correlation spearman correlation coefficient of 0 49 farkas et al 2019 2018 a river in nepal was monitored for crassphage cpq 056 at four to seven orders expressed as copies 100 ml and hpyvs jc and bk of up to six orders moderate correlation spearman s rank order correlation coefficient of 0 47 was found between crassphage and bk while no correlation was found between crassphage and jc tandukar et al 2018 ward et al 2020 however although hpyvs were lower in abundance than crassphage they exhibited a higher positive rate in freshwater samples and thus presented higher benefits for water quality monitoring indicating human pollution although crassphage had a significantly higher abundance than hpyvs in owtp and cwtp samples its opposite trend was observed in thailand s seawater at water temperatures of 27 8 31 9 c similar decay rates of both markers were observed in both freshwater and seawater microcosms at 18 28 c and when exposed to sunlight ahmed et al 2019b greaves et al 2020 however other physical chemical and biological factors could affect the fate and transport of each virus differently in this study no significant correlation was observed between hpyvs and crassphage in seawater implying the markers different behaviors further investigation is therefore needed to characterize factors affecting the different abundance levels in these sampling sites and to expand the investigation to other seawater and freshwater sites to develop a better understanding in summary this study suggests that both hpyvs and crassphage may be used to monitor seawater and freshwater identifying human fecal pollution in thailand 5 conclusions the two viral markers hpyvs and crassphage demonstrated ideal performance for sewage source tracking in thailand the two bacterial markers lachno3 and bacv6 21 presented high sensitivity but moderate specificity with cross detection in poultry chicken and duck and livestock swine cattle goat sheep and buffalo both bacterial markers were present in owtp inf at similar levels and were significantly higher than the two viral markers crassphage was significantly higher than hpyvs in owtp inf in the influents of cwtp2 and in the effluents of both cwtp1 and cwtp2 hpyvs showed higher positive rates than crassphage in freshwater and seawater but presented significantly higher levels only in seawater hpyvs and crassphage expressed moderate correlations in wastewater treatment kendall s tau 0 483 and environmental waters kendall s tau 0 453 and can be used to indicate high and low contamination clusters the results suggested that hpyvs and crassphage or in combination may act as human associated mst markers in contaminated aquatic environments this study also highlighted the necessity of validating mst markers in sewage and local environmental waters to effectively facilitate water

17267,identifying sewage contamination via microbial source tracking mst marker genes has proven useful for effective water quality management worldwide however performance evaluations for these marker genes in tropical areas are limited therefore this research evaluated four human associated mst marker genes human polyomaviruses jc and bk viruses hpyvs bacteriophage crassphage cpq 056 lachnospiraceae lachno3 and bacteroides bacv6 21 for tracking sewage pollution in aquatic environments of thailand the viral marker genes hpyv and crassphage were highly sensitive and specific to sewage from onsite wastewater treatment plants owtps n 19 with no cross detection in 120 composite swine cattle chicken duck goat sheep and buffalo fecal samples the bacterial marker genes lachno3 and bacv6 21 demonstrated high sensitivity but moderate specificity however using both markers could improve specificity to 0 80 max value of 1 00 the most abundant markers in owtp samples were lachno3 and bacv6 21 5 42 8 02 and nondetect 8 05 log10 copies 100 ml crassphage 5 28 7 38 log10 copies 100 ml and hpyvs 3 66 6 53 log10 copies 100 ml respectively due to their increased specificity the abundance of viral markers were further investigated in environmental waters in which hpyvs showed greater levels up to 4 33 log10 copies 100 ml and greater detection rates 92 7 in two coastal beaches n 41 than crassphage up to 3 51 log10 copies 100 ml and 56 1 hpyvs were also found at slightly lower levels up to 5 10 log10 copies 100 ml but at higher detection rates 92 6 in a freshwater canal n 27 than crassphage up to 5 21 log10 copies 100 ml and 88 9 hpyvs and crassphage marker genes were identified as highly sensitive and specific for tracking sewage pollution in aquatic environments of

et al 2013 harwood et al 2014 mayer et al 2018 sirikanchana et al 2014 pinpointing pollution sources could lead to effective pollution mitigation and improved risk assessment ballesté et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 various mst methods have been developed and validated to discriminate between contamination from different hosts of these quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr is the most widely used method ahmed et al 2020 layton et al 2013 mayer et al 2018 these qpcr assays target specific marker genes from microorganisms associated with the feces of animals among human associated viral mst marker genes human polyomaviruses hpyvs have been used as indicators of sewage pollution in many regions ahmed et al 2019a mcquaig et al 2009 rachmadi et al 2016 staley et al 2012 hpyvs are nonenveloped icosahedral double stranded dna viruses belonging to the polyomaviridae family moens et al 2017 hpyvs bk and jc viruses in the betapolyomavirus genus cause nephropathy and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy respectively moens et al 2017 crassphage is a bacteriophage which was first discovered by a comparative metagenomic approach called cross assembly crass crassphage has been suggested as an indicator of human fecal pollution in environmental waters farkas et al 2020 and as a viral indicator of untreated sewage tandukar et al 2020 recently crassphage monitoring has been expanded to investigate fomite and hand contamination to potentially prevent pathogenic microbial fecal oral transmission park et al 2020 in the usa and australia human associated bacteria in the family lachnospiraceae lachno3 and the genus bacteroides bacv6 21 have also been proposed as mst markers for human fecal pollution tracking in environmental waters qpcr assays have been developed to detect these marker genes ahmed et al 2019a feng et al 2018 feng and mclellan 2019 lachnospiraceae are anaerobic bacteria belonging to the order clostridiales which are prevalent in the human gut microbiota the bacv6 21 marker was initially designed from metagenomics data to target nonfecal bacteroides from the urban sewer system rather than solely from human feces feng and mclellan 2019 bacv6 21 showed superior sensitivity to the influents of centralized wastewater treatment plants cwtp inf n 40 in the usa feng and mclellan 2019 bacv6 21 was designed from sewer microorganisms and hpyvs from human urine therefore both were not expected to be present in human feces in australia lachno3 and crassphage were also found in 68 9 and 37 9 of individual human fecal samples n 29 respectively but they were both present in 100 of cwtp inf samples n 3 confirming that these markers are more suitable for tracking sewage pollution at the community level ahmed et al 2019a untreated sewage is a significant source of environmental water contamination especially in middle and low income countries where wastewater treatment facilities may be inadequate and ineffective world health organization and unicef 2017 pollution control department pcd 2020 since the performance of mst markers may vary geographically mayer et al 2018 somnark et al 2018a they must be characterized before being applied in new geographical regions this study therefore investigated the performance of the two viral hpyvs and crassphage and two bacterial lachno3 and bacv6 21 marker gene assays in thailand the markers which performed best were further assessed for their abundance in influents of onsite wastewater treatment plants owtp inf influents and effluents of centralized wastewater treatment plants cwtp inf and cwtp eff and environmental water including seawater and freshwater results presented in this study will facilitate appropriate mst marker selection and application for mitigating fecal pollution issues in thailand 2 materials and methods 2 1 human sewage and nonhuman fecal samples assay performance was assessed using archived dna from human i e sewage and nonhuman fecal samples kongprajug et al 2019b somnark et al 2018b sewage samples n 19 were previously collected from 12 owtps of hospitals with 80 inpatient beds in bangkok nonthaburi saraburi samut sakhon samut prakan and chon buri provinces sewage samples from owtps were collected to represent only human fecal source with no cross contamination from stormwater industrial sources or pets two hundred ml of untreated sewage were collected and stored in sterile plastic bottles containing 3 33 ml of 0 3 sodium thiosulfate one hundred and twenty nonhuman composite fecal samples were collected by combining at least 20 individual fecal samples from the same animal species within each farm in bangkok nakhon pathom phra nakhon si ayutthaya pathum thani suphan buri and chai nat provinces samples were collected from the following animal species due to their high prevalence in the area cattle n 34 chicken n 23 and swine n 38 samples were also taken from animals of lower prevalence buffalo n 6 duck n 5 goat n 10 and sheep n 4 as previously described somnark et al 2018b the purpose of pooling fecal and sewage samples was to screen many individuals at a time to reduce sample processing time and associated costs pooled sample testing also tighten the criteria for specificity values which reflects marker distribution at facility levels as previously discussed somnark et al 2018b 2 2 influent and effluent samples from centralized wastewater treatment plants cwtps in addition to owtps the abundance of mst markers was characterized in cwtp inf and cwtp eff samples from two cwtps in chonburi province receiving both domestic sewage and stormwater runoff through combined sewer systems one liter of grab samples n 24 was collected over six sampling campaigns november 2018 to may 2019 at two sampling points one after bar screening cwtp inf and the other after secondary sedimentation tank treatment cwtp eff the first treatment plant cwtp1 uses an oxidation ditch process receiving 5 780 cu m of wastewater day the second facility cwtp2 employs an activated sludge system accepting 71 547 cu m of wastewater day samples were transported on ice to the laboratory within six hours of collection two field blanks were collected at sampling sites as quality controls and transported to the laboratory on ice with the other samples 2 3 seawater and freshwater samples the abundance of mst markers was also measured in seawater and freshwater samples seawater samples n 41 were received from seven sampling points over two beaches in chonburi province beaches a and b ten liters of samples were collected at 30 cm below the water s surface freshwater samples n 27 were collected from nine canal stations near an industrial estate in rayong province freshwater c one liter of samples was taken with a water sampler at 30 cm below the water s surface all samples were placed in sterile plastic containers and transported to the laboratory on ice within six hours of collection nine field blanks were also collected at sampling sites and transported to the laboratory on ice field duplicates were collected to examine the reproducibility of the laboratory protocols in the three freshwater and four seawater samples 2 4 water filtration and dna extraction water samples were kept at 5 c and fecal samples at 20 c for no more than three days until filtration and dna extraction were performed two hundred ml of owtp inf were filtered with a 0 22 µm pore size mixed cellulose ester membrane merck millipore billerica ma usa dna was extracted from the filtered membranes and from 150 200 mg of the nonhuman fecal samples using the zr fecal dna miniprep kit zymo research irvine ca usa as previously described kongprajug et al 2020 five hundred ml of the cwtp inf and cwtp eff samples were adjusted to a ph of 3 5 0 2 followed by filtration with a 0 45 µm pore size hawp membrane merck millipore ten liters of seawater samples were preacidified as described above and 1 5 l of each sample were separately filtered filtered membranes were extracted using a quick dna fecal soil microbe miniprep kit zymo research usa and dna extracts of the same sample were combined one liter of freshwater samples was preacidified and 0 5 l was separately filtered dna was extracted with a zymobiomics dna microprep kit zymo research usa and extracts from the same samples were combined the dna concentration was measured with a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo scientific usa and the dna was stored at 80 c until use thirty method blanks were analyzed by processing sterile laboratory water through all steps as quality controls 2 5 qpcr assays and inhibition test the following human associated qpcr primers were used hpyvs mcquaig et al 2009 crassphage cpq 056 stachler et al 2017 lachno3 feng et al 2018 and bacv6 21 feng and mclellan 2019 tables s1 and s2 the qpcr analysis was conducted according to the minimum information for publication of quantitative real time pcr experiments miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 the qpcr reactions were performed with a quantstudio 3 real time pcr system applied biosystems thermo fisher scientific usa for each instrumental run containing unknown samples the dna standard at a concentration of 5 104 5 105 copies per reaction was run in triplicate as a calibration control according to a mixed model kongprajug et al 2020 2019a sivaganesan et al 2010 no template controls ntcs in triplicate were also included in every run the qpcr results were analyzed using quantstudio design analysis software with an automatic baseline and manual adjustment of the threshold values for the hpyv 0 025 crassphage 0 036 lachno3 0 036 and bacv6 21 0 080 different synthetic plasmid standards invitrogen thermo fisher scientific usa containing each marker gene were used to develop standard curves with a mixed model method kongprajug et al 2020 sivaganesan et al 2010 the standard curves were obtained from four replicates of individual instrumental runs each with a triplicate of six ten fold concentrations ranging from 5 101 to 5 106 gene copies reaction the assay limit of detection alod was defined as the lowest concentration in copies reactions of the ten standard replicates that showed a standard deviation of cq 0 5 the assay limit of quantification aloq was considered to be the lowest concentration in copies reactions of the target gene that could be correctly quantified in this case the lowest concentration in the standard curve haugland et al 2010 kongprajug et al 2020 the standard curve performance characteristics qpcr efficiencies alod and aloq for this study are reported in table s3 the method limit of quantification mloq for each sample was calculated as copies 100 ml by incorporating the sample s filtration volume and dna extracted volume in negatively detected environmental samples the mloq ranged from 1 94 2 40 log10 copies 100 ml for hpyvs and from 1 80 3 00 log10 copies 100 ml for crassphage one negative cwtp eff sample had an mloq of 3 29 log10 copies 100 ml inhibition analysis was performed with the dilution method owtp inf dna extracts were diluted to 5 10 and 20 ng and analyzed in duplicate via the hf183 bfdrev assay as previously described kongprajug et al 2020 three dilutions 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 µl of templates from the cwtps and the other environmental samples were examined with the hpyv and crassphage assays cq values for each dilution were plotted against dna concentration and an r 2 of 0 90 suggested significant inhibition the results indicated that qpcr inhibition was not observed in 24 cwtp and 41 seawater samples nor was it found in 19 owtp samples using the hf183 bfdrev assay as previously reported kongprajug et al 2020 however four of 27 freshwater dna samples 14 8 had inhibition therefore to mimimize the inhibition effect the lowest dilution of the dna template was used for the calculations three field blanks and three method blanks processed with the freshwater samples were also analyzed with hpyv and crassphage assays and eight field blanks and ten method blanks examined with the seawater and cwtp samples were tested with the genbac3 assay tables s1 and s2 all field blanks and method blanks were negative showing that no cross contamination occurred in field and laboratory processing steps moreover reproducibility of the laboratory protocols using the hpyv and crassphage assays showed acceptable coefficients of variation in all representative environmental water samples 1 28 19 45 table s4 2 6 qualitative performance measures owtp samples rather than cwtp samples were used to test the assays performances thereby ensuring no stormwater or nonhuman cross contamination five performance criteria were compared for each assay with true positive tp denoting the number of positive target samples true negative tn the number of negative nontarget samples false positive fp the number of positive nontarget samples and false negative fn the number of negative target samples sensitivity was determined by tp tp fn specificity by tn tn fp accuracy by tp tn tp fp tn fn positive predictive value by tp tp fp and negative predictive value by tn tn fn in addition this study selected the previously published crassphage marker gene results for the archived sewage and nonhuman fecal sample sets but the qualitative performance criteria were recalculated for comparison with the hpyv lachno3 and bacv6 21 markers kongprajug et al 2019b 2 7 statistical analyses statistical analyses were carried out using an r statistical program r core team 2019 a chi squared test of two proportions was used to compare significant differences between the assays performance measures significant differences in abundance were tested with one way analysis of variance anova using holm sidak s multiple comparisons datasets containing nondetects were analyzed via nonparametric survival analysis helsel 2012 the significance of differences for datasets containing nondetects was examined via the generalized wilcoxon test peto prentice test for multiple comparisons with holm s bias correction a paired sample comparison for data containing nondetects was also conducted with the paired prentice wilcoxon test correlation analysis was performed using kendall s tau on u score rank and water samples were grouped using principal component analysis and k means clustering the optimum number of clusters was determined by 30 indices using the nbclust package charrad et al 2014 3 results 3 1 qualitative performance measures for all assays all qpcr positive samples contained target genes concentrations that were greater than their corresponding aloq values the hpyv and crassphage viral markers were absolute host specific and sensitive both were detected in all sewage samples and absent in all animal fecal samples tables 1 and s5 the lachno3 and bacv6 21 bacterial markers exhibited comparable sensitivity and negative predictive value to the viral markers chi squared test of two proportions p 0 05 but they had significantly lower specificity accuracy and positive predictive value p 0 05 one negative sewage sample in the bacv6 21 assay presented 5 90 6 53 and 7 05 log10 copies 100 ml for hpyvs crassphage and lachno3 respectively the low specificity of the bacterial markers was found by cross detection in all nonhuman feces excluding duck and buffalo samples for the lachno3 and goat and sheep samples for the bacv6 21 high cross detection rates were observed for the lachno3 marker in swine 73 0 and cattle 36 4 and for the bacv6 21 marker in swine 52 6 which resulted in relatively low accuracy and positive predictive values one cattle one chicken and 14 swine fecal samples showed false positive results for both the lachno3 and bacv6 21 markers the tandem application of lachno3 and bacv6 21 could improve sewage specificity to 0 855 accuracy to 0 868 and positive predictive value to 0 529 3 2 marker abundance in human sewage and nonhuman fecal samples the abundance levels in owtp inf n 19 were highest for both bacterial markers lachno3 5 42 8 02 log10 copies 100 ml and bacv6 21 nondetect 8 05 log10 copies 100 ml fig 1 and table s6 hpyvs 3 66 6 53 log10 copies 100 ml showed significantly lower abundance than crassphage 5 28 7 38 log10 copies 100 ml and both were significantly lower than the bacterial markers paired prentice wilcoxon test p 0 001 the swine fecal samples showed cross detection with the lachno3 n 27 and bacv6 21 n 20 markers of up to 9 12 and 7 66 log10 copies g feces respectively the chicken fecal samples presented lachno3 n 1 and bacv6 21 n 4 markers of up to 8 21 and 8 07 log10 copies g feces respectively 3 3 hpyvs and crassphage in cwtp samples further investigation of the highly host associated hpyvs and crassphage revealed a 100 positive presence in all cwtp inf and cwtp eff samples from the two cwtps except for one cwtp2 eff hpyv sample fig 2 and table s7 no significant difference in hpyv abundance was observed between cwtp1 inf 4 38 6 03 log10 copies 100 ml and cwtp2 inf 5 69 6 02 log10 copies 100 ml and between cwtp1 eff 3 91 4 86 log10 copies 100 ml and cwtp2 eff nondetect nonnondetect5 09 log10 copies 100 ml p 0 05 the generalized wilcoxon test with holm s bias correction cwtp1 did not significantly remove hpyvs with log10 reduction values ranging from 0 25 1 26 on the other hand hpyv levels in cwtp2 eff were significantly lower than in cwtp2 inf p 0 05 the generalized wilcoxon test with holm s bias correction with a 0 86 to a 2 40 log10 reduction there were also no significant differences in hpyv levels for owtp inf and cwtp inf sewage samples p 0 05 one way anova with holm sidak s multiple comparisons as with hpyvs crassphage demonstrated similar abundance in both cwtp1 inf and cwtp2 inf 5 04 7 16 and 6 19 7 16 log10 copies 100 ml and in both cwtp1 eff and cwtp2 eff 4 64 5 81 and 3 96 5 96 log10 copies 100 ml cwtp1 could not reduce crassphage 0 01 0 96 log10 reduction while cwtp2 could significantly decrease its abundance 1 15 2 52 log10 reduction crassphage abundance also showed no significant differencent abundance levels between owtp inf and cwtp inf samples crassphage was found at significantly greater abundance levels than hpyvs in all samples except cwtp1 inf p 0 05 paired prentice wilcoxon test fig 2 the hpyvs and crasssphage in cwtps were moderately correlated showing a kendall s tau value of 0 483 p 0 05 fig 3 a 3 4 hpyvs and crassphage in environmental water samples hpyvs were present in most beach a 94 1 beach b 91 7 and freshwater c 92 6 samples while crassphage was positive at a lower rate beach a 41 2 beach b 66 7 freshwater c 88 9 fig 2 and table s7 hpyvs were found at similar abundance levels at beaches a and b ranging from nondetect 4 12 log10 copies 100 ml and from nondetect 4 33 log10 copies 100 ml respectively however hpyv abundance was significantly higher in freshwater c samples nondetect to 5 10 log10 copies 100 ml crassphage markers were significantly lower in beach a nondetect 2 68 log10 copies 100 ml than in beach b samples nondetect 3 51 log10 copies 100 ml p 0 05 the generalized wilcoxon test with holm s bias correction and both beaches showed a significantly lower abundance of crassphage than did freshwater c samples nondetect 5 21 log10 copies 100 ml hpyv levels were significantly higher than crassphage levels in beaches a and b but lower than crassphage in freshwater c p 0 05 paired prentice wilcoxon test fig 2 in 38 hpyv positive beach samples 22 were also crassphage positive while one hpyv negative sample was crassphage positive when using crassphage as a screening parameter a crassphage positive sample could provide 96 confidence of hpyv presence positive predictive value 0 96 however a crassphage negative sample could provide only 11 confidence of hpyv absence negative predictive value 0 11 in freshwater samples 23 of 25 hpyv positive samples were also crassphage positive while only one hpyv negative sample was crassphage positive therefore crassphage provided a positive predictive value of 0 96 and a negative predictive value of 0 33 for hpyvs two crassphage negative freshwater samples showed 2 75 and 3 45 log10 copies 100 ml for hpyvs while one hpyv negative sample contained 4 19 log10 copies 100 ml of crassphage a moderate correlation was also observed between the two markers kendall s tau 0 453 p 0 001 fig 3b when separately calculated a moderate correlation was observed for freshwater c kendall s tau 0 558 p 0 05 while no significant correlation was shown for the beach samples cluster analysis indicated two optimal clusters the first dimension constituted the highest variance 80 6 with an eigenvalue of 1 612 while the second dimension showed a 19 4 variance with an eigenvalue of 0 388 fig 4 the two clusters placed most freshwater samples designated as mps into the high contamination group while most of the seawater samples labeled a through g were placed in the low contamination group samples were clustered into the low contamination group when 1 hpyvs were 2 78 log10 copies 100 ml or 2 when hpyvs were 2 78 but crassphage was 2 60 log10 copies 100 ml the distributions of both clusters were illustrated in box plots with the high contamination group representing hpyvs from 2 79 5 10 log10 copies 100 ml median 3 82 log10 copies 100 ml and crassphage from 2 10 5 21 log10 copies 100 ml median 4 30 log10 copies 100 ml fig 5 the low contamination cluster contained samples with hpyv levels up to 4 12 log10 copies 100 ml median 2 54 log10 copies 100 ml and crassphage up to 4 19 log10 copies 100 ml median 2 05 log10 copies 100 ml 4 discussion 4 1 higher human specificity of the two viral markers than of the two bacterial markers the hpyv marker targeting both bk and jc viruses has shown 100 specificity for owtp inf with no cross detection in any of the nonhuman fecal samples in this study or in other geographical regions ahmed et al 2019a mcquaig et al 2009 staley et al 2012 exceptions have been found only in one of 30 bird fecal samples and one of ten pig wastewater samples in australia ahmed et al 2019a 2010 crassphage showed excellent specificity in this study however previous reports have indicated cross detection in one composite swine sample from earlier work in thailand kongprajug et al 2019b and in dog cat gull poultry and cattle samples from other geographical regions ahmed et al 2018b 2018a stachler et al 2017 overall the results indicate that using individual viral markers either hpyvs or crassphage or in combination offers the highest specificity and sensitivity for sewage pollution tracking a similar trend showing higher specificity among viral markers than among bacterial markers has also been observed in southeast queensland australia ahmed et al 2019a this could be explained by the co presence of certain gut bacterial genera in animals and humans feng et al 2020 lachno3 and bacv6 21 have demonstrated relatively low specificity however simultaneously applying both bacterial markers could improve their separate specificities to 0 80 bacv6 21 has shown high sensitivity and specificity for humans and could not be detected in nonhuman fecal samples cat cattle deer dog pig chicken and gull in the usa feng and mclellan 2019 however cross detection has been reported in cattle chicken pig buffalo and duck fecal samples in thailand at two to eight orders of magnitude g this study and in bird cow chicken dog emu and sheep fecal samples in australia at two to nine orders of magnitude g of feces ahmed et al 2019a these contradictory results emphasize geographical differences in mst marker genes performance such cross detection with nonhuman fecal samples have mainly limited the application of bacterial markers in areas especially where fecal pollution occurs from both human and nonhuman sources the low specificity of lachno3 is due to its high cross detection in cattle pigs sheep and goats lachno3 has also been detected in nonhuman fecal samples in australia including bird cat deer and horse at four to seven orders of magnitude g of feces ahmed et al 2019a originally lachno3 was designed from highly sewage associated dna regions as identified by metagenomics data and it demonstrated no cross reactivity in ten cattle and nine pig samples from the milwaukee area of the usa feng et al 2018 however cattle being raised in thailand with exposure to different diets and environmental stressors may affect the animals gut microbiomes mach et al 2020 shanks et al 2014 2011 this has been supported by another marker targeting the lachnospiraceae 16s v6 region which has shown diverse prevalence in cattle with different feeding diets and across different cattle types i e dairy and beef cattle feng et al 2018 newton et al 2011 other than the intrinsic presence of marker sequence in nontargeted samples low assay specificity could also be caused by nonspecific pcr amplification feng et al 2020 in a previous study the cross reactivity of lachno3 with animal feces was likely caused by nonspecific qpcr amplification as supported by an absence of lachno3 in the metagenomic analysis feng et al 2018 lachnospiraceae has been reported as adversely increased nonspecific pcr amplification by lowering the annealing temperature which could in turn increase pcr efficiency feng et al 2018 in this study the annealing temperature of the lachno3 qpcr cycling condition was adjusted from 64 c as originally designed to 60 c for the following reasons 1 the master mix reagent used in this study i e 2x itaq universal probes supermix biorad usa was recommended for use at 60 c according to the manufacturer s instructions and 2 higher pcr efficiency as shown by the steeper slope of the amplification plot was observed at 60 c compared to 64 c according to a preliminary test figure s1 the corresponding pcr efficiency for the lachno3 assay in this research was 94 3 which is similar to that in the original study 95 5 feng et al 2018 the variation in the optimal annealing temperature between this study and the original study may have been caused by the different qpcr reagents and apparatuses used bacich et al 2011 burgos et al 2002 nshimyimana et al 2017 siefring et al 2008 4 2 higher abundance of the two bacterial markers than of the two viral markers in owtp samples though they expressed inferior human source specificity both lachno3 and bacv6 21 demonstrated higher abundance in owtp inf than did the hpyvs and crassphage viral markers lachno3 has been detected in cwtp inf in the usa and australia at five and eight orders of magnitude 100 ml respectively ahmed et al 2019a feng et al 2018 these measures are similar to the range found in thailand the abundance of the bacv6 21 marker in cwtp inf has been found to be six to eight orders of magnitude 100 ml in the usa feng and mclellan 2019 and approximately eight orders of magnitude 100 ml in australia ahmed et al 2019a also in a similar range to owtp inf in thailand a higher abundance of bacterial markers than of viral markers was observed in cwtp inf and in human feces ahmed et al 2019a although faster decay rates of bacterial than of viral dna markers have been reported in both freshwater and seawater ahmed et al 2019b ballesté et al 2019 greaves et al 2020 the higher abundance of bacterial markers in sewage could be due to the higher excretion rates of gut bacteria than of enteric viruses or to the better adsorption of viruses to particulate matters potentially caused by the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions chahal et al 2016 horswell et al 2010 4 3 suitability of hpyv and crassphage as human associated mst markers 4 3 1 higher abundance and removal of crassphage than of hpyvs in cwtp samples hpyvs both bk and jc viruses have exhibited 100 sensitivity to untreated sewage as shown in this study and in other geographical locations rachmadi et al 2016 however less sensitivity to individual urine samples has been reported mcquaig et al 2009 hpyvs were present in owtp inf and cwtp inf in thailand expressed as copies 100 ml three to six orders at levels comparable to those detected in cwtp inf in australia five to six orders ahmed et al 2019a japan four orders hata et al 2013 and the usa four to six orders kitajima et al 2014 korajkic et al 2020 mcquaig et al 2009 schmitz et al 2016 staley et al 2012 tandukar et al 2020 wu et al 2020 no significant differences were observed between hpyvs from septic tanks and cwtp inf in the usa mcquaig et al 2009 crassphage cpq 056 in both owtp inf and cwtp inf in this study five to seven orders expressed as copies 100 ml was equally abundant as that found in cwtp inf from indiana usa wu et al 2020 but higher than that found in cwtp inf from elsewhere in the usa two to four orders stachler et al 2017 and slightly lower than that found in cwtp inf from australia eight orders ahmed et al 2018a 2018b and from two other studies in new orleans and across the usa up to nine orders korajkic et al 2020 tandukar et al 2020 crassphage cpq 056 was reported as up to six orders expressed as copies 100 ml in a secondary treated effluent in louisiana usa tandukar et al 2020 another crassphage marker detected with a crass up lp assay reported as four to six orders and expressed as copies 100 ml in cwtp eff samples from spain ballesté et al 2019 relatively similar ranges of both hpyvs and crassphage from different geographical regions underscore their usefulness as global sewage indicators neither wastewater treatment capacity nor wastewater volume received affected the concentrations of hpyvs and crassphage as previously stated crank et al 2020 however differences in reported quantity could result from intrinsic factors such as different gut microbial levels due to diets and lifestyles honap et al 2020 mah et al 2008 turnbaugh et al 2009 and extrinsic factors such as temperature ph total suspended solids sewer pipe condition and retention time ahmed et al 2019b booncharoen et al 2018 okadera et al 2020 comparisons among different studies could also present confounding biases due to different field and laboratory protocols analytical instruments and data analysis methods which could affect each virus at different levels agetsuma yanagihara et al 2017 crank et al 2020 kongprajug et al 2020 petcharat et al 2020 shanks et al 2012 this study presented hpyvs and crassphage removals through wastewater treatment processes through secondary sedimentation of 2 40 and 2 52 log10 removal respectively in an activated sludge treatment plant cwtp2 the oxidation ditch treatment plant cwtp1 removed neither viral marker different treatment processes could be one of the factors affecting removal efficiency as it has been previously reported that activated sludge treatment facilities more significantly reduce crassphage levels than do biofilter treatment plants farkas et al 2019 various maximum removal levels of hpyvs in treatment facilities at points prior to the disinfection process have been reported ranging from 1 33 log10 removal in indiana usa wu et al 2020 to 2 9 log10 removals in japan and louisiana usa hata et al 2013 tandukar et al 2020 crassphage has been removed at 2 48 log10 removal by a wastewater treatment facility in indiana usa wu et al 2020 as similarly observed in this study crassphage has been present in cwtp inf at higher concentrations than hpyvs crank et al 2020 farkas et al 2019 2018 tandukar et al 2020 and has been more significantly reduced than hpyvs through wastewater treatment plants in indiana and louisiana usa tandukar et al 2020 wu et al 2020 the difference in removal efficiency between the two markers could be caused by the varying behaviors of each virus as demonstrated by the effect concentration methods have on crassphage but not on hpyvs crank et al 2020 moderate to high correlations between the two markers have been observed in indiana usa pearson correlation coefficient of 0 87 wu et al 2020 louisiana usa pearson correlation coefficient of 0 89 and 0 91 in cwtp inf with jc and bk respectively tandukar et al 2020 the uk spearman correlation coefficient of 0 50 and 0 67 in cwtp inf and cwtp eff respectively farkas et al 2019 and italy spearman s rank correlation coefficients of 0 74 and 0 85 depending on two different concentration methods crank et al 2020 overall the present study promotes the suitability of crassphage as a sewage associated indicator due to its consistently high abundance 4 3 2 higher abundance in seawater and higher positive rate in freshwater of hpyvs than of crassphage a significantly higher abundance of crassphage than of hpyvs in freshwater at water temperatures of 28 4 35 4 c has been observed in this study conforming to other researches conducted also in freshwater in an impacted stream in pennsylvania usa crassphage cpq 056 assay and hpyvs were reported at four to six and one to four orders expressed as copies 100 ml respectively with no significant correlation observed stachler et al 2018 another study in the uk represented two to six orders of crassphage cpq 056 and up to three orders of hpyvs jc in freshwater with moderate correlation spearman correlation coefficient of 0 49 farkas et al 2019 2018 a river in nepal was monitored for crassphage cpq 056 at four to seven orders expressed as copies 100 ml and hpyvs jc and bk of up to six orders moderate correlation spearman s rank order correlation coefficient of 0 47 was found between crassphage and bk while no correlation was found between crassphage and jc tandukar et al 2018 ward et al 2020 however although hpyvs were lower in abundance than crassphage they exhibited a higher positive rate in freshwater samples and thus presented higher benefits for water quality monitoring indicating human pollution although crassphage had a significantly higher abundance than hpyvs in owtp and cwtp samples its opposite trend was observed in thailand s seawater at water temperatures of 27 8 31 9 c similar decay rates of both markers were observed in both freshwater and seawater microcosms at 18 28 c and when exposed to sunlight ahmed et al 2019b greaves et al 2020 however other physical chemical and biological factors could affect the fate and transport of each virus differently in this study no significant correlation was observed between hpyvs and crassphage in seawater implying the markers different behaviors further investigation is therefore needed to characterize factors affecting the different abundance levels in these sampling sites and to expand the investigation to other seawater and freshwater sites to develop a better understanding in summary this study suggests that both hpyvs and crassphage may be used to monitor seawater and freshwater identifying human fecal pollution in thailand 5 conclusions the two viral markers hpyvs and crassphage demonstrated ideal performance for sewage source tracking in thailand the two bacterial markers lachno3 and bacv6 21 presented high sensitivity but moderate specificity with cross detection in poultry chicken and duck and livestock swine cattle goat sheep and buffalo both bacterial markers were present in owtp inf at similar levels and were significantly higher than the two viral markers crassphage was significantly higher than hpyvs in owtp inf in the influents of cwtp2 and in the effluents of both cwtp1 and cwtp2 hpyvs showed higher positive rates than crassphage in freshwater and seawater but presented significantly higher levels only in seawater hpyvs and crassphage expressed moderate correlations in wastewater treatment kendall s tau 0 483 and environmental waters kendall s tau 0 453 and can be used to indicate high and low contamination clusters the results suggested that hpyvs and crassphage or in combination may act as human associated mst markers in contaminated aquatic environments this study also highlighted the necessity of validating mst markers in sewage and local environmental waters to effectively facilitate water

17268,this study investigated how a chloramine loss and nitrifying conditions influenced putative pathogenic bacterial diversity in bulk water and biofilm of a laboratory and a full scale chloraminated water distribution systems fifty four reference databases containing full length 16s rrna gene sequences obtained from the national centre for biotechnology information database were prepared to represent fifty four pathogenic bacterial species listed in the world health organisation and australian drinking water quality guidelines when 16s rrna gene sequences of all samples were screened against the fifty four reference pathogenic databases a total of thirty one putative pathogenic bacteria were detected in both laboratory and full scale systems where total chlorine residuals ranged between 0 03 2 2 mg l pathogenic bacterial species mycolicibacterium fortuitum and pseudomonas aeruginosa were noted in all laboratory i e in bulk water and biofilm and in bulk water of full scale samples and mycolicibacterium fortuitum dominated when chloramine residuals were high other different pathogenic bacterial species were observed dominant with decaying chloramine residuals this study for the first time reports the diverse abundance of putative pathogenic bacteria resilient towards chloramine and highlights that metagenomics surveillance of drinking water can serve as a rapid assessment and an early warning of outbreaks of a large number of putative pathogenic bacteria graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chloramine microbiological safety water supply water quality guidelines monitoring nitrification 1 introduction there is a large number of bacterial pathogens known to be transmitted via drinking water see nhmrc 2011 and word health organisation 2017 for a comprehensive list of bacterial pathogens transmitted via drinking water although drinking water quality guidelines are for both pathogens of faecal and environmental origin such as naegleria fowleri pseudomonas legionella spp and mycobacterium spp water utilities are largely focused only on pathogens of faecal origin and use some faecal pathogens as indicators of faecal contamination of drinking water sobsey 1989 in this 21st century management of drinking water pathogen outbreaks are a definitive challenge due to globalization intense mobility of humans and urbanization to successfully manage an outbreak an early recognition of emerging pathogens in drinking water is critical as a delay in the recognition of pathogens can have a serious negative impact on the economy due to travel and trade restrictions public health and public reaction includes anxiety panic and confusion with the latter often abetted by media coverage a pathogen outbreak on the other hand often remains undiagnosed for months and this time lag allows the spread of the pathogen undetected both in the community and throughout the distribution network therefore early warning and surveillance of pathogens in drinking water is critical to effectively manage new outbreaks current pathogen surveillance in drinking water is largely dependent on various culture based microbiology and biotechnology methods and these methods do not facilitate a detailed identification of pathogens present in drinking water u s department of agriculture 2012 culture independent approaches such as virulence gene assays multilocus sequence typing enzyme linked immunosorbent assays and quantitative polymerase chain reactions are also increasingly being used and they provide an accurate identification based on specific genes and loci present in pathogens to provide good pathogenic surveillance however it is important to screen all pathogenic bacteria known to be transmitted via drinking water and to this end the aforementioned culture independent methods are not suitable simply due to cost and analysis time required metagenomic sequencing on the other hand can overcome most limitations of culture independent methods and the ability to rapidly and cost effectively screen all putative pathogenic bacteria transmitted via drinking water is a major advantage hence this method has the potential to enable early warning and surveillance of pathogenic bacteria in drinking water frey et al 2014 despite the advantages pathogen surveillance using metagenomic sequencing has significant challenges some of these include the lack of comprehensive reference sequence databases for comparison challenges associated with sample preparation for sequencing the lack of sufficient depth and breadth of sequence coverage to detect pathogens to a very low level e g to a strain or a species level and the lack of a well defined standard of what constitutes identification of a pathogen in a sample i e how many organism specific reads are necessary to make a positive call the above challenges can and will be overcome with the advancement of metagenomic sequence technologies and 16s rrna gene based metagenomics in particular is gaining significant interest despite its failure to provide identification of virulence factors aw and rose 2012 frey et al 2014 as an early warning and surveillance of putative pathogenic bacteria because of its ability to facilitate an unbiased universal capture of pathogenic bacteria in samples sibley et al 2012 to safeguard consumers there are multiple barriers in place to prevent entry and transmission of pathogens in drinking water distribution systems white 2010 disinfection is a very important barrier and is usually the last barrier in municipal water treatment disinfectants are dosed to eliminate kill waterborne pathogens and disinfectant residuals are maintained throughout the distribution system to prevent the regrowth and occurrence of pathogens until the water reaches the taps of consumers chloramine is one of the widely used disinfectants around the world and is considered to be effective to prevent the occurrence of waterborne pathogens wolfe et al 1985 however chloramine decay due to auto decomposition vikesland et al 2001 interactions with chemicals and microbial constituents sathasivan et al 2005 abundant in the water distribution systems due to the initial microbial and chemical decay of chloramine free ammonia is released into the water and this triggers nitrification accelerating the decay of chloramine sathasivan et al 2008 based on how active the nitrifiers are i e for nitrite production and the decay rates of chloramine nitrification in a chloraminated distribution system occurs in two different stages mild and severe sathasivan et al 2008 during the stage of mild nitrification even with a bulk water nitrite concentration of 0 010 mg n l microbial chloramine decay 0 001 to 0 006 h 1 has been noted the severely nitrifying stage often coincides with a bulk water nitrite concentration of 0 10 mg n l and accelerated decay of chloramine total decay is about an order higher than that observed during the mildly nitrifying stage then becomes inevitable sathasivan et al 2008 with the onset of severe nitrification there is a decrease of ph wilczak et al 1996 an increased release of soluble microbial products bal krishna et al 2012 and an increase of bacterial diversity bal krishna et al 2013a in the distribution system thus with the decay of chloramine diverse environmental conditions arise sathasivan et al 2008 impacting the resident bacterial communities and their abundance in chloraminated distribution systems bal krishna et al 2013a gomez alvarez et al 2014 bal krishna et al 2018 for example bacterial classes solibacteres nitrospira sphingobacteria and betaproteobacteria dominate at low chloramine residuals i e after the onset of severe nitrification and actinobacteria and gammaproteobacteria dominate at higher chloramine residuals i e before and during the stage of mild nitrification bal krishna et al 2013a while the impact of chloramine decay on overall bacterial diversity is reported the impact on pathogenic bacteria is largely missing in the literature past studies however have examined the prevalence of a limited number of bacterial pathogens such as legionella mycobacteria pseudomonas amoebas in chloraminated water distribution systems waak et al 2019 wang et al 2012a household wang et al 2012b and hospital baron et al 2014 plumbing receiving chloraminated water when considering the large number of bacterial pathogens known to cause outbreaks nhmrc 2011 world health organisation 2017 it is then questionable whether a conclusive study of microbial safety of chloraminated water can be facilitated with the examination of only a limited number of bacterial pathogens hence a study that examines the influence of chloramine residuals and the nitrification stage on all pathogenic bacterial species identified critical for the safety of drinking water is paramount to better manage pathogenic outbreaks in chloraminated distribution systems to examine the influence of chloramine decay on the abundance of putative pathogenic bacteria this study characterised the bacterial communities in bulk water and in biofilm samples that experienced different environmental conditions i e a high to low chloramine residual and non nitrified to severely nitrified in a laboratory scale distribution system using 16s rrna gene based metagenomics to validate laboratory findings water samples having similar chloramine residuals were collected from a full scale water distribution system and abundance and diversity of putative pathogenic bacteria were quantified in these samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 the laboratory scale reactor system the laboratory scale system comprised five high density polyethylene hdpe tanks lr 1 to lr 5 of 20 l each connected in series using hdpe pipelines fig 1 a the reactor was operated in a controlled environment where bulk water temperatures remained between 18 23 c the hydraulic retention time hrt in each reactor was 1 day and hence the laboratory scale system had a total hrt of 5 days this laboratory scale system was operated similar to what is reported in bal krishna et al 2013a in brief raw water from mundaring western australia reservoir which is also the source water for the goldfields and agricultural water supply system detailed in section 2 2 was collected and used to prepare the feed water for the laboratory scale reactor system to maintain a stable disinfection residual in the system chlorine from a stock solution of 500 mg cl2 l sodium hypochlorite was first dosed to the collected water until a final concentration of approximately 1 0 1 5 mg l was achieved after 24 h chlorine was re adjusted to achieve 2 5 cl2 l and ammonia stock solution of 500 mg n l ammonium chloride was added to achieve a total ammonia concentration of 0 56 mg n l finally ph was adjusted to 8 0 0 1 this water feed water was then fed into the laboratory scale distribution system figure 1a prior to collecting bulk water and biofilm samples from each reactor the laboratory scale system was operated for more than 500 days to ensure bulkwater and biofim stability martiny et al 2003 the bulk water samples 1 5 l were passed through 0 22 μm filters to recover biomass the hdpe pipes length 15 cm and diameter 0 6 cm from each of the reactors the source of biofilms were placed in polyethylene terephthalate bottles containing 500 ml of sterile water to detach the biofilms from the pipes the bottles were placed in an ultrasonic water bath bransonic 220 usa ultrasonic treatment was carried out at a frequency of 30 khz and power 690 w for 10 min the initial water temperature in the bath was 20 c subsequently the detached biofilms were recovered following the same procedure that was used to recover biomass from the bulk water 2 2 the full scale distribution system a section of the goldfield and agricultural water supply system gawss located east of perth western australia was used to collect bulk water and biofilm samples fig 1b the main conduit of the gawss transfers water aboveground from mundaring weir to the goldfields of western australia over a distance of approximately 630 km the distribution pipeline is largely made up of a cement mortar lined ductile iron pipe water is primarily disinfected at the mundaring pump station and chlorine gas is directly dosed into the main pipe via a diffuser to achieve a total chlorine residual of 3 6 3 7 mg l bal krishna et al 2013b within a few seconds an ammonia solution 20 w v is dosed downstream directly into the pipe to facilitate the formation of chloramine 2 2 1 bulk water sample collection from the full scale distribution system hdpe tanks 20 l were used to collect bulk water samples from the gawss the hdpe tanks were cleaned using sodium hypochlorite 10 15 mg cl2 l and were also rinsed with the water to be collected five times prior to sample collection the samples were collected from five different locations and they were labelled fs 1 to fs 5 fig 1b bulk water chlorine residual temperature and ph were measured at the time of sample collection from each of the locations bulk water was also collected upon immediate filtration using 0 22 µm syringe filters into a sterile 50 ml falcon tube this sample was transported to the laboratory at 4 c to quantify nitrogenous species present in bulk water samples collected in the 20 l hdpe tanks were transported at ambient temperature 20 23 c and were used to extract dna within 24 h of collection prior to the extraction of dna the bacteria in the bulk water samples were concentrated as detailed in hill et al 2005 using hemoflow hf80s dialyzers containing ultrafiltration hollow fibers fresenius medical care lexington ma usa the concentrated bacterial biomass 30 80 ml samples were then used to extract dna as detailed below additional details of biomass concentration in bulk water can be found in supporting information s1 2 2 2 biofilm sample collection from the full scale distribution system five biofilm monitors bms kiwa netherlands also installed in a section of the gawss were used to collect biofilm samples fig 1b as detailed in vander kooij et al 1995 all bms were fitted with a vertical glass column length 60 cm internal diameter 19 5 0 05 mm where 40 glass rings were vertically stacked one on top of the other each glass ring was 14 9 0 4 mm in height 17 9 0 04 mm in external diameter and 14 2 0 4 mm in internal diameter and facilitated a large surface for biofilm adhesion each bm was connected to the main distribution pipeline with the aid of a teflon coated pressure reducing valve and a water flow rate of 50 l h hrt 13 s was maintained downwards through the glass column the system was covered to ensure darkness preventing the growth of phototrophic organisms on the glass rings the bms were operational for over 2 years before sampling during sampling two glass rings were removed from a bm and each was placed in a 50 ml falcon tube containing 10 ml of autoclaved dechlorinated tap water the tubes were then transported to the laboratory at 4 c the collected samples were labelled fs 6 to fs 10 the falcon tubes with samples were placed in an ultrasonic water bath bransonic 220 usa for 3 min the suspension was then decanted into a new tube and the glass rings were sonicated once more for 3 min in fresh autoclaved 10 ml dechlorinated tap water the corresponding suspensions of glass rings were pooled and the suspensions were filtered through 0 22 μm polycarbonate membrane filters to concentrate detached biomass the residue was then resuspended in 0 50 ml of autoclaved dechlorinated tap water an aliquot of each of the suspensions was used to extract dna at the time of biofilm sample collection bulk water samples were also collected and filtered through 0 22 µm syringe filters to facilitate analysis of nitrogen species at each of the sampling sites to prevent conclusions from being drawn by comparing microbial communities of bulk water with that found in biofilms developed in bms microbial analysis of bulk water was not carried out biofilms developed on bms do not directly compare with pipe wall biofilms that naturally occur in distribution systems ginige et al 2017 and this is largely due to differences in hydraulic conditions and biofilm attachment surfaces 2 3 bacterial community analysis using 454 pyrosequencing the dna of concentrated bulk water samples was extracted using a dneasy powerwater sterivex kit cat no id 14 600 50 nf qiagen usa and the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc usa was used to extract dna from biofilm samples the extracted dna was then stored at 20 c before shipment to mr dna molecular research lp texas usa for 454 pyrosequencing 454 pyrosequencing was performed using universal bacterial primers 27f 5 agrgtttgatcmtggctcag 3 and 530r 5 ccgcngcngctggcac 3 to capture hypervariable regions v1 v2 and v3 kumar et al 2011 as detailed in dowd et al 2008 specifics of the sequencing protocol followed is given in supporting information section s2 post sequence processing was carried out using the qiime quantitative insights into microbial ecology caporaso et al 2010 software package http www qiime org a detailed outline of the bioinformatic pipeline used is given in supporting information section s3 the chimera checked raw sequence data of all samples were deposited accession numbers prjna607678 in the database of the national centre for biotechnology information ncbi 2 4 16s rrna gene pathogen databases and identification of putative pathogenic bacteria fifty four pathogen listed in world health organisation and in australian drinking water quality guidelines nhmrc 2011 world health organisation 2017 reference databases each representing a pathogenic species was constructed by compiling full length 16s rrna gene sequences obtained from ncbi some 16s rrna gene sequences were extracted from genome sequences that were also downloaded from the same database after removing redundant sequences a total of 83 010 full length pathogen sequences were categorised based on phylogeny into their respective reference databases bal krishna et al 2020 these reference databases were then used to identify putative pathogenic bacteria in the samples for this the basic local alignment search tool blast was used to find regions of similarity between a sequence in a sample and sequences in reference databases specifically the qiime script exclude seqs by blast py was used to blast search sample sequences against the reference pathogen databases and hits were screened by e value 1exp 100 and the percentage 0 98 0 985 and 0 99 of the query that aligned with each sequence the matching hits were reported as a percent abundance of individual pathogens present in analysed samples further spearman s rank sum correlation coefficients were calculated using spss version 26 spss chicago to derive correlations between relative abundances of putative pathogens and total chlorine residuals using a significance cut off of α 0 05 2 5 chemical analysis chloramine residuals measured as total chlorine total ammonical nitrogen tan nitrite and nox nitrite nitrate were measured on the filtered 0 22 µm samples the aquakem 200 thermo scientific usa a high precision wet chemistry automated analyser was used to quantify tan nox and nitrite concentrations in samples the tan and nox analysis in this instrument was carried out in accordance to epa method 350 1 epa 1981a and nitrite analysis was performed in accordance to the apha sulphanilamide method 4500 no2 b apha et al 1998 total chlorine residuals were measured following the dpd colorimetric method using a hach pocket colorimeter this instrument had an experimental error of 0 03 mg l a portable ph metre hach 40d with a ph probe hach phc101 was used to measure ph and this had a measurement error of 0 1 additional details of the analytical methods can be found in bal krishna and sathasivan 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical parameters in the laboratory and full scale water distribution systems in the laboratory scale system the bulk water total chlorine residual in lr 1 was 2 18 0 25 mg l throughout the study with a flow of water into downstream lr 2 3 4 and 5 reactors a rapid decay of chloramine and a change of nitrogenous compounds tan nitrite and nitrate in bulk water was noted fig 2 a between lr 1 and 2 a total chlorine loss of 0 58 mg l was noted and this accompanied a marginal increase of nitrite 0 01 mg n l signifying a mildly nitrifying condition in r 2 sathasivan et al 2008 between lr 2 and 3 there is a tan drop of approximately 50 and this coincides with a 50 increase of nox fig 2a which shows the onset of nitrification in reactor lr 3 the presence of high nitrite levels 0 10 mg n l and low total chlorine residuals 0 5 mg l in lr 4 and 5 imply both reactors were severely nitrified sathasivan et al 2008 after the onset of severe nitrification there is a rapid drop of total chlorine residuals and this is largely a result of the increased bacterial diversity and metabolites in bulk water and in biofilms sathasivan and bal krishna 2012 a consistent decrease of ph from 8 0 0 1 to 7 6 0 1 was noted between lr 1 and 5 and this also confirms an increase of nitrifying bacterial activities wilczak et al 1996 full scale bulk water samples having chloramine residuals of range 0 05 2 20 mg l fig 2a similar to that of the laboratory scale system were also collected from different sampling locations of a full scale distribution system similar to the laboratory scale system the high bulk water total chlorine residual 2 2 mg l observed at fs 1 decreased down to 0 04 mg l with the passage of water down to location fs 3 this drop of total chlorine also coincided with a decrease of tan and an increase of nox concentrations fig 2a fs 3 is severely nitrified and is similar to lr 4 and 5 stable tan and nox concentrations fig 2a at locations fs 2 4 and 5 suggest these locations are comparable to lr 2 mildly nitrified considering that the above full scale samples were bulk water samples the water chemistry observed perhaps is a result of biofilm activities that prevailed upstream of sampling points the full scale biofilm monitoring locations successfully represented bulk water chemistry that prevailed between lr 3 and 5 of the laboratory scale system fig 2 location fs 6 onset of nitrification experienced the highest total chlorine residuals 0 91 mg l and a gradual decline of total chlorine was apparent between locations fs 7 and 10 severe nitrification there was a higher nox 0 89 mg n l and a minimal tan 0 02 mg l observed at these locations and the bacterial communities in these bms can be expected to resemble lr 4 and 5 bacterial communities in the laboratory scale system higher bulk water temperatures 27 31 c also have been observed at locations fs 7 and 10 of full scale and sarker et al 2013 have demonstrated the influence of higher temperatures on severe nitrification in chloraminated distribution systems specifically the optimum temperature for the growth of nitrifiers is between 25 and 30 c odell et al 1996 wolfe and lieu 2001 and hence a rapid growth of nitrifiers at such optimum bulk water temperatures induce severe nitrification conditions the bulk water total chlorine and nitrogenous species that appear to vary between the two lots of samples bulk water and biofilm are likely a result of sampling locations in the full scale distribution system fig 1b accelerated decay of chloramine by biofilms abundant in bms adhikari et al 2012 sathasivan et al 2010 may also have contributed towards the low chloramine residuals observed in bulk water samples obtained from bm devices fig 2 3 2 bacterial species and richness in the laboratory and full scale distribution systems the bacterial species richness estimators observed species and chao1 index were used to examine the influence of chloramine residuals on overall bacterial diversity of both laboratory and full scale systems the estimator observed species is a count of different otus that were present in each of the samples schloss and handelsman 2005 the chao1 index on the other hand estimates diversity based on abundance data includes the abundance of rare otus chao 1984 an increasing trend of either estimate signifies an increase of bacteria species richness accordingly the laboratory scale bulk water and biofilm samples show a clear increase of bacterial species richness with a decrease in bulk water chloramine residuals fig 2b bal krishna et al 2013a using flow cytometry also demonstrated an increase of bacterial cell numbers in bulk water and in biofilm with a decrease of chloramine residuals in a laboratory scale chloraminated distribution system when bulk water chloramine residuals are high only a handful of bacteria that can resist the disinfectant dominates the system and this is reflected with low observed species and chao1 index estimates with the decay of chloramine more bacterial species can resist chloramine and as a consequence an increase of bacterial species richness fig 2b can be observed e g the dominance of nitrifiers after the onset of nitrification as previously mentioned the full scale bulk water samples and the water chemistry observed in these samples perhaps are a result of biological activities upstream of the sampling locations hence correlating bacterial species richness with the water chemistry of these samples may not be appropriate the full scale biofilms on the other hand is a direct result of the bulk water chemistry at the bm locations hence it is valid to examine a correlation between bulk water chloramine residuals and bacterial species richness estimators for the full scale biofilm samples the chloramine residuals observed at the full scale bms are comparable to laboratory scale reactor lr 3 to 5 and according to fig 2b in these three reactors of the laboratory scale the bacterial species richness estimators did not significantly change with a decreasing concentration of bulk water chloramine the bacterial species richness in full scale biofilm samples also did not show a clear increase with a decrease of chloramine concentration this suggests that the resident bacteria in this distribution system perhaps already are capable of resisting the chloramine concentrations observed at these locations and hence the species richness is already saturated as can be observed with laboratory scale reactor locations lr 3 to 5 the study of gomez alvarez et al 2014 corroborates the above conclusion derived the variations of chao1 and observed species measurements between the two systems on the other hand could be a result of many factors including hydraulic operational conditions fish et al 2017 the age of biofilm and even the difference of pipe material used to facilitate the growth of biofilms ginige et al 2017 although it is not meaningful to compare water chemistry and species richness of full scale bulk water samples this study continued to make this comparison with a higher degree of confidence since the chloramine residuals at the monitored locations fs 1 2 4 and 5 were largely comparable to laboratory scale reactor locations lr 1 to 3 since the full scale bacterial species richness observed at locations fs 1 to 5 were perhaps a result of upstream water chemistry it is then reasonable to assume that the species richness observed were a result of a much higher bulk water chloramine residual than what was noted at the above sampling locations in the laboratory scale reactors lr 1 to 3 there is a gradual decrease of chloramine concentrations and this coincides with a gradual increase of bacterial species richness similarly the full scale locations fs 1 2 4 5 and 3 also demonstrate an increase of species richness with a decrease of chloramine residuals 3 3 bacterial community compositions when bacterial abundance was examined in both laboratory and full scale bulk water and biofilm samples an increase in abundance of different bacteria genera was observed with an increase in species richness in the laboratory scale system bacterial genera mycobacterium 22 59 and pseudomonas 1 4 23 8 dominated in the bulk water lr 1 lr 2 and lr 3 and in biofilm lr 1 lr 2 and lr 3 samples and the chloramine residuals in these samples were high and ranged between 0 7 2 18 mg l the genus mycobacterium has been frequently observed in both chlorinated and chloraminated drinking water distribution systems gomez alvarez et al 2012 and their resistance towards the disinfectants taylor et al 2000 are well known at low chloramine residuals i e at reactors lr 3 lr 4 and lr 5 and or after the onset of nitrification unclassified hyphomicrobianceae 2 0 6 3 unclassified betaproteobacteria 3 2 17 7 unclassified rhizobiales 1 0 21 2 sphingomonas 8 1 27 0 and nitrosomonas 1 3 2 8 were noted dominating in the laboratory scale system fig 3 sphingomonas are metabolically versatile and have higher affinities towards low nutrient concentrations liu et al 2013 and their high dominance in biofilm samples lr 3 lr 4 and lr 5 are likely due to an irreversible attachment of cells on to wall surfaces using excreted exopolysaccharides vuoriranta et al 2003 even though full scale bulk water samples fs 1 to 5 showed chloramine residuals that were comparable to lr 1 to 3 locations of the laboratory scale system the microbial abundance diversity between these three locations of the laboratory and the five locations of the full scale system varied significantly fig 3 the bacterial genera prochlorococcus 19 8 33 1 dominated the full scale system while mycobacterium 22 59 dominated the laboratory scale system at these high bulk water chloramine residuals to complement the low mycobacterium 1 5 29 5 abundance a higher abundance of other bacterial genera such as candidatus aquiluna 5 1 7 3 and ack m1 0 07 7 95 insignificant in the laboratory scale system were noted in the full scale bulk water samples as previously discussed the bacterial diversity and abundance noted in bulk water samples of fs 1 to 5 of the full scale system is not a result of the bulk water chemistry observed at these locations and it is a result of bulk water chemistry that is prevalent up stream the chloramine residuals at the above five locations are high and ranged between 0 05 2 2 mg l the chloramine residuals upstream of the above five locations should then be a magnitude higher and it is this water chemistry that likely influenced the bacterial diversity and abundance in the bulk water samples analysed accordingly it is not surprising to observe other dominant bacterial genera in these full scale bulk water samples the study further demonstrates disinfectant tolerance possibly as a stress response herath and sathasivan 2020 with bacterial genera such as prochlorococcus showing a much higher tolerance when compared with mycobacterium even though the full scale biofilm sampling locations showed some similarities to lr 3 to 5 of laboratory scale reactors in terms of chloramine residuals the bulk water chemistry continued to differ specifically with full scale biofilm monitoring locations showing higher nox concentrations fig 2 in addition to the chloramine residual the bulk water chemistry also influences the bacterial diversity and abundance associated with pipe wall biofilms and this was apparent when comparing laboratory scale lr 3 to 5 biofilm samples with full scale fs 6 to 10 biofilms samples specifically higher relative abundances of nitrifying bacterial genera nitrosomonas 13 9 and nitrospira 44 4 were observed at fs 6 and their abundance at lr 3 fig 3 were comparatively lower despite both locations showing similar total chlorine residuals fig 2a there however was a notable difference of bulk water temperature observed at lr 3 21 c and at fs 6 27 c fig 2a the optimum temperature for the growth of nitrifiers are reported to be between 25 and 30 c odell et al 1996 wolfe and lieu 2001 and the low bulk water temperature at lr 3 could have been contributory towards the difference of nitrifier abundance observed between lr 3 and fs 6 additionally the difference of biofilm growth media in lr 3 and fs 6 may also have influenced nitrifier abundance at these two locations and future studies should examine the influence of biofilm media on nitrifier abundance in chloraminated distribution systems sinibacteraceae 10 6 opitutaceae 36 7 nitrospira 2 0 52 6 and unclassified planctomycetes 2 2 9 0 were dominated at locations fs 7 to 10 where chloramine residuals were low 0 03 0 2 mg l and bulk water nox concentrations were high while chloramine residual and the bulk water chemistry could significantly influence bacterial diversity and abundance there are other factors such as the difference in the disinfection dosing strategy berry et al 2006 the bulk water nutrients and elements concentrations and types liu et al 2013 the pipe materials ginige et al 2017 and the hydraulic conditions lehtola et al 2006 which also influence overall bacterial diversity in both bulk water and in biofilms of full scale distribution systems 3 4 identification of putative pathogenic bacteria in chloraminated water distribution systems a bioinformatics pipeline such as qiime in general facilitates demultiplexing and quality filtering otu picking taxonomic assignment phylogenetic reconstruction and diversity analyses of raw dna sequence data caporaso et al 2010 for phylogenetic reconstruction and nucleic acid based detection and quantification of microbial diversity a reference database is vital and rrna databases such as silva are currently used worldwide quast et al 2013 while the above analysis is capable of revealing the abundance of bacterial genera such as mycobacterium pseudomonas legionella which contain pathogenic species due to the generic nature of the silva database obtaining a quantitative estimation of only the pathogenic species of the above bacterial genera becomes tedious if not impossible on the other hand if the silva database only contained the reference sequences of the pathogenic bacteria a quantitative estimation of the pathogenic bacterial species then becomes feasible and a similar approach has been examined to quantify pathogens in clinical samples miao et al 2017 the short 300 base pair lengths of the raw dna sequences will however continue to pose a challenge to identify the pathogenic bacterial species with absolute certainty in this study the grouping of sequences into otus quantification of relative abundances and sequence classification were carried out against a full length silva 16s rrna gene database at 97 sequence similarity the relative abundance of each of the putative pathogens in contrast was determined against full length sequence databases of individual pathogens at a much higher sequence 97 similarity as opposed to the genus level relative abundance that was reported with the silva database a species level relative abundance was reported with pathogens and hence a sequence similarity that was higher than 97 was selected to obtain an accurate estimation of relative abundance for putative pathogens to understand which percent sequence similarity is best to apply to obtain an accurate relative abundance for putative pathogens a range of percent sequence similarities 97 were applied to quantify the relative abundance of putative pathogens these relative abundances of putative pathogens were then compared against genus level relative abundances derived using the silva database and fig 4 provides a comparison of two putative pathogens in fig 4a the genus level relative abundance of mycobacterium showed a greater similarity to that of a combined relative abundance of eight mycobacterium spp this suggests that it was these eight pathogenic mycobacterium spp that were predominantly prevalent in the samples analysed in contrast the genus level relative abundance of pseudomonas far exceeded the relative abundance of the pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa in some samples fig 4b considering the large prevalence of non pathogenic pseudomonas spp in the environment this result is not surprising to a large extent the relative abundance of both pathogens quantified at 98 and 98 5 sequence similarities correlated well with the trend of relative abundance observed at the genus level at 99 sequence similarities however the pathogen relative abundance significantly deviated from the genus level relative abundance this deviation was thought to be primarily a result of the short length sequence approximate 300 base pair of the samples hence the relative abundance of all putative pathogenic bacteria in this study was estimated at a 98 sequence similarity as can be seen in fig 4b on occasions the genus level relative abundance appears lower than the estimated relative abundance of putative pathogens this was specifically noted when genus level relative abundance was low i e 1 this is likely a result of the differences between the two different algorithms that were used to determine the genus and the pathogen relative abundances the blast algorithm was exclusively used to estimate the relative abundance of putative pathogens while the usearch algorithm was used to cluster and quantify genus level relative abundance considering the wider application of the ncbi blast algorithm specifically to match sequences to species level identification of bacteria the relative abundance of putative pathogens derived using blast was considered accurate and was used for the comparative assessment of putative pathogens in all sampling locations of this study 3 5 a relative abundance of putative pathogenic bacteria in chloraminated water distribution systems a total of fifty four reference databases containing full length pathogenic 16s rrna gene bacterial sequences were developed and used to detect and quantify pathogenic bacteria i e fifty four pathogens listed in both the world health organisation 2017 and in australian drinking water quality guidelines nhmrc 2011 although all samples were screened for fifty four pathogens when chloramine residuals were in the range of 0 03 2 2 mg l only thirty one pathogenic bacterial species were detected in both bulk water and in biofilm samples of laboratory and full scale systems fig 5 similar to how chloramine residuals were observed impacting the overall bacterial community composition different pathogenic bacterial species were observed dominant with decaying chloramine residuals however species such as mycolicibacterium fortuitum and pseudomonas aeruginosa were noted in all laboratory i e in both bulk water and in biofilm and in bulk water of full scale samples fig 5 when a spearman s rank sum correlation coefficient was carried out between total chlorine residuals and relative abundances of mycolicibacterium fortuitum ρ 0 643 p 0 002 and pseudomonas aeruginosa ρ 0 608 p 0 004 significant positive correlations were noted suggesting that both organisms are resistant towards higher chloramine residuals mycobacterium avium mycobacterium gordonae and mycolicibacterium fortuitum previously reported as mycobacterium fortuitum were dominant in the laboratory scale system when chloramine residuals were high and the relative abundance of mycolicibacterium fortuitum was noted highest mycobacterium avium and mycolicibacterium fortuitum are well known for their tolerance towards disinfectants loret and dumoutier 2019 and this explains their dominance in samples that contained high chloramine residuals for example the ct concentration x time values for a 3 log reduction of mycobacterium avium at ph 7 and at 25 c range between 51 and 204 mg min l for chlorine 91 1710 mg min l for chloramine 2 11 mg min l for chlorine dioxide and 0 10 0 17 mg min l for ozone falkinham et al 2001 the ct value for a 2 log reduction of mycolicibacterium fortuitum on the other hand was 13 mg min l with ozone farooq et al 1977 other mycobacterium species mycobacterium intracellulare mycobacterium marinum mycobacterium scrofulaceum mycobacterium xenopi and mycobacteroides chelonae were also noted specifically in association with biofilm samples fig 5 the hydrophobic properties of the mycobacterium cell wall and their ability to form aggregates in water may have made them resistant to the disinfectants used for water treatment falkinham 2018 similar to mycobacterium spp pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed in all of the laboratory and bulk water samples of the full scale system fig 5 pseudomonas aeruginosa is also well known to resist disinfectant chlorine and chloramine residuals applied in water distribution systems ridgway and olson 1982 shrivastava et al 2004 additionally it exhibits diverse properties when exposed to different environmental and nutrient conditions da silva et al 2008 legionella is another pathogenic species often reported occurring in cooling tower waters lu et al 2017 and some occurrence also has been reported in drinking water distribution systems wang et al 2012 chloramine is known for its effectiveness to suppress the growth of legionella wang et al 2012 and legionella was not observed dominant both in the laboratory and in the full scale systems fig 5 compared to the full scale system an overall higher relative putative pathogen abundance was noted in the laboratory scale system fig 5 the majority of putative pathogenic species specifically bacterial genera tsukamurella mycobacterium and klebsiella were noted abundant in the biofilms of the laboratory scale system and they were largely missing both in bulk water and biofilms of the full scale distribution system further even when total chlorine and level of nitrification appeared similar e g locations lr 3 and fs 6 of laboratory and full scale distribution systems respectively the relative abundances of putative pathogens especially mycobacterium spp were noted different it has to be noted that operational conditions such as hrt water flow rate manuel et al 2009 physicochemical parameters such as temperature sisti et al 1998 chloramine residuals pipe materials wang et al 2012b etc which are known to influence the growth and diversity of bacteria in distribution systems were not maintained identical in the laboratory and full scale systems in this study the above operational variations are likely to have had some influence on the difference of putative pathogen relative abundance observed in the laboratory and full scale distribution systems furthermore the relative abundances reported in this manuscript should be considered with caution and should not be considered reflecting the absolute abundance of putative pathogens for example when total absolute bacterial abundance is very low even when absolute putative pathogen abundance is insignificant a higher relative abundance of the putative pathogen may be reported similarly when total absolute bacterial abundance is high a high absolute putative pathogen abundance may also be reported as an insignificant relative abundance reporting abundance as a relative abundance accordingly may also have contributed towards the observed differences of putative pathogenic abundance noted between the laboratory and full scale systems in this study in addition to the pathogenic bacterial species discussed above this study for the very first time reveals the diverse abundance of many putative pathogenic bacteria resilient towards chloramine of fifty four pathogenic bacterial species the detection of only thirty one species implies that the undetected twenty three species may have either not been prevalent in source waters or are sensitive towards chloramine water utilities do not routinely monitor all of the thirty one pathogenic species identified in this study in chloraminated distribution systems often it is the index and model organisms i e a group or species of bacteria that are indicative of pathogen presence e g e coli as an index for salmonella and faecal indicators organisms that indicates a possible occurrence of faecal contamination e g thermotolerant coliforms or e coli edberg et al 2000 which are routinely examined and it is unclear whether faecal indicators or index model organisms monitored account for all of the thirty one pathogenic species identified in this study a future study should focus on ascertaining the effectiveness of current water quality monitoring methods applied to chloraminated distribution systems to accurately inform the occurrence of pathogenic bacteria revealed in this study further the metagenomic surveillance tools developed in this study should be expanded to detect other waterborne pathogens such as protozoa viruses and helminths enabling the identification of disease outbreaks before their discovery by clinical surveillance future effort should also focus on 1 increasing the accuracy of the metagenomic analysis perhaps by replacing the blast algorithm with a phylogenetic placement algorithm czech et al 2019 and 2 examining mechanisms underlying the pathogen inhibitory destruction effects of chloramine as a note of caution it must be stressed that our short 454 pyrosequence data and current metagenomic surveillance tools in general do not allow accurate identification of pathogens to the strains or the species level our metagenomic data also do not provide information on the viability of the identified pathogens and this makes it difficult to quantitatively assess any public health significance of this work irrespective of these limitations metagenomic surveillance of drinking water can serve as a rapid assessment and an early warning of outbreaks for a large number of putative pathogenic bacteria to confirm a pathogenic outbreak however the presumptive positive metagenomic results need verification using conventional identification methods culture depended and or independent overall the study is of significance since it brings to attention the necessity to further expand our current water quality monitoring methods to screen a wider group of pathogenic bacteria including the thirty one putative pathogenic species identified in this study 4 conclusions this study investigated the relative putative pathogenic bacterial abundance in bulk water and in biofilm with decaying chloramine residuals and changing nitrifying conditions in a laboratory and in a full scale water distribution system the following conclusions were made from this study fifty four reference databases containing full length 16s rrna gene sequences of fifty four pathogenic bacteria species listed in the world health organisation and in australian drinking water quality guidelines were developed and used to examine the relative abundance of putative pathogenic bacteria present in chloraminated water distribution systems different putative pathogenic bacteria were observed dominant with decaying chloramine residuals out of the fifty four pathogenic bacterial species a total of thirty one putative pathogens were detected in both the laboratory and full scale chloraminated water distribution systems where chloramine residuals ranged between 0 03 and 2 2 mg l the bacterial species mycolicibacterium fortuitum and pseudomonas aeruginosa were noted in all laboratory both bulk water and in biofilm and full scale bulk water samples and mycolicibacterium fortuitum dominated under high chloramine residuals this study highlights the importance of developing new indicator organisms which would enable screening of pathogenic bacteria

17268,this study investigated how a chloramine loss and nitrifying conditions influenced putative pathogenic bacterial diversity in bulk water and biofilm of a laboratory and a full scale chloraminated water distribution systems fifty four reference databases containing full length 16s rrna gene sequences obtained from the national centre for biotechnology information database were prepared to represent fifty four pathogenic bacterial species listed in the world health organisation and australian drinking water quality guidelines when 16s rrna gene sequences of all samples were screened against the fifty four reference pathogenic databases a total of thirty one putative pathogenic bacteria were detected in both laboratory and full scale systems where total chlorine residuals ranged between 0 03 2 2 mg l pathogenic bacterial species mycolicibacterium fortuitum and pseudomonas aeruginosa were noted in all laboratory i e in bulk water and biofilm and in bulk water of full scale samples and mycolicibacterium fortuitum dominated when chloramine residuals were high other different pathogenic bacterial species were observed dominant with decaying chloramine residuals this study for the first time reports the diverse abundance of putative pathogenic bacteria resilient towards chloramine and highlights that metagenomics surveillance of drinking water can serve as a rapid assessment and an early warning of outbreaks of a large number of putative pathogenic bacteria graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chloramine microbiological safety water supply water quality guidelines monitoring nitrification 1 introduction there is a large number of bacterial pathogens known to be transmitted via drinking water see nhmrc 2011 and word health organisation 2017 for a comprehensive list of bacterial pathogens transmitted via drinking water although drinking water quality guidelines are for both pathogens of faecal and environmental origin such as naegleria fowleri pseudomonas legionella spp and mycobacterium spp water utilities are largely focused only on pathogens of faecal origin and use some faecal pathogens as indicators of faecal contamination of drinking water sobsey 1989 in this 21st century management of drinking water pathogen outbreaks are a definitive challenge due to globalization intense mobility of humans and urbanization to successfully manage an outbreak an early recognition of emerging pathogens in drinking water is critical as a delay in the recognition of pathogens can have a serious negative impact on the economy due to travel and trade restrictions public health and public reaction includes anxiety panic and confusion with the latter often abetted by media coverage a pathogen outbreak on the other hand often remains undiagnosed for months and this time lag allows the spread of the pathogen undetected both in the community and throughout the distribution network therefore early warning and surveillance of pathogens in drinking water is critical to effectively manage new outbreaks current pathogen surveillance in drinking water is largely dependent on various culture based microbiology and biotechnology methods and these methods do not facilitate a detailed identification of pathogens present in drinking water u s department of agriculture 2012 culture independent approaches such as virulence gene assays multilocus sequence typing enzyme linked immunosorbent assays and quantitative polymerase chain reactions are also increasingly being used and they provide an accurate identification based on specific genes and loci present in pathogens to provide good pathogenic surveillance however it is important to screen all pathogenic bacteria known to be transmitted via drinking water and to this end the aforementioned culture independent methods are not suitable simply due to cost and analysis time required metagenomic sequencing on the other hand can overcome most limitations of culture independent methods and the ability to rapidly and cost effectively screen all putative pathogenic bacteria transmitted via drinking water is a major advantage hence this method has the potential to enable early warning and surveillance of pathogenic bacteria in drinking water frey et al 2014 despite the advantages pathogen surveillance using metagenomic sequencing has significant challenges some of these include the lack of comprehensive reference sequence databases for comparison challenges associated with sample preparation for sequencing the lack of sufficient depth and breadth of sequence coverage to detect pathogens to a very low level e g to a strain or a species level and the lack of a well defined standard of what constitutes identification of a pathogen in a sample i e how many organism specific reads are necessary to make a positive call the above challenges can and will be overcome with the advancement of metagenomic sequence technologies and 16s rrna gene based metagenomics in particular is gaining significant interest despite its failure to provide identification of virulence factors aw and rose 2012 frey et al 2014 as an early warning and surveillance of putative pathogenic bacteria because of its ability to facilitate an unbiased universal capture of pathogenic bacteria in samples sibley et al 2012 to safeguard consumers there are multiple barriers in place to prevent entry and transmission of pathogens in drinking water distribution systems white 2010 disinfection is a very important barrier and is usually the last barrier in municipal water treatment disinfectants are dosed to eliminate kill waterborne pathogens and disinfectant residuals are maintained throughout the distribution system to prevent the regrowth and occurrence of pathogens until the water reaches the taps of consumers chloramine is one of the widely used disinfectants around the world and is considered to be effective to prevent the occurrence of waterborne pathogens wolfe et al 1985 however chloramine decay due to auto decomposition vikesland et al 2001 interactions with chemicals and microbial constituents sathasivan et al 2005 abundant in the water distribution systems due to the initial microbial and chemical decay of chloramine free ammonia is released into the water and this triggers nitrification accelerating the decay of chloramine sathasivan et al 2008 based on how active the nitrifiers are i e for nitrite production and the decay rates of chloramine nitrification in a chloraminated distribution system occurs in two different stages mild and severe sathasivan et al 2008 during the stage of mild nitrification even with a bulk water nitrite concentration of 0 010 mg n l microbial chloramine decay 0 001 to 0 006 h 1 has been noted the severely nitrifying stage often coincides with a bulk water nitrite concentration of 0 10 mg n l and accelerated decay of chloramine total decay is about an order higher than that observed during the mildly nitrifying stage then becomes inevitable sathasivan et al 2008 with the onset of severe nitrification there is a decrease of ph wilczak et al 1996 an increased release of soluble microbial products bal krishna et al 2012 and an increase of bacterial diversity bal krishna et al 2013a in the distribution system thus with the decay of chloramine diverse environmental conditions arise sathasivan et al 2008 impacting the resident bacterial communities and their abundance in chloraminated distribution systems bal krishna et al 2013a gomez alvarez et al 2014 bal krishna et al 2018 for example bacterial classes solibacteres nitrospira sphingobacteria and betaproteobacteria dominate at low chloramine residuals i e after the onset of severe nitrification and actinobacteria and gammaproteobacteria dominate at higher chloramine residuals i e before and during the stage of mild nitrification bal krishna et al 2013a while the impact of chloramine decay on overall bacterial diversity is reported the impact on pathogenic bacteria is largely missing in the literature past studies however have examined the prevalence of a limited number of bacterial pathogens such as legionella mycobacteria pseudomonas amoebas in chloraminated water distribution systems waak et al 2019 wang et al 2012a household wang et al 2012b and hospital baron et al 2014 plumbing receiving chloraminated water when considering the large number of bacterial pathogens known to cause outbreaks nhmrc 2011 world health organisation 2017 it is then questionable whether a conclusive study of microbial safety of chloraminated water can be facilitated with the examination of only a limited number of bacterial pathogens hence a study that examines the influence of chloramine residuals and the nitrification stage on all pathogenic bacterial species identified critical for the safety of drinking water is paramount to better manage pathogenic outbreaks in chloraminated distribution systems to examine the influence of chloramine decay on the abundance of putative pathogenic bacteria this study characterised the bacterial communities in bulk water and in biofilm samples that experienced different environmental conditions i e a high to low chloramine residual and non nitrified to severely nitrified in a laboratory scale distribution system using 16s rrna gene based metagenomics to validate laboratory findings water samples having similar chloramine residuals were collected from a full scale water distribution system and abundance and diversity of putative pathogenic bacteria were quantified in these samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 the laboratory scale reactor system the laboratory scale system comprised five high density polyethylene hdpe tanks lr 1 to lr 5 of 20 l each connected in series using hdpe pipelines fig 1 a the reactor was operated in a controlled environment where bulk water temperatures remained between 18 23 c the hydraulic retention time hrt in each reactor was 1 day and hence the laboratory scale system had a total hrt of 5 days this laboratory scale system was operated similar to what is reported in bal krishna et al 2013a in brief raw water from mundaring western australia reservoir which is also the source water for the goldfields and agricultural water supply system detailed in section 2 2 was collected and used to prepare the feed water for the laboratory scale reactor system to maintain a stable disinfection residual in the system chlorine from a stock solution of 500 mg cl2 l sodium hypochlorite was first dosed to the collected water until a final concentration of approximately 1 0 1 5 mg l was achieved after 24 h chlorine was re adjusted to achieve 2 5 cl2 l and ammonia stock solution of 500 mg n l ammonium chloride was added to achieve a total ammonia concentration of 0 56 mg n l finally ph was adjusted to 8 0 0 1 this water feed water was then fed into the laboratory scale distribution system figure 1a prior to collecting bulk water and biofilm samples from each reactor the laboratory scale system was operated for more than 500 days to ensure bulkwater and biofim stability martiny et al 2003 the bulk water samples 1 5 l were passed through 0 22 μm filters to recover biomass the hdpe pipes length 15 cm and diameter 0 6 cm from each of the reactors the source of biofilms were placed in polyethylene terephthalate bottles containing 500 ml of sterile water to detach the biofilms from the pipes the bottles were placed in an ultrasonic water bath bransonic 220 usa ultrasonic treatment was carried out at a frequency of 30 khz and power 690 w for 10 min the initial water temperature in the bath was 20 c subsequently the detached biofilms were recovered following the same procedure that was used to recover biomass from the bulk water 2 2 the full scale distribution system a section of the goldfield and agricultural water supply system gawss located east of perth western australia was used to collect bulk water and biofilm samples fig 1b the main conduit of the gawss transfers water aboveground from mundaring weir to the goldfields of western australia over a distance of approximately 630 km the distribution pipeline is largely made up of a cement mortar lined ductile iron pipe water is primarily disinfected at the mundaring pump station and chlorine gas is directly dosed into the main pipe via a diffuser to achieve a total chlorine residual of 3 6 3 7 mg l bal krishna et al 2013b within a few seconds an ammonia solution 20 w v is dosed downstream directly into the pipe to facilitate the formation of chloramine 2 2 1 bulk water sample collection from the full scale distribution system hdpe tanks 20 l were used to collect bulk water samples from the gawss the hdpe tanks were cleaned using sodium hypochlorite 10 15 mg cl2 l and were also rinsed with the water to be collected five times prior to sample collection the samples were collected from five different locations and they were labelled fs 1 to fs 5 fig 1b bulk water chlorine residual temperature and ph were measured at the time of sample collection from each of the locations bulk water was also collected upon immediate filtration using 0 22 µm syringe filters into a sterile 50 ml falcon tube this sample was transported to the laboratory at 4 c to quantify nitrogenous species present in bulk water samples collected in the 20 l hdpe tanks were transported at ambient temperature 20 23 c and were used to extract dna within 24 h of collection prior to the extraction of dna the bacteria in the bulk water samples were concentrated as detailed in hill et al 2005 using hemoflow hf80s dialyzers containing ultrafiltration hollow fibers fresenius medical care lexington ma usa the concentrated bacterial biomass 30 80 ml samples were then used to extract dna as detailed below additional details of biomass concentration in bulk water can be found in supporting information s1 2 2 2 biofilm sample collection from the full scale distribution system five biofilm monitors bms kiwa netherlands also installed in a section of the gawss were used to collect biofilm samples fig 1b as detailed in vander kooij et al 1995 all bms were fitted with a vertical glass column length 60 cm internal diameter 19 5 0 05 mm where 40 glass rings were vertically stacked one on top of the other each glass ring was 14 9 0 4 mm in height 17 9 0 04 mm in external diameter and 14 2 0 4 mm in internal diameter and facilitated a large surface for biofilm adhesion each bm was connected to the main distribution pipeline with the aid of a teflon coated pressure reducing valve and a water flow rate of 50 l h hrt 13 s was maintained downwards through the glass column the system was covered to ensure darkness preventing the growth of phototrophic organisms on the glass rings the bms were operational for over 2 years before sampling during sampling two glass rings were removed from a bm and each was placed in a 50 ml falcon tube containing 10 ml of autoclaved dechlorinated tap water the tubes were then transported to the laboratory at 4 c the collected samples were labelled fs 6 to fs 10 the falcon tubes with samples were placed in an ultrasonic water bath bransonic 220 usa for 3 min the suspension was then decanted into a new tube and the glass rings were sonicated once more for 3 min in fresh autoclaved 10 ml dechlorinated tap water the corresponding suspensions of glass rings were pooled and the suspensions were filtered through 0 22 μm polycarbonate membrane filters to concentrate detached biomass the residue was then resuspended in 0 50 ml of autoclaved dechlorinated tap water an aliquot of each of the suspensions was used to extract dna at the time of biofilm sample collection bulk water samples were also collected and filtered through 0 22 µm syringe filters to facilitate analysis of nitrogen species at each of the sampling sites to prevent conclusions from being drawn by comparing microbial communities of bulk water with that found in biofilms developed in bms microbial analysis of bulk water was not carried out biofilms developed on bms do not directly compare with pipe wall biofilms that naturally occur in distribution systems ginige et al 2017 and this is largely due to differences in hydraulic conditions and biofilm attachment surfaces 2 3 bacterial community analysis using 454 pyrosequencing the dna of concentrated bulk water samples was extracted using a dneasy powerwater sterivex kit cat no id 14 600 50 nf qiagen usa and the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc usa was used to extract dna from biofilm samples the extracted dna was then stored at 20 c before shipment to mr dna molecular research lp texas usa for 454 pyrosequencing 454 pyrosequencing was performed using universal bacterial primers 27f 5 agrgtttgatcmtggctcag 3 and 530r 5 ccgcngcngctggcac 3 to capture hypervariable regions v1 v2 and v3 kumar et al 2011 as detailed in dowd et al 2008 specifics of the sequencing protocol followed is given in supporting information section s2 post sequence processing was carried out using the qiime quantitative insights into microbial ecology caporaso et al 2010 software package http www qiime org a detailed outline of the bioinformatic pipeline used is given in supporting information section s3 the chimera checked raw sequence data of all samples were deposited accession numbers prjna607678 in the database of the national centre for biotechnology information ncbi 2 4 16s rrna gene pathogen databases and identification of putative pathogenic bacteria fifty four pathogen listed in world health organisation and in australian drinking water quality guidelines nhmrc 2011 world health organisation 2017 reference databases each representing a pathogenic species was constructed by compiling full length 16s rrna gene sequences obtained from ncbi some 16s rrna gene sequences were extracted from genome sequences that were also downloaded from the same database after removing redundant sequences a total of 83 010 full length pathogen sequences were categorised based on phylogeny into their respective reference databases bal krishna et al 2020 these reference databases were then used to identify putative pathogenic bacteria in the samples for this the basic local alignment search tool blast was used to find regions of similarity between a sequence in a sample and sequences in reference databases specifically the qiime script exclude seqs by blast py was used to blast search sample sequences against the reference pathogen databases and hits were screened by e value 1exp 100 and the percentage 0 98 0 985 and 0 99 of the query that aligned with each sequence the matching hits were reported as a percent abundance of individual pathogens present in analysed samples further spearman s rank sum correlation coefficients were calculated using spss version 26 spss chicago to derive correlations between relative abundances of putative pathogens and total chlorine residuals using a significance cut off of α 0 05 2 5 chemical analysis chloramine residuals measured as total chlorine total ammonical nitrogen tan nitrite and nox nitrite nitrate were measured on the filtered 0 22 µm samples the aquakem 200 thermo scientific usa a high precision wet chemistry automated analyser was used to quantify tan nox and nitrite concentrations in samples the tan and nox analysis in this instrument was carried out in accordance to epa method 350 1 epa 1981a and nitrite analysis was performed in accordance to the apha sulphanilamide method 4500 no2 b apha et al 1998 total chlorine residuals were measured following the dpd colorimetric method using a hach pocket colorimeter this instrument had an experimental error of 0 03 mg l a portable ph metre hach 40d with a ph probe hach phc101 was used to measure ph and this had a measurement error of 0 1 additional details of the analytical methods can be found in bal krishna and sathasivan 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical parameters in the laboratory and full scale water distribution systems in the laboratory scale system the bulk water total chlorine residual in lr 1 was 2 18 0 25 mg l throughout the study with a flow of water into downstream lr 2 3 4 and 5 reactors a rapid decay of chloramine and a change of nitrogenous compounds tan nitrite and nitrate in bulk water was noted fig 2 a between lr 1 and 2 a total chlorine loss of 0 58 mg l was noted and this accompanied a marginal increase of nitrite 0 01 mg n l signifying a mildly nitrifying condition in r 2 sathasivan et al 2008 between lr 2 and 3 there is a tan drop of approximately 50 and this coincides with a 50 increase of nox fig 2a which shows the onset of nitrification in reactor lr 3 the presence of high nitrite levels 0 10 mg n l and low total chlorine residuals 0 5 mg l in lr 4 and 5 imply both reactors were severely nitrified sathasivan et al 2008 after the onset of severe nitrification there is a rapid drop of total chlorine residuals and this is largely a result of the increased bacterial diversity and metabolites in bulk water and in biofilms sathasivan and bal krishna 2012 a consistent decrease of ph from 8 0 0 1 to 7 6 0 1 was noted between lr 1 and 5 and this also confirms an increase of nitrifying bacterial activities wilczak et al 1996 full scale bulk water samples having chloramine residuals of range 0 05 2 20 mg l fig 2a similar to that of the laboratory scale system were also collected from different sampling locations of a full scale distribution system similar to the laboratory scale system the high bulk water total chlorine residual 2 2 mg l observed at fs 1 decreased down to 0 04 mg l with the passage of water down to location fs 3 this drop of total chlorine also coincided with a decrease of tan and an increase of nox concentrations fig 2a fs 3 is severely nitrified and is similar to lr 4 and 5 stable tan and nox concentrations fig 2a at locations fs 2 4 and 5 suggest these locations are comparable to lr 2 mildly nitrified considering that the above full scale samples were bulk water samples the water chemistry observed perhaps is a result of biofilm activities that prevailed upstream of sampling points the full scale biofilm monitoring locations successfully represented bulk water chemistry that prevailed between lr 3 and 5 of the laboratory scale system fig 2 location fs 6 onset of nitrification experienced the highest total chlorine residuals 0 91 mg l and a gradual decline of total chlorine was apparent between locations fs 7 and 10 severe nitrification there was a higher nox 0 89 mg n l and a minimal tan 0 02 mg l observed at these locations and the bacterial communities in these bms can be expected to resemble lr 4 and 5 bacterial communities in the laboratory scale system higher bulk water temperatures 27 31 c also have been observed at locations fs 7 and 10 of full scale and sarker et al 2013 have demonstrated the influence of higher temperatures on severe nitrification in chloraminated distribution systems specifically the optimum temperature for the growth of nitrifiers is between 25 and 30 c odell et al 1996 wolfe and lieu 2001 and hence a rapid growth of nitrifiers at such optimum bulk water temperatures induce severe nitrification conditions the bulk water total chlorine and nitrogenous species that appear to vary between the two lots of samples bulk water and biofilm are likely a result of sampling locations in the full scale distribution system fig 1b accelerated decay of chloramine by biofilms abundant in bms adhikari et al 2012 sathasivan et al 2010 may also have contributed towards the low chloramine residuals observed in bulk water samples obtained from bm devices fig 2 3 2 bacterial species and richness in the laboratory and full scale distribution systems the bacterial species richness estimators observed species and chao1 index were used to examine the influence of chloramine residuals on overall bacterial diversity of both laboratory and full scale systems the estimator observed species is a count of different otus that were present in each of the samples schloss and handelsman 2005 the chao1 index on the other hand estimates diversity based on abundance data includes the abundance of rare otus chao 1984 an increasing trend of either estimate signifies an increase of bacteria species richness accordingly the laboratory scale bulk water and biofilm samples show a clear increase of bacterial species richness with a decrease in bulk water chloramine residuals fig 2b bal krishna et al 2013a using flow cytometry also demonstrated an increase of bacterial cell numbers in bulk water and in biofilm with a decrease of chloramine residuals in a laboratory scale chloraminated distribution system when bulk water chloramine residuals are high only a handful of bacteria that can resist the disinfectant dominates the system and this is reflected with low observed species and chao1 index estimates with the decay of chloramine more bacterial species can resist chloramine and as a consequence an increase of bacterial species richness fig 2b can be observed e g the dominance of nitrifiers after the onset of nitrification as previously mentioned the full scale bulk water samples and the water chemistry observed in these samples perhaps are a result of biological activities upstream of the sampling locations hence correlating bacterial species richness with the water chemistry of these samples may not be appropriate the full scale biofilms on the other hand is a direct result of the bulk water chemistry at the bm locations hence it is valid to examine a correlation between bulk water chloramine residuals and bacterial species richness estimators for the full scale biofilm samples the chloramine residuals observed at the full scale bms are comparable to laboratory scale reactor lr 3 to 5 and according to fig 2b in these three reactors of the laboratory scale the bacterial species richness estimators did not significantly change with a decreasing concentration of bulk water chloramine the bacterial species richness in full scale biofilm samples also did not show a clear increase with a decrease of chloramine concentration this suggests that the resident bacteria in this distribution system perhaps already are capable of resisting the chloramine concentrations observed at these locations and hence the species richness is already saturated as can be observed with laboratory scale reactor locations lr 3 to 5 the study of gomez alvarez et al 2014 corroborates the above conclusion derived the variations of chao1 and observed species measurements between the two systems on the other hand could be a result of many factors including hydraulic operational conditions fish et al 2017 the age of biofilm and even the difference of pipe material used to facilitate the growth of biofilms ginige et al 2017 although it is not meaningful to compare water chemistry and species richness of full scale bulk water samples this study continued to make this comparison with a higher degree of confidence since the chloramine residuals at the monitored locations fs 1 2 4 and 5 were largely comparable to laboratory scale reactor locations lr 1 to 3 since the full scale bacterial species richness observed at locations fs 1 to 5 were perhaps a result of upstream water chemistry it is then reasonable to assume that the species richness observed were a result of a much higher bulk water chloramine residual than what was noted at the above sampling locations in the laboratory scale reactors lr 1 to 3 there is a gradual decrease of chloramine concentrations and this coincides with a gradual increase of bacterial species richness similarly the full scale locations fs 1 2 4 5 and 3 also demonstrate an increase of species richness with a decrease of chloramine residuals 3 3 bacterial community compositions when bacterial abundance was examined in both laboratory and full scale bulk water and biofilm samples an increase in abundance of different bacteria genera was observed with an increase in species richness in the laboratory scale system bacterial genera mycobacterium 22 59 and pseudomonas 1 4 23 8 dominated in the bulk water lr 1 lr 2 and lr 3 and in biofilm lr 1 lr 2 and lr 3 samples and the chloramine residuals in these samples were high and ranged between 0 7 2 18 mg l the genus mycobacterium has been frequently observed in both chlorinated and chloraminated drinking water distribution systems gomez alvarez et al 2012 and their resistance towards the disinfectants taylor et al 2000 are well known at low chloramine residuals i e at reactors lr 3 lr 4 and lr 5 and or after the onset of nitrification unclassified hyphomicrobianceae 2 0 6 3 unclassified betaproteobacteria 3 2 17 7 unclassified rhizobiales 1 0 21 2 sphingomonas 8 1 27 0 and nitrosomonas 1 3 2 8 were noted dominating in the laboratory scale system fig 3 sphingomonas are metabolically versatile and have higher affinities towards low nutrient concentrations liu et al 2013 and their high dominance in biofilm samples lr 3 lr 4 and lr 5 are likely due to an irreversible attachment of cells on to wall surfaces using excreted exopolysaccharides vuoriranta et al 2003 even though full scale bulk water samples fs 1 to 5 showed chloramine residuals that were comparable to lr 1 to 3 locations of the laboratory scale system the microbial abundance diversity between these three locations of the laboratory and the five locations of the full scale system varied significantly fig 3 the bacterial genera prochlorococcus 19 8 33 1 dominated the full scale system while mycobacterium 22 59 dominated the laboratory scale system at these high bulk water chloramine residuals to complement the low mycobacterium 1 5 29 5 abundance a higher abundance of other bacterial genera such as candidatus aquiluna 5 1 7 3 and ack m1 0 07 7 95 insignificant in the laboratory scale system were noted in the full scale bulk water samples as previously discussed the bacterial diversity and abundance noted in bulk water samples of fs 1 to 5 of the full scale system is not a result of the bulk water chemistry observed at these locations and it is a result of bulk water chemistry that is prevalent up stream the chloramine residuals at the above five locations are high and ranged between 0 05 2 2 mg l the chloramine residuals upstream of the above five locations should then be a magnitude higher and it is this water chemistry that likely influenced the bacterial diversity and abundance in the bulk water samples analysed accordingly it is not surprising to observe other dominant bacterial genera in these full scale bulk water samples the study further demonstrates disinfectant tolerance possibly as a stress response herath and sathasivan 2020 with bacterial genera such as prochlorococcus showing a much higher tolerance when compared with mycobacterium even though the full scale biofilm sampling locations showed some similarities to lr 3 to 5 of laboratory scale reactors in terms of chloramine residuals the bulk water chemistry continued to differ specifically with full scale biofilm monitoring locations showing higher nox concentrations fig 2 in addition to the chloramine residual the bulk water chemistry also influences the bacterial diversity and abundance associated with pipe wall biofilms and this was apparent when comparing laboratory scale lr 3 to 5 biofilm samples with full scale fs 6 to 10 biofilms samples specifically higher relative abundances of nitrifying bacterial genera nitrosomonas 13 9 and nitrospira 44 4 were observed at fs 6 and their abundance at lr 3 fig 3 were comparatively lower despite both locations showing similar total chlorine residuals fig 2a there however was a notable difference of bulk water temperature observed at lr 3 21 c and at fs 6 27 c fig 2a the optimum temperature for the growth of nitrifiers are reported to be between 25 and 30 c odell et al 1996 wolfe and lieu 2001 and the low bulk water temperature at lr 3 could have been contributory towards the difference of nitrifier abundance observed between lr 3 and fs 6 additionally the difference of biofilm growth media in lr 3 and fs 6 may also have influenced nitrifier abundance at these two locations and future studies should examine the influence of biofilm media on nitrifier abundance in chloraminated distribution systems sinibacteraceae 10 6 opitutaceae 36 7 nitrospira 2 0 52 6 and unclassified planctomycetes 2 2 9 0 were dominated at locations fs 7 to 10 where chloramine residuals were low 0 03 0 2 mg l and bulk water nox concentrations were high while chloramine residual and the bulk water chemistry could significantly influence bacterial diversity and abundance there are other factors such as the difference in the disinfection dosing strategy berry et al 2006 the bulk water nutrients and elements concentrations and types liu et al 2013 the pipe materials ginige et al 2017 and the hydraulic conditions lehtola et al 2006 which also influence overall bacterial diversity in both bulk water and in biofilms of full scale distribution systems 3 4 identification of putative pathogenic bacteria in chloraminated water distribution systems a bioinformatics pipeline such as qiime in general facilitates demultiplexing and quality filtering otu picking taxonomic assignment phylogenetic reconstruction and diversity analyses of raw dna sequence data caporaso et al 2010 for phylogenetic reconstruction and nucleic acid based detection and quantification of microbial diversity a reference database is vital and rrna databases such as silva are currently used worldwide quast et al 2013 while the above analysis is capable of revealing the abundance of bacterial genera such as mycobacterium pseudomonas legionella which contain pathogenic species due to the generic nature of the silva database obtaining a quantitative estimation of only the pathogenic species of the above bacterial genera becomes tedious if not impossible on the other hand if the silva database only contained the reference sequences of the pathogenic bacteria a quantitative estimation of the pathogenic bacterial species then becomes feasible and a similar approach has been examined to quantify pathogens in clinical samples miao et al 2017 the short 300 base pair lengths of the raw dna sequences will however continue to pose a challenge to identify the pathogenic bacterial species with absolute certainty in this study the grouping of sequences into otus quantification of relative abundances and sequence classification were carried out against a full length silva 16s rrna gene database at 97 sequence similarity the relative abundance of each of the putative pathogens in contrast was determined against full length sequence databases of individual pathogens at a much higher sequence 97 similarity as opposed to the genus level relative abundance that was reported with the silva database a species level relative abundance was reported with pathogens and hence a sequence similarity that was higher than 97 was selected to obtain an accurate estimation of relative abundance for putative pathogens to understand which percent sequence similarity is best to apply to obtain an accurate relative abundance for putative pathogens a range of percent sequence similarities 97 were applied to quantify the relative abundance of putative pathogens these relative abundances of putative pathogens were then compared against genus level relative abundances derived using the silva database and fig 4 provides a comparison of two putative pathogens in fig 4a the genus level relative abundance of mycobacterium showed a greater similarity to that of a combined relative abundance of eight mycobacterium spp this suggests that it was these eight pathogenic mycobacterium spp that were predominantly prevalent in the samples analysed in contrast the genus level relative abundance of pseudomonas far exceeded the relative abundance of the pathogenic pseudomonas aeruginosa in some samples fig 4b considering the large prevalence of non pathogenic pseudomonas spp in the environment this result is not surprising to a large extent the relative abundance of both pathogens quantified at 98 and 98 5 sequence similarities correlated well with the trend of relative abundance observed at the genus level at 99 sequence similarities however the pathogen relative abundance significantly deviated from the genus level relative abundance this deviation was thought to be primarily a result of the short length sequence approximate 300 base pair of the samples hence the relative abundance of all putative pathogenic bacteria in this study was estimated at a 98 sequence similarity as can be seen in fig 4b on occasions the genus level relative abundance appears lower than the estimated relative abundance of putative pathogens this was specifically noted when genus level relative abundance was low i e 1 this is likely a result of the differences between the two different algorithms that were used to determine the genus and the pathogen relative abundances the blast algorithm was exclusively used to estimate the relative abundance of putative pathogens while the usearch algorithm was used to cluster and quantify genus level relative abundance considering the wider application of the ncbi blast algorithm specifically to match sequences to species level identification of bacteria the relative abundance of putative pathogens derived using blast was considered accurate and was used for the comparative assessment of putative pathogens in all sampling locations of this study 3 5 a relative abundance of putative pathogenic bacteria in chloraminated water distribution systems a total of fifty four reference databases containing full length pathogenic 16s rrna gene bacterial sequences were developed and used to detect and quantify pathogenic bacteria i e fifty four pathogens listed in both the world health organisation 2017 and in australian drinking water quality guidelines nhmrc 2011 although all samples were screened for fifty four pathogens when chloramine residuals were in the range of 0 03 2 2 mg l only thirty one pathogenic bacterial species were detected in both bulk water and in biofilm samples of laboratory and full scale systems fig 5 similar to how chloramine residuals were observed impacting the overall bacterial community composition different pathogenic bacterial species were observed dominant with decaying chloramine residuals however species such as mycolicibacterium fortuitum and pseudomonas aeruginosa were noted in all laboratory i e in both bulk water and in biofilm and in bulk water of full scale samples fig 5 when a spearman s rank sum correlation coefficient was carried out between total chlorine residuals and relative abundances of mycolicibacterium fortuitum ρ 0 643 p 0 002 and pseudomonas aeruginosa ρ 0 608 p 0 004 significant positive correlations were noted suggesting that both organisms are resistant towards higher chloramine residuals mycobacterium avium mycobacterium gordonae and mycolicibacterium fortuitum previously reported as mycobacterium fortuitum were dominant in the laboratory scale system when chloramine residuals were high and the relative abundance of mycolicibacterium fortuitum was noted highest mycobacterium avium and mycolicibacterium fortuitum are well known for their tolerance towards disinfectants loret and dumoutier 2019 and this explains their dominance in samples that contained high chloramine residuals for example the ct concentration x time values for a 3 log reduction of mycobacterium avium at ph 7 and at 25 c range between 51 and 204 mg min l for chlorine 91 1710 mg min l for chloramine 2 11 mg min l for chlorine dioxide and 0 10 0 17 mg min l for ozone falkinham et al 2001 the ct value for a 2 log reduction of mycolicibacterium fortuitum on the other hand was 13 mg min l with ozone farooq et al 1977 other mycobacterium species mycobacterium intracellulare mycobacterium marinum mycobacterium scrofulaceum mycobacterium xenopi and mycobacteroides chelonae were also noted specifically in association with biofilm samples fig 5 the hydrophobic properties of the mycobacterium cell wall and their ability to form aggregates in water may have made them resistant to the disinfectants used for water treatment falkinham 2018 similar to mycobacterium spp pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed in all of the laboratory and bulk water samples of the full scale system fig 5 pseudomonas aeruginosa is also well known to resist disinfectant chlorine and chloramine residuals applied in water distribution systems ridgway and olson 1982 shrivastava et al 2004 additionally it exhibits diverse properties when exposed to different environmental and nutrient conditions da silva et al 2008 legionella is another pathogenic species often reported occurring in cooling tower waters lu et al 2017 and some occurrence also has been reported in drinking water distribution systems wang et al 2012 chloramine is known for its effectiveness to suppress the growth of legionella wang et al 2012 and legionella was not observed dominant both in the laboratory and in the full scale systems fig 5 compared to the full scale system an overall higher relative putative pathogen abundance was noted in the laboratory scale system fig 5 the majority of putative pathogenic species specifically bacterial genera tsukamurella mycobacterium and klebsiella were noted abundant in the biofilms of the laboratory scale system and they were largely missing both in bulk water and biofilms of the full scale distribution system further even when total chlorine and level of nitrification appeared similar e g locations lr 3 and fs 6 of laboratory and full scale distribution systems respectively the relative abundances of putative pathogens especially mycobacterium spp were noted different it has to be noted that operational conditions such as hrt water flow rate manuel et al 2009 physicochemical parameters such as temperature sisti et al 1998 chloramine residuals pipe materials wang et al 2012b etc which are known to influence the growth and diversity of bacteria in distribution systems were not maintained identical in the laboratory and full scale systems in this study the above operational variations are likely to have had some influence on the difference of putative pathogen relative abundance observed in the laboratory and full scale distribution systems furthermore the relative abundances reported in this manuscript should be considered with caution and should not be considered reflecting the absolute abundance of putative pathogens for example when total absolute bacterial abundance is very low even when absolute putative pathogen abundance is insignificant a higher relative abundance of the putative pathogen may be reported similarly when total absolute bacterial abundance is high a high absolute putative pathogen abundance may also be reported as an insignificant relative abundance reporting abundance as a relative abundance accordingly may also have contributed towards the observed differences of putative pathogenic abundance noted between the laboratory and full scale systems in this study in addition to the pathogenic bacterial species discussed above this study for the very first time reveals the diverse abundance of many putative pathogenic bacteria resilient towards chloramine of fifty four pathogenic bacterial species the detection of only thirty one species implies that the undetected twenty three species may have either not been prevalent in source waters or are sensitive towards chloramine water utilities do not routinely monitor all of the thirty one pathogenic species identified in this study in chloraminated distribution systems often it is the index and model organisms i e a group or species of bacteria that are indicative of pathogen presence e g e coli as an index for salmonella and faecal indicators organisms that indicates a possible occurrence of faecal contamination e g thermotolerant coliforms or e coli edberg et al 2000 which are routinely examined and it is unclear whether faecal indicators or index model organisms monitored account for all of the thirty one pathogenic species identified in this study a future study should focus on ascertaining the effectiveness of current water quality monitoring methods applied to chloraminated distribution systems to accurately inform the occurrence of pathogenic bacteria revealed in this study further the metagenomic surveillance tools developed in this study should be expanded to detect other waterborne pathogens such as protozoa viruses and helminths enabling the identification of disease outbreaks before their discovery by clinical surveillance future effort should also focus on 1 increasing the accuracy of the metagenomic analysis perhaps by replacing the blast algorithm with a phylogenetic placement algorithm czech et al 2019 and 2 examining mechanisms underlying the pathogen inhibitory destruction effects of chloramine as a note of caution it must be stressed that our short 454 pyrosequence data and current metagenomic surveillance tools in general do not allow accurate identification of pathogens to the strains or the species level our metagenomic data also do not provide information on the viability of the identified pathogens and this makes it difficult to quantitatively assess any public health significance of this work irrespective of these limitations metagenomic surveillance of drinking water can serve as a rapid assessment and an early warning of outbreaks for a large number of putative pathogenic bacteria to confirm a pathogenic outbreak however the presumptive positive metagenomic results need verification using conventional identification methods culture depended and or independent overall the study is of significance since it brings to attention the necessity to further expand our current water quality monitoring methods to screen a wider group of pathogenic bacteria including the thirty one putative pathogenic species identified in this study 4 conclusions this study investigated the relative putative pathogenic bacterial abundance in bulk water and in biofilm with decaying chloramine residuals and changing nitrifying conditions in a laboratory and in a full scale water distribution system the following conclusions were made from this study fifty four reference databases containing full length 16s rrna gene sequences of fifty four pathogenic bacteria species listed in the world health organisation and in australian drinking water quality guidelines were developed and used to examine the relative abundance of putative pathogenic bacteria present in chloraminated water distribution systems different putative pathogenic bacteria were observed dominant with decaying chloramine residuals out of the fifty four pathogenic bacterial species a total of thirty one putative pathogens were detected in both the laboratory and full scale chloraminated water distribution systems where chloramine residuals ranged between 0 03 and 2 2 mg l the bacterial species mycolicibacterium fortuitum and pseudomonas aeruginosa were noted in all laboratory both bulk water and in biofilm and full scale bulk water samples and mycolicibacterium fortuitum dominated under high chloramine residuals this study highlights the importance of developing new indicator organisms which would enable screening of pathogenic bacteria

17269,in temperate lakes it is generally assumed that light rather than temperature constrains phytoplankton growth in winter rapid winter warming and increasing observations of winter blooms warrant more investigation of these controls we investigated the mechanisms regulating a massive winter diatom bloom in a temperate lake high frequency data and process based lake modeling demonstrated that phytoplankton growth in winter was dually controlled by light and temperature rather than by light alone water temperature played a further indirect role in initiating the bloom through ice thaw which increased light exposure the bloom was ultimately terminated by silicon limitation and sedimentation these mechanisms differ from those typically responsible for spring diatom blooms and contributed to the high peak biomass our findings show that phytoplankton growth in winter is more sensitive to temperature and consequently to climate change than previously assumed this has implications for nutrient cycling and seasonal succession of lake phytoplankton communities the present study exemplifies the strength in integrating data analysis with different temporal resolutions and lake modeling the new lake ecological model serves as an effective tool in analyzing and predicting winter phytoplankton dynamics for temperate lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords winter diatom bloom high frequency monitoring lake modeling light limitation temperature 1 introduction diatom blooms have been well documented in freshwater lake ecosystems sorvari et al 2002 winder et al 2008 for eutrophic temperate lakes a typical seasonal pattern of plankton succession is frequently observed with a spring diatom bloom followed by a summer cyanobacteria bloom shatwell and köhler 2019 townsend et al 1992 these successional stages have been conceptualized in the plankton ecology group peg model sommer et al 2012 sommer et al 1986 winter diatom blooms however are under studied because winter is traditionally considered as an unproductive period this concept has recently been challenged prompting calls to focus more on winter limnology hampton et al 2017 here we define winter as january to march when the water column in northern temperate lakes is predominantly mixed and spring as april to june when stratification begins the same definition as in many other studies e g shatwell et al 2019 understanding lake ecological processes in winter is particularly important because climate change forces faster warming in winter than in other seasons in temperate lakes shatwell et al 2019 it is currently not possible to predict how the anticipated future changes of the global climate during winter will affect seasonal succession this may constitute a serious source of uncertainty in projecting climate impacts on lake ecosystems as increasing evidence has shown that biological activities in winter are causally linked with those in the following seasons salonen et al 2009 potential consequences of shifting winter dynamics include changing nutrient cycling and phytoplankton succession over the year wilhelm et al 2014 uncoupling zooplankton phytoplankton trophic interactions and phenological mismatch winder and schindler 2004 or unwanted developments in water quality thackeray et al 2016 to this end further investigation of critical winter limnology phenomena and the underlying mechanisms particularly winter diatom blooms is timely and essential winter diatom blooms could be driven by a different set of mechanisms from those for spring diatom blooms succession of phytoplankton communities is recognized as a consequence of light water temperature and nutrient limitation ferris and lehman 2007 neale et al 1991 vincent 1983 xiao et al 2019 massive diatom developments in winter are reported in many ice covered lakes with incredible photosynthetic efficiency due to a stable water column and inverse stratification d souza et al 2013 reavie et al 2016 spaulding and baron 1993 in temperate stratified lakes light is considered to be the sole limiting factor in winter and early spring sommer et al 1986 the onset of stratification serves as a light switch enabling net phytoplankton growth at a time when nutrients are sufficiently high and grazers are not yet present in significant abundances and initiating the spring bloom the emerging grazers parasitism and pathogens in late spring are usually considered as the terminators of spring diatom blooms sommer et al 2012 regarding winter diatom blooms however the classic light switch does not play a role because such blooms usually start before the onset of stratification whereas ice thaw was proposed as the major trigger of such blooms in shallower lakes shatwell et al 2008 a complex interaction between factors of temperature light and nutrients may also contribute to the mass development of diatoms nicklisch et al 2008 further little is known about the bloom terminator which could be sedimentation resulting from the onset of stratification or nutrient limitation goto et al 2007 thackeray et al 2008 thus we can hypothesize that the role of stratification onset in driving the diatom growth depends on the timing of the bloom early diatom blooms that occur at the end of winter during deep recirculation can be terminated by stratification onset due to enhanced water column stability and diatom sedimentation on the other hand later blooms that occur in spring can be triggered by stratification onset which enhances the light conditions for organisms in the epilimnion finally contrasting evidence prevails regarding the dominant species either as large or small centric species kirilova et al 2008 shatwell et al 2008 sommer et al 1986 yang et al 2016 taken together factors determining the timing dynamics and composition of winter diatom blooms remain far from conclusive and require quantitative investigations several challenges constrain further research sampling during winter is often complicated due to ice cover and thus less frequent the temporal frequency of regular sampling e g monthly is insufficient to capture the dynamics of algal blooms and their driving factors in detail in addition simultaneous monitoring of meteorology lake physical characteristics and water quality profiles are generally scarce even with sufficient data reliable predictions of winter phytoplankton dynamics for a given inland aquatic system remain challenging exploiting a combination of in situ high frequency monitoring techniques and process based lake modeling techniques may shed more light on winter limnology as has been successfully demonstrated in other applications in limnology kong et al 2019 to address these questions we investigated a temperate freshwater lake lake barleber in central germany with intermediate depth mean 6 7 m and hyper eutrophic state which underwent a massive diatom bloom in winter 2019 our hypotheses are 1 rather than a single trigger of light both water temperature and light interactively drive the winter diatom bloom 2 the bloom is terminated by silicon limitation and sedimentation near the onset of lake stratification and 3 the winter diatom bloom is dominated by small centric species rather than larger pennate or colonial diatoms we synthesized and analyzed data across one year from multiple sources including in situ high frequency monitoring meteorological databases and biweekly sampling of water quality variables in addition we developed an ecological model including competition between three phytoplankton species typically dominating lowland hyper eutrophic german lakes in spring one small solitary centric diatom one pennate diatom and one cyanobacterium even though the pennate diatom is better adapted to low light we expect that the small centric diatom outcompetes the other two species during the simulation because it is best adapted to low temperature the comprehensive dataset facilitated modeling lake physical and ecological dynamics and unraveled mechanisms driving this bloom event which were found different from those for spring diatom blooms 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site lake barleber is located in the city of magdeburg germany 52 13 15 n 11 39 00 e fig 1 the lake was formed by gravel excavations at the beginning of the 1930s with a surface area of approximately 1 km² a maximum depth of 11 0 m and an average depth of 6 7 m the lake is monomictic as it is stably stratified in summer while mixed in other seasons except for short ice cover periods when the lake is temporarily and inversely stratified there is no surface in or outflow the lake is fed only by groundwater and precipitation with an annual groundwater inflow of 640 000 m3 water residence time is approximately 10 years hannappel and strom 2020 it was initially dominated by macrophytes but became progressively eutrophic and dominated by phytoplankton due to release of sediment borne phosphorus p in 1986 a lake wide phosphorus removal with an aluminum addition turned the lake back into the mesotrophic state with a diverse macrophyte community klapper and geller 2001 but since 2016 the lake again switched into an eutrophic state 2 2 sampling schemes and data preparation the main sampling site was ba1 fig 1 where water samples were collected at five depths 0 5 2 5 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 m and water temperature profiles were measured with manual probes table s1 the sampling frequency varied from weekly during warm seasons jun sep 2018 and mar jul 2019 every second day during the cyanobacteria bloom in july 2018 to biweekly monthly during cold seasons oct 2018 feb 2019 water chemistry variables total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorus tp soluble reactive phosphorus srp and silicon si concentrations were measured in the laboratory using standard methods table s1 volume weighted concentrations were calculated for the whole water column during mixing and separately for the epilimnion and hypolimnion during the stratified period secchi depth z secchi was measured manually using a secchi disk in addition the thermistor chain captured water temperatures at 15 depths table s1 every 15 minutes moreover we used a multi parameter probe to manually capture vertical profiles of temperature electrical conductivity salinity ph turbidity oxygen and chlorophyll a fluorescence and a multi channel fluorescence probe to determine the phytoplankton composition in terms of specific chlorophyll fluorescence from diatoms green algae cryptophytes and cyanophytes beutler et al 2002 water chemistry and probe data were all linearly interpolated from 0 0 m to 9 0 m at 0 5 m intervals and then linearly interpolated to daily resolution in addition we collected phytoplankton samples and fixed them with lugol s solution during the diatom bloom mar 4th 2019 and observed the samples under an inverted microscope to identify the dominant phytoplankton group in addition to manual sampling and profiles a high frequency monitoring buoy measured near surface water conditions every 10 minutes at the bam site in the middle of the lake fig 1 and table s1 a multi parameter probe and a multi channel fluorescence probe were both integrated into the buoy system and permanently suspended at 0 5 m depth for continuous monitoring of physic chemical properties temperature conductivity ph turbidity oxygen and chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton community dynamics in the surface water all high frequency datasets were further aggregated to daily intervals we collected meteorological data from the german meteorology service dwd via the r package rdwd boessenkool 2019 at the station magdeburg ca 15 km south from the lake including air temperature c air pressure hpa humidity mean wind speed m s 1 and precipitation mm including snow at hourly interval and sum of solar incoming radiation j cm 2 for every 10 minutes fig s1 solar radiation was aggregated to hourly intervals in addition we obtained historical climate data at station magdeburg from 2010 at 10 minutes resolution 2 3 statistics during the deep circulation period october 2018 to march 2019 we tested the differences of the volume weighted nutrient concentrations before and after the onset of the winter diatom bloom we applied a generalized least squares gls model with a first order autoregressive correlation structure ar 1 to analyze the nutrient time series data against a binary variable as the proxy of the winter diatom bloom 0 no bloom 1 bloom the gls model was implemented in r r core team 2018 using the function gls in package nlme pinheiro et al 2012 2 4 physical characteristics evaluation water surface temperature was estimated as the mean value in the upper 1 m layer at 0 0 and 1 0 m depth and bottom temperature as the mean value measured at 6 5 and 7 5 m around the mean depth 6 7 m the onset and end of lake stratification was considered as the start and end of the longest period in the year with a temperature difference higher than 1 c between the surface and bottom shatwell and köhler 2019 thermocline depth during the stratification was calculated using the function ts thermo depth in package rlakeanalyzer winslow et al 2019 in r r core team 2018 the mixed layer depth h m was assumed to be the mean lake depth when the lake was isothermal and the thermocline depth when the lake was stratified shatwell and köhler 2019 z secchi was linearly interpolated over time between measurements to the daily scale and the light extinction coefficient ε m 1 was calculated from z secchi as ε 2 05 z secchi obtained from similar waterbodies in germany shatwell et al 2016 the mean daily underwater light intensity i m mol m 2 d 1 in the mixed layer down to depth of h was calculated based on the lambert beer law i m i 0 ε h 1 1 e ε h where i 0 was the photosynthetically available radiation par just below the water surface i 0 was estimated from daily solar radiation assuming 4 56 μmol photons j 1 par proportion within solar radiation of 50 and 10 reflection and backscattering at the water surface shatwell and köhler 2019 during the ice cover period jan 14th feb 4th 2019 i 0 was reduced by 50 as an empirical estimation kirillin et al 2012 we assumed a value of 1 3 0 8 2 5 mol m 2 d 1 as the critical light intensity for positive net growth of phytoplankton köhler et al 2018 siegel et al 2002 sommer and lengfellner 2008 the effective photoperiod was calculated as the length of the solar day multiplied by the ratio of euphotic to mixed depth z eu z mix 1 when z eu z mix 1 1 to account for periods when phytoplankton are in effective darkness below the euphotic layer z eu was considered to be the depth of 1 of surface light given by z eu ln 0 01 ε 1 2 5 modeling two modeling approaches were implemented in this study the first was estimating the period of ice cover and thickness from november 2018 to april 2019 using the one dimensional bulk hydrodynamic model flake a process based model to simulate lake thermal regimes kirillin et al 2011 mironov 2008 the model consists of two water layers representing the simplified vertical structure of the water column including the ice cover shatwell et al 2019 flake has been widely used especially in numerical weather prediction and climate research and is readily applicable for lakes with different conditions kirillin et al 2017 shatwell et al 2019 thiery et al 2014 model inputs included air temperature c vapor pressure mb wind speed m s 1 cloud cover and solar incoming radiation w m 2 obtained from the dwd described above vapor pressure was calculated as the product of saturated vapor pressure calculated from air temperature according to tabata 1973 and relative humidity the second approach aimed at simulating phytoplankton dynamics during the winter diatom bloom to elucidate the underlying mechanisms a lake ecological model fig 2 was developed to simulate phytoplankton growth and the competition between species that typically dominate lowland hyper eutrophic german lakes in spring the model is zero dimensional and is valid for a mixed water column or water layer the state variables in the model include p and si both dissolved in water and stored in sediment biovolume of two diatoms stephanodiscus minutulus and nitzschia acicularis and one cyanobacterium limnothrix redekei as well as the biovolume quota of p within each species of algae the model assumed a constant fraction of si in the two diatom species as observed in experimental data s minutulus is a centric diatom usually dominating in early spring which is a strong competitor for si a low temperature short photoperiod specialist and specially adapted to early spring conditions n acicularis is a late spring pennate diatom a p specialist and grows rapidly under optimal conditions l redekei is a late spring cyanobacterium which grows much slower than both diatoms but is a superior competitor under p limitation nicklisch 1999 and has no si requirements all three species are well adapted to low light conditions with a low light compensation point and high light use efficiency see table s2 compared to other common species reynolds 2006 the model accounted for the species specific 3 way interactions between temperature photoperiod and the respective limiting resources light phosphorus and silicon it could thus determine e g the relative contribution of different factors in constraining growth rates model parameters related to growth kinetics light absorption nutrient and chlorophyll content were calculated directly from culture experimental data at high accuracy foy 1983 gibson and foy

light availability water temperature effective photoperiod and mixed layer depth all at daily intervals during the simulation period jan 1st to mar 31st 2019 the model is written in r r core team 2018

observed a massive algal bloom during feb and mar 2019 with a maximum chlorophyll concentration up to 93 4 μg l 1 on mar 1st fig 3 while the chlorophyll a fluorescence was unable to distinguish diatoms and dinoflagellates microscopic inspections revealed that the massive winter algal bloom consisted of small centric diatoms while dinoflagellates were not present on the contrary dinoflagellates were present at high abundance and diatoms were almost absent during summer 2018 the winter diatom bloom reached a concentration that was approximately 1 4 times higher than that in the previous summer when cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates bloomed together maximum 68 4 μg l 1 on september 4th 2018 chlorophyll a fluorescence data from profiles during regular sampling confirmed the occurrence of the winter diatom bloom in 2019 and further revealed that the diatoms were homogeneously distributed in the water column during the bloom fig s2 we considered the first day of the exponential growth of diatoms as the start of the diatom bloom feb 5th fig 4 a and the day with the minimum value before the spring algal development as the end mar 20th fig 3a there were several short term diatom developments during jan 24th to feb 4th 2019 before the bloom started fig 4a 3 2 meteorological and lake physical conditions lake barleber was ice covered from jan 14th to feb 4th 2019 just before the winter bloom approximately two thirds of the surface area measured data showed that water temperature started to decline from the start of ice cover throughout the water column following the decline in air temperature that fell below zero fig 4b water temperatures from the surface to the bottom were below 4 c and demonstrated intermittent inverse stratification from jan 15th to feb 4th fig 3c the inverse stratification was transient and restricted to the upper 1 m of the water column suggesting incomplete ice cover with changing ice thickness and coverage area over time this inference was further supported by predictions of ice thickness from the 1d hydrodynamic model flake fig 4c and s3 the model indicated two periods with ice cover on the lake one at the end of january and the other at the beginning of february with an ice thickness up to 0 7 cm this is an estimation of the average ice thickness across the lake surface without considering the spatial heterogeneity in addition there was frequent snowfall during the ice cover period fig 4c that could have profound effects on light under ice taken together we concluded that the lake was at least partially covered by ice during jan 14th to feb 4th 2019 with relatively low ice thickness it is thus reasonable to reduce the light below water surface during ice cover by a factor of 0 5 to calculate the mean water column light intensity im fig 4d the diatom bloom started immediately after ice thaw in parallel with changes in lake physical conditions including an increase in air and water temperature light intensity termination of inverse stratification and onset of deep recirculation fig 3 and 4 the lake was well mixed and isothermal during the diatom bloom except for short term heating and cooling on the surface and stratification started soon after the diatom bloom collapsed fig 3b furthermore light intensity fluctuated around the critical value of 1 3 mol m2 day 1 before the onset of the diatom bloom fig 4d and stayed mostly above the critical value afterwards 3 3 water quality the lake was hyper eutrophic due to high tp concentrations mean 0 42 mg l 1 with a range of 0 05 0 71 mg l 1 during the study period june 2018 to june 2019 the system was p limited in winter with dissolved inorganic nitrogen din total phosphorus tp ratios of 2 3 to 3 1 1 6 as the threshold dolman et al 2016 except for no3 n concentrations of other nutrients were all significantly lower after the onset of the diatom bloom p 0 05 table 1 fig s4 data for si concentrations were not directly available before the onset of the diatom bloom but si concentration in the previous november sampling reached 1 55 mg l 1 after the bloom si decreased to 0 05 mg l 1 close to the detection limit 0 02 mg l 1 the decline was also pronounced for srp from 337 to 242 μg l 1 and ammonium from 0 76 to 0 17 mg l 1 furthermore we observed changes in multiple water quality variables in parallel with the diatom bloom fig s5 oxygen level increased rapidly to a maximum concentration of 23 1 mg l 1 and saturation of 182 5 in the middle of the bloom meanwhile there was an increase in ph throughout the water column 8 41 9 13 pointing to high photosynthetic activity 3 4 ecological modeling model predictions of nutrients and various water quality proxies fit nicely to the field observations with low root mean square error rmse and high correlation coefficient r values fig 5 the model predicted that rather than large pennate diatoms n acicularis and cyanobacteria l redekei small centric diatoms as represented by s minutulus would dominate the phytoplankton community during the bloom fig 6 a which was also consistent with observations dissolved p in the model prediction was consumed rapidly during the bloom but was not shown in the observations implying that the model might have underestimated relevant processes for p cycling such as sediment mineralization and release the model clearly showed that abrupt silicon limitation and subsequent sedimentation losses terminated the bloom the model further indicated that rather than a single trigger of light an increase of both water temperature and light intensity interactively initiated the diatom bloom fig 6b before the bloom constraint mainly by temperature and light together reduced the net growth rate of s minutulus from the maximum 1 3 d 1 to a level fluctuating around zero fluctuations of net growth rate on certain days were most likely attributed to cloudiness as shown in fig s1c for global radiation then a period with continuous positive net growth rate initiated the diatom bloom implying that constraints from temperature and light intensity were both weakened effective photoperiod showed little effect except for the period with the peak diatom biomass beginning of march after the biomass peak limitation by si depletion became dominant and drove the bloom to the end inner panel of fig 6b our model therefore revealed a complex interplay of factors including temperature light and nutrients in driving the winter diatom bloom 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms of the winter diatom bloom both our analyses of field data and modeling outcomes suggest different mechanisms for driving the diatom blooms in winter than in spring winter diatom assemblages under ice covered lakes are primarily driven by high photosynthetic efficiency and a stable water column d souza et al 2013 spaulding and baron 1993 besides light is particularly emphasized in the peg model as the key factor triggering the spring phytoplankton buildup following the concept of critical mixing depth sverdrup 1953 the onset of stratification in deeper lakes 30m in depth typically brings an order of magnitude increase in light availability serving as a light switch of the diatom bloom sommer et al 2012 in shallower lakes the spring bloom can begin before the onset of thermal stratification during the winter circulation period when lakes are typically mixed to the bottom in addition the revised version of the peg model specifically states that temperature is unimportant for winter phytoplankton dynamics sommer et al 2012 this is based on the fact that dominant algal species in winter are usually well adapted to cold conditions experimental studies further show that water temperature has little effect on the initial slope of algal growth light and photosynthesis light curves under low light conditions davison 1991 foy 1983 talling 1957 because photochemical rather than enzymatic processes are rate limiting this has led to the view that temperature is unimportant but this conclusion neglects the interaction between temperature and light low temperatures decrease the threshold at which light becomes limiting nicklisch et al 2008 so that light may be close to growth saturating even at the low intensities that occur in winter in temperate lakes the interaction therefore increases the relative importance of temperature accordingly higher growth rates can only be achieved by simultaneously increasing light and temperature and thus both factors must be considered as co limiting here we define limiting in terms of growth rates rather than in terms of biomass which can only be limited by true resources like light and nutrients based on the modeling which disentangled the individual effects of temperature and light we found that both factors are important to the diatom bloom and the bloom was most likely initiated by a complex interaction of them fig 6b we further supported this finding by projecting the observed water temperatures and light values during the bloom over the isoclines of equal specific growth rate at 0 2 d 1 as a typical value during the bloom estimated by the model fig 7 a we found that the points showing the water temperature and light intensity in the water column during jan 1st and mar 20th 2019 were distributed along both limbs of the isoclines suggesting constraints from both factors the isocline for s minutulus is closest to the origin around the points showing that this species can achieve the same growth rate as the other species at lower light and temperature this reflects its specific adaptation to these conditions and explains why this species dominates in the model during the cold periods in addition specifically for s minutulus we compared the relative strength of the growth constraint by both light energy and temperature before and during the bloom using the constraint vector μ i μ t fig 7b based on the model estimations fig 7c e we found that the arrows representing the constraint vector demonstrated both vertical and horizontal directions fig 7b implying that both factors played a role in driving the diatom bloom this method further categorized the light and temperature condition field into either light constraint or temperature constraint accordingly light and temperature alternatively acted as the major constraint on the growth of s minutulus before the onset of the bloom fig 6b then at the exponential growth stage of the diatom temperature constrained the growth on most days as an increase in temperature would have brought a greater increase in growth rate of s minutulus than an increase in light this is evident for conditions where the arrows are almost vertical showing that light energy plays a minor role interestingly light was strongly constraining only on some overcast days as shown by arrows with a large horizontal component we further proposed that water temperature contributed to the onset of the winter diatom bloom both directly and indirectly the direct effects were physiological and allowed higher growth rates of diatoms fig 6b the indirect effects included driving the ice thaw and water mixing which were likely more pronounced the lake became fully mixed after ice thaw allowing for rapid increase in both light intensity and water temperature growth limitation on the diatoms was therefore weakened which initiated exponential growth our results therefore highlight the fundamental role of water temperature in driving winter diatom blooms which can be considered as an auxiliary switch altogether the physical environment is important for the onset of winter diatom bloom rather than simply the amount of light we found that nutrients were not limiting at the beginning of the bloom but si limitation ultimately terminated the bloom this was indicated by both nutrient data fig s4 and the modeling results fig 6b though ammonium was almost depleted at the end of the bloom diatoms may use nitrate as an alternative nitrogen source for growth so that the bloom was unlikely terminated by n limitation moreover srp concentrations during the bloom were too high 200 µg l 1 to indicate p limitation of phytoplankton results from an experimental study shatwell et al 2013 implied that the initial si concentration of 1 5 mg l 1 would be far above the range for si limited growth of both diatom species before the diatom bloom the apparent half saturation constant in the monod model of specific growth rates was about 0 025 and 0 046 mg l 1 for s minutulus and n acicularis respectively across various conditions of temperature 5 20 c and photoperiod 6 12 h d 1 the reduction of si concentration from 1 5 to 0 05 mg l 1 fully complied with the increase of diatom biomass and also suggested limitation by si fig 6b mostly the emergence of grazers köhler et al 2005 lampert et al 1986 sommer et al 2012 or parasitism particularly by chytrids frenken et al 2017 ibelings et al 2011 are responsible for terminating spring diatom blooms though we cannot exclude these factors because we neither observed nor modeled the abundance of grazers or chytrids we assume that silicon limitation and sedimentation played the major role the onset of silicon limitation is usually abrupt and recycling is slow at low temperature if there is no external supply of fresh silicon the diatom biomass can no longer increase and the bloom is inevitably terminated the model suggested that the bloom dynamics could be explained entirely by abiotic factors and that diatoms grew exponentially during the bloom as in a batch culture without signals of grazing fig 6a si limitation was apparently predominating in the end of the bloom fig 6b in fact we think the absence of significant losses due to grazing or parasitism facilitated the high peak biomass close to the limit set by complete incorporation of available silicon previous studies also demonstrate that grazing pressure decreases and si limitation increases when diatom blooms occur earlier for instance due to climate warming shatwell et al 2008 thackeray et al 2008 winder and schindler 2004 4 2 composition of the diatom bloom we observed that small centric species similar to stephanodiscus spp dominated the winter diatom bloom in lake barleber modeling results also suggest that stephanodiscus spp may outcompete other species e g n acicularis in winter fig 6a this finding is against our expectation that winter diatom blooms are typically dominated by large diatoms such as aulacoseria spp as observed in many other lake systems horn et al 2011 yang et al 2016 these large species display a combination of traits that mediate high competitive abilities including low light and low temperature adaptation accumulation of nutrient reserves and strong benthic pelagic coupling that allow them to form a considerable winter inoculum in deep water jewson et al 2010 lewandowska et al 2015 winter inoculum is the key for the domination of large diatoms because in this way they can establish priority and build up nutrient reserves to outcompete other species gibson 1981 padisák et al 2003 however in lake barleber nutrients particularly p were abundant and the nutrient storage capabilities of large rather slow growing diatom species like aulacoseira spp may not provide a significant advantage moreover small fast growing species such as stephanodiscus spp are probably stronger competitors under si limitation kilham et al 1986 shatwell et al 2013 in addition a sensitivity analysis of the model to the sinking velocity assigned to 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 m d 1 of the two diatom species s minutulus and n acicularis demonstrated marginal effects of sinking velocity on the ecological dynamics during winter 2019 in lake barleber fig s6 implying that the dominance of s minutulus was attributed more to the other competitive advantages such as si uptake and adaptation to low photoperiod it is noteworthy that diatom blooms dominated by stephanodiscus spp in mild winters were also observed in the polymictic and eutrophic lake müggelsee berlin germany with a mean depth of 4 9 m shatwell et al 2008 taken together in hyper eutrophic lakes with shallow to intermediate depth such as lake barleber the winter diatom assemblage is more likely dominated by small centric species 4 3 merits and limitations of the methodology we demonstrate high resolution monitoring as an effective tool to refine the recognition of limnological phenomena and to unravel new mechanisms the high frequency data on water temperature profiles water quality and phytoplankton community provide a unique opportunity to investigate the comprehensive picture of the short term winter phytoplankton dynamics and to evaluate the underlying mechanisms in detail this would be difficult with the data from regular sampling at a biweekly resolution or coarser during cold seasons furthermore we showcase the strength of combining high frequency data with those from regular monitoring as high frequency data cover a fine temporal resolution of a small set of target variables while regular sampling data include a more comprehensive set of variables but at a relatively low frequency our dataset inevitably contains gaps e g missing ice data and si concentrations before the bloom we performed a dual modeling approach to compensate for such weakness and to provide more insights on the mechanisms driving the diatom bloom agreement between the model outputs and the observations were primarily attributable to the following reasons first the model configuration represented the majority of physical and ecological components and processes in the lake that were critical during the winter diatom bloom the ecological model explicitly considered a well chosen functional diatom group dominating in the field and the species specific interactions between growth factors light temperature photoperiod and nutrients second all growth parameters for light p si temperature and photoperiod constraint growth were directly measured in laboratory experiments for all species table s2 rather than calibrated or estimated representing a high degree of realism third the models were driven by high quality external forcing data including in situ measurements of in lake physical and chemical conditions altogether the models in the present study were capable of reproducing the dynamics of key processes in the lake so that their predictions of those variables without observations ice thickness and si concentrations could be relied on we therefore see the potential to apply these models as ecological forecasting tools e g with respect to the occurrence of diatom blooms in temperate lakes nevertheless we explicitly focus on winter ecological dynamics so that some processes in the ecological model such as nutrient release from sediment and maximum phosphorus uptake rate are not temperature dependent for simplicity these processes should be coupled to temperature if the model is applied during periods with larger temperature variation or when si p ratios are higher which would be an important step forward for the model improvement in the future 4 4 implications and perspectives our findings for winter diatom blooms would be relevant to other gravel pit and groundwater fed lakes which are globally widespread due to the high demand of gravel and sand 1 7 108 metric tons per year for construction mollema and antonellini 2016 in addition our results may also apply to temperate shallow to medium depth lakes and reservoirs in general fed by surface inflows which supports the phenomenon of diatom growth in winter we further applied the developed ecological model to lake müggelsee natural temperate riverine lake mean depth 4 9m fed by spree river retention time 6 weeks which also supports winter blooms of small centric diatoms shatwell et al 2008 the good model results fig s7 illustrate the general applicability of our findings because the principles in the model about the interactive effects of light and temperature are universal further such winter diatom blooms can occur in oligo and mesotrophic lakes goto et al 2007 and drinking water reservoirs horn et al 2011 provided they are not too deep however the species dominating these blooms and thus their dynamics may differ from the more eutrophic species modeled here deep drinking water reservoirs usually experience typical spring diatom blooms horn et al 2015 wentzky et al 2019 altogether we infer that our results apply in general to temperate eutrophic shallow to moderately deep lakes that can experience mild winters or intermittent ice cover our findings can be valuable for evaluating the impact of climate change on inland freshwater ecosystems with increasing air temperature in a future climate model projections demonstrate higher surface water temperature thereby reducing ice cover and extending the circulation period before stratification for lakes shatwell et al 2019 woolway and merchant 2019 given the important role of water temperature shown here we expect more frequent winter diatom blooms in lake barleber and also in similar temperate lakes in addition the intensity of the diatom bloom could be larger because previous studies have shown that the bloom intensity correlates with the duration of the circulation period horn et al 2011 furthermore earlier ice thaw results in lower temperature for diatom growth which may shift the diatom composition from large pennate to small cold adapted centric species as we found here in lake barleber the dominance of highly edible small centric diatoms rather than their large less edible counterparts was likely to impose knock on effects on the earlier occurrence of zooplankton which possibly altered the seasonal succession of plankton communities the consequences of changing patterns of winter diatom blooms on the lake ecosystem structure and functioning are subject to further investigations 5 conclusions ecological dynamics of temperate lakes in winter are poorly understood because winter was long thought to be dormant and was consequently ignored in most sampling campaigns we examined the occurrence and short term dynamics of a massive winter bloom of diatoms in a german lake which exceeded the annual biomass maximum of the previous year the results showed that this bloom was dominated by small centric diatom species rather than their larger counterparts we demonstrate that temperature can no longer be ignored in winter dynamics but that both temperature and light are decisive we therefore challenge the current paradigm of sole control by light availability on lake phytoplankton growth in winter our new findings were attributed to the combination of regular field sampling in situ high frequency monitoring and modeling of the lake we provide a novel model of the species specific interactive effects of different factors on algal dynamics the model parameters are based on a large set of phytoplankton bioassay data and was implemented without calibration so as to give a high degree of realism and become applicable to temperate lakes in general overall increasing frequency of winter biological activities in lakes such as diatom blooms are inevitable in the context of climate change calling for more insights on the lake winter limnology and their implications on the seasonal succession of biogeochemical and ecological processes notes data and r script for the

17269,in temperate lakes it is generally assumed that light rather than temperature constrains phytoplankton growth in winter rapid winter warming and increasing observations of winter blooms warrant more investigation of these controls we investigated the mechanisms regulating a massive winter diatom bloom in a temperate lake high frequency data and process based lake modeling demonstrated that phytoplankton growth in winter was dually controlled by light and temperature rather than by light alone water temperature played a further indirect role in initiating the bloom through ice thaw which increased light exposure the bloom was ultimately terminated by silicon limitation and sedimentation these mechanisms differ from those typically responsible for spring diatom blooms and contributed to the high peak biomass our findings show that phytoplankton growth in winter is more sensitive to temperature and consequently to climate change than previously assumed this has implications for nutrient cycling and seasonal succession of lake phytoplankton communities the present study exemplifies the strength in integrating data analysis with different temporal resolutions and lake modeling the new lake ecological model serves as an effective tool in analyzing and predicting winter phytoplankton dynamics for temperate lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords winter diatom bloom high frequency monitoring lake modeling light limitation temperature 1 introduction diatom blooms have been well documented in freshwater lake ecosystems sorvari et al 2002 winder et al 2008 for eutrophic temperate lakes a typical seasonal pattern of plankton succession is frequently observed with a spring diatom bloom followed by a summer cyanobacteria bloom shatwell and köhler 2019 townsend et al 1992 these successional stages have been conceptualized in the plankton ecology group peg model sommer et al 2012 sommer et al 1986 winter diatom blooms however are under studied because winter is traditionally considered as an unproductive period this concept has recently been challenged prompting calls to focus more on winter limnology hampton et al 2017 here we define winter as january to march when the water column in northern temperate lakes is predominantly mixed and spring as april to june when stratification begins the same definition as in many other studies e g shatwell et al 2019 understanding lake ecological processes in winter is particularly important because climate change forces faster warming in winter than in other seasons in temperate lakes shatwell et al 2019 it is currently not possible to predict how the anticipated future changes of the global climate during winter will affect seasonal succession this may constitute a serious source of uncertainty in projecting climate impacts on lake ecosystems as increasing evidence has shown that biological activities in winter are causally linked with those in the following seasons salonen et al 2009 potential consequences of shifting winter dynamics include changing nutrient cycling and phytoplankton succession over the year wilhelm et al 2014 uncoupling zooplankton phytoplankton trophic interactions and phenological mismatch winder and schindler 2004 or unwanted developments in water quality thackeray et al 2016 to this end further investigation of critical winter limnology phenomena and the underlying mechanisms particularly winter diatom blooms is timely and essential winter diatom blooms could be driven by a different set of mechanisms from those for spring diatom blooms succession of phytoplankton communities is recognized as a consequence of light water temperature and nutrient limitation ferris and lehman 2007 neale et al 1991 vincent 1983 xiao et al 2019 massive diatom developments in winter are reported in many ice covered lakes with incredible photosynthetic efficiency due to a stable water column and inverse stratification d souza et al 2013 reavie et al 2016 spaulding and baron 1993 in temperate stratified lakes light is considered to be the sole limiting factor in winter and early spring sommer et al 1986 the onset of stratification serves as a light switch enabling net phytoplankton growth at a time when nutrients are sufficiently high and grazers are not yet present in significant abundances and initiating the spring bloom the emerging grazers parasitism and pathogens in late spring are usually considered as the terminators of spring diatom blooms sommer et al 2012 regarding winter diatom blooms however the classic light switch does not play a role because such blooms usually start before the onset of stratification whereas ice thaw was proposed as the major trigger of such blooms in shallower lakes shatwell et al 2008 a complex interaction between factors of temperature light and nutrients may also contribute to the mass development of diatoms nicklisch et al 2008 further little is known about the bloom terminator which could be sedimentation resulting from the onset of stratification or nutrient limitation goto et al 2007 thackeray et al 2008 thus we can hypothesize that the role of stratification onset in driving the diatom growth depends on the timing of the bloom early diatom blooms that occur at the end of winter during deep recirculation can be terminated by stratification onset due to enhanced water column stability and diatom sedimentation on the other hand later blooms that occur in spring can be triggered by stratification onset which enhances the light conditions for organisms in the epilimnion finally contrasting evidence prevails regarding the dominant species either as large or small centric species kirilova et al 2008 shatwell et al 2008 sommer et al 1986 yang et al 2016 taken together factors determining the timing dynamics and composition of winter diatom blooms remain far from conclusive and require quantitative investigations several challenges constrain further research sampling during winter is often complicated due to ice cover and thus less frequent the temporal frequency of regular sampling e g monthly is insufficient to capture the dynamics of algal blooms and their driving factors in detail in addition simultaneous monitoring of meteorology lake physical characteristics and water quality profiles are generally scarce even with sufficient data reliable predictions of winter phytoplankton dynamics for a given inland aquatic system remain challenging exploiting a combination of in situ high frequency monitoring techniques and process based lake modeling techniques may shed more light on winter limnology as has been successfully demonstrated in other applications in limnology kong et al 2019 to address these questions we investigated a temperate freshwater lake lake barleber in central germany with intermediate depth mean 6 7 m and hyper eutrophic state which underwent a massive diatom bloom in winter 2019 our hypotheses are 1 rather than a single trigger of light both water temperature and light interactively drive the winter diatom bloom 2 the bloom is terminated by silicon limitation and sedimentation near the onset of lake stratification and 3 the winter diatom bloom is dominated by small centric species rather than larger pennate or colonial diatoms we synthesized and analyzed data across one year from multiple sources including in situ high frequency monitoring meteorological databases and biweekly sampling of water quality variables in addition we developed an ecological model including competition between three phytoplankton species typically dominating lowland hyper eutrophic german lakes in spring one small solitary centric diatom one pennate diatom and one cyanobacterium even though the pennate diatom is better adapted to low light we expect that the small centric diatom outcompetes the other two species during the simulation because it is best adapted to low temperature the comprehensive dataset facilitated modeling lake physical and ecological dynamics and unraveled mechanisms driving this bloom event which were found different from those for spring diatom blooms 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site lake barleber is located in the city of magdeburg germany 52 13 15 n 11 39 00 e fig 1 the lake was formed by gravel excavations at the beginning of the 1930s with a surface area of approximately 1 km² a maximum depth of 11 0 m and an average depth of 6 7 m the lake is monomictic as it is stably stratified in summer while mixed in other seasons except for short ice cover periods when the lake is temporarily and inversely stratified there is no surface in or outflow the lake is fed only by groundwater and precipitation with an annual groundwater inflow of 640 000 m3 water residence time is approximately 10 years hannappel and strom 2020 it was initially dominated by macrophytes but became progressively eutrophic and dominated by phytoplankton due to release of sediment borne phosphorus p in 1986 a lake wide phosphorus removal with an aluminum addition turned the lake back into the mesotrophic state with a diverse macrophyte community klapper and geller 2001 but since 2016 the lake again switched into an eutrophic state 2 2 sampling schemes and data preparation the main sampling site was ba1 fig 1 where water samples were collected at five depths 0 5 2 5 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 m and water temperature profiles were measured with manual probes table s1 the sampling frequency varied from weekly during warm seasons jun sep 2018 and mar jul 2019 every second day during the cyanobacteria bloom in july 2018 to biweekly monthly during cold seasons oct 2018 feb 2019 water chemistry variables total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorus tp soluble reactive phosphorus srp and silicon si concentrations were measured in the laboratory using standard methods table s1 volume weighted concentrations were calculated for the whole water column during mixing and separately for the epilimnion and hypolimnion during the stratified period secchi depth z secchi was measured manually using a secchi disk in addition the thermistor chain captured water temperatures at 15 depths table s1 every 15 minutes moreover we used a multi parameter probe to manually capture vertical profiles of temperature electrical conductivity salinity ph turbidity oxygen and chlorophyll a fluorescence and a multi channel fluorescence probe to determine the phytoplankton composition in terms of specific chlorophyll fluorescence from diatoms green algae cryptophytes and cyanophytes beutler et al 2002 water chemistry and probe data were all linearly interpolated from 0 0 m to 9 0 m at 0 5 m intervals and then linearly interpolated to daily resolution in addition we collected phytoplankton samples and fixed them with lugol s solution during the diatom bloom mar 4th 2019 and observed the samples under an inverted microscope to identify the dominant phytoplankton group in addition to manual sampling and profiles a high frequency monitoring buoy measured near surface water conditions every 10 minutes at the bam site in the middle of the lake fig 1 and table s1 a multi parameter probe and a multi channel fluorescence probe were both integrated into the buoy system and permanently suspended at 0 5 m depth for continuous monitoring

circulation period october 2018 to march 2019 we tested the differences of the volume weighted nutrient concentrations before and after the onset of the winter diatom bloom we applied a generalized least squares gls model with a first order autoregressive correlation structure ar 1 to analyze the nutrient time series data against a binary variable as the proxy of the winter diatom bloom 0 no bloom 1 bloom the gls model was implemented in r r core team 2018 using the function gls in package nlme pinheiro et al 2012 2 4 physical characteristics evaluation water surface temperature was estimated as the mean value in the upper 1 m layer at 0 0 and 1 0 m depth and bottom temperature as the mean value measured at 6 5 and 7 5 m around the mean depth 6 7 m the onset and end of lake stratification was considered as the start and end of the longest period in the year with a temperature difference higher than 1 c between the surface and bottom shatwell and köhler 2019 thermocline

lake depth when the lake was isothermal and the thermocline depth when the lake was stratified shatwell and köhler 2019 z secchi was linearly interpolated over time between measurements to the daily scale and the light extinction coefficient ε m 1 was calculated from z secchi as ε 2 05 z secchi obtained from similar waterbodies in germany shatwell et al 2016 the mean daily underwater light

thickness from november 2018 to april 2019 using the one dimensional bulk hydrodynamic model flake a process based model to simulate lake thermal regimes kirillin et al 2011 mironov 2008 the model consists of two water layers representing the simplified vertical structure of the water column including the ice cover shatwell et al 2019 flake has been widely used especially in numerical weather prediction and climate research and is readily applicable for lakes with different conditions kirillin et al 2017 shatwell et al 2019 thiery et al 2014 model inputs included air temperature c vapor pressure mb wind speed m s 1 cloud cover and solar incoming radiation w m 2 obtained from the dwd described above vapor pressure was calculated as the product of saturated vapor pressure calculated from air temperature according to tabata 1973 and relative humidity the second approach aimed at simulating phytoplankton dynamics during the winter diatom bloom to elucidate the underlying mechanisms a lake ecological model fig 2 was developed to simulate phytoplankton growth and the competition between species that typically dominate lowland hyper eutrophic german lakes in spring the model is zero dimensional and is valid for a mixed water column or water layer the state variables in the model include p and si both dissolved in water and stored in sediment biovolume of two diatoms stephanodiscus minutulus and nitzschia acicularis and one cyanobacterium limnothrix redekei as well as the biovolume quota of p within each species of algae the model assumed a constant fraction of si in the two diatom species as observed in experimental data s minutulus is a centric diatom usually dominating in early spring which is a strong competitor for si a low temperature short photoperiod specialist and specially adapted to early spring conditions n acicularis is a late spring pennate diatom a p specialist and grows rapidly under optimal conditions l redekei is a late spring cyanobacterium which grows much slower than both diatoms but is a superior competitor under p limitation nicklisch 1999 and has no si requirements all three species are well adapted to low light conditions with a low light compensation point and high light use efficiency see table s2 compared to other common species reynolds 2006 the model accounted for the species specific 3 way interactions between temperature photoperiod and the respective limiting resources light phosphorus and silicon it could thus determine e g the relative contribution of different factors in constraining growth rates model parameters related to growth kinetics light absorption nutrient and chlorophyll content were calculated directly from culture experimental data at high accuracy foy 1983 gibson and foy 1983 kohl and giersdorf 1991 nicklisch 1992 nicklisch and kohl 1989 nicklisch et al 1991 shatwell et al 2013 shatwell et al 2014 shatwell et al 2012 table s2 and s3 inputs to the model include mean light availability water temperature effective photoperiod and mixed layer depth all at daily intervals during the simulation period jan 1st to mar 31st 2019 the model is written in r r core team 2018 and solved using the package desolve soetaert et al 2010 details of the model are explicitly described in the supporting information si text 3 results 3 1 occurrence of the winter diatom bloom we observed a massive algal bloom during feb and mar 2019 with a maximum chlorophyll concentration up to 93 4 μg l 1 on mar 1st fig 3 while the chlorophyll a fluorescence was unable to distinguish diatoms and dinoflagellates microscopic inspections revealed that the massive winter algal bloom consisted of small centric diatoms while dinoflagellates were not present on the contrary dinoflagellates were present at high abundance and diatoms were almost absent during summer 2018 the winter diatom bloom reached a concentration that was approximately 1 4 times higher than that in the previous summer when cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates bloomed together maximum 68 4 μg l 1 on september 4th 2018 chlorophyll a fluorescence data from profiles during regular sampling confirmed the occurrence of the winter diatom bloom in 2019 and further revealed that the diatoms were homogeneously distributed in the water column during the bloom fig s2 we considered the first day of the exponential growth of diatoms as the start of the diatom bloom feb 5th fig 4 a and the day with the minimum value before the spring algal development as the end mar 20th fig 3a there were several short term diatom developments during jan 24th to feb 4th 2019 before the bloom started fig 4a 3 2 meteorological and lake physical conditions lake barleber was ice covered from jan 14th to feb 4th 2019 just before the winter bloom approximately two thirds of the surface area measured data showed that water temperature started to decline from the start of ice cover throughout the water column following the decline in air temperature that fell below zero fig 4b water temperatures from the surface to the bottom were below 4 c and demonstrated intermittent inverse stratification from jan 15th to feb 4th fig 3c the inverse stratification was transient and restricted to the upper 1 m of the water column suggesting incomplete ice cover with changing ice thickness and coverage area over time this inference was further supported by predictions of ice thickness from the 1d hydrodynamic model flake fig 4c and s3 the model indicated two periods with ice cover on the lake one at the end of january and the other at the beginning of february with an ice thickness up to 0 7 cm this is an estimation of the average ice thickness across the lake surface without considering the spatial heterogeneity in addition there was frequent snowfall during the ice cover period fig 4c that could have profound effects on light under ice taken together we concluded that the lake was at least partially covered by ice during jan 14th to feb 4th 2019 with relatively low ice thickness it is thus reasonable to reduce the light below water surface during ice cover by a factor of 0 5 to calculate the mean water column light intensity im fig 4d the diatom bloom started immediately after ice thaw in parallel with changes in lake physical conditions including an increase in air and water temperature light intensity termination of inverse stratification and onset of deep recirculation fig 3 and 4 the lake was well mixed and isothermal during the diatom bloom except for short term heating and cooling on the surface and stratification started soon after the diatom bloom collapsed fig 3b furthermore light intensity fluctuated around the critical value of 1 3 mol m2 day 1 before the onset of the diatom bloom fig 4d and stayed mostly above the critical value afterwards 3 3 water quality the lake was hyper eutrophic due to high tp concentrations mean 0 42 mg l 1 with a range of 0 05 0 71 mg l 1 during the study period june 2018 to june 2019 the system was p limited in winter with dissolved inorganic nitrogen din total phosphorus tp ratios of 2 3 to 3 1 1 6 as the threshold dolman et al 2016 except for no3 n concentrations of other nutrients were all significantly lower after the onset of the diatom bloom p 0 05 table 1 fig s4 data for si concentrations were not directly available before the onset of the diatom bloom but si concentration in the previous november sampling reached 1 55 mg l 1 after the bloom si decreased to 0 05 mg l 1 close to the detection limit 0 02 mg l 1 the decline was also pronounced for srp from 337 to 242 μg l 1 and ammonium from 0 76 to 0 17 mg l 1 furthermore we observed changes in multiple water quality variables in parallel with the diatom bloom fig s5 oxygen level increased rapidly to a maximum concentration of 23 1 mg l 1 and saturation of 182 5 in the middle of the bloom meanwhile there was an increase in ph throughout the water column 8 41 9 13 pointing to high photosynthetic activity 3 4 ecological modeling model predictions of nutrients and various water quality proxies fit nicely to the field observations with low root mean square error rmse and high correlation coefficient r values fig 5 the model predicted that rather than large pennate diatoms n acicularis and cyanobacteria l redekei small centric diatoms as represented by s minutulus would dominate the phytoplankton community during the bloom fig 6 a which was also consistent with observations dissolved p in the model prediction was consumed rapidly during the bloom but was not shown in the observations implying that the model might have underestimated relevant processes for p cycling such as sediment mineralization and release the model clearly showed that abrupt silicon limitation and subsequent sedimentation losses terminated the bloom the model further indicated that rather than a single trigger of light an increase of both water temperature and light intensity interactively initiated the diatom bloom fig 6b before the bloom constraint mainly by temperature and light together reduced the net growth rate of s minutulus from the maximum 1 3 d 1 to a level fluctuating around zero fluctuations of net growth rate on certain days were most likely attributed to cloudiness as shown in fig s1c for global radiation then a period with continuous positive net growth rate initiated the diatom bloom implying that constraints from temperature and light intensity were both weakened effective photoperiod showed little effect except for the period with the peak diatom biomass beginning of march after the biomass peak limitation by si depletion became dominant and drove the bloom to the end inner panel of fig 6b our model therefore revealed a complex interplay of factors including temperature light and nutrients in driving the winter diatom bloom 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms of the winter diatom bloom both our analyses of field data and modeling outcomes suggest different mechanisms for driving the diatom blooms in winter than in spring winter diatom assemblages under ice covered lakes are primarily driven by high photosynthetic efficiency and a stable water column d souza et al 2013 spaulding and baron 1993 besides light is particularly emphasized in the peg model as the key factor triggering the spring phytoplankton buildup following the concept of critical mixing depth sverdrup 1953 the onset of stratification in deeper lakes 30m in depth typically brings an order of magnitude increase in light availability serving as a light switch of the diatom bloom sommer et al 2012 in shallower lakes the spring bloom can begin before the onset of thermal stratification during the winter circulation period when lakes are typically mixed to the bottom in addition the revised version of the peg model specifically states that temperature is unimportant for winter phytoplankton dynamics sommer et al 2012 this is based on the fact that dominant algal species in winter are usually well adapted to cold conditions experimental studies further show that water temperature has little effect on the initial slope of algal growth light and photosynthesis light curves under low light conditions davison 1991 foy 1983 talling 1957 because photochemical rather than enzymatic processes are rate limiting this has led to the view that temperature is unimportant but this conclusion neglects the interaction between temperature and light low temperatures decrease the threshold at which light becomes limiting nicklisch et al 2008 so that light may be close to growth saturating even at the low intensities that occur in winter in temperate lakes the interaction therefore increases the relative importance of temperature accordingly higher growth rates can only be achieved by simultaneously increasing light and temperature and thus both factors must be considered as co limiting here we define limiting in terms of growth rates rather than in terms of biomass which can only be limited by true resources like light and nutrients based on the modeling which disentangled the individual effects of temperature and light we found that both factors are important to the diatom bloom and the bloom was most likely initiated by a complex interaction of them fig 6b we further supported this finding by projecting the observed water temperatures and light values during the bloom over the isoclines of equal specific growth rate at 0 2 d 1 as a typical value during the bloom estimated by the model fig 7 a we found that the points showing the water temperature and light intensity in the water column during jan 1st and mar 20th 2019 were distributed along both limbs of the isoclines suggesting constraints from both factors the isocline for s minutulus is closest to the origin around the points showing that this species can achieve the same growth rate as the other species at lower light and temperature this reflects its specific adaptation to these conditions and explains why this species dominates in the model during the cold periods in addition specifically for s minutulus we compared the relative strength of the growth constraint by both light energy and temperature before and during the bloom using the constraint vector μ i μ t fig 7b based on the model estimations fig 7c e we found that the arrows representing the constraint vector demonstrated both vertical and horizontal directions fig 7b implying that both factors played a role in driving the diatom bloom this method further categorized the light and temperature condition field into either light constraint or temperature constraint accordingly light and temperature alternatively acted as the major constraint on the growth of s minutulus before the onset of the bloom fig 6b then at the exponential growth stage of the diatom temperature constrained the growth on most days as an increase in temperature would have brought a greater increase in growth rate of s minutulus than an increase in light this is evident for conditions where the arrows are almost vertical showing that light energy plays a minor role interestingly light was strongly constraining only on some overcast days as shown by arrows with a large horizontal component we further proposed that water temperature contributed to the onset of the winter diatom bloom both directly and indirectly the direct effects were physiological and allowed higher growth rates of diatoms fig 6b the indirect effects included driving the ice thaw and water mixing which were likely more pronounced the lake became fully mixed after ice thaw allowing for rapid increase in both light intensity and water temperature growth limitation on the diatoms was therefore weakened which initiated exponential growth our results therefore highlight the fundamental role of water temperature in driving winter diatom blooms which can be considered as an auxiliary switch altogether the physical environment is important for the onset of winter diatom bloom rather than simply the amount of light we found that nutrients were not limiting at the beginning of the bloom but si limitation ultimately terminated the bloom this was indicated by both nutrient data fig s4 and the modeling results fig 6b though ammonium was almost depleted at the end of the bloom diatoms may use nitrate as an alternative nitrogen source for growth so that the bloom was unlikely terminated by n limitation moreover srp concentrations during the bloom were too high 200 µg l 1 to indicate p limitation of phytoplankton results from an experimental study shatwell et al 2013 implied that the initial si concentration of 1 5 mg l 1 would be far above the range for si limited growth of both diatom species before the diatom bloom the apparent half saturation constant in the monod model of specific growth rates was about 0 025 and 0 046 mg l 1 for s minutulus and n acicularis respectively across various conditions of temperature 5 20 c and photoperiod 6 12 h d 1 the reduction of si concentration from 1 5 to 0 05 mg l 1 fully complied with the increase of diatom biomass and also suggested limitation by si fig 6b mostly the emergence of grazers köhler et al 2005 lampert et al 1986 sommer et al 2012 or parasitism particularly by chytrids frenken et al 2017 ibelings et al 2011 are responsible for terminating spring diatom blooms though we cannot exclude these factors because we neither observed nor modeled the abundance of grazers or chytrids we assume that silicon limitation and sedimentation played the major role the onset of silicon limitation is usually abrupt and recycling is slow at low temperature if there is no external supply of fresh silicon the diatom biomass can no longer increase and the bloom is inevitably terminated the model suggested that the bloom dynamics could be explained entirely by abiotic factors and that diatoms grew exponentially during the bloom as in a batch culture without signals of grazing fig 6a si limitation was apparently predominating in the end of the bloom fig 6b in fact we think the absence of significant losses due to grazing or parasitism facilitated the high peak biomass close to the limit set by complete incorporation of available silicon previous studies also demonstrate that grazing pressure decreases and si limitation increases when diatom blooms occur earlier for instance due to climate warming shatwell et al 2008 thackeray et al 2008 winder and schindler 2004 4 2 composition of the diatom bloom we observed that small centric species similar to stephanodiscus spp dominated the winter diatom bloom in lake barleber modeling results also suggest that stephanodiscus spp may outcompete other species e g n acicularis in winter fig 6a this finding is against our expectation that winter diatom blooms are typically dominated by large diatoms such as aulacoseria spp as observed in many other lake systems horn et al 2011 yang et al 2016 these large species display a combination of traits that mediate high competitive abilities including low light and low temperature adaptation accumulation of nutrient reserves and strong benthic pelagic coupling that allow them to form a considerable winter inoculum in deep water jewson et al 2010 lewandowska et al 2015 winter inoculum is the key for the domination of large diatoms because in this way they can establish priority and build up nutrient reserves to outcompete other species gibson 1981 padisák et al 2003 however in lake barleber nutrients particularly p were abundant and the nutrient storage capabilities of large rather slow growing diatom species like aulacoseira spp may not provide a significant advantage moreover small fast growing species such as stephanodiscus spp are probably stronger competitors under si limitation kilham et al 1986 shatwell et al 2013 in addition a sensitivity analysis of the model to the sinking velocity assigned to 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 m d 1 of the two diatom species s minutulus and n acicularis demonstrated marginal effects of sinking velocity on the ecological dynamics during winter 2019 in lake barleber fig s6 implying that the dominance of s minutulus was attributed more to the other competitive advantages such as si uptake and adaptation to low photoperiod it is noteworthy that diatom blooms dominated by stephanodiscus spp in mild winters were also observed in the polymictic and eutrophic lake müggelsee berlin germany with a mean depth of 4 9 m shatwell et al 2008 taken together in hyper eutrophic lakes with shallow to intermediate depth such as lake barleber the winter diatom assemblage is more likely dominated by small centric species 4 3 merits and limitations of the methodology we demonstrate high resolution monitoring as an effective tool to refine the recognition of limnological phenomena and to unravel new mechanisms the high frequency data on water temperature profiles water quality and phytoplankton community provide a unique opportunity to investigate the comprehensive picture of the short term winter phytoplankton dynamics and to evaluate the underlying mechanisms in detail this would be difficult with the data from regular sampling at a biweekly resolution or coarser during cold seasons furthermore we showcase the strength of combining high frequency data with those from regular monitoring as high frequency data cover a fine temporal resolution of a small set of target variables while regular sampling data include a more comprehensive set of variables but at a relatively low frequency our dataset inevitably contains gaps e g missing ice data and si concentrations before the bloom we performed a dual modeling approach to compensate for such weakness and to provide more insights on the mechanisms driving the diatom bloom agreement between the model outputs and the observations were primarily attributable to the following reasons first the model configuration represented the majority of physical and ecological components and processes in the lake that were critical during the winter diatom bloom the ecological model explicitly considered a well chosen functional diatom group dominating in the field and the species specific interactions between growth factors light temperature photoperiod and nutrients second all growth parameters for light p si temperature and photoperiod constraint growth were directly measured in laboratory experiments for all species table s2 rather than calibrated or estimated representing a high degree of realism third the models were driven by high quality external forcing data including in situ measurements of in lake physical and chemical conditions altogether the models in the present study were capable of reproducing the dynamics of key processes in the lake so that their predictions of those variables without observations ice thickness and si concentrations could be relied on we therefore see the potential to apply these models as ecological forecasting tools e g with respect to the occurrence of diatom blooms in temperate lakes nevertheless we explicitly focus on winter ecological dynamics so that some processes in the ecological model such as nutrient release from sediment and maximum phosphorus uptake rate are not temperature dependent for simplicity these processes should be coupled to temperature if the model is applied during periods with larger temperature variation or when si p ratios are higher which would be an important step forward for the model improvement in the future 4 4 implications and perspectives our findings for winter diatom blooms would be relevant to other gravel pit and groundwater fed lakes which are globally widespread due to the high demand of gravel and sand 1 7 108 metric tons per year for construction mollema and antonellini 2016 in addition our results may also apply to temperate shallow to medium depth lakes and reservoirs in general fed by surface inflows which supports the phenomenon of diatom growth in winter we further applied the developed ecological model to lake müggelsee natural temperate riverine lake mean depth 4 9m fed by spree river retention time 6 weeks which also supports winter blooms of small centric diatoms shatwell et al 2008 the good model results fig s7 illustrate the general applicability of our findings because the principles in the model about the interactive effects of light and temperature are universal further such winter diatom blooms can occur in oligo and mesotrophic lakes goto et al 2007 and drinking water reservoirs horn et al 2011 provided they are not too deep however the species dominating these blooms and thus their dynamics may differ from the more eutrophic species modeled here deep drinking water reservoirs usually experience typical spring diatom blooms horn et al 2015 wentzky et al 2019 altogether we infer that our results apply in general to temperate eutrophic shallow to moderately deep lakes that can experience mild winters or intermittent ice cover our findings can be valuable for evaluating the impact of climate change on inland freshwater ecosystems with increasing air temperature in a future climate model projections demonstrate higher surface water temperature thereby reducing ice cover and extending the circulation period before stratification for lakes shatwell et al 2019 woolway and merchant 2019 given the important role of water temperature shown here we expect more frequent winter diatom blooms in lake barleber and also in similar temperate lakes in addition the intensity of the diatom bloom could be larger because previous studies have shown that the bloom intensity correlates with the duration of the circulation period horn et al 2011 furthermore earlier ice thaw results in lower temperature for diatom growth which may shift the diatom composition from large pennate to small cold adapted centric species as we found here in lake barleber the dominance of highly edible small centric diatoms rather than their large less edible counterparts was likely to impose knock on effects on the earlier occurrence of zooplankton which possibly altered the seasonal succession of plankton communities the consequences of changing patterns of winter diatom blooms on the lake ecosystem structure and functioning are subject to further investigations 5 conclusions ecological dynamics of temperate lakes in winter are poorly understood because winter was long thought to be dormant and was consequently ignored in most sampling campaigns we examined the occurrence and short term dynamics of a massive winter bloom of diatoms in a german lake which exceeded the annual biomass maximum of the previous year the results showed that this bloom was dominated by small centric diatom species rather than their larger counterparts we demonstrate that temperature can no longer be ignored in winter dynamics but that both temperature and light are decisive we therefore challenge the current paradigm of sole control by light availability on lake phytoplankton growth in winter our new findings were attributed to the combination of regular field sampling in situ high frequency monitoring and modeling of the lake we provide a novel model of the species specific interactive effects of different factors on algal dynamics the model parameters are based on a large set of phytoplankton bioassay data and was implemented without calibration so as to give a high degree of realism and become applicable to temperate lakes in general overall increasing frequency of winter biological activities in lakes such as diatom blooms are inevitable in the context of climate change calling for more insights on the lake winter limnology and their implications on the seasonal succession of biogeochemical and ecological processes notes data and r script for the
