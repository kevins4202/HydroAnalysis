et in large lake wetlands monthly et in the poyang lake wetland during 2008 2017 was estimated by the remote sensing et retrieval model based on a nonparametric approach rs np and the spatio temporal variation of et and the influencing factors were analyzed new hydrological insights for the region the validation revealed the usefulness of the rs np model in a moist region and yielded a relative error of 6 12 in the wet dry season temporally the average yearly et was 884 mm with et p precipitation of 55 65 the monthly et p ratio increased significantly from 40 50 from january to may to 90 130 from july to october et in june was lower by over 20 than that in may and july with the lowest et p value 33 spatially relatively larger and lower et occurred in the northern and southern parts respectively the main factors affecting et variability were downwelling shortwave radiation 2 3 contribution and water area 1 3 contribution at the monthly scale precipitation and surface temperature

linkages with environmental factors in large lake systems graphical abstract ga1 keywords evapotranspiration large lakes poyang lake rs np model environmental factors water budget data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a critical parameter that participated in the hydrologic and energy balance processes liu et al 2016 it is affected by land cover weather and climate dynamics across multiple spatio temporal scales cui et al 2019 ji et al 2021 traditionally et can be observed by pan lysimeter and eddy covariance ec at the point scale pan et al 2017b wang and dickinson 2012 undergoing comprehensive validation remotely sensed products have been widely used to obtain et spatio temporal patterns the main algorithms include the triangle approach surface energy balance system sebs mod16 algorithm remote sensing et retrieval model based on the nonparametric approach rs np etc jia et al 2003 jiang and islam 1999 mu et al 2011 2007 pan et al 2020 su 2002 the associated et products are used to investigate et variations in space and time domains ma et al 2015 wu et al 2013 et is an important variable for water balance accounting in basins especially so in large lake systems however et estimation is generally hindered or subject to large errors in moist regions bian et al 2018 zhao et al 2013 more importantly only a few products can provide spatially and temporally seamless et data over open inland waters in those regions these open waters can contribute substantially to water release from terrestrial surfaces due to large water surface evaporation in this case the inaccurate et data add to the total uncertainty of water balance closure for basins including these lakes given the large contributions of open waters to et the development and validation of new et algorithms are critical especially in moist regions poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china experiences seasonal and interannual variations in water surface area zeng et al 2017 the lake area is a mix of mud flat vegetation and water bodies dronova et al 2011 these changes in the land covered and water covered surface area significantly affect the spatial distribution of et in the lake zhao and liu 2017 more importantly in recent years et varies as a result of a growing number of extreme meteorological and hydrological conditions zhou and liu 2018 accordingly et showed a decreasing trend from 1988 to 2012 on the basis of the ground observations in the lake wen et al 2020 in addition a significant seasonal variation of et was observed over a few years kunstmann et al 2015 li et al 2019 limited by the reliability of et products the details of the et spatio temporal variations differed significantly in various research wang et al 2022 wu et al 2013 therefore an accurate estimation of et is important to evaluate and manage water resources in poyang lake zhao et al 2010 that could in due course provide an important scientific basis for the construction of a potential water conservancy hub project shao et al 2017 in this study monthly et data were estimated in the poyang lake wetland from 2008 to 2017 using the rs np model this model has been previously shown to outperform in arid regions and needs further validation in moist regions pan et al 2016 2017a 2020 in this study the np based et data are validated against an ec site and other et retrieval models in the poyang lake wetland then the spatial and temporal distributions of et are analyzed across the poyang lake wetland finally the influencing factors are investigated at monthly and annual timescales 2 study area and data 2 1 study area as the largest freshwater lake in china poyang lake is located between 113 5 and 118 5 e and 24 5 and 30 0 n and covers the northern part of the poyang lake basin in the middle of the yangtze river basin fig 1 there are large changes in the continuous lake surface area and areas of seasonal inundation mu et al 2022 the inundated area changed from less than 1000 km2 between october and march to more than 3000 km2 between april and september in the wet season the lake is almost covered by water in the dry season grasslands bare mud surfaces and croplands can exist seasonal et variations partly depend on the changing lake surfaces the lake area belongs to a subtropical monsoon climate specifically the lake area experiences the east asian rainy season every year in the conventional meteorological year the subtropical high pressure starts to strengthen and move westward and northward from april and it rains strongly in the poyang lake in june and the precipitation p from april to june can account for 50 of the total precipitation of the year from early july when the subtropical high pressure moves north again the wet season stops and the weather becomes dry shankman et al 2006 wu and zhang 2014 2 2 data the 1 km moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products were selected table 1 including the myd06 cloud temperature and cloud emissivity myd11 land surface emissivity and myd09 reflectance huete et al 2002 menzel and strabala 1997 wan and dozier 1996 these products were acquired from the level 1 and atmosphere archive and distribution system laads the 1 16 resolution land surface temperature air temperature air pressure humidity and surface downwelling shortwave radiation data were obtained from the china meteorological administration land data assimilation system cldas shi 2014 to keep the same spatial resolution the resolution of cldas was resampled to 1 km by nearest neighbor resampling these data were derived from the national meteorological information center of china and were used to estimate et over the poyang lake wetland from 2008 to 2017 at monthly seasonal and annual scales in addition the cldas downwelling shortwave radiation precipitation and surface temperature data were used to analyse the factors that influence et variations the other influencing factor water surface dynamics derived based on a ndvi threshold segmentation approach fan et al 2020 the remotely sensed et data were validated by in situ observations acquired from ec and the water balance analysis was based on era5 land reanalyse product et data were measured at the top of a 38 m tower located on an island sheshan island in the middle of the poyang lake 116 4 e 29 1 n zhao and liu 2018 the site s underlying type is water and bare soil in the dry season and water in the wet season these observations were taken in december 2013 and from january to may 2014 the observations were averaged to an 8 day mean the spatial resolution of the era5 land runoff is 0 1 and this study resampled them to 1 km through the nearest resampling 3 methodology 3 1 et estimation in the np approach proposed by liu et al liu et al 2012a a homogeneous ground surface is assumed to be a macroscopic state system and the hamiltonian potential energy plus kinetic energy is the total energy of this system and taking the surface temperature as the generalized coordinate and partial differentiation of the hamiltonian quantity the sensible heat flux can be obtained and then the latent flux can be obtained according to the energy balance equation based on the np approach the rs np model has been developed to retrieve all sky et at a regional scale pan et al 2017b unlike other remote sensing et retrieval models there are no complex parameterizations of resistances subjectively determined wet day edges and variable empirical coefficients in rs np models in addition the rs np model requires only easily accessible inputs pan et al 2020 in our previous study the rs np model was proposed to estimate et in an arid region liu et al 2012a pan et al 2016 2020 in this study the rs np model was applied to the 8 day et retrieval over the entire land surface in a moist region for the first time monthly yearly and multi year average et data were calculated considering that energy is consumed in the et process et can be represented by latent energy le liu et al 2016 in the rs np model when the underlying surface is the non water le can be expressed as 1 le γ r n g s ε s σ t s 4 t a 4 g s ln t s t a where le is latent heat flux rn is the net radiation gs is surface soil heat flux ta is the air temperature ts is the land surface temperature and εs is the surface emissivity δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure at temperature ta and γ is the psychometric constant for rn it can be expressed as 2 r n 1 α r sd r ld r lu 3 r ld σ ε a t a 4 1 ε a σ ε c t c 4 4 r lu σ ε s t s 4 where rsd is the downwelling shortwave radiation rld is the downwelling longwave radiation rlu is the upwelling longwave radiation α is the surface albedo σ is the stephan boltzmann constant εa is the atmospheric emissivity tc is the cloud temperature and εc is the cloud emissivity for εa it can be expressed as 5 ε a 1 1 46 5 e 0 t a exp 1 2 3 46 5 e 0 t a 1 2 6 e 0 p 1 0 628 q 1 where e0 is the near surface water vapor pressure p is the near surface pressure and q is the relative humidity for gs it can be expressed as 7 g s 0 583 exp 2 13 ndvi r n ndvi 0 g s 0 583 r n ndvi 0 where ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi which can be derived from myd09 reflectance data huete et al 2002 for α and εs they can be expressed as α 0 160 α 1 0 291 α 2 0 243 α 3 0 116 α 4 0 112 α 5 0 081 α 7 8 ε s 0 273 1 778 ε 31 1 807 ε 31 ε 32 1 037 ε 32 9 where α1 α2 α3 α4 α5 and α7 are the reflectance in bands 1 2 3 4 5 and 7 of modis respectively ε31 and ε32 denote the emissivity in bands 31 and 32 of myd11 respectively the surface emissivity under cloudy sky conditions is obtained from that under the closest clear sky conditions when the underlying surface is water the le can be calculated in this equation priestley and taylor 1972 10 le 1 26 δ δ γ rn gs considering that ndvi can eliminate the effects of atmospheric conditions the determination of the underlying surface is based on the method of ndvi threshold in this study acharya et al 2018 fan et al 2020 the threshold of water ndvi is determined by the approach of fan which shows a relatively reliable performance in poyang lake based on the instantaneous le the daily le can be expressed as 11 le daily 1 1 r sd daily le r sd 12 r sd daily t t rise t t set r sd t t set t rise where le daily is the daily average evapotranspiration after time upscaling r sd daily is the daily average shortwave net radiation trise is the time of sunrise and tset is the time of sunset based on daily le the le at a larger temporal scale can be obtained by average in addition to validate the rs np model in the moist region the retrieved le derived from the rs pm algorithm mod16 algorithm and the triangle approach were compared jiang and islam 2001 1999 mu et al 2011 2007 the et retrieved by the mod16 algorithm was called et pm and the et retrieved by the triangle approach was called et pt in this paper similarly the et retrieved by the rs np model was called et np 3 2 the analysis of hysteresis relationships between monthly et and environmental factors the regression was built between monthly et and environmental factors to analyse hysteresis relationships et was plotted as the dependent variable and surface temperature doweling shortwave radiation precipitation and water area was plotted as independent variables for the regression lines respectively the hysteresis index was used to evaluate the hysteresis relationship between monthly et and environmental factors langlois et al 2010 xu et al 2022 when the index value is near 1 the hysteresis relationship is not significant less larger than 1 of the index value means the counter clockwise clockwise delay a farther than 1 index value means a larger hysteresis loop and a more significant hysteresis relationship 3 3 calculation of contribution rate for et to water volume variation to reveal the influence of et error on water storage the monthly water storage was estimated by water area using the linear regression between water area and water volume during the recent 40 years in the way of liu et al 2020a then the monthly variation of water storage can be calculated by the adjacent two months in the study area the monthly et volume was calculated by the rs np model considering the relative error of rs np rs pm and triangle approach at the monthly scale the improvement of the monthly et volume was calculated based on the monthly et volume and the improvement of relative error the contribution rate can be calculated by the rate of the improvement of the monthly et volume to the monthly variation of water storage 3 4 metrics for accuracy assessment bias relative error re and rmse are used to quantify errors in et retrieval bias quantifies the average absolute difference between calculated values si and surface observations oi where i 1 n and n are the numbers of pair data for comparison re is the absolute value of the bias divided by the magnitude of the surface observations rmse is the standard deviation of the calculated values around surface observations pan et al 2015 it represents a combination of standard deviation and bias the rmse represents the sample standard deviation of the differences between calculated values and observed values their definitions are described as follows 13 bias s i o i n 14 re s o o 100 15 rmse i 1 n s i o i 2 n in addition a linear regression approach is used regression was used to analyse the accordance and discrepancy among les the consistency among les is better when the regression line is nearer to the 1 1 line the correlation coefficient r2 slope and intercept of the linear fit between le retrieval and the surface le observations corrections are subsequently obtained 4 results 4 1 evaluation of et estimation the comparison between the observed and 8 day et estimations is shown in fig 2 and table 2 the retrieved et was in relatively satisfactory accordance with the observed et in the wet season with an overall bias rmse and r2 of 1 mm 8 day 3 75 mm month 2 mm 8 day 7 mm month and 0 95 respectively in the dry season the overall bias rmse and r2 retrieved et was 1 99 mm 8 day 7 46 mm month 4 73 mm 8 day 17 73 mm month and 0 49 respectively considering that the average monthly et observation was 100 mm month the relative error of et estimation was only 6 in the wet season and about 12 in the dry season considering the relatively bad performance of the rs pm algorithm and the triangle approach with a larger re of more than 15 the r2 value of around 0 8 in the wet season and lower than 0 45 in the dry season these results demonstrated that our method performed well over the poyang lake wetland during our study period to evaluate et retrieved by rs np in a long time series at a regional scale the annual predicted precipitation was used to compare with the precipitation of cldas during 2008 2017 the predicted precipitation was calculated by the et estimated by rs np models and runoff derived from era5 land in accordance with water balance gibson and edwards 2002 fig 3 indicates that the annual predicted precipitation is considered reliable and the predicted precipitation and the cldas precipitation show a good consistency with the r2 of 0 81 which is better than the predicted precipitation based on mod16 et with the r2 of 0 67 wu et al 2013 therefore compared with mod16 et retrieved by rs np models also has a better performance at a regional scale in a long time series 4 2 spatial temporal variation of et 4 2 1 overall variation fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of multi year et in the poyang lake wetland a large et appeared in the region of the outlet and main channel in the northern part of the poyang lake wetland with a value of more than 1200 mm year a low value less than 600 mm year was observed in the southern part fig 5 illustrates the variation in monthly et over the poyang lake wetland during 2008 2017 the mean et was 884 mm year and it accounts for 61 of precipitation the monthly et generally decreased from 2008 to 2017 for most years et from april to august had a large value which contributed 64 to the yearly value the highest monthly et 173 mm month occurred in july 2013 and the lowest value 14 mm month appeared in january 2008 and 2012 the most drastic variation in monthly et occurred in 2012 with an et fluctuation of 149 mm and the least drastic variation appeared in 2014 with a value of 82 mm 4 2 2 annual variations in et fig 6 shows the interannual variations of et during 2008 2017 the yearly et varied from 789 mm 2017 to 990 mm 2013 the yearly et decreased progressively even though the variation trend of precipitation p is different from that of et the variation trend of the ratio of et to precipitation et p is similar to that of et the largest precipitation 1763 mm appeared in 2012 and the lowest one 1213 mm in 2011 in contrast the ratio of et to precipitation varied from 49 2017 to 77 2013 the ratio was in the range of 55 65 in most of all years similar to the spatial distribution of multi year et the high yearly et was distributed in the northern part and the low value was observed in the southern part fig 7 in 2013 et reached more than 1500 mm year in the northeast part of the lake in 2017 less than 600 mm year was observed in the southern part 4 2 3 monthly variations in et fig 8 shows the multi year average monthly et large et occurred in summer june to august while low et was observed in winter december to february the medium et appeared in spring and autumn in detail the largest value was 138 mm in july while the lowest value was 24 mm in january generally a single peak and valley of multi year monthly et were observed due to the large discrepancy in precipitation between the rainy season and the dry season the variation pattern of the et p was different from that of et from july to november high ratio values over 90 were common and the largest ratio value was up to 130 in october the ratio values decreased dramatically to 36 in november when water volume decreased rapidly in poyang lake wu and liu 2015 after that the ratio value increased by 70 in december from january to may the ratio values were kept between 40 50 different from the conventional understanding of monotone increase of et from may to july in the subtropical zone of the northern hemisphere liu et al 2012b the et in june was lower than those in may and july by larger than 20 in poyang lake wetland similarly the lowest et p value 33 was also observed in june when the ratio varied considerably before and after this month similar to the spatial distribution of multi year et high et was distributed in the northern part and low value appeared in the southern part fig 9 in july et with a value larger than 180 mm dominated most parts of the northern area of the poyang lake wetland in january et with a value of approximately 10 mm month appeared in most parts of the lake except for a small part of the northeast area of the poyang lake wetland 5 discussion 5 1 influencing factors to analyse the influencing factors of et variation surface temperature downwelling shortwave radiation inundated area percentage water area and precipitation were regressed with et at the annual and monthly scale after the normalization of the annual et and factors the multiple linear regression is listed here y 1 0 23 x 1 0 43 x 2 0 09 x 3 0 39 x 4 where y1 x1 x2 x3 and x4 are the annual et surface temperature downwelling shortwave radiation precipitation and inundated area percentage respectively at the annual scale the main affecting factors were downwelling shortwave radiation and inundated area percentage with both near to 40 contribution to et variation surface temperature also showed a non main influencing factor of et variation with near 20 contribution the large contributions of radiation and surface temperature to annual et were also reported in other studies wang et al 2022 at the monthly scale the multiple linear regression of the normalization of monthly et and factors is y 2 0 04 x 5 0 61 x 6 0 06 x 7 0 34 x 8 where y2 x5 x6 x7 and x8 are the monthly et surface temperature downwelling shortwave radiation precipitation and water area respectively obviously at the monthly scale the downwelling shortwave was the dominant influencing factor of et variation with near to two thirds parts of the contribution to et variation while water area contributed to near to one third part of et variation at the monthly scale a similar large contribution of inundated area percentage was also reported in other studies zhao and liu 2014 in addition the influencing factors that the et in june was lower than those in may and july were analyzed in fig 10 this result is likely related to the east asian rainy season in june in the poyang lake wetland in this period about june the surface temperature and water area were larger than those in may and they were also less than those in july however the precipitation in june was significantly larger than that in may and july accordingly the solar radiation is relatively low in june and affects the energy support of et an et al 2000 bian et al 2018 wu and zhang 2014 therefore surface temperature and water area were not the dominant influencing factors the relatively low solar radiation caused by the rainy season cloud was probably the dominant factor affecting the low et in june 5 2 hysteresis relationships between monthly et and environmental factors based on ground observations hysteresis relationships between hourly et and environmental factors were observed in the poyang lake wetland according to other research at the point scale cui et al 2020 zhang and werner 2015 to evaluate the hysteresis relationships at a larger temporal and spatial scale the regression between monthly et and environment factors was analysed at the regional scale fig 11 even though precipitation is not the main affecting factor of et at the monthly scale there is still a significant hysteresis relationship between monthly et and precipitation with a hysteresis index value of 0 61 a counter clockwise loop appeared and it implied the precipitation affects the et several months later furthermore the et lag time to precipitation was 1 month as indicated in fig 7 this phenomenon is probably attributed to the situation that the precipitation falls into the lake and it is gathered into the lake in a period in summary there is also a hysteresis loop of precipitation and water storage which is related to the water area in the poyang lake wetland huang et al 2017 considering that the water area affected the monthly et significantly in the current month the precipitation possibly affected the monthly et one month later furthermore there is another hysteresis relationship between monthly et and surface temperature was also revealed in fig 10 with a clockwise loop hysteresis index value 1 20 the similar clockwise loop between hourly et and surface temperature was also discovered at the point scale in other studies cui et al 2020 in addition there is no obvious hysteresis relationship between monthly le and downwelling shortwave radiation water area hysteresis index value of 0 99 and 1 05 respectively 5 3 the influence of et error on water storage to reveal the influence of et error on water storage the monthly water storage was estimated by water area in the way of liu et al 2020b then the improvement of et with re decrease of 9 will decrease the error of evaporated water volume in the lake with a range of 54 310 km3 month considering the water volume in poyang lake with the range of 68 150 km3 month the improvement of et estimation account for the water volume with the range of 55 278 which means the improvement of et estimation is prominently larger than the lake s water volume change feng et al 2011 sun et al 2021 zhan et al 2016 hence it is implied that the improvement of et estimation is prominently beneficial for the significant improvement of the evaluation of the water budget in poyang lake wetland even though that et is regarded as negligible compared with the runoff to the lake in some papers feng et al 2011 2012 neculau et al 2016 thus the rs np model helped not only the accurate et estimation but also the comprehensive evaluation of the water budget 6 conclusions to investigate et variations over the poyang lake wetland during 2008 2017 et was retrieved based on modis and cldas data using the rs np model results showed that the rs np model was successfully applied to the et estimation in moist regions for the first time compared with other et retrieval models et estimated by the rs np model showed satisfactory accuracy with the re of 6 in the wet season and 12 in the dry season and could capture et variation patterns furthermore the improvement of et estimation will account for more than half of the lake s volume which is a significant improvement in the evaluation of the water budget based on the et estimation temporally the yearly et varied from 799 to 987 mm year average 884 mm year the annual et p values were 55 65 at most of the years on the monthly scale et varied from 24 mm to 137 mm the monthly et p values change drastically from 40 50 january to may to 90 130 july to october then decreased dramatically to 36 in november et in june was lower by over 20 than that in may and july and the lowest et p value 33 also appeared in june which is probably related to the sharp decrease of downwelling shortwave radiation due to the east asia monsoon spatially large et occurred in the northern part of the poyang lake wetland while low et existed in the southern part owing to water surface distribution at the annual scale the main affecting factors of et are downwelling shortwave radiation inundated area percentage and surface temperature with the contribution of near to 40 40 and 20 respectively downwelling shortwave radiation and water area are among the most influencing factors that affect et on the monthly scale with the contribution of 2 3 and 1 3 respectively monthly et shows a counter clockwise loop with precipitation and a clockwise loop with surface temperature with a lag time of one month these findings show the applicability of the rs np model in the moist region and offer a comprehensive understanding of et variations and affecting factors in the poyang lake wetland especially for the influence of east asia monsoon and the hysteresis relationship between et and environmental factors at the regional scale author

7680,study region poyang lake wetland study focus evapotranspiration et is a critical parameter in the hydrologic and energy budget and it is important for understanding spatio temporal variations in et in large lake wetlands monthly et in the poyang lake wetland during 2008 2017 was estimated by the remote sensing et retrieval model based on a nonparametric approach rs np and the spatio temporal variation of et and the influencing factors were analyzed new hydrological insights for the region the validation revealed the usefulness of the rs np model in a moist region and yielded a relative

data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a critical parameter that participated in the hydrologic and energy balance processes liu et al 2016 it is affected by land cover weather and climate dynamics across multiple spatio temporal scales cui et al 2019 ji et al 2021 traditionally et can be observed by pan lysimeter and eddy covariance ec at the point scale pan et al 2017b wang and dickinson 2012 undergoing comprehensive validation remotely sensed products have been widely used to obtain et spatio temporal patterns the main algorithms include the triangle approach surface energy balance system sebs mod16 algorithm remote sensing et retrieval model based on the nonparametric approach rs np etc jia et al 2003 jiang and islam 1999 mu et al 2011 2007 pan et al 2020 su 2002 the associated et products are used to investigate et variations in space and time domains ma et al 2015 wu et al 2013 et is an important variable for water balance accounting in basins especially so in large lake systems however et estimation is generally hindered or subject to large errors in moist regions bian et al 2018 zhao et al 2013 more importantly only a few products can provide spatially and temporally seamless et data over open inland waters in those regions these open waters can contribute substantially to water release from terrestrial surfaces due to large water surface evaporation in this case the inaccurate et data add to the total uncertainty of water balance closure for basins including these lakes given the large contributions of open waters to et the development and validation of new et algorithms are critical especially in moist regions poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china experiences seasonal and interannual variations in water surface area zeng et al 2017 the lake area is a mix of mud flat vegetation and water bodies dronova et al 2011 these changes in the land covered and water covered surface area significantly affect the spatial distribution of et in the lake zhao and liu 2017 more importantly in recent years et varies as a result of a growing number of extreme meteorological and hydrological conditions zhou and liu 2018 accordingly et showed a decreasing trend from 1988 to 2012 on the basis of the ground observations in the lake wen et al 2020 in addition a significant seasonal variation of et was observed over a few years kunstmann et al 2015 li et al 2019 limited by the reliability of et products the details of the et spatio temporal variations differed significantly in various research wang et al 2022 wu et al 2013 therefore an accurate estimation of et is important to evaluate and manage water resources in poyang lake zhao et al 2010 that could in due course provide an important scientific basis for the construction of a potential water conservancy hub project shao et al 2017 in this study monthly et data were estimated in the poyang lake wetland from 2008 to 2017 using the rs np model this model has been previously shown to outperform in arid regions and needs further validation in moist regions pan et al 2016 2017a 2020 in this study the np based et data are validated against an ec site and other et retrieval models in the poyang lake wetland then the spatial and temporal distributions of et are analyzed across the poyang lake wetland finally the influencing factors are investigated at monthly and annual timescales 2 study area and data 2 1 study area as the largest freshwater lake in china poyang lake is located between 113 5 and 118 5 e and 24 5 and 30 0 n and covers the northern part of the poyang lake basin in the middle of the yangtze river basin fig 1 there are large changes in the continuous lake surface area and areas of seasonal inundation mu et al 2022 the inundated area changed from less than 1000 km2 between october and march to more than 3000 km2 between april and september in the wet season the lake is almost covered by water in the dry season grasslands bare mud surfaces and croplands can exist seasonal et variations partly depend on the changing lake surfaces the lake area belongs to a subtropical monsoon climate specifically the lake area experiences the east asian rainy season every year in the conventional meteorological year the subtropical high pressure starts to strengthen and move westward and northward from april and it rains strongly in the poyang lake in june and the precipitation p from april to june can account for 50 of the total precipitation of the year from early july when the subtropical high pressure moves north again the wet season stops and the weather becomes dry shankman et al 2006 wu and zhang 2014 2 2 data the 1 km moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products were selected table 1 including the myd06 cloud temperature and cloud emissivity myd11 land surface emissivity and myd09 reflectance huete et al 2002 menzel and strabala 1997 wan and dozier 1996 these products were acquired from the level 1 and atmosphere archive and distribution system laads the 1 16 resolution land surface temperature air temperature air pressure humidity and surface downwelling shortwave radiation data were obtained from the china meteorological administration land data assimilation system cldas shi 2014 to keep the same spatial resolution the resolution of cldas was resampled to 1 km by nearest neighbor resampling these data were derived from the national meteorological information center of china and were used to estimate et over the poyang lake wetland from 2008 to 2017 at monthly seasonal and annual scales in addition the cldas downwelling shortwave radiation precipitation and surface temperature data were used to analyse the factors that influence et variations the other influencing factor water surface dynamics derived based on a ndvi threshold segmentation approach fan et al 2020 the remotely sensed et data were validated by in situ observations acquired from ec and the water balance analysis was based on era5 land reanalyse product et data were measured at the top of a 38 m tower located on an island sheshan island in the middle of the poyang lake 116 4 e 29 1 n zhao and liu 2018 the site s underlying type is water and bare soil in the dry season and water in the wet season these observations were taken in december 2013 and from january to may 2014 the observations were averaged to an 8 day mean the spatial resolution of the era5 land runoff is 0 1 and this study resampled them to 1 km through the nearest resampling 3 methodology 3 1 et estimation in the np approach proposed by liu et al liu et al 2012a a homogeneous ground surface is assumed to be a macroscopic state system and the hamiltonian potential energy plus kinetic energy is the total energy of this system and taking the surface temperature as the generalized coordinate and partial differentiation of the hamiltonian quantity the sensible heat flux can be obtained and then the latent flux can be obtained according to the energy balance equation based on the np approach the rs np model has been developed to retrieve all sky et at a regional scale pan et al 2017b unlike other remote sensing et retrieval models there are no complex parameterizations of resistances subjectively determined wet day edges and variable empirical coefficients in rs np models in addition the rs np model requires only easily accessible inputs pan et al 2020 in our previous study the rs np model was proposed to estimate et in an arid region liu et al 2012a pan et al 2016 2020 in this study the rs np model was applied to the 8 day et retrieval over the entire land surface in a moist region for the first time monthly yearly and multi year average et data were calculated considering that energy is consumed in the et process et can be represented by latent energy le liu et al 2016 in the rs np model when the underlying surface is the non water le can be expressed as 1 le γ r n g s ε s σ t s 4 t a 4 g s ln t s t a where le is latent heat flux rn is the net radiation gs is surface soil heat flux ta is the air temperature ts is the land surface temperature and εs is the surface emissivity δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure at temperature ta and γ is the psychometric constant for rn it can be expressed as 2 r n 1 α r sd r ld r lu 3 r ld σ ε a t a 4 1 ε a σ ε c t c 4 4 r lu σ ε s t s 4 where rsd is the downwelling shortwave radiation rld is the downwelling longwave radiation rlu is the upwelling longwave radiation α is the surface albedo σ is the stephan boltzmann constant εa is the atmospheric emissivity tc is the cloud temperature and εc is the cloud emissivity for εa it can be expressed as 5 ε a 1 1 46 5 e 0 t a exp 1 2 3 46 5 e 0 t a 1 2 6 e 0 p 1 0 628 q 1 where e0 is the near surface water vapor pressure p is the near surface pressure and q is the relative humidity for gs it can be expressed as 7 g s 0 583 exp 2 13 ndvi r n ndvi 0 g s 0 583 r n ndvi 0 where ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi which can be derived from myd09 reflectance data huete et al 2002 for α and εs they can be expressed as α 0 160 α 1 0 291 α 2 0 243 α 3 0 116 α 4 0 112 α 5 0 081 α 7 8 ε s 0 273 1 778 ε 31 1 807 ε 31 ε 32 1 037 ε 32 9 where α1 α2 α3 α4 α5 and α7 are the reflectance in bands 1 2 3 4 5 and 7 of modis respectively ε31 and ε32 denote the emissivity in bands 31 and 32 of myd11 respectively the surface emissivity under cloudy sky conditions is obtained from that under the closest clear sky conditions when the underlying surface is water the le can be calculated in this equation priestley and taylor 1972 10 le 1 26 δ δ γ rn gs considering that ndvi can eliminate the effects of atmospheric conditions the determination of the underlying surface is based on the method of ndvi threshold in this study acharya et al 2018 fan et al 2020 the threshold of water ndvi is determined by the approach of fan which shows a relatively reliable performance in poyang lake based on the instantaneous le the daily le can be expressed as 11 le daily 1 1 r sd daily le r sd 12 r sd daily t t rise t t set r sd t t set t rise where le daily is the daily average evapotranspiration after time upscaling r sd daily is the daily average shortwave net radiation trise is the time of sunrise and tset is the time of sunset based on daily le the le at a larger temporal scale can be obtained by average in addition to validate the rs np model in the moist region the retrieved le derived from the rs pm algorithm mod16 algorithm and the triangle approach were compared jiang and islam 2001 1999 mu et al 2011 2007 the et retrieved by the mod16 algorithm was called et pm and the et retrieved by the triangle approach was called et pt in this paper similarly the et retrieved by the rs np model was called et np 3 2 the analysis of hysteresis relationships between monthly et and environmental factors the regression was built between monthly et and environmental factors to analyse hysteresis relationships et was plotted as the dependent variable and surface temperature doweling shortwave radiation precipitation and water area was plotted as independent variables for the regression lines respectively the hysteresis index was used to evaluate the hysteresis relationship between monthly et and environmental factors langlois et al 2010 xu et al 2022 when the index value is near 1 the hysteresis relationship is not significant less larger than 1 of the index value means the counter clockwise clockwise delay a farther than 1 index value means a larger hysteresis loop and a more significant hysteresis relationship 3 3 calculation of contribution rate for et to water volume variation to reveal the influence of et error on water storage the monthly water storage was estimated by water area using the linear regression between water area and water volume during the recent 40 years in the way of liu et al 2020a then the monthly variation of water storage can be calculated by the adjacent two months in the study area the monthly et volume was calculated by the rs np model considering the relative error of rs np rs pm and triangle approach at the monthly scale the improvement of the monthly et volume was calculated based on the monthly et volume and the improvement of relative error the contribution rate can be calculated by the rate of the improvement of the monthly et volume to the monthly variation of water storage 3 4 metrics for accuracy assessment bias relative error re and rmse are used to quantify errors in et retrieval bias quantifies the average absolute difference between calculated values si and surface observations oi where i 1 n and n are the numbers of pair data for comparison re is the absolute value of the bias divided by the magnitude of the surface observations rmse is the standard deviation of the calculated values around surface observations pan et al 2015 it represents a combination of standard deviation and bias the rmse represents the sample standard deviation of the differences between calculated values and observed values their definitions are described as follows 13 bias s i o i n 14 re s o o 100 15 rmse i 1 n s i o i 2 n in addition a linear regression approach is used regression was used to analyse the accordance and discrepancy among les the consistency among les is better when the regression line is nearer to the 1 1 line the correlation coefficient r2 slope and intercept of the linear fit between le retrieval and the surface le observations corrections are subsequently obtained 4 results 4 1 evaluation of et estimation the comparison between the observed and 8 day et estimations is shown in fig 2 and table 2 the retrieved et was in relatively satisfactory accordance with the observed et in the wet season with an overall bias rmse and r2 of 1 mm 8 day 3 75 mm month 2 mm 8 day 7 mm month and 0 95 respectively in the dry season the overall bias rmse and r2 retrieved et was 1 99 mm 8 day 7 46 mm month 4 73 mm 8 day 17 73 mm month and 0 49 respectively considering that the average monthly et observation was 100 mm month the relative error of et estimation was only 6 in the wet season and about 12 in the dry season considering the relatively bad performance of the rs pm algorithm and the triangle approach with a larger re of more than 15 the r2 value of around 0 8 in the wet season and lower than 0 45 in the dry season these results demonstrated that our method performed well over the poyang lake wetland during our study period to evaluate et retrieved by rs np in a long time series at a regional scale the annual predicted precipitation was used to compare with the precipitation of cldas during 2008 2017 the predicted precipitation was calculated by the et estimated by rs np models and runoff derived from era5 land in accordance with water balance gibson and edwards 2002 fig 3 indicates that the annual predicted precipitation is considered reliable and the predicted precipitation and the cldas precipitation show a good consistency with the r2 of 0 81 which is better than the predicted precipitation based on mod16 et with the r2 of 0 67 wu et al 2013 therefore compared with mod16 et retrieved by rs np models also has a better performance at a regional scale in a long time series 4 2 spatial temporal variation of et 4 2 1 overall variation fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of multi year et in the poyang lake wetland a large et appeared in the region of the outlet and main channel in the northern part of the poyang lake wetland with a value of more than 1200 mm year a low value less than 600 mm year was observed in the southern part fig 5 illustrates the variation in monthly et over the poyang lake wetland during 2008 2017 the mean et was 884 mm year and it accounts for 61 of precipitation the monthly et generally decreased from 2008 to 2017 for most years et from april to august had a large value which contributed 64 to the yearly value the highest monthly et 173 mm month occurred in july 2013 and the lowest value 14 mm month appeared in january 2008 and 2012 the most drastic variation in monthly et occurred in 2012 with an et fluctuation of 149 mm and the least drastic variation appeared in 2014 with a value of 82 mm 4 2 2 annual variations in et fig 6 shows the interannual variations of et during 2008 2017 the yearly et varied from 789 mm 2017 to 990 mm 2013 the yearly et decreased progressively even though the variation trend of precipitation p is different from that of et the variation trend of the ratio of et to precipitation et p is similar to that of et the largest precipitation 1763 mm appeared in 2012 and the lowest one 1213 mm in 2011 in contrast the ratio of et to precipitation varied from 49 2017 to 77 2013 the ratio was in the range of 55 65 in most of all years similar to the spatial distribution of multi year et the high yearly et was distributed in the northern part and the low value was observed in the southern part fig 7 in 2013 et reached more than 1500 mm year in the northeast part of the lake in 2017 less than 600 mm year was observed in the southern part 4 2 3 monthly variations in et fig 8 shows the multi year average monthly et large et occurred in summer june to august while low et was observed in winter december to february the medium et appeared in spring and autumn in detail the largest value was 138 mm in july while the lowest value was 24 mm in january generally a single peak and valley of multi year monthly et were observed due to the large discrepancy in precipitation between the rainy season and the dry season the variation pattern of the et p was different from that of et from july to november high ratio values over 90 were common and the largest ratio value was up to 130 in october the ratio values decreased dramatically to 36 in november when water volume decreased rapidly in poyang lake wu and liu 2015 after that the ratio value increased by 70 in december from january to may the ratio values were kept between 40 50 different from the conventional understanding of monotone increase of et from may to july in the subtropical zone of the northern hemisphere liu et al 2012b the et in june was lower than those in may and july by larger than 20 in poyang lake wetland similarly the lowest et p value 33 was also observed in june when the ratio varied considerably before and after this month similar to the spatial distribution of multi year et high et was distributed in the northern part and low value appeared in the southern part fig 9 in july et with a value larger than 180 mm dominated most parts of the northern area of the poyang lake wetland in january et with a value of approximately 10 mm month appeared in most parts of the lake except for a small part of the northeast area of the poyang lake wetland 5 discussion 5 1 influencing factors to analyse the influencing factors of et variation surface temperature downwelling shortwave radiation inundated area percentage water area and precipitation were regressed with et at the annual and monthly scale after the normalization of the annual et and factors the multiple linear regression is listed here y 1 0 23 x 1 0 43 x 2 0 09 x 3 0 39 x 4 where y1 x1 x2 x3 and x4 are the annual et surface temperature downwelling shortwave radiation precipitation and inundated area percentage respectively at the annual scale the main affecting factors were downwelling shortwave radiation and inundated area percentage with both near to 40 contribution to et variation surface temperature also showed a non main influencing factor of et variation with near 20 contribution the large contributions of radiation and surface temperature to annual et were also reported in other studies wang et al 2022 at the monthly scale the multiple linear regression of the normalization of monthly et and factors is y 2 0 04 x 5 0 61 x 6 0 06 x 7 0 34 x 8 where y2 x5 x6 x7 and x8 are the monthly et surface temperature downwelling shortwave radiation precipitation and water area respectively obviously at the monthly scale the downwelling shortwave was the dominant influencing factor of et variation with near to two thirds parts of the contribution to et variation while water area contributed to near to one third part of et variation at the monthly scale a similar large contribution of inundated area percentage was also reported in other studies zhao and liu 2014 in addition the influencing factors that the et in june was lower than those in may and july were analyzed in fig 10 this result is likely related to the east asian rainy season in june in the poyang lake wetland in this period about june the surface temperature and water area were larger than those in may and they were also less than those in july however the precipitation in june was significantly larger than that in may and july accordingly the solar radiation is relatively low in june and affects the energy support of et an et al 2000 bian et al 2018 wu and zhang 2014 therefore surface temperature and water area were not the dominant influencing factors the relatively low solar radiation caused by the rainy season cloud was probably the dominant factor affecting the low et in june 5 2 hysteresis relationships between monthly et and environmental factors based on ground observations hysteresis relationships between hourly et and environmental factors were observed in the poyang lake wetland according to other research at the point scale cui et al 2020 zhang and werner 2015 to evaluate the hysteresis relationships at a larger temporal and spatial scale the regression between monthly et and environment factors was analysed at the regional scale fig 11 even though precipitation is not the main affecting factor of et at the monthly scale there is still a significant hysteresis relationship between monthly et and precipitation with a hysteresis index value of 0 61 a counter clockwise loop appeared and it implied the precipitation affects the et several months later furthermore the et lag time to precipitation was 1 month as indicated in fig 7 this phenomenon is probably attributed to the situation that the precipitation falls into the lake and it is gathered into the lake in a period in summary there is also a hysteresis loop of precipitation and water storage which is related to the water area in the poyang lake wetland huang et al 2017 considering that the water area affected the monthly et significantly in the current month the precipitation possibly affected the monthly et one month later furthermore there is another hysteresis relationship between monthly et and surface temperature was also revealed in fig 10 with a clockwise loop hysteresis index value 1 20 the similar clockwise loop between hourly et and surface temperature was also discovered at the point scale in other studies cui et al 2020 in addition there is no obvious hysteresis relationship between monthly le and downwelling shortwave radiation water area hysteresis index value of 0 99 and 1 05 respectively 5 3 the influence of et error on water storage to reveal the influence of et error on water storage the monthly water storage was estimated by water area in the way of liu et al 2020b then the improvement of et with re decrease of 9 will decrease the error of evaporated water volume in the lake with a range of 54 310 km3 month considering the water volume in poyang lake with the range of 68 150 km3 month the improvement of et estimation account for the water volume with the range of 55 278 which means the improvement of et estimation is prominently larger than the lake s water volume change feng et al 2011 sun et al 2021 zhan et al 2016 hence it is implied that the improvement of et estimation is prominently beneficial for the significant improvement of the evaluation of the water budget in poyang lake wetland even though that et is regarded as negligible compared with the runoff to the lake in some papers feng et al 2011 2012 neculau et al 2016 thus the rs np model helped not only the accurate et estimation but also the comprehensive evaluation of the water budget 6 conclusions to investigate et variations over the poyang lake wetland during 2008 2017 et was retrieved based on modis and cldas data using the rs np model results showed that the rs np model was successfully applied to the et estimation in moist regions for the first time compared with other et retrieval models et estimated by the rs np model showed satisfactory accuracy with the re of 6 in the wet season and 12 in the dry season and could capture et variation patterns furthermore the improvement of et estimation will account for more than half of the lake s volume which is a significant improvement in the evaluation of the water budget based on the et estimation temporally the yearly et varied from 799 to 987 mm year average 884 mm year the annual et p values were 55 65 at most of the years on the monthly scale et varied from 24 mm to 137 mm the monthly et p values change drastically from 40 50 january to may to 90 130 july to october then decreased dramatically to 36 in november et in june was lower by over 20 than that in may and july and the lowest et p value 33 also appeared in june which is probably related to the sharp decrease of downwelling shortwave radiation due to the east asia monsoon spatially large et occurred in the northern part of the poyang lake wetland while low et existed in the southern part owing to water surface distribution at the annual scale the main affecting factors of et are downwelling shortwave radiation inundated area percentage and surface temperature with the contribution of near to 40 40 and 20 respectively downwelling shortwave radiation and water area are among the most influencing factors that affect et on the monthly scale with the contribution of 2 3 and 1 3 respectively monthly et shows a counter clockwise loop with precipitation and a clockwise loop with surface temperature with a lag time of one month these findings show the applicability of the rs np model in the moist region and offer a comprehensive understanding of et variations and affecting factors in the poyang lake wetland especially for the influence of east asia monsoon and the hysteresis relationship between et and environmental factors at the regional scale author

7681,study region the datong river source region in the northeast qinghai tibetan plateau study focus climate change and anthropogenic factors are the most important factors influencing runoff land use land cover lulc is an important anthropogenic factor that has a significant impact on runoff changes quantifying runoff variation characteristics and determining the effect of changes in climate and lulc on runoff is important for water resource management and application the mathematical statistics analysis and soil and water assessment tool swat were combined to perform a comprehensive analysis of runoff based on meteorological and hydrological data from the datong river source area and the effect of changes in climate and lulc on runoff was quantitatively calculated new hydrological insights for the region the results indicate that under the warm and humid climate there was a slight change in the inter annual runoff while the distribution of runoff within the year was uneven due to the control of climate factors climate exhibited a positive driving effect on runoff while lulc reduced the runoff and contributed 125 and 25 respectively to the change in the runoff rainfall is the most important climatic factor influencing runoff change it is recommended that the flood tragedy induced by short periods of high rainfall be taken into account during the process of water resource management in the basin graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change lulc swat model datong river source area abbreviations lulc land use land cover swat soil and water assessment

et al 2021 as a readily accessible source of fresh water surface runoff provides the foundation for ecological environment protection and socioeconomic development the influence of global climate change and lulc on hydrology is at the intersection of climatology land resource management and hydrology and is also one of the hottest topics in current scientific research xue et al 2021 guo et al 2022 on the one hand there is now consensus that global warming is caused by natural and man made factors according to the fifth ipcc report published in 2013 the average temperature of the earth s surface has increased by 0 85 during the past 100 years ipcc 2013 various research studies from domestic scholars also show that china s temperature will continue to increase in the future tag et al 2009 wang et al 2022a 2022b climate warming has been found to accelerate the rate of the water cycle which has a great impact on precipitation evaporation runoff and other meteorological and hydrological factors at different spatio temporal scales immerzeel et al 2010 and results in frequent extreme climate hydrological events wu et al 2021 additionally severe anthropogenic factors have altered the underlying surface conditions and water resource allocation process on the spatio temporal scale and significantly affected the soil moisture evapotranspiration and runoff processes in the basin tian et al 2020 therefore it is of great significance for water resources management to clarify the law of hydrological evolution under changing environmental conditions under the influence of global change the hydrological cycle of the land is undergoing a rapid transformation and the hydrological process is exhibiting signs of instability yang et al 2021 on the one hand the qinghai tibet plateau is a region that is susceptible to global climate change and the warming amplitude may be twice that of the surrounding plain area the melting of glaciers and the degradation of frozen soil indicate its feedback influence on hydrological systems various researchers are interested in quantifying hydrological processes and their affecting elements on the qinghai tibet plateau under changing environmental conditions on the other hand with rapid economic development and population growth human activities and changes in lulc have emerged as the primary drivers of land hydrological processes tang et al 2015 understanding the impact of climate and lulc on hydrological changes is also a hot topic and a challenge in recent research zhao et al 2012 guo et al 2014 yuan et al 2015 wang et al 2021a 2021b according to yin et al 2018 climate and lulc will continue to play a significant role in hydrological changes over the next 50 100 years and their effects on runoff will vary by region wang et al 2020a 2020b found that the role of climate in runoff changes has reached 60 in the guijiang river basin li and fang 2021 discovered that precipitation had the greatest impact on hydrological changes in the men river basin of thailand whereas dry season temperature had the strongest impact ahmed et al 2022 revealed that climate change contributed up to 98 to runoff variation at zhimenda basin of the yangtze river alifujiang et al 2021 found that both climatic and anthropogenic factors reduced the annual runoff in the issyk kul lake basin of kyrgyzstan although their contribution rates differed depending on the methodology used the distributed hydrological modeling method has been widely used in the preceding studies due to its comprehensive consideration of spatial heterogeneity and watershed hydrophysical processes chen et al 2020 zeng et al 2021 climate warming interbasin water diversion and grazing bans are among the natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the datong river basin the hydrological process of the basin is unstable and fragile as the primary area of river formation and development the alteration of hydrological features in the river source area has a direct impact on the rational allocation and usage of water resources in the mid lower reaches which is crucial for regional economic development wu et al 2019 the following are the main problems involved in this study 1 what were the climatic and hydrological changes in the basin from 1960 to 2019 2 what were the lulc changes in the basin from 1980 to 2020 3 to what extent do they contribute to variations in the runoff this study employs mathematical statistics analysis and the swat model to investigate the meteorological and hydrological aspects of the datong river source region then the quantitative effects of climate and lulc changes on runoff are investigated the research results are of significant importance for elucidating the runoff evolution law of the datong river source region in the context of climate change for the management of the basin water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the datong river flows into the yellow river via the huangshui river which receives from the muli region at the southern foot of the qilian mountains with a total length of 554 km the river flows from northwest to southeast through nine counties in the provinces of qinghai and gansu liu et al 2016 dong et al 2018 the datong river source area discussed in this study is the area above the qingshizui hydrology station with 2884 m of lowest elevation and 5067 m of highest elevation in the basin which is characterized by high elevation large drop and complex and diverse topography huang et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 the lulc in the basin is primarily consisted of grassland woodland wetland and bare land with grassland accounting for 50 53 of the study area the climate in the study region is primarily influenced by the westerlies the plateau monsoon and the summer monsoon the temperature and precipitation in the basin have altered dramatically due to global warming the precipitation ranged between 300 mm and 550 mm from 1960 to 2019 and the annual average temperature was 0 6 c which has a significant impact on the regional hydrological process the annual runoff of datong river is about 28 95 108 m3 with abundant water resources currently three water diversion projects have been constructed in the basin including the water diversion from datong river to qinwangchuan in 1994 with a design water diversion of 4 43 108 m3 water diversion from liu river to jin in 2003 with a design water diversion of 0 4 108 m3 and water diversion from datong river to huangshui in 2016 with a design water diversion of 3 5 108 m3 furthermore local authorities are also considering diverting water to heihe the west da river in jinchang and qinghai lake liu et al 2016 fig 1 2 2 data collection there are two types of key data for model operation raster data and statistical data raster data includes dem lulc map soil type map and other useful information weather and hydrological data are the most common types of statistical data the weather and hydrological data can be used not only for model operation and verification but also the study of historical meteorological and hydrological laws the details of obtained data are shown in table 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 swat model calibration and validation the swat model is capable of simulating the impact of complex large scale soil types and lulc on hydrology and water resources guo et al 2014 on arcgis 10 2 platform the model can be divided into various hydrological response units hrus based on the topography lulc and soil data of the basin the runoff of each hru was then calculated using the water balance formula and finally the flow of the total outlet section of the basin was obtained the water surface cycle in the swat model can be expressed as arnold et al 1998 1

the model has been established an evaluation of its applicability is required to investigate the hydrological changes in the source region of the datong river wang et al 2020 based on previous

the trend of climate change the anomaly value represents the difference between the measured and average runoff values and the percentage of the anomaly was used to classify runoff abundance and drought grade wang et al 2021a 2021b in addition to measuring the trend of change in climate and hydrological data sets the mann kendall mutation test may also calculate the mutation time fu et al 2018 kendall 1938 mann 1945 ye et al 2013 correlation analysis was used to determine the degree of correlation between different climatic and hydrological elements xu 2002 3 results and analysis 3 1 change characteristics of hydrological and meteorological factors from 1960 2019 the average annual temperature and precipitation in the datong river source area increased with values of 0 6 c and 413 3 mm respectively fig 2 in the last 60 years the average temperature in the datong river source region has increased at a rate of 0 35 c 10a p 0 01 in the datong river source region the average temperature was lowest in 1967 and highest in 2016 1 3 c from a decadal perspective the average temperature exceeded the multi year average in the mid 1990 s and remained above 0 c after the 21st century precipitation in the datong river source region has increased at a rate of 14 02 mm 10a p 0 01 over the previous 60 years with the maximum value 537 8 mm recorded in the basin in the year 2014 only 317 4 mm of precipitation occurred in the basin in 1962 periodic precipitation was also obvious in the study area it was a brief rain period from 1960 to 1980 with an average annual precipitation of 388 mm which was 25 3 mm less than the average precipitation in the last 60 years from 1981 2004 the average annual precipitation was 407 5 mm which is not significantly different from the average precipitation during the previous 60 years from 2005 2019 the average annual precipitation was 458 1 mm which was 44 7 mm greater than the average annual precipitation during the previous 57 years from 1960 2016 the average runoff in the source area of the datong river source area was 15 86 108 m3 with dry season runoff accounting for 12 4 and rainy season runoff accounting for 87 6 as shown in fig 3a the annual runoff reached the lowest value 8 54 108 m3 in 1979 reached the maximum 29 2 108 m3 in 1989 with a range of 20 66 108 m3 and increased with the rate of 0 16 108 m3 10a p 0 1 throughout the study period according to the statistical results of the percentage anomaly fig 3b there were 7 41 and 9 years of high flat and dry runoff in the datong river source area in general there was a slight fluctuation in the annual average runoff in the datong river source between 1960 and 2016 as shown in fig 4 the m k test reveals that the temperature mutation in the datong river source area occurred around 1997 before the mutation the average temperature from 1960 to 1997 was 1 1 c and after the mutation the average temperature from 1998 to 2019 was 0 2 c representing a considerable increase in temperature by analyzing the annual average temperature uf characteristic it can be seen that the uf curve exceeded 0 in 1963 and exceeded the critical curve 1 96 in 1992 indicating that the average temperature began to rise in 1963 and the warming trend became obvious after 1992 the incidence of the precipitation mutation occurred later than the temperature mutation in 2010 compared to the period before the mutation 1960 2010 the increase after the mutation 2011 2019 was 66 2 mm the source region of the datong river did not experience a dramatic change in the runoff 3 2 characteristics of the change in lulc the status and proportion of lulc types in the datong river source area in 1980 2000 and 2020 are presented in table 3 grassland is the predominant lulc type in the datong river source region covering more than 50 followed by bare land which covers approximately 16 other significant lulc types in the research area include wetland forest and water regions cultivated glaciers settlements and other construction land account for less than 1 of the total fig 5 shows the transfer matrices of various types of lulc the purpose of this study is to examine the evolution of the primary lulc types changes in these major lulc types significantly affect the hydrological processes the results indicate that the majority of lulc s transition occurred between 1980 and 2000 with little change between 2000 and 2020 the area of permanent glacier and snow dropped by 7 83 km2 59 7 and bare land decreased by 49 08 km2 3 6 as a result of climate change while the area of water increased by 59 95 km2 17 forest grassland wetland cultivated land and settlement have remained largely unchanged 3 3 simulation of natural runoff process in the 1980 s lulc was used as the initial driving data for the swat model the swat model was preheated from 1960 to 1961 calibrated from 1962 to 1999 and confirmed from 2000 to 2016 data runoff simulation findings in the study region showed r2 ns and pbias of 0 8 0 79 and 1 8 during the calibration period and 0 73 0 73 and 2 1 during the validation period respectively table 4 as shown in fig 6 the observed value and the simulated value of monthly runoff have a similar trend and the overall simulation effect is relatively ideal but there is still some error at the simulated peak these findings demonstrate that the swat model is applicable in the datong river source region where it can be used to simulate the hydrological process and examine its response to climatic and lulc changes 3 4 contribution analysis of runoff change the calibrated swat model was used to quantify the changes in the hydrological process of the datong river source area under various scenarios the model calculation results are shown in table 5 it can be seen that under the constant lulc scenario s1 and s2 s3 and s4 the average runoff from 1981 to 2016 increased by 1 m3 s when compared to 1962 1980 under similar climate conditions s1 and s3 s2 and s4 the average runoff in 2020 will decrease by 0 2 m3 s compared with that in 1980 average runoff changed by 0 8 m3 s due to the combined effect of climate and lulc s1 and s4 in summary the impact of climate on runoff changes accounted for 125 while the impact of lulc was 25 the change in lulc has little effect on runoff in the datong river source area and exhibits a predictable reaction trend these findings demonstrate that climate change exerts a more significant impact than lulc on runoff in the datong river source area 4 discussion 4 1 the influence of meteorological factors on the runoff change the water cycle in the basin is significantly influenced by weather factors such as temperature and precipitation in alpine regions it is commonly considered that temperature recharges rivers by melting ice and snow while precipitation is a substantial contributor to river runoff recharge moreover the temperature has a significant impact on evapotranspiration which helps to reduce runoff yang et al 2017 to further investigate the effect of climate on runoff correlation and multiple regression analyses formula 8 9 of runoff temperature and precipitation factors in the research region were conducted at various time scales fig 7 and table 6 on an inter annual scale the runoff was primarily affected by precipitation the contribution rate is 70 3 p 0 01 while temperature had an adverse effect on runoff this is primarily attributable to the fact that the influence of precipitation on changes in runoff occurred primarily between may and october when precipitation was relatively abundant during this period the proportion of glacier melt water in runoff replenishment is low and the temperature increase has a reduced effect on runoff by affecting evaporation monthly runoff in the study area was found to be positively correlated with the mean minimum temperature 0 however the correlation coefficient between runoff and average maximum temperature was negative from may to october while it was positive with precipitation fig 7 according to table 6 autumn and winter precipitation consists primarily of snowfall and less precipitation additionally some studies wang et al 2020a 2020b found that winter and spring snow in high altitude can be affected by temperature which is comparable with the results of the contribution rate analysis in the present study in summary the temperature has a significant influence on runoff in autumn and winter the annual distribution law of precipitation and runoff was consistent runoff from may to october accounted for 87 6 of the entire year demonstrating that precipitation had the greatest influence on runoff fluctuation and that the influence of precipitation on runoff fluctuation occurred mostly from may to october when precipitation was relatively abundant according to liu et al 2016 the intensification of global warming since the 1990 s has resulted in the continuous upward movement or even disappearance of the snow line in the datong river source area resulting in a significant reduction in runoff the findings show that the influence of temperature on runoff change is reflected in runoff reduction by affecting glacier snow storage and evaporation furthermore global warming appears to intensify glacier melting resulting in changes in river runoff fed by glaciers additionally there is a definite effect on the runoff when the temperature hits a particular threshold 4 2 the influence of anthropogenic on runoff anthropogenic influences on runoff in the datong river basin are primarily due to two factors the first is the reduction in runoff caused by water transfer between basins the basin has three interbasin water diversion projects including the water diversion from datong river to qinwangchuan in 1995 with a design water diversion of 4 43 108 m3 water diversion from liu river to jin river in 2003 with a design water diversion of 0 4 108 m3 and water diversion from datong river to huangshui in 2016 with a design water diversion of 3 5 108 m3 the amount of water extracted from the datong river will increase as production water and living standards improve resulting in a year by year decrease in runoff in the datong river the second point is that changes in surface cover influence runoff fluctuations zhu et al 2020 studied the runoff of the changhua river in an arid area and found that the surface changes caused by large scale cash crop planting construction of large scale water conservancy projects and soil erosion indirectly reduced the changhua river runoff dai et al 2019 found that as urbanization progressed construction land in the qinhuai river basin increased significantly between 1987 and 2013 while vegetation cover decreased weakening the basin s function of regulating runoff and increasing the risk of flooding due to the fact that the datong river source area is within qilian mountain national park and the area has been subject to the strictest protection measures there has not been a significant change in the area s lulc status throughout the study period however the decrease in runoff may be attributable to the corresponding increase in water area as a result of climate change and the obvious reduction of lulc categories susceptible to surface runoff such as bare land in general the inter basin water diversion project of the datong river basin concentrates mostly on the lower part of the qingshizui which has minimal effect on the runoff of the upper reaches therefore the anthropogenic influence on runoff is primarily represented in the change in lulc 4 3 implication for water resource management this study demonstrates that climate is the primary factor of runoff change although lulc change should not be ignored when managing water resources in the basin through human involvement watershed water resources management aims to enhance the rational distribution of water resources and support the basin s sustainable development based on a knowledge of the influence of climate and lulc on runoff change in the datong river source area the management of water resources in the basin can be improved in the following ways 1 take positive measures to deal with potential climate related flood and debris flow disasters the results indicate that the contribution rate of climate change to runoff change is 125 and the runoff is mainly concentrated during the rainy season accounting for 87 6 this is expected to cause flooding for example in 2021 heavy rainfall in qilian county caused floods disrupting traffic and damaging crops 2 continue to implement the cross basin water transfer project under the premise of meeting demand within the basin 3 in the future continue to protect glaciers and maintain fresh water reserves 4 actively promote water saving irrigation technology to improve water resources 5 conclusions based on historical meteorological and hydrological data this study employed the swat model and multiple regression analysis techniques to conduct a quantitative analysis of the causes of runoff changes the following results are obtained 1 the climate of the datong river source area showed a warm and humid trend from 1960 to 2019 the inter annual runoff was relatively stable but the annual runoff varied greatly the dry season and rainy season runoff accounted for 12 4 and 87 6 of the annual runoff respectively 2 grassland is the largest land patch in the datong river source area covering more than 50 except for permanent glaciers and bare land regions which decreased as a result of an increase in temperature and the corresponding increase in the water area there were no substantial changes in other kinds and lulc change was concentrated in the first 20 years 3 climate change and lulc contributed 125 and 25 respectively to the change in runoff in the datong river source region the contribution of rainfall to annual runoff accounted for 70 3 of all meteorological factors with the majority of rainfall occurring during the warm season the cold season temperature has a significant influence on runoff the scientific management of water resources in river basins must consider climate and lulc changes in the context of global change in the future we should actively promote high efficient water saving irrigation technology to further improve the utilization efficiency of water resources simultaneously we should rationally allocate the cross basin water transfer project to promote the sustainable development of the basin furthermore active measures should be taken to deal with the flood disaster caused by climate change while monitoring the water credit authorship contribution statement meiliang zhao

et al 2021 as a readily accessible source of fresh water surface runoff provides the foundation for ecological environment protection and socioeconomic development the influence of global climate change and lulc on hydrology is at the intersection of climatology land resource management and hydrology and is also one of the hottest topics in current scientific research xue et al 2021 guo et al 2022 on the one hand there is now consensus that global warming is caused by natural and man made factors according to the fifth ipcc report published in 2013 the average temperature of the earth s surface has increased by 0 85 during the past 100 years ipcc 2013 various research studies from domestic scholars also show that china s temperature will continue to increase in the future tag et al 2009 wang et al 2022a 2022b climate warming has been found to accelerate the rate of the water cycle which has a great impact on precipitation evaporation runoff and other meteorological and hydrological factors at different spatio temporal scales immerzeel et al 2010 and results in frequent extreme climate hydrological events wu et al 2021 additionally severe anthropogenic factors have altered the underlying surface conditions and water resource allocation process on the spatio temporal scale and significantly affected the soil moisture evapotranspiration and runoff processes in the basin tian et al 2020 therefore it is of great significance for water resources management to clarify the law of hydrological evolution under changing environmental conditions under the influence of global change the hydrological cycle of the land is undergoing a rapid transformation and the hydrological process is exhibiting signs of instability yang et al 2021 on the one hand the qinghai tibet plateau is a region that is susceptible to global climate change and the warming amplitude may be twice that of the surrounding plain area the melting of glaciers and the degradation of frozen soil indicate its feedback influence on hydrological systems various researchers are interested in quantifying hydrological processes and their affecting elements on the qinghai tibet plateau under changing environmental conditions on the other hand with rapid economic development and population growth human activities and changes in lulc have emerged as the primary drivers of land hydrological processes tang et al 2015 understanding the impact of climate and lulc on hydrological changes is also a hot topic and a challenge in recent research zhao et al 2012 guo et al 2014 yuan et al 2015 wang et al 2021a 2021b according to yin et al 2018 climate and lulc will continue to play a significant role in hydrological changes over the next 50 100 years and their effects on runoff will vary by

hydrological changes in the men river basin of thailand whereas dry season temperature had the strongest impact ahmed et al 2022 revealed that climate change contributed up to 98 to runoff variation at zhimenda basin of the yangtze river alifujiang et al 2021 found that both climatic and anthropogenic factors reduced the annual runoff in the issyk kul lake basin of kyrgyzstan although their contribution rates differed depending on the methodology used the distributed hydrological modeling method has been widely used in the preceding studies due to its comprehensive consideration of spatial heterogeneity and watershed hydrophysical processes chen et al 2020 zeng et al 2021 climate warming interbasin water diversion and grazing bans are among the natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the datong river basin the hydrological process of the basin is unstable and fragile as the primary area of river formation and development the alteration of hydrological features in the river source area has a direct impact on the rational allocation and usage of water resources in the mid lower reaches which is crucial for regional economic development wu et al 2019 the following are the main problems involved in this study 1 what were the climatic and hydrological changes in the basin from 1960 to 2019 2 what were the lulc changes in the basin from 1980 to 2020 3 to what extent do they contribute to variations in the runoff this study employs mathematical statistics analysis and the swat model to investigate the meteorological and hydrological aspects of the datong river source region then the quantitative effects of climate and lulc changes on runoff are investigated the research results are of significant importance for elucidating the runoff evolution law of the datong river source region in the context of climate change for the management of the basin water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the datong river flows into the yellow river via

primarily consisted of grassland woodland wetland and bare land with grassland accounting for 50 53 of the study area the climate in the study region is primarily influenced by the westerlies the plateau monsoon and the summer monsoon the temperature and precipitation in the basin have altered dramatically due to global warming the precipitation ranged between 300 mm and 550 mm from 1960 to 2019 and the annual average temperature was 0 6 c which has a significant impact on the regional hydrological process the annual runoff of datong river is about 28 95 108 m3 with abundant water resources currently three water diversion projects have been constructed in the basin including the water diversion from datong river to qinwangchuan in 1994 with a design water diversion of 4 43 108

guo et al 2014 on arcgis 10 2 platform the model can be divided into various hydrological response units hrus based on the topography lulc and soil data of the basin the runoff of each hru was then calculated using the water balance formula and finally the flow of the total outlet section of the basin was obtained the water surface cycle in the swat model can be expressed as arnold et al 1998 1

and the simulated value of monthly runoff have a similar trend and the overall simulation effect is relatively ideal but there is still some error at the simulated peak these findings demonstrate that the swat model is applicable in the datong river source region where it can be used to simulate the hydrological process and examine its response to climatic and lulc changes 3 4 contribution analysis of runoff change the calibrated swat model was used to quantify the changes in the hydrological process of the datong river source area under various scenarios the model calculation results are shown in table 5 it can be seen that under the constant lulc scenario s1 and s2 s3 and s4 the average runoff from 1981 to 2016 increased by 1 m3 s when compared to 1962 1980 under similar climate conditions s1 and s3 s2 and s4 the average runoff in 2020 will decrease by 0 2 m3 s compared with that in 1980 average runoff changed by 0 8 m3 s due to the combined effect of climate and lulc s1 and s4 in summary the impact of climate on runoff changes accounted for 125 while the impact of lulc was 25 the change in lulc has little effect on runoff in the datong river source area and exhibits a predictable reaction trend these findings demonstrate that climate change exerts a more significant impact than lulc on runoff in the datong river source area 4 discussion 4 1 the influence of meteorological factors on the runoff change the water cycle in the basin is significantly influenced by weather factors such as temperature and precipitation in alpine regions it is commonly considered that temperature recharges rivers by melting ice and snow while precipitation is a substantial contributor to river runoff recharge moreover the temperature has a significant impact on evapotranspiration which helps to reduce runoff yang et al 2017 to further investigate the effect of climate on runoff correlation and multiple regression analyses formula 8 9 of runoff temperature and precipitation factors in the research region were conducted at various time scales fig 7 and table 6 on an inter annual scale the runoff was primarily affected by precipitation the contribution rate is 70 3 p 0 01 while temperature had an adverse effect on runoff this is primarily attributable to the fact that the influence of precipitation on changes in runoff occurred primarily between may and october when precipitation was relatively abundant during this period the proportion of glacier melt water in runoff replenishment is low and the temperature increase has a reduced effect on runoff by affecting evaporation monthly runoff in the study area was found to be positively correlated with the mean minimum temperature 0 however the correlation coefficient between runoff and average maximum temperature was negative from may to october while it was positive with precipitation fig 7 according to table 6 autumn and winter precipitation consists primarily of snowfall and less precipitation additionally some studies wang et al 2020a 2020b found that winter and spring snow in high altitude can be affected by temperature which is comparable with the results of the contribution rate analysis in the present study in summary the temperature has a significant influence on runoff in autumn and winter the annual distribution law of precipitation and runoff was consistent runoff from may to october accounted for 87 6 of the entire year demonstrating that precipitation had the greatest influence on runoff fluctuation and that the influence of precipitation on runoff fluctuation occurred mostly from may to october when precipitation was relatively abundant according to liu et al 2016 the intensification of global warming since the 1990 s has resulted in the continuous upward movement or even disappearance of the snow line in the datong river source area resulting in a significant reduction in runoff the findings show that the influence of temperature on runoff change is reflected in runoff reduction by affecting glacier snow storage and evaporation furthermore global warming appears to intensify glacier melting resulting in changes in river runoff fed by glaciers additionally there is a definite effect on the runoff when the temperature hits a particular threshold 4 2 the influence of anthropogenic on runoff anthropogenic influences on runoff in the datong river basin are primarily due to two factors the first is the reduction in runoff caused by water transfer between basins the basin has three interbasin water diversion projects including the water diversion from datong river to qinwangchuan in 1995 with a design water diversion of 4 43 108 m3 water diversion from liu river to jin river in 2003 with a design water diversion of 0 4 108 m3 and water diversion from datong river to huangshui in 2016 with a design water diversion of 3 5 108 m3 the amount of water extracted from the datong river will increase as production water and living standards improve resulting in a year by year decrease in runoff in the datong river the second point is that changes in surface cover influence runoff fluctuations zhu et al 2020 studied the runoff of the changhua river in an arid area and found that the surface changes caused by large scale cash crop planting construction of large scale water conservancy projects and soil erosion indirectly reduced the changhua river runoff dai et al 2019 found that as urbanization progressed construction land in the qinhuai river basin increased significantly between 1987 and 2013 while vegetation cover decreased weakening the basin s function of regulating runoff and increasing the risk of flooding due to the fact that the datong river source area is within qilian mountain national park and the area has been subject to the strictest protection measures there has not been a significant change in the area s lulc status throughout the study period however the decrease in runoff may be attributable to the corresponding increase in water area as a result of climate change and the obvious reduction of lulc categories susceptible to surface runoff such as bare land in general the inter basin water diversion project of the datong river basin concentrates mostly on the lower part of the qingshizui which has minimal effect on the runoff of the upper reaches therefore the anthropogenic influence on runoff is primarily represented in the change in lulc 4 3 implication for water resource management this study demonstrates that climate is the primary factor of runoff change although lulc change should not be ignored when managing water resources in the basin through human involvement watershed water resources management aims to enhance the rational distribution of water resources and support the basin s sustainable development based on a knowledge of the influence of climate and lulc on runoff change in the datong river source area the management of water resources in the basin can be improved in the following ways 1 take positive measures to deal with potential climate related flood and debris flow disasters the results indicate that the contribution rate of climate change to runoff change is 125 and the runoff is mainly concentrated during the rainy season accounting for 87 6 this is expected to cause flooding for example in 2021 heavy rainfall in qilian county caused floods disrupting traffic and damaging crops 2 continue to implement the cross basin water transfer project under the premise of meeting demand within the basin 3 in the future continue to protect glaciers and maintain fresh water reserves 4 actively promote water saving irrigation technology to improve water resources 5 conclusions based on historical meteorological and hydrological data this study employed the swat model and multiple regression analysis techniques to conduct a quantitative analysis of the causes of runoff changes the following results are obtained 1 the climate of the datong river source area showed a warm and humid trend from 1960 to 2019 the inter annual runoff was relatively stable but the annual runoff varied greatly the dry season and rainy season runoff accounted for 12 4 and 87 6 of the annual runoff respectively 2 grassland is the largest land patch in the datong river source area covering more than 50 except for permanent glaciers and bare land regions which decreased as a result of an increase in temperature and the corresponding increase in the water area there were no substantial changes in other kinds and lulc change was concentrated in the first 20 years 3 climate change and lulc contributed 125 and 25 respectively to the change in runoff in the datong river source region the contribution of rainfall to annual runoff accounted for 70 3 of all meteorological factors with the majority of rainfall occurring during the warm season the cold season temperature has a significant influence on runoff the scientific management of water resources in river basins must consider climate and lulc changes in the context of global change in the future we should actively promote high efficient water saving irrigation technology to further improve the utilization efficiency of water resources simultaneously we should rationally allocate the cross basin water transfer project to promote the sustainable development of the basin furthermore active measures should be taken to deal with the flood disaster caused by climate change while monitoring the water credit authorship contribution statement meiliang zhao

7682,study region the xiaoxingkai lake basin in china study focus watershed hydrological simulation is a prominent aspect of hydrology however comprehensive analysis of lake basins based on hydrological simulation is rarely conducted therefore we used the soil and water assessment tool swat with dynamic land use land cover lulc input and time varying parameters to simulate streamflow of the xiaoxingkai lake basin and estimate the impacts of lulc and climate change on streamflow during 1961 2017 we also evaluated the contributions of lulc and climate change to water volume in lake xiaoxingkai through a lake water balance analysis new hydrologic insights for the region the simulated streamflow agrees well with observations at most stations nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 5 and goodness of fit r2 0 8 climate change has a positive effect on streamflow which dominates the streamflow variations during 1981 1995 and 2006 2017 whereas lulc change has a negative effect with a dominant role during 1996 2005 the volume of lake xiaoxingkai increased slightly at a rate of 0 12 106 m3 yr 1 with climate change contributing the most 77 25 to the increase followed by direct human activities 47 50 and lulc change 24 76 this study facilitates a better understanding of the hydrological cycle in the xiaoxingkai lake basin under changing environments and is helpful for regional water resource management graphical abstract ga1 keywords swat lulc change climate change hydrological cycle lake water balance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction human activities are increasingly influential in controlling streamflow by directly constructing hydraulic structures and consuming water ayivi and jha 2018 simultaneously anthropogenic land use land cover lulc changes also alter the yield and concentration mechanism of streamflow affecting the streamflow and base flow in the basin haddeland et al 2014 ji and duan 2019 musie et al 2020 osei et al 2019 for instance expanded cropland and impervious surface as well as shrunk natural vegetation may increase runoff gal et al 2016 yonaba et al 2021 climate change is another major factor that mainly influences water flux and surface conditions via rising temperature and spatiotemporal redistribution of precipitation wang et al 2021b 2022 xie et al 2015 since 1950 the hydrological cycle has undergone widespread changes triggered by climate change and human activities myhre et al 2018 labat et al 2004 demonstrated that the global hydrological cycle was intensified by increased continental precipitation this situation would further exacerbate future drought conditions in many parts of the world padrón et al 2020 satoh et al 2022 touma et al 2015 therefore investigating how change in lulc and climate affects streamflow is crucial for making adaptive land and water resources management policy chen et al 2020 generally hydrologic models can be used to investigate hydrological responses to lulc and climate change through scenario simulations frans et al 2013 haddeland et al 2014 lv et al 2022 praskievicz and chang 2009 yin et al 2017 the coupling of general circulation models and hydrological models is also a hot way to simulate the potential impacts of lulc and climate change on streamflow getachew et al 2021 li and fang 2021 op de hipt et al 2019 osei et al 2019 peres et al 2019 the soil and water assessment tool swat a semi distributed hydrological model bieger et al 2017 was widely used for simulating streamflow abbaspour et al 2015 bailey et al 2022 cao et

lulc and climate change on streamflow by using the method of scenario simulations based on the swat model ayivi and jha 2018 musie et al 2020 yonaba et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 recently an improved swat has been released to address the limitations of the previous version and solve the challenges of modeling in current and future water resources bieger et al 2017 swat has been used in a couple of studies to simulate runoff and reservoir release with good performance chawanda et al 2020 jiménez navarro et al 2021 paul et al 2021 future efforts are still needed in light of the limited research so far jiménez navarro et al 2021 wagner et al 2022 lakes and their basins are relatively independent natural complexes their management is an important part of water resource management since lakes and reservoirs hold approximately 90 of the global liquid surface freshwater chidammodzi and muhandiki 2016 woolway et al 2020 therefore investigating the hydrological cycles of lakes and their basins as well as their response to lulc and climate change is of great significance many researchers have conducted hydrological simulations in lake basins such as the great lakes basin myers et al 2021 lake tana basin getachew et al 2021 teklay et al 2019 woldesenbet et al 2018 lake ziway basin musie et al 2020 poyang lake catchment ye et al 2013 etc however they focused on the hydrological processes and water balance of the terrestrial part but ignored the further analysis of lake water level and volume based on hydrological simulation at the watershed scale cao et al 2021 lake khanka is a transboundary lake shared by china and russia with 1 3 in china and 2 3 in russia lake xiaoxingkai the relatively independent part of lake khanka located in china is connected to lake khanka by floodgates in 1942 the chinese government built the mu xing flood diversion channel through which more than 80 of the water in the middle and upper reaches of the muling river enters lake xiaoxingkai and then lake khanka since then the muling river became a tributarie of lake khanka and the major water source of lake xiaoxingkai in recent decades the annual average temperature and precipitation have increased in the khanka lake basin moreover driven by the varying terrain distinct policies and rapid development of socioeconomic in china and russia chu et al 2019 the lulc in the khanka lake basin has undergone obvious regional transformations zhou et al 2019 particularly in china due to the intensive agricultural lands and human activities chu et al 2019 which affect the water flow from the muling river to lake xiaoxingkai as a sub basin of the khanka lake basin accurate simulation of streamflow and its response to lulc and climate change in the xiaoxingkai lake basin is of great significance for water resource management and china russian water resource cooperation in the khanka lake basin this study focused on xiaoxingkai lake basin or muling xingkai basin and evaluated the adaptability of swat model specifically we simulated streamflow under different scenarios and estimated the impacts of lulc and climate change on streamflow into lake xiaoxingkai more importantly we analyzed the water balance in lake xiaoxingkai and quantified the contributions of major components to the changing lake volume 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the xiaoxingkai lake basin 43 49 59 45 55 03 n 129 50 59 132 55 24 e is a sub basin of the khanka lake basin fig 1 covering an area of 17 658 km2 the middle and lower reaches of the basin are dominated by flat topography whereas the upper reaches are dominated by mountains and its elevation ranges from 62 m to 1110 m fig 2a b the average annual precipitation and temperature are 524 mm and 3 8 respectively because it belongs to the climate zone of temperate continental monsoon up to 80 of precipitation in the basin occurs in wet season from may and september song et al 2012 and the air temperatures is below the freezing point in dry and cold season from october to april yuan et al 2018 the xiaoxingkai lake basin has five main land use types including forest frst 52 13 of the basin agricultural land agrl 24 94 rice field rice 7 18 wetland wetl 6 15 and grassland past 5 63 fig 2c as well as four major soil types including luvisols 66 50 followed by phaeozems 18 23 gleisoils 10 01 and anthrosols 3 26 fig 2d 2 2 the swat model and its setup 2 2 1 swat swat a completely restructured version of swat bieger et al 2017 is more convenient for code modification and more flexible in defining management schedules and connecting spatial units bieger et al 2019 bieger et al 2017 the most important changes in model function are the implementation of landscape units and routings associated with them as well as the more flexible management schedules routing constituents and connection between managed flow systems and the natural stream network bieger et al 2017 in this study we simulated the streamflow of xiaoxingkai lake basin based on qswat a swat plugin in qgis and swatpluseditor the interface of the swat program the xiaoxingkai lake basin was divided into 43 sub basins including 3876 hydrological response units 2 2 2 swat model input data the spatial and non spatial data required to drive a swat model include topographic data lulc maps soil map and daily meteorological data the 30 m digital elevation model dem of aster gdem v1 was obtained from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn to delineate watersheds and generate terrain slope information the 30 m lulc maps for 1980 1990 2000 and 2010 were obtained from the resource and environment science and data center cas resdc https www resdc cn the soil map with a spatial resolution of 30 arc second was obtained from the harmonized world soil database hwsd v1 2 http fao org soils portal soil survey these spatial data were resampled to 90 m in this study to improve model performance and they were all transformed into the wgs 1984 albers area projection the daily meteorological data including precipitation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed from 1959 to 2017 at 11 stations within and around the study area fig 1c were collected from the resdc it should be noted that solar radiation instead of sunshine duration is required by swat model therefore we calculated the solar radiation from sunshine duration see supplementary text reservoirs are man made impoundments located on the main channel network of watersheds and can function in irrigation and flood control qingnianshuiku built in 1961 is the largest reservoir in xiaoxingkai lake basin mainly used for flood control and irrigation combined with power generation fish farming and other functions according to the existing literature wang and cui 2009 the volume when it filled to the emergency spillway of the reservoir and the corresponding water surface area were 4 01 108 m3 and 58 km2 respectively and that to the principal spillway was 2 19 108 m3 the water surface area corresponding to the volume when it filled to the principal spillway of the reservoir was determined as the minimum water surface area 25 km2 calculated based on the global surface water dataset gswd pekel et al 2016 thus reservoir releases were simulated using the target release method and decision table in the swat reservoir module see fig s1 for the decision table agricultural management practices planting irrigation and harvest are also considered according to the crop planting map of heilongjiang province the crops in xiaoxingkai lake basin are dominated by single crop rice and spring maize therefore it was assumed that the land use type with rice was only planted with single crop rice and agrl was only planted with spring maize in this study management operations were scheduled by the specific date obtained from two agro meteorological stations irrigation was achieved using the auto irrigation module in swat and the irrigation schedule was determined according to reports in the technical specification for water saving irrigation the specific irrigation time amount and frequency for single crop rice and spring maize were provided in table s1 2 2 3 calibration validation and evaluation of swat in this study monthly streamflow data monitored by six hydrological stations muling ml lishuzhen lsz mishanqiao msq hubeizha hbz hubeizha mu hbzm and yitong yt fig 1c collected from the annual hydrological report of the people s republic of china ahr prc were used for model parameter sensitivity calibration and validation however as the hydrological data between 1988 and 2001 were not published we only obtained monthly streamflow data from 1961 to 1987 and 2002 2017 with varying temporal coverage at different stations based on the principle of the least lulc changes within sub periods and the largest between sub periods as well as the availability of streamflow data we divided the period 1961 2017 into four sub periods p0 1961 1980 p1 1981 1995 p2 1996 2005 and p3 2006 2017 and took lulc data in 1980 1990 2000 and 2010 as input to build the swat model with dynamic lulc input and time varying parameters the model parameter sensitivity analysis calibration and validation were implemented for each sub period in addition based on the meteorological data during 1961 2017 and the lulc data in 1980 1990 2000 and 2010 four swat models with static lulc input and fixed parameters was constructed to compare with the simulation results of the model based on dynamic lulc input and time varying parameters the calibration and validation schemes are shown in table 1 we used two years for all warm up periods and performed the multi site calibration using the swatplusr package schürz 2019 at monthly scale based on previous studies abbaspour et al 2015 cao et al 2021 li and fang 2021 as well as the global sensitivity analysis conducted by using the fourier amplitude sensitivity test in fast package of r language we selected 23 parameters for model calibration more information on the parameters is provided in table s2 we used the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and the coefficient of determination r2 to evaluate the simulated streamflow the r2 measures the strength of the relationship between the observations and simulations eq 1 in contrast the nse an indicator of the model efficiency measures how well the simulations agree with the observations eq 2 ayivi and jha 2018 the pbias indicates an over or under estimated tendency compared with the observations eq 3 1 r 2 i 1 n q o b s i q o b s a v g q s i m i q s i m a v g 2 i 1 n q o b s i q o b s a v g 2 i 1 n q s i m i q s i m a v g 2 2 n s

observed and simulated values respectively q obs avg and q sim avg refer to the average value of the observations and simulations respectively we also used 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu abbaspour et al 2017 of the model to describe the output uncertainty to compare the 95ppu with the adopted recharge signal two statistics indices p factor and r factor abbaspour et al 2004 abbaspour et al 2015 were employed the p factor with a range of 0 1 refers to the percentage of observed data covered by the 95ppu band whereas the r factor with a range of 0 to refers to the thickness of the 95ppu band eq 4 4 r factor 1 n t 1 n q sim t 97 5 q sim t 2 5 δ obs where q s i m t 97 5 and q s i m t 2 5 are the 97 5th upper boundary of 95ppu and 2 5th lower boundary of 95ppu percentiles of the cumulative distribution of simulation at time step t n refers to the number of data and δ o b s refers to the standard deviation of the observations a lager p factor and a smaller r factor represent more observed values were simulated by the model with a lower uncertainty abbaspour et al 2015 abbaspour et al 2015 recommended a desirable value of 0 7 for p factor and 1 5 for r factor but it should also depend on simulation scale and adequacy of the input and calibrating data 2 3 separation of lulc and climate impacts on streamflow in this study we assumed that lulc change and climate change are independent therefore their respective contributions to streamflow can be evaluated using the fixing changing method mekonnen et al 2018 yonaba et al 2021 the fixing changing method separates the impacts of lulc and climate change on streamflow by scenario simulation with fixing climate data used in base period and changing lulc or that with fixing lulc data used in base period and changing climate data in this study we divided the simulation period into four sub periods see section 2 2 3 and defined 10 simulation scenarios including four base actual scenarios s0 s3 three scenarios reflecting the influence of lulc change sl1 sl3 and three scenarios reflecting the influence of climate change sc1 sc3 table 2 based on above scenarios and taking two different periods p0 and p1 as an example the isolated relative contribution of lulc change η p 1 lu climate change η p 1 cl and the interactive effects of lulc and climate change η p 1 lu cl on the variation of average annual streamflow can be calculated as in eqs 5 7 5 η p 1 lu δ q p 0 1 lu δ q p 0 1 100 6 η p 1 cl δ q p 0 1 cl δ q p 0 1 100 7 η p 1 lu cl δ q p 0 1 lu cl δ q p 0 1 100 where q p0 1 lu q p0 1 cl and q p0 1 lu cl refer to the variations in the average annual streamflow in period p1 relative to p0 attributed to lulc change climate change and the interaction of lulc and climate change respectively δq p0 1 refers to the actual variation in the average annual streamflow in the period p1 relative to p0 the δq p0 1 can be defined as in eq 8 8 δ q p 0 1 q s 1 q s 0 δ q p 0 1 lu δ q p 0 1 cl δ q p 0 1 lu cl where q s0 and q s1 refer to the average annual streamflow under scenarios s0 and s1 respectively then q p0 1 lu q p0 1 cl and q p0 1 lu cl can be defined as in eqs 9 11 9 δ q p 0 1 lu q sl 1 q s 0 10 δ q p 0 1 cl q sc 1 q s 0 11 δ q p 0 1 lu cl q s 1 q s 0 δ q p 0 1 cl δ q p 0 1 lu where q sl1 and q sc1 are the average annual streamflow under scenarios sl1 and sc1 respectively the calculations of relative contribution of lulc change climate change and the interactive effects of lulc and climate change on the variation of average annual streamflow in periods p2 and p3 relative to p0 are similar to above 2 4 datasets of lake water area and lake level the lake water area of xiaoxingkai was obtained from the gswd v1 3 which contained 30 m landsat derived data from 1984 to 2017 and was downloaded from the google earth engine https developers google com earth engine its uncertainty defined as the unobserved component of the maximum permanent water area pekel et al 2016 was less than 5 except in 1994 7 05 fig s6 the annual mean lake level measurements from 1962 to 1987 and 2002 2014 were obtained from the ahr prc some missing records of the lake water area from 1962 to 1983 and the lake level from 1988 to 2001 were restructured based on the relationship between lake level and water area 2 5 lake water balance the change in water balance net water budget of a lake is reflected in the corresponding variations of lake level and water area zhang et al 2018 when the net water budget is positive the lake level rises and the water area expands therefore when the lake level changes slightly a small change in lake volume can be expressed as in eq 12 12 dv adl where a is the lake water area then variation in water volume v when the lake level l rises from l 1 to l 2 can be calculated as in eq 13 13 v l 1 l 2 adl assuming that the relationship between lake level and water area can be fitted with a quadratic equation eq 14 14 a a l 2 bl c then v can be calculated as 15 v l 1 l 2 a l 2 bl c dl 1 3 l 2 l 1 a 1 a 2 a l 1 l 2 1 2 b l 2 l 1 c where a 1 and a 2 are the lake water areas corresponding to the lake levels l 1 and l 2 respectively for an exorheic lake the lake volume is usually affected by surface runoff into the lake rin precipitation falling on the lake surface p evaporation from the lake surface e net groundwater into the lake gn lake outflow rout and human consumption h therefore the lake water balance is formulated as in eqs 16 17 coppens et al 2020 neitsch et al 2011 16 v r in p g n r out e h 17 g n g in g out where g in and g out refers to the groundwater inflow and outflow respectively in this study we assumed that g in is equal to g out and the lake water balance model can be simplified as eq 18 18 v r in p r out e h 3 results 3 1 calibration validation and evaluation of swat model we calibrated the swat model using observed streamflow data from six hydrological stations and selected 23 parameters with good performance at these stations for calibration table s2 the sensitivity of these parameters is shown in fig s2 s5 figs 3 and 4 illustrate that the simulated streamflow based on the dynamic lulc input and time varying parameter method were greatly matched with the observations at monthly and annual scale during the calibration periods in periods p0 p2 the nse values were greater than 0 5 but were slightly small 0 26 nse 0 5 during the validation period in period p0 and at some stations in period p3 fig 3 and table 3 this indicated that the simulated streamflow at these stations during 1971 1980 and 2006 2017 were somewhat unsatisfactory even though there were low nse values but all of them were greater than 0 indicating that the simulated streamflow was still better than the mean of observed values the pbias values were smaller than 25 at most stations especially at mid and downstream stations indicating that more than 75 of the observations were captured by the model at most stations the r2 values were larger than 0 6 at almost all the stations in the four periods demonstrating good agreement between the simulated and observed monthly streamflow the r factor and p factor showed a lower uncertainty of the simulations in p0 p2 than in p3 the 95ppu bandwidth was smaller than 1 5 in periods p0 p2 and approximately 81 of p factor values were larger than 0 6 indicating that more than 60 of the observations were covered by 95ppu at most stations in addition the monthly streamflow in different seasons fig 3b1 g1 b2 g2 indicated that the streamflow at the ml and lsz stations was underestimated in spring due to the inaccurate simulation of snowmelt fig 4 shows that the streamflow was underestimated at ml and lsz on the annual scale especially during the calibration period overall although the performances of the swat model were quite poor at some hydrological stations and some periods due to considering the relative high performances at all stations simultaneously the simulation results of hbz located downstream and with adequate observations showed a very high correlation r 0 85 at yearly scale with observation values throughout the entire period 1961 2017 and their fluctuations were consistent the results of the model simulations based on the static lulc input and fixed parameters showed good agreement between the simulated and observed monthly streamflow fig s7 and table s3 however the scatterplots showed that the simulated streamflow based on the time varying parameter method with dynamic lulc input was significantly better except for hbzm and yt fig 5 therefore the model based on the time varying parameters method with dynamic lulc input is more appropriate and the simulation results used in the subsequent analysis are the outputs of swat model based on the time varying parameter method with dynamic lulc input 3 2 contributions of lulc and climate change to the streamflow the annual precipitation in the xiaoxingkai lake basin experienced decreases from 1961 to 1980 5 23 mm yr 1 and from 1996 to 2005 4 28 mm yr 1 but increases from 1981 to 1995 1 26 mm yr 1 and from 2006 to 2017 5 84 mm yr 1 without an overall slight increasing trend 0 28 mm yr 1 fig 6a the annual mean temperature showed a significant increase from 1961 to 2017 with a rate of 0 034 yr 1 as well as the sub periods 1961 1980 0 010 yr 1 1981 1995 0 091 yr 1 1996 2005 0 011 yr 1 and 2006 2017 0 012 yr 1 fig 6b the land use types of xiaoxingkai lake basin were dominated by rice 47 74 52 13 agrl 24 94 31 21 and frst 7 18 9 15 fig 7 from 1980 2010 the lulc changes were featured by an increase in agrl 25 14 rice 20 15 and watr 10 51 and a decrease in wetl 39 07 past 25 94 and frst 7 85 the increased agrl was mainly caused by the reclamation of frst and past and the increased rice was mainly transformed from agrl and wetl table s5 fig 8 shows that the average streamflow into lake xiaoxingkai was 47 91 m3 s 1 54 26 m3 s 1 30 45 m3 s 1 and 51 81 m3 s 1 in scenarios s0 s3 respectively indicating that lulc and climate change in p1 and p3 promoted streamflow and changes in p2 reduced streamflow the average streamflow in scenarios sl1 sl3 was 44 76 m3 s 1 32 70 m3 s 1 and 40 28 m3 s 1 respectively suggesting that lulc change reduced streamflow in p1 p2 especially in p2 in scenarios sc1 sc3 the average streamflow values were 58 21 m3 s 1 46 73 m3 s 1 and 61 03 m3 s 1 respectively indicating that climate change increased streamflow in p1 and p3 relative to that in p0 the average streamflow increased by 6 35 m3 s 1 from p0 to p1 mainly contributed by the climate change ηcl 170 16 partly offset by lulc change ηlulc 49 67 table 4 overall climate change positively dominated streamflow from p0 to p1 the decline trends of streamflow 17 46 m3 s 1 and precipitation 34 mm were observed from p0 to p2 the lulc change dominated by the transition from frst past wetl to agrl and rice had a large impact on streamflow ηlulc 87 12 largely reducing streamflow from p0 to p3 the average streamflow increased by 3 89 m3 s 1 in that climate change e g the increase of precipitation greatly promoted streamflow ηcl 344 75 while lulc change ηlulc 195 97 and the interaction of lulc and climate change ηlulc cl 48 78 offset most of the impacts 3 3 effects of water balance components on lake volume the lake water area from 1962 to 1983 and lake level from 1988 to 2001 were reconstructed based on the quadratic polynomial model figs 9 and 10a the lake water area and lake level exhibited the same increasing trends from 1962 to 2014 with increase rates of 0 37 km2 yr 1 and 0 02 m yr 1 respectively according to eq 15 and the annual average lake level and water area we estimated the annual variations in lake volume from 1962 to 2014 fig 10b the lake volume in lake xiaoxingkai fluctuated strongly from 1962 to 2014 and showed a slightly increasing trend 0 12 106 m3 yr 1 based on above results and lake water balance the sum of human consumption and lake outflow was calculated by subtracting the lake surface evaporation and lake water volume change from the total water supply thus the average lake water volume variation and each water balance component were obtained table 5 the results showed that surface runoff into the lake and lake surface precipitation accounted for 93 61 and 6 39 of the inputs respectively the lake surface evaporation and the sum of lake outflow and human consumption accounted for 4 90 and 95 10 of the outputs respectively ultimately the climate change contributed 77 25 to the water volume change in lake xiaoxingkai the lulc change contributed 24 76 and the direct human activities such as lake outflow affected by sluice operation and human consumption contributed 47 50 fig 11 apparently the water volume change in lake xiaoxingkai were mainly driven by climate change with the non negligible impact of human activities 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty analysis of the swat model model simulations is often accompanied by some uncertainties it has been pointed out that the input dataset calibration and structure of swat model are the main sources of its output uncertainty duku et al 2015 yang et al 2021 the major input uncertainty in this study may be caused by the resampling of the spatial data to reduce operational complexity and increase computational efficiency we resampled the 30 m dem and lulc maps and a 30 arc second soil map to 90 m which may introduce some uncertainty however too much detail information generated by the input data with higher spatial resolution would result in a significant increase in running time of swat model arnold et al 2010 notter et al 2012 therefore it is acceptable to choose an appropriate spatial resolution based on computational efficiency and operational feasibility duku et al 2015 the uncertainty of parameter calibration is usually described by 95ppu quantifying through two indices p factor and r factor abbaspour et al 2017 yang et al 2021 in this study we evaluated the simulation and measurement errors using the 95ppu and the results illustrated that the uncertainty in our study was acceptable see table 3 4 2 impacts of lulc and climate change on streamflow the fixing changing method is commonly used to evaluate the impacts of lulc and climate change on streamflow berihun et al 2019 mekonnen et al 2018 op de hipt et al 2019 woldesenbet et al 2018 yonaba et al 2021 our results of ten simulation scenarios based on the fixing changing method indicated that climate change dominantly caused the variation of streamflow in the xiaoxingkai lake basin before 1995 from 1996 2005 lulc change played a dominant role and both lulc change and climate change reduced streamflow after 2006 climate change played a positive and dominant role in streamflow our results are supported by zhou et al 2019 in the amur river basin but differ from the results in some other humid areas fohrer et al 2001 musie et al 2020 wagner et al 2013 and semi arid regions yang et al 2021 where lulc change barely influenced streamflow 4 3 estimation of lake water balance lake volume variation is the essence of the change in lake water balance that is the relationship between water supply and water loss state and it is the result of multiple driving factors in this study we estimated the lake volume variation in lake xiaoxingkai based on the restructured long term continuous lake level and water area from 1962 to 2014 evaluated the proportions of different components of lake water balance and assessed the contributions of climate change and human activities to lake volume our result demonstrated that the impact of human activities on lake volume in lake xiaoxingkai 22 74 was significantly higher than that in lake qinghai 2 45 yang et al 2021 a closed lake in the semi arid region of northwestern china and it was lower than that in the baiyangdian lake basin 60 62 hu et al 2012 in eastern china because the flood discharge from lake xiaoxingkai to khanka mainly occurred from july to september during the sluice operation no sluice discharge data have been obtained so far therefore we regarded the outflow of lake xiaoxingkai as affected by human activities and deduced the volume of lake outflow and human consumption through the water balance model in future research cooperation with local departments regarding hydrology and environmental protection and long term lake hydrological monitoring should be strengthened to clarify each component of the lake water balance 5 conclusion in the past few decades the lulc and climate in the xiaoxingkai lake basin have obviously changed the changing environment has a great impact on water resources in the basin which is a challenge for regional water resources management but less been investigated in this study we successfully applied the swat model with dynamic lulc input and time varying parameters to simulate the streamflow since 1960 s and evaluate the impacts of lulc and climate change on streamflow entering the lake xiaoxingkai additionally we estimated the lake volume change and quantified the contributions of water balance components the main findings are as follows 1 the swat model based on the dynamic lulc input and time varying parameter method is more suitable for the xiaoxingkai lake basin with better performance at mid and downstream stations than upstream stations 2 the changing lulc and climate in the xiaoxingkai lake basin from 1961 to 2017 had significant impacts on streamflow with climate change hoding a dominant position in streamflow variations during 1981 1995 and 2006 2017 and lulc change during 1996 2005 3 the water volume of lake xiaoxingkai slightly increased with time 0 12 106 m3 yr 1 and its variation was mainly affected by climate change followed by lulc and human activities the estimation of the lake water balance of xiaoxingkai lake in this study was only a rough approximation due to limited monitoring data we propose developing an optimized assessment method to refine the proportion of each water balance component and investigating the nutrient concentration and lake ecosystem to realize a comprehensive simulation and analysis of water quantity quality and ecology of the lake basin our findings provided a hydrological basis and reference for future research in this basin and in other similar lake basins as well as a scientific insight for agriculture and water resource management in the khanka lake basin credit authorship contribution statement feiyan xiao

7682,study region the xiaoxingkai lake basin in china study focus watershed hydrological simulation is a prominent aspect of hydrology however comprehensive analysis of lake basins based on hydrological simulation is rarely conducted therefore we used the soil and water assessment tool swat with dynamic land use land cover lulc input and time varying parameters to simulate streamflow of the xiaoxingkai lake basin and estimate the impacts of lulc and climate change on streamflow during 1961 2017 we also evaluated the contributions of lulc and climate change to water volume in lake xiaoxingkai through a lake water balance analysis new hydrologic insights for the region the simulated streamflow agrees well with observations at most stations nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 5 and goodness of fit r2 0 8 climate change has a positive effect on streamflow which dominates the streamflow variations during 1981 1995 and 2006 2017 whereas lulc change has a negative effect with a dominant role during 1996 2005 the volume of lake xiaoxingkai increased slightly at a rate of 0 12 106 m3 yr 1 with climate change contributing the most 77 25 to the increase followed by direct human activities 47 50 and lulc change 24 76 this study facilitates a better understanding of the hydrological cycle in the xiaoxingkai lake basin under changing environments and is helpful for regional water resource management graphical abstract ga1 keywords swat lulc change climate change hydrological cycle lake water balance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction human activities are increasingly influential in controlling streamflow by directly constructing hydraulic structures and consuming water ayivi and jha 2018 simultaneously anthropogenic land use land cover lulc changes also alter the yield and concentration mechanism of streamflow affecting the streamflow and base flow in the basin haddeland et al 2014 ji and duan 2019 musie et al 2020 osei et al 2019 for instance expanded cropland and impervious surface as well as shrunk natural vegetation may increase runoff gal et al 2016 yonaba et al 2021 climate change is another major factor that mainly influences water flux and surface conditions via rising temperature and spatiotemporal redistribution of precipitation wang et al 2021b 2022 xie et al 2015 since 1950 the hydrological cycle has undergone widespread changes triggered by climate change and human activities myhre et al 2018 labat et al 2004 demonstrated that the global hydrological cycle was intensified by increased continental precipitation this situation would further exacerbate future drought conditions in many parts of the world padrón et al 2020 satoh et al 2022 touma et al 2015 therefore investigating how change in lulc and climate affects streamflow is crucial for making adaptive land and water resources management policy chen et al 2020 generally hydrologic models can be used to investigate hydrological responses to lulc and climate change through scenario simulations frans et al 2013 haddeland et al 2014 lv et al 2022 praskievicz and chang 2009 yin et al 2017 the coupling of general circulation models and hydrological models is also a hot way to simulate the potential impacts of lulc and climate change on streamflow getachew et al 2021 li and fang 2021 op de hipt et al 2019 osei et al 2019 peres et al 2019 the soil and water assessment tool swat a semi distributed hydrological model bieger et al 2017 was widely used for simulating streamflow abbaspour et al 2015 bailey et al 2022 cao et

climate change and management practices i e crop planting irrigation fertilization and harvesting on water quantity and quality gassman et al 2007 many previous studies have identified the impacts of lulc and climate change on streamflow by using the method of scenario simulations based on the swat model ayivi and jha 2018 musie et al 2020 yonaba et al 2021 zhou et al 2019 recently an improved swat has been released to address the limitations of the previous version and solve the challenges of modeling in current and future water resources bieger et al 2017 swat has been used in a couple of studies to simulate runoff and reservoir release with good performance chawanda et al 2020 jiménez navarro et al 2021 paul et al 2021 future efforts are still needed in light of the limited research so far jiménez navarro et al 2021 wagner et al 2022 lakes and their basins are relatively independent natural complexes their management is an important part of water resource management since lakes and reservoirs hold approximately 90 of the global liquid surface freshwater chidammodzi and muhandiki 2016 woolway et al 2020 therefore investigating the hydrological cycles of lakes and their basins as well as their response to lulc and climate change is of great significance many researchers have conducted hydrological simulations in lake basins such as the great lakes basin myers et al 2021 lake tana basin getachew et al 2021 teklay et al 2019 woldesenbet et al 2018 lake ziway basin musie et al 2020 poyang lake catchment ye et al 2013 etc however they focused on the hydrological processes and water balance of the terrestrial part but ignored the further analysis of lake water level and volume based on hydrological simulation at the watershed scale cao et al 2021 lake khanka is a transboundary lake shared by china and russia with 1 3 in china and 2 3 in russia lake xiaoxingkai the relatively independent part of lake khanka located in china is connected to lake khanka by floodgates in 1942 the chinese government built the mu xing flood diversion channel through which more than 80 of the water in the middle and upper reaches of the muling river enters lake xiaoxingkai and then lake khanka since then the muling river became a tributarie of lake khanka and the major water source of lake xiaoxingkai in recent decades the annual average temperature and precipitation have increased in the khanka lake basin moreover driven by the varying terrain distinct policies and rapid development of socioeconomic in china and russia chu et al 2019 the lulc in the khanka lake basin has undergone obvious regional transformations zhou et al 2019 particularly in china due to the intensive agricultural lands and human activities chu et al 2019 which affect the water flow from the muling river to lake xiaoxingkai as a sub basin of the khanka lake basin accurate simulation of streamflow and its response to lulc and climate change in the xiaoxingkai lake basin is of great significance for water resource management and china russian water resource cooperation in the khanka lake basin this study focused on xiaoxingkai lake basin or muling xingkai basin and evaluated the adaptability of swat model specifically we simulated streamflow under different scenarios and estimated the impacts of lulc and climate change on streamflow into lake xiaoxingkai more importantly we analyzed the water balance in lake xiaoxingkai and quantified the contributions of major components to the changing lake volume 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the xiaoxingkai lake basin 43 49 59 45 55 03 n 129 50 59 132 55 24 e is a sub basin of the khanka lake basin fig 1 covering an area of 17 658 km2 the middle and lower reaches of the basin are dominated by flat topography whereas the upper reaches are dominated by mountains and its elevation ranges from 62 m to 1110 m fig 2a b the average annual precipitation and temperature are 524 mm and 3 8 respectively because it belongs to the climate zone of temperate continental monsoon up to 80 of precipitation in the basin occurs in wet season from may and september song et al 2012 and the air temperatures is below the freezing point in dry and cold season from october to april yuan et al 2018 the xiaoxingkai lake basin has five main land use types including forest frst 52 13 of the basin agricultural land agrl 24 94 rice field rice 7 18 wetland wetl 6 15 and grassland past 5 63 fig 2c as well as four major soil types including luvisols 66 50 followed by phaeozems 18 23 gleisoils 10 01 and anthrosols 3 26 fig 2d 2 2 the swat model and its setup 2 2 1 swat swat a completely restructured version of swat bieger et al 2017 is more convenient for code modification and more flexible in defining management schedules and connecting spatial units bieger et al 2019 bieger et al 2017 the most important changes in model function are the implementation of landscape units and routings associated with them as well as the more flexible management schedules routing constituents and connection between managed flow systems and the natural stream network bieger et al 2017 in this study we simulated the streamflow of xiaoxingkai lake basin based on qswat a swat plugin in qgis and swatpluseditor the interface of the swat program the xiaoxingkai lake basin was divided into 43 sub basins including 3876 hydrological response units 2 2 2 swat model input data the spatial and non spatial data required to drive a swat model include topographic data lulc maps soil map and daily meteorological data the 30 m digital elevation model dem of aster gdem v1 was obtained from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn to delineate watersheds and generate terrain slope information the 30 m lulc maps for 1980 1990 2000 and 2010 were obtained from the resource and environment science and data center cas resdc https www resdc cn the soil map with a spatial resolution of 30 arc second was obtained from the harmonized world soil database hwsd v1 2 http fao org soils portal soil survey these spatial data were resampled to 90 m in this study to improve model performance and they were all transformed into the wgs 1984 albers area projection the daily meteorological data including precipitation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed from 1959 to 2017 at 11 stations within and around the study area fig 1c were collected from the resdc it should be noted that solar radiation instead of sunshine duration is required by swat model therefore we calculated the solar radiation from sunshine duration see supplementary text reservoirs are man made impoundments located on the main channel network of watersheds and can function in irrigation and flood control qingnianshuiku built in 1961 is the largest reservoir in xiaoxingkai lake basin mainly used for flood control and irrigation combined with power generation fish farming and other functions according to the existing literature wang and cui 2009 the volume when it filled to the emergency spillway of the reservoir and the corresponding water surface area were 4 01 108 m3 and 58 km2 respectively and that to the principal spillway was 2 19 108 m3 the water surface area corresponding to the volume when it filled to the principal spillway of the reservoir was determined as the minimum water surface area 25 km2 calculated based on the global surface water dataset gswd pekel et al 2016 thus reservoir releases were simulated using the target release method and decision table in the swat reservoir module see fig s1 for the decision table agricultural management practices planting irrigation and harvest are also considered according to the crop planting map of heilongjiang province the crops in xiaoxingkai lake basin are dominated by single crop rice and spring maize therefore it was assumed that the land use type with rice was only planted with single crop rice and agrl was only planted with spring maize in this study management operations were scheduled by the specific date obtained from two agro meteorological stations irrigation was achieved using the auto irrigation module in swat and the irrigation schedule was determined according to reports in the technical specification for water saving irrigation the specific irrigation time amount and frequency for single crop rice and spring maize were provided in table s1 2 2 3 calibration validation and evaluation of swat in this study monthly streamflow data monitored by six hydrological stations muling ml lishuzhen lsz mishanqiao msq hubeizha hbz hubeizha mu hbzm and yitong yt fig 1c collected from the annual hydrological report of the people s republic of china ahr prc were used for model parameter sensitivity calibration and validation however as the hydrological data between 1988 and 2001 were not published we only obtained monthly streamflow data from 1961 to 1987 and 2002 2017 with varying temporal coverage at different stations based on the principle of the least lulc changes within sub periods and the largest between sub periods as well as the availability of streamflow data we divided the period 1961 2017 into four sub periods p0 1961 1980 p1 1981 1995 p2 1996 2005 and p3 2006 2017 and took lulc data in 1980 1990 2000 and 2010 as input to build the swat model with dynamic lulc input and time varying parameters the model parameter sensitivity analysis calibration and validation were implemented for each sub period in addition based on the meteorological data during 1961 2017 and the lulc data in 1980 1990 2000 and 2010 four swat models with static lulc input and fixed parameters was constructed to compare with the simulation results of the model based on dynamic lulc input and time varying parameters the calibration and validation schemes are shown in table 1 we used two years for all warm up periods and performed the multi site calibration using the swatplusr package schürz 2019 at monthly scale based on previous studies abbaspour et al 2015 cao et al 2021 li and fang 2021 as well as the global sensitivity analysis conducted by using the fourier amplitude sensitivity test in fast package of r language we selected 23 parameters for model calibration more information on the parameters is provided in table s2 we used the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and the coefficient of determination r2 to evaluate the simulated streamflow the r2 measures the strength of the relationship between the observations and simulations eq 1 in contrast the nse an indicator of the model efficiency measures how well the simulations agree with the observations eq 2 ayivi and jha 2018 the pbias indicates an over or under estimated tendency compared with the observations eq 3 1 r 2 i 1 n q o b s i q o b s a v g q s i m i q s i m a v g 2 i 1 n q o b s i q o b s a v g 2 i 1 n q s i m i q s i m a v g 2 2 n s

observed and simulated values respectively q obs avg and q sim avg refer to the average value of the observations and simulations respectively we also used 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu abbaspour et al 2017 of the model to describe the output uncertainty to compare the 95ppu with the adopted recharge signal two statistics indices p factor and r factor abbaspour et al 2004 abbaspour et al 2015 were employed the p factor with a range of 0 1 refers to the percentage of observed data covered by the 95ppu band whereas the r factor with a range of 0 to refers to the thickness of the 95ppu band eq 4 4 r factor 1 n t 1 n q sim t 97 5 q sim t 2 5 δ obs where q s i m t 97 5 and q s i m t 2 5 are the 97 5th upper boundary of 95ppu and 2 5th lower boundary of 95ppu percentiles of the cumulative distribution of simulation at time step t n refers to the number of data and δ o b s refers to the standard deviation of the observations a lager p factor and a smaller r factor represent more observed values were simulated by the model with a lower uncertainty abbaspour et al 2015 abbaspour et al 2015 recommended a desirable value of 0 7 for p factor and 1 5 for r factor but it should also depend on simulation scale and adequacy of the input and calibrating data 2 3 separation of lulc and climate impacts on streamflow in this study we assumed that lulc change and climate change are independent therefore their respective contributions to streamflow can be evaluated using the fixing changing method mekonnen et al 2018 yonaba et al 2021 the fixing changing method separates the impacts of lulc and climate change on streamflow by scenario simulation with fixing climate data used in base period and changing lulc or that with fixing lulc data used in base period and changing climate data in this study we divided the simulation period into four sub periods see section 2 2 3 and defined 10 simulation scenarios including four base actual scenarios s0 s3 three scenarios reflecting the influence of lulc change sl1 sl3 and three scenarios reflecting the influence of climate change sc1 sc3 table 2 based on above scenarios and taking two different periods p0 and p1 as an example the isolated relative contribution of lulc change η p 1 lu climate change η p 1 cl and the interactive effects of lulc and climate change η p 1 lu cl on the variation of average annual streamflow can be calculated as in eqs 5 7 5 η p 1 lu δ q p 0 1 lu δ q p 0 1 100 6 η p 1 cl δ q p 0 1 cl δ q p 0 1 100 7 η p 1 lu cl δ q p 0 1 lu cl δ q p 0 1 100 where q p0 1 lu q p0 1 cl and q p0 1 lu cl refer to the variations in the average annual streamflow in period p1 relative to p0 attributed to lulc change climate change and the interaction of lulc and climate change respectively δq p0 1 refers to the actual variation in the average annual streamflow in the period p1 relative to p0 the δq p0 1 can be defined as in eq 8 8 δ q p 0 1 q s 1 q s 0 δ q p 0 1 lu δ q p 0 1 cl δ q p 0 1 lu cl where q s0 and q s1 refer to the average annual streamflow under scenarios s0 and s1 respectively then q p0 1 lu q p0 1 cl and q p0 1 lu cl can be defined as in eqs 9 11 9 δ q p 0 1 lu q sl 1 q s 0 10 δ q p 0 1 cl q sc 1 q s 0 11 δ q p 0 1 lu cl q s 1 q s 0 δ q p 0 1 cl δ q p 0 1 lu where q sl1 and q sc1 are the average annual streamflow under scenarios sl1 and sc1 respectively the calculations of relative contribution of lulc change climate change and the interactive effects of lulc and climate change on the variation of average annual streamflow in periods p2 and p3 relative to p0 are similar to above 2 4 datasets of lake water area and lake level the lake water area of xiaoxingkai was obtained from the gswd v1 3 which contained 30 m landsat derived data from 1984 to 2017 and was downloaded from the google earth engine https developers google com earth engine its uncertainty defined as the unobserved component of the maximum permanent water area pekel et al 2016 was less than 5 except in 1994 7 05 fig s6 the annual mean lake level measurements from 1962 to 1987 and 2002 2014 were obtained from the ahr prc some missing records of the lake water area from 1962 to 1983 and the lake level from 1988 to 2001 were restructured based on the relationship between lake level and water area 2 5 lake water balance the change in water balance net water budget of a lake is reflected in the corresponding variations of lake level and water area zhang et al 2018 when the net water budget is positive the lake level rises and the water area expands therefore when the lake level changes slightly a small change in lake volume can be expressed as in eq 12 12 dv adl where a is the lake water area then variation in water volume v when the lake level l rises from l 1 to l 2 can be calculated as in eq 13 13 v l 1 l 2 adl assuming that the relationship between lake level and water area can be fitted with a quadratic equation eq 14 14 a a l 2 bl c then v can be calculated as 15 v l 1 l 2 a l 2 bl c dl 1 3 l 2 l 1 a 1 a 2 a l 1 l 2 1 2 b l 2 l 1 c where a 1 and a 2 are the lake water areas corresponding to the lake levels l 1 and l 2 respectively for an exorheic lake

refers to the groundwater inflow and outflow respectively in this study we assumed that g in is equal to g out and the lake water balance model can be simplified as eq 18 18 v r in p r out e h 3 results 3 1 calibration validation and evaluation of swat model we calibrated the swat model using observed streamflow data from six hydrological stations and selected 23 parameters with good performance at these stations for calibration table s2 the sensitivity of these parameters is shown in fig s2 s5 figs 3 and 4 illustrate that the simulated streamflow based on the dynamic lulc input and time varying parameter method were greatly matched with the observations at monthly and annual scale during the calibration periods in periods p0 p2 the nse values were greater than 0 5 but were slightly small 0 26 nse 0 5 during the validation period in period p0 and at some stations in period p3 fig 3 and table 3 this indicated that the simulated streamflow at these stations during 1971 1980 and 2006 2017 were somewhat unsatisfactory even though there were low nse values but all of them were greater than 0 indicating that the simulated streamflow was still better than the mean of observed values the pbias values were smaller than 25 at most stations especially at mid and downstream stations indicating that more than 75 of the observations were captured by the model at most stations the r2 values were larger than 0 6 at almost all the stations in the four periods demonstrating good agreement between the simulated and observed monthly streamflow the r factor and p factor showed a lower uncertainty of the simulations in p0 p2 than in p3 the 95ppu bandwidth was smaller than 1 5 in periods p0 p2 and approximately 81 of p factor values were larger than 0 6 indicating that more than 60 of the observations were covered by 95ppu at most stations in addition the monthly streamflow in different seasons fig 3b1 g1 b2 g2 indicated that the streamflow at the ml and lsz stations was underestimated in spring due to the inaccurate simulation of snowmelt fig 4 shows that the streamflow was underestimated at ml and lsz on the annual scale especially during the calibration period overall although the performances of the swat model were quite poor at some hydrological stations and some periods due to considering the relative high performances at all stations simultaneously the simulation results of hbz located downstream and with adequate observations showed a very high correlation r 0 85 at yearly scale with observation values throughout the entire period 1961 2017 and their fluctuations were consistent the results of the model simulations based on the static lulc input and fixed parameters showed good agreement between the simulated and observed monthly streamflow fig s7 and table s3 however the scatterplots showed that the simulated streamflow based on the time varying parameter method with dynamic lulc input was significantly better except for hbzm and yt fig 5 therefore the model based on the time varying parameters method with dynamic lulc input is more appropriate and the simulation results used in the subsequent analysis are the outputs of swat model based on the time varying parameter method with dynamic lulc input 3 2 contributions of lulc and climate change to the streamflow the annual precipitation in the xiaoxingkai lake basin experienced decreases from 1961 to 1980 5 23 mm yr 1 and from 1996 to 2005 4 28 mm yr 1 but increases from 1981 to 1995 1 26 mm yr 1 and from 2006 to 2017 5 84 mm yr 1 without an overall slight increasing trend 0 28 mm yr 1 fig 6a the annual mean temperature showed a significant increase from 1961 to 2017 with a rate of 0 034 yr 1 as well as the sub periods 1961 1980 0 010 yr 1 1981 1995 0 091 yr 1 1996 2005 0 011 yr 1 and 2006 2017 0 012 yr 1 fig 6b the land use types of xiaoxingkai lake basin were dominated by rice 47 74 52 13 agrl 24 94 31 21 and frst 7 18 9 15 fig 7 from 1980 2010 the lulc changes were featured by an increase in agrl 25 14 rice 20 15 and watr 10 51 and a decrease in wetl 39 07 past 25 94 and frst 7 85 the increased agrl was mainly caused by the reclamation of frst and past and the increased rice was mainly transformed from agrl and wetl table s5 fig 8 shows that the average streamflow into lake xiaoxingkai was 47 91 m3 s 1 54 26 m3 s 1 30 45 m3 s 1 and 51 81 m3 s 1 in scenarios s0 s3 respectively indicating that lulc and climate change in p1 and p3 promoted streamflow and changes in p2 reduced streamflow the average streamflow in scenarios sl1 sl3 was 44 76 m3 s 1 32 70 m3 s 1 and 40 28 m3 s 1 respectively suggesting that lulc change reduced streamflow in p1 p2 especially in p2 in scenarios sc1 sc3 the average streamflow values were 58 21 m3 s 1 46 73 m3 s 1 and 61 03 m3 s 1 respectively indicating that climate change increased streamflow in p1 and p3 relative to that in p0 the average streamflow increased by 6 35 m3 s 1 from p0 to p1 mainly contributed by the climate change ηcl 170 16 partly offset by lulc change ηlulc 49 67 table 4 overall climate change positively dominated streamflow from p0 to p1 the decline trends of streamflow 17 46 m3 s 1 and precipitation 34 mm were observed from p0 to p2 the lulc change dominated by the transition from frst past wetl to agrl and rice had a large impact on streamflow ηlulc 87 12 largely reducing streamflow from p0 to p3 the average streamflow increased by 3 89 m3 s 1 in that climate change e g the increase of precipitation greatly promoted streamflow ηcl 344 75 while lulc change ηlulc 195 97 and the interaction of lulc and climate change ηlulc cl 48 78 offset most of the impacts 3 3 effects of water balance components on lake volume the lake water area from 1962 to 1983 and lake level from 1988 to 2001 were reconstructed based on the quadratic polynomial model figs 9 and 10a the lake water area and lake level exhibited the same increasing trends from 1962 to 2014 with increase rates of 0 37 km2 yr 1 and 0 02 m yr 1 respectively according to eq 15 and the annual average lake level and water area we estimated the annual variations in lake volume from 1962 to 2014 fig 10b the lake volume in lake xiaoxingkai fluctuated strongly from 1962 to 2014 and showed a slightly increasing trend 0 12 106 m3 yr 1 based on above results and lake water balance the sum of human consumption and lake outflow was calculated by subtracting the lake surface evaporation and lake water volume change from the total water supply thus the average lake water volume variation and each water balance component were obtained table 5 the results showed that surface runoff into the lake and lake surface precipitation accounted for 93 61 and 6 39 of the inputs respectively the lake surface evaporation and the sum of lake outflow and human consumption accounted for 4 90 and 95 10 of the outputs respectively ultimately the climate change contributed 77 25 to the water volume change in lake xiaoxingkai the lulc change contributed 24 76 and the direct human activities such as lake outflow affected by sluice operation and human consumption contributed 47 50 fig 11 apparently the water volume change in lake xiaoxingkai were mainly driven by climate change with the non negligible impact of human activities 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty analysis of the swat model model simulations is often accompanied by some uncertainties it has been pointed out that the input dataset calibration and structure of swat model are the main sources of its output uncertainty duku et al 2015 yang et al 2021 the major input uncertainty in this study may be caused by the resampling of the spatial data to reduce operational complexity and increase computational efficiency we resampled the 30 m dem and lulc maps and a 30 arc second soil map to 90 m which may introduce some uncertainty however too much detail information generated by the input data with higher spatial resolution would result in a significant increase in running time of swat model arnold et al 2010 notter et al 2012 therefore it is acceptable to choose an appropriate spatial resolution based on computational efficiency and operational feasibility duku et al 2015 the uncertainty of parameter calibration is usually described by 95ppu quantifying through two indices p factor and r factor abbaspour et al 2017 yang et al 2021 in this study we evaluated the simulation and measurement errors using the 95ppu and the results illustrated that the uncertainty in our study was acceptable see table 3 4 2 impacts of lulc and climate change on streamflow the fixing changing method is commonly used to evaluate the impacts of lulc and climate change on streamflow berihun et al 2019 mekonnen et al 2018 op de hipt et al 2019 woldesenbet et al 2018 yonaba et al 2021 our results of ten simulation scenarios based on the fixing changing method indicated that climate change dominantly caused the variation of streamflow in the xiaoxingkai lake basin before 1995 from 1996 2005 lulc change played a dominant role and both lulc change and climate change reduced streamflow after 2006 climate change played a positive and dominant role in streamflow our results are supported by zhou et al 2019 in the amur river basin but differ from the results in some other humid areas fohrer et al 2001 musie et al 2020 wagner et al 2013 and semi arid regions yang et al 2021 where lulc change barely influenced streamflow 4 3 estimation of lake water balance lake volume variation is the essence of the change in lake water balance that is the relationship between water supply and water loss state and it is the result of multiple driving factors in this study we estimated the lake volume variation in lake xiaoxingkai based on the restructured long term continuous lake level and water area from 1962 to 2014 evaluated the proportions of different components of lake water balance and assessed the contributions of climate change and human activities to lake volume our result demonstrated that the impact of human activities on lake volume in lake xiaoxingkai 22 74 was significantly higher than that in lake qinghai 2 45 yang et al 2021 a closed lake in the semi arid region of northwestern china and it was lower than that in the baiyangdian lake basin 60 62 hu et al 2012 in eastern china because the flood discharge from lake xiaoxingkai to khanka mainly occurred from july to september during the sluice operation no sluice discharge data have been obtained so far therefore we regarded the outflow of lake xiaoxingkai as affected by human activities and deduced the volume of lake outflow and human consumption through the water balance model in future research cooperation with local departments regarding hydrology and environmental protection and long term lake hydrological monitoring should be strengthened to clarify each component of the lake water balance 5 conclusion in the past few decades the lulc and climate in the xiaoxingkai lake basin have obviously changed the changing environment has a great impact on water resources in the basin which is a challenge for regional water resources management but less been investigated in this study we successfully applied the swat model with dynamic lulc input and time varying parameters to simulate the streamflow since 1960 s and evaluate the impacts of lulc and climate change on streamflow entering the lake xiaoxingkai additionally we estimated the lake volume change and quantified the contributions of water balance components the main findings are as follows 1 the swat model based on the dynamic lulc input and time varying parameter method is more suitable for the xiaoxingkai lake basin with better performance at mid and downstream stations than upstream stations 2 the changing lulc and climate in the xiaoxingkai lake basin from 1961 to 2017 had significant impacts on streamflow with climate change hoding a dominant position in streamflow variations during 1981 1995 and 2006 2017 and lulc change during 1996 2005 3 the water volume of lake xiaoxingkai slightly increased with time 0 12 106 m3 yr 1 and its variation was mainly affected by climate change followed by lulc and human activities the estimation of the lake water balance of xiaoxingkai lake in this study was only a rough approximation due to limited monitoring data we propose developing an optimized assessment method to refine the proportion of each water balance component and investigating the nutrient concentration and lake ecosystem to realize a comprehensive simulation and analysis of water quantity quality and ecology of the lake basin our findings provided a hydrological basis and reference for future research in this basin and in other similar lake basins as well as a scientific insight for agriculture and water resource management in the khanka lake basin credit authorship contribution statement feiyan xiao

7683,study region nine mountain catchments 5 in northern and 4 in southern china study focus flash floods in small mountain catchments are some of the most frequent and most destructive natural disasters of china mixed runoff hydrological model is a popular method for flood warning and forecasting however the key factors affecting runoff components in hydrological model parameter calibration need to be further studied in this study four different overland flow routing techniques are implemented into a semi distributed mixed runoff hydrological model system mrhms which are the triangle unit hydrograph tuh geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh geomorphoclimatic instantaneous unit hydrograph gciuh and kinematic wave kw mrhms kw is the previously developed spatiotemporally mixed runoff skby model new hydrological insights for the region the study finds that sensitivity parameters of the mrhms in northern and southern china are related to their main runoff components different parameter orders in automatic calibration of mrhms result in different model performances and the suggested parameter orders are consistent with the sensitivity of parameters in northern and southern china soil moisture and primary runoff components in northern and southern china differ significantly only mrhms gciuh can achieve similar performance in northern and southern catchments mrhms gciuh therefore enhances our understanding of runoff formation mechanisms in the heterogeneous hydroclimatic landscape of china and is a promising tool for a nationwide flood prediction and flood warning system graphical abstract ga1 keywords hydrological model geomorphoclimatic instantaneous unit hydrograph sensitivity analysis china data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the semi distributed hydrological model is a popular method for simulating catchment water balance it combines distributed and lumped models to capture hydrological process spatial variability while maintaining computational efficiency beven 2011 proposed an infiltration and saturation excess model for catchment response which was extended to account for soil property spatial variability resulting in more accurate runoff generation simulations researchers kan et al 2017 rui 2013 have discovered that in humid regions of china such as the yangtze river basin and many southern parts of china where annual rainfall exceeds 800 mm vegetation thrives the vadose zone generally contains some moisture with a small water deficit that can be satisfied by a single rainfall event and may cause saturation excess runoff in contrast researchers jin et al 2015 kan et al 2017 rui 2013 wang et al 2011 have discovered that the vegetation of the arid area is usually poor and the vadose zone is very thick here evaporation exceeds precipitation by several or even ten times resulting in a significant water deficit in the vadose zone that cannot be satisfied by one rainfall event instead localized high intensity short duration rainstorms often exceed the infiltration rate and cause infiltration excess runoff in china lots of watersheds can be categorized into either saturation excess based watershed or infiltration excess based watershed and the flood forecasting usually achieves satisfactory accuracy using xinanjiang watershed rainfall runoff hydrological model xaj zhao 1984 1992 1993 and northern shaanxi watershed rainfall runoff hydrological model zhao 1984 respectively however further flood forecasting applications reveal that some watersheds cannot be accurately predicted using only the saturation excess or infiltration excess runoff generation mechanisms due to the complex spatial temporal variations and heterogeneities of the meteorological forcing hydrological processes and geological underlying conditions the saturation excess and infiltration excess mechanisms may interweave with each other for a specific watershed saturation excess and infiltration excess can successively happen at a specific location for different time or can simultaneously happen at different locations at the same time liu et al 2019b developed a spatiotemporally mixed runoff model skby model which can simultaneously consider the saturation and infiltration excess mechanisms and liu et al 2019a compared skby model with eight other hydrological models in 15 small watersheds in china they demonstrated that the skby model performed best among nine hydrological models the physical processes of rainfall runoff transformation are simulated with parameters representing soil land surface and climate properties that are optimized for each geographic location using observations however semi distributed mixed runoff hydrological models are complex due to multiple parameters and equations describing different physical processes therefore when observed discharge data are the only available data for calibrating hydrological models one of the key issues is that different sets of runoff components can provide acceptable discharge estimates qiang et al 2021 ma et al 2022 however some of these sets may include irrational runoff components for example the actual runoff components in arid regions were suggested as infiltration excess surface flow kan et al 2017 rui 2013 zhao 1984 however the models may present interflow or saturated excess flow as the primary runoff component which is completely different from the actual runoff components slope confluence also known as overland flow routing is a crucial factor in hydrological modeling as it affects the storage transfer and release of water within a drainage basin accurate representation of slope confluence can improve the performance of hydrological models by reducing uncertainty and increasing predictive accuracy the geometry and hydraulic properties of slope confluences determine how water is routed through channels or overland flow pathways to downstream areas modelling slope confluences requires accurate representation of their geometry hydraulic properties and connectivity with other parts of the watershed hornberger et al 2014 various methods have been developed to capture the complexity of slope confluences such as reasoning formula method contour of equal travel time method unit hydrograph method linear reservoir method nonlinear reservoir method and hydrodynamic method unit hydrograph is widely used to evaluate the response of the catchment to various meteorological events such as storms and floods and to estimate the flow rate characteristics of rivers and streams nash 1960 proposed a method for calculating unit hydrographs based on linear reservoir models while scs soil conservation service united states developed statistical procedures for deriving synthetic unit hydrographs mishra and singh 2003 noto and la loggia 2007 utilized remote sensing and gis techniques to integrate a distributed unit hydrograph d uh model that considers the variations in velocity between hillslopes and the stream system thereby enhancing the classical unit hydrograph theory mesa and mifflin 1986 developed a simple model to investigate the relative role of network geometry and hillslope in basin response where the network geometry is quantified in a width function that reflects the distribution of runoff with flow distance from the outlet grimaldi et al 2012 compared the one parameter width function instantaneous unit hydrograph wfiuh 1par model with the geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh model for 25 rainfall runoff flood events observed in five watersheds the parameters of d uh model wfiuh 1par model and giuh model must be calibrated for different flood events bamufleh et al 2020 developed a giuh using equivalent horton strahler ratios for flash flood prediction the parameters of the giuh can be obtained directly from digital elevation model dem data thus making this giuh applicable to different flood events with the same parameters geomorphoclimatic instantaneous unit hydrograph gciuh rodríguez iturbe et al 1982 bamufleh et al 2020 has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional unit hydrographs as it considers the effects of catchment morphology and climate on runoff response models based on gciuh provide better results than traditional models when considering variable rainfall intensity and soil moisture addor et al 2017 arash et al 2009 although many different methods of slope confluence process can be selected when establishing hydrological models it is important to choose the most suitable method to achieve accurate results once the model is set up a sensitivity analysis sa is performed to quantify the variations in its results due to variations in its parameters pianosi et al 2016 saltelli et al 2010 global sensitivity analysis gsa corresponds to evaluating the sensitivity of the model for large variations of input gsa can be used before model calibration to identify the most significant parameters and regions in the parameter space where the model produces extreme values pianosi et al 2016 there are several methods for performing gsa that generally require significant computational effort when models have more than tens of input parameters designing a sampling strategy of the parameter space applied to obtain a good representation of the input and results of the model at reasonable computational effort requires a sophisticated mathematical approach doherty 2015 erdal and cirpka 2019 gilbert et al 2016 morris 1991 sobol 2001 song et al 2015 gsa methods based on probabilistic or random sampling of the parameter space can be applied to any mathematical model that depends on multiple inputs and produces multiple outputs morris 1991 pianosi et al 2016 gsa can also be used to rank parameters according to their importance for model results usually resulting in a more reliable measure of parameter importance for non linear models at the cost of additional computational effort mishra et al 2009 song et al 2015 parameter sensitivity analysis psa of a hydrological model is key to quantifying model uncertainty however effectively validating the model and identifying dominant parameters for distributed hydrological models are impediments to achieving parameter optimization song et al 2012 the complexity of models and large number of parameters make optimization difficult psa speeds up calibration and validation by identifying which parameters produce the largest changes in model output in response to perturbations demaria et al 2007 cuo et al 2011 scollo et al 2008 several available methods for conventional psa have been proposed fang et al 2015 conducted psa using a sensitivity analysis approach called state dependent parameter method for an application of swat to kaidu river basin in china s tianshan mountains song et al 2012 assessed parameter sensitivity of a distributed hydrological model dtvgm distributed time variant gain model by combining water balance coefficient nash sutcliffe coefficient and correlation coefficient zhan et al 2013 proposed an approach that integrates morris screening method with a qualitative analysis method based on statistical emulator to analyze parameter sensitivity of dtvgm jiang et al 2015 performed psa and calibration for a distributed hims hydro information modeling system applied to china s luanhe river basin using morris screening method one factor at a time oat from these examples two aspects of psa can be identified oat has been widely used and proven useful approach psa has mostly been carried out for some typical hydrological models huang et al 2020 li et al 2021 indicate that optimizing the sensitivity parameters can greatly reduce the computational costs of swat streamflow simulations while ensuring their accuracy however it is difficult to calibrate the parameters of hydrological models in poorly gauged or ungauged basins in a study by wi et al 2015 various calibration strategies were tested for a spatially distributed hydrologic model with the aim of improving the accuracy of model simulations and understanding the uncertainty in predictions for interior ungauged sites in a sparsely gauged watershed the authors found that increasing parameter complexity did not significantly increase the uncertainty in streamflow projections despite the emergence of parameter equifinality kuchment and gelfan 2009 demonstrated that by using measurements and runoff generation models in proxy basins the number of parameters requiring calibration can be limited to two or three castiglioni et al 2010 showed that regional information can be highly effective in setting up hydrological models vélez et al 2009 reported that the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua algorithm can be used for automatic calibration of distributed conceptual models and the resulting calibrated model can be applied to ungauged basins montanari and toth 2007 discovered that the use of whittle s maximum likelihood estimator for calibrating the parameters of hydrological models could be a valuable opportunity in the context of ungauged or scarcely gauged catchments as the only information required for model parameterization is the spectral density function of the actual process simulated by the model in the application of the spatiotemporally mixed runoff hydrological model unreasonable runoff components are often obtained by automatically calibrating model parameters the common method to solve this problem is to manually modify some key parameters or narrow the range of parameters to a range with regional characteristics can the reasonable runoff components be obtained by automatically calibrating the parameters of spatiotemporally mixed runoff hydrological model is still a problem in this study the key issues that we emphasize are as follows 1 can the parameters be automatically optimized to obtain reasonable runoff components in different regions of china 2 what factors affect the results of runoff components that are automatically calibrated by the semi distributed mixed runoff hydrological model 3 does the order of calibration for hydrological model parameters affect the results to achieve these goals firstly we developed a semi distributed mixed runoff hydrological model system mrhms based on the object modeling system oms david et al 2013 and oms is coupled with the shuffled complex evolution sce global search parameter optimization algorithm mrhms coupled with four overland flow methods are referred to as model 1 mrhms tuh model 2 mrhms giuh model 3 mrhms gciuh and model 4 skby in this study the four overland flow routing methods include 1 a triangle unit hydrograph tuh saefulloh et al 2018 2 a geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh sulistyowati et al 2018 bamufleh et al 2020 3 a geomorphoclimatic instantaneous unit hydrograph gciuh arash et al 2009 and 4 kinematic wave method the same with skby model liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b mrhms can operate in both daily and hourly modes it can automatically switch between these modes during long term time series flood simulations based on whether daily or hourly data is being used and the daily mode provides the initial state variables for flood mode secondly we utilized nine typical small mountainous catchments in china with unique geomorphic and climatic characteristics thirdly for the four models hydrological parameters have been categorized into four parameter types pt based on the hydrological processes and we changed the order of parameter calibration and analyzed the sensitivity of model parameters by the sobol sensitivity analysis method sobol 2001 saltelli et al 2010 fourthly we evaluated the four models with model performances and the flood warning ability with three contingency scores fifthly the runoff components and soil moisture in different regions were analyzed finally some useful advice will be given to model developers and users as guidelines when building flood forecasting schemes in china 2 study area data and catchment properties 2 1 study area and data nine representative small mountainous catchments are located in nine different chinese provinces fig 1 anhui hubei jiangxi beijing gansu hebei jilin liaoning and henan and each catchment has different weather soil types and vegetation the classification of study catchments into north and south table 1 reflects the traditional geographical south north division of china which is called the qinling mountain huaihe river line fig 1 more detailed information about the nine catchments can be found in fig s 2 of the supplementary material file this line approximates the 0 c january isotherm and the 800 mm isohyet zhao et al 2015 the qin mountains extend along a west east axis from gansu province into shaanxi and henan provinces and act as a climatic barrier a sharp northward decrease in annual precipitation further east the climate changes more gradually from humid in southern china to semi humid and semi arid northern of the huaihe river the annual mean precipitation in the five northern catchments is on average 48 lower than in the four southern study catchments and annual mean temperature is on average 9 c lower all study catchments have in common that winters are dry and flash floods occur after intensive summer rainstorms the catchment areas range between 17 and 521 km2 table 1 and the average area of catchments is 198 km2 meteorological data are available from 27 rain gauges located within or in the close vicinity of the 9 catchments and 10 county weather stations provided by the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn fig 1 data from rain gauges and hydrological stations are available only for the summer storm events which includes hourly rainfall and hourly observed discharge data provided by china institute of water resources and hydropower research the county weather stations provide the information about daily rainfall amounts outside of the storm events and daily air temperature data on average 21 years of data are available for each study catchment with 1 3 storm events occurring per year the simulation periods and the number of storm events in each study catchment are listed in table 1 2 2 catchments properties the attributes have been selected for their potential to affect catchment hydrology e g addor et al 2017 berghuijs et al 2014 singh et al 2014 and are available for whole china the attributes are extracted from the following data sets 2 2 1 elevation topographical attributes such as altitude aspect or slope are extracted from digital elevation model dem data and the resolution of the dem in this study is 30 m which was provided by the geospatial data cloud site the computer network information center and the chinese academy of sciences http www gscloud cn 2 2 2 soil texture information about soil is provided by the soil and terrain database soter for china version 1 0 at scale 1 1 million compiled by the institute of soil science chinese academy of science issas and isric world soil information dijkshoorn et al 2008 the soil texture was resampled to 30 m with the same resolution as dem in this study 2 2 3 landuse and vegetation landuse and vegetation information is provided by the 2009 global land cover map globcover bontemps et al 2011 the land cover map has a resolution of 300 m for this study it was resampled to 30 m with the same resolution as dem 3 methodology 3 1 mrhms model the semi distributed mixed runoff hydrological model system mrhms has been developed based on the object modeling system oms david et al 2013 mrhms calculates the runoff generation processes for each sub catchment and provides daily mode and flood mode and the methods used in the daily mode are the same as those with the prms iv model see markstrom et al 2015 for the flood mode mrhms calculates the evaporation interception depression and infiltration on every sub catchment each sub catchment generates five runoff components hortonian surface runoff r h namely infiltration excess surface runoff dunnian surface runoff r d namely saturated excess surface runoff slow interflow r i fast interflow r p and groundwater flow r g respectively the two surface runoffs converge at the outlet of sub catchment through an overland flow routing process while interflows and groundwater flow directly into channel routing process fig 2 the evaporation process use an empirical method alexandris and kerkides 2003 the interception and depression processes are the same as described by leavesley et al 1983 the infiltration process uses one dimensional infiltration and water redistribution calculation methods lai et al 2015 three methods are employed in this study for the overland flow routing process triangle dimensionless unit hydrograph tuh saefulloh et al 2018 geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh bamufleh et al 2020 and geomorphoclimatic instantaneous unit hydrograph gciuh arash et al 2009 the kinematic wave method is used for the channel routing process in this study the mrhms with three overland flow routing methods are referred to as model 1 model 2 and model 3 the spatiotemporally mixed runoff skby liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b model based on the kinematic wave method hayes 1970 is referred to as model 4 all hydrological processes in the mrhms are described in detail in the supplementary material file 3 2 model calibration and validation it is relatively easy to fit peak flows accurately when calibrating for a single flood even though different models may have varying runoff components however it is crucial that the model accurately reflects the mechanism of runoff generation when calibrating over a long term series of different floods in order to investigate the main factors affecting runoff components in mrhms through automatic optimization based on observed discharge this study employs a multi step calibration technique that integrates oms with sce method hay et al 2006a 2006b for model parameter calibration in the multi step calibration technique a step is associated with a parameter set which contains one or more parameters values and a round consists of one or more steps in this study the parameters of mrhms are categorized into four parameter types pt for four steps based on the hydrological processes table 2 the ranges of parameter calibration are based on the studies by liu et al 2019b and markstrom et al 2015 parameters in pt 1 are related to evaporation and infiltration processes which mainly influence the hortonian runoff r h parameters in pt 2 primarily affect the dunnain runoff r d slow interflow r i and fast interflow r p parameters in pt 3 mainly influence the groundwater flow r g while parameters in pt 4 mainly affect overland flow routing and channel flow routing process the hydrological model is calibrated in four steps with different parameter types in each step there are 24 permutations of parameter calibration ppcs with each ppc indicating the type of parameters used in each step for example 4132 indicates that the parameters used in the first step belong to pt 4 those in the second step belong to pt 1 those in the third step belong to pt 3 and those in the last step belong to pt 2 this study involves five rounds of parameter calibration with each step obtaining optimal parameters that served as default parameters for the subsequent step as described by klemeš 1986 and shen et al 2022 there are two methods to split data into calibration and validation period that is the first 50 for calibration and the last 50 for validation when the data period length is insufficient the two data splitting schemes are the first 70 for calibration and the last 30 for validation therefore in this study due to the lack of observed daily discharge data we use 70 of flood events for calibration and the last 30 of flood events for validation as shown in table 1 in order to reduce uncertainty in initial state variables such as initial soil moisture during calibration and validation for different flood events models run with long term time series data including daily and hourly data the daily mode only provides the initial state variables for the flood mode for example out of the 30 flood events that occurred in bingyugou catchment 21 flood events from 2004 to 2012 were used for parameter calibration while the remaining nine flood events from 2013 to 2013 were used for model validation all four models calibrated the streamflow with 24 pms in the nine typical catchments with each catchment having the same default parameters and parameter ranges table 2 3 3 sensitivity analysis sobol sensitivity analysis sobol 2001 is a global sensitivity analysis method that is employed in this study to investigate the parameter sensitivity of four models initially morris screening method campolongo et al 2007 morris 1991 is used for parameter sampling subsequently the sobol sensitivity analysis method is utilized to calculate the sensitivity of parameters in nine catchments for each of the four models next we compute the average sensitivity of the same parameters for each model in northern and southern catchments to derive the parameter sensitivity of mrhms lastly we sum up the sensitivity of parameters for each parameter type in northern and southern catchments 3 4 model evaluation the evaluation of the model performance aimed to 1 assess the capacity of the model to reproduce an overall streamflow fit at the event scale and 2 evaluate its ability to accurately identify streamflow extremes i e the peak flow and the peak time which are important for flood warning the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 metric is used to assess the overall streamflow fit and the absolute peak flood error eqp and absolute difference of peak time etp are used to evaluate the performance of peak flow table 3 a warning system for flash floods depends on reliable warnings for flood events exceeding a given return period in this paper researchers evaluated the ability of four models to accurately identify streamflow extremes using flood frequency analysis the p iii distribution is used for the flood frequency analysis as it is recommended by the chinese ministry of water resources xiong et al 2015 the return periods table 3 for simulated and observed peaks have been estimated we have determined if the maximum hourly streamflow exceeded a reference flood quantile of a given return period for each storm event we consider the 2 year return period to represent common high streamflow while the 10 year return period represents a severe flood see ragettli et al 2017 for example three cases for flood prediction performance following javelle et al 2016 are identified 1 hit h when both the simulated and observed streamflow exceed the flow threshold corresponding to a specific return period indicating high flow 2 miss m when the simulated streamflow is below the threshold and does not agree with the high flow detected by observations and 3 false alert fa when the simulated streamflow indicates high flow but the observed streamflow does not three contingency scores table 3 are computed for evaluating the flood warning ability 1 the probability of detection pod which is the fraction of correct event predictions hits in all observed high flow events 2 the success rate sr which is the fraction of hits in the total number of all high flow event predictions 3 and the critical success index csi which is the fraction of hits in the total number of event predictions plus the number of missed observations 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of the calibration order for four models in order to explore the influence of parameter calibration order on the calibration results of hydrological model we conducted calibration for 24 different permutations of parameter calibration ppcs in nine catchments and then subsequently validated the model using identical parameter values across all 24 ppcs with the continuous performance nse of all flood events in validation period were calculated fig 3 illustrates the minimum median and maximum nse values obtained for 24 ppcs in the five northern catchments the results show that all four models each with 24 ppcs exhibit significant variation in the minimum median and maximum nse values the minimum nse values for model 1 model 2 model 3 and model 4 range from 0 09 to 0 40 0 13 0 58 0 17 0 63 and 0 10 0 35 respectively the median nse values for model 1 model 2 model 3 and model 4 range from 0 37 to 0 60 0 36 0 75 0 50 0 86 and from 0 18 to 0 61 respectively the maximum nse values for model 1 model 2 model 3 and model 4 range from 0 59 to 0 74 0 57 0 87 0 66 0 95 and from 0 41 to 0 80 respectively comparing with the nse values of 24 ppcs reveals that for all four models 4132 has the highest median nse value this indicates that the best ppcs in northern china s five catchments is 4132 thus suggesting that when calibrating hydrological models in the catchments of northern china it is recommended to follow a specific order the first calibration step should involve calibrating the parameters of the routing processes which includes overland flow routing and channel routing processes the second calibration step should focus on calibrating the parameters of the surface runoff generation processes such as evaporation and infiltration processes in the third calibration step it is recommended to calibrate the parameters of groundwater finally in the last calibration step it is suggested to calibrate the parameters of subsurface processes such as fast interflow and slow interflow processes fig 4 illustrates the minimum median and maximum nse values obtained for 24 ppcs in the four southern catchments the results show that all four models each with 24 ppcs also exhibit significant variation in the minimum median and maximum nse values the minimum nse values for model 1 model 2 model 3 and model 4 range from 0 22 to 0 72 0 36 0 72 0 45 0 68 and 0 04 0 73 respectively the median nse values for model 1 model 2 model 3 and model 4 range from 0 53 to 0 80 0 57 0 81 0 67 0 82 and from 0 58 to 0 77 respectively the maximum nse values for model 1 model 2 model 3 and model 4 range from 0 61 to 0 82 0 62 0 81 0 77 0 84 and from 0 64 to 0 84 respectively comparing with the nse values of 24 ppcs reveals that for all four models 2341 has the highest median nse value this indicates that the best ppcs in southern china s four catchments is 2341 thus suggesting that when calibrating hydrological models in the catchments of southern china it is recommended to follow a specific order the first calibration step should involve calibrating the parameters of the subsurface processes such as fast interflow and slow interflow processes the second calibration step should focus on calibrating the parameters of groundwater in the third calibration step it is recommended to calibrate the parameters of the routing processes which includes overland flow routing and channel routing processes finally in the last calibration step it is suggested to calibrate the parameters of the surface runoff generation processes such as evaporation and infiltration processes fig 3 and fig 4 indicate that the influence of the parameter order of the hydrological model on the model results is different in the north and south of china the best ppc in the north and south of china are 4132 and 2341 respectively the ppc 1234 means that the order of parameter calibration is the same as the hydrological process order from surface runoff generation processes subsurface flow groundwater flow to overland flow routing and channel routing process which was not the best ppc in both northern and southern china in this study 4 2 sensitivity analysis fig 5 presents the parameter sensitivity spectrum of mrhms which was calculated using sobol sensitivity analysis the results indicate that the parameter sensitivity of mrhms differs in northern and southern china in the northern catchments the parameters of routing processes α ω and m ω are parameters of channel routing process and k v is parameter of gciuh have the highest sensitivity as shown in table 2 and fig 5 a the next sensitive parameters are the percentage of preferential flow d p and soil depth h in the southern catchments parameters of subsurface flow processes including fast interflow and slow interflow have the highest sensitivity as shown in table 2 and fig 5 a ground water linear coefficient k g follows as the next important parameter in southern catchments in both northern and southern catchments the evaporating dish conversion coefficient k c is the least sensitive parameter with a total index of sobol sensitivity of less than 1 this may be because during the flood process evaporation has a minimal impact due to its short duration after summarizing the parameter sensitivity for each parameter type pie graphs in fig 5 indicate that pt4 representing overland flow and channel flow parameters table 2 is the highest sensitivity parameter type in northern catchments while pt2 representing subsurface parameters table 2 is in southern catchments pt1 representing infiltration and evaporation parameters table 2 is the parameter type with the second highest sensitivity in northern catchments while pt3 representing groundwater parameters table 2 holds this designation in southern catchments the third sensitive parameter types are pt3 and pt 4 in northern and southern catchments respectively the least sensitive parameter types are pt2 and pt 1 in northern and southern catchments respectively these results are consistent with the results of automatic calibration with 24 ppcs in the following parts of this study the ppc 4132 and ppc 2341 were applied in the northern and southern catchments respectively the results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that in dry regions the primary component of runoff is infiltration excess surface flow and the most sensitive parameters are those that control infiltration excess surface flow processes however in wet regions the primary component of runoff is interflow and the most sensitive parameters are those that control interflow processes 4 3 model performance comparisons 4 3 1 model performance comparisons based on nse eqp and etp as presented in table 4 the continuous nse which has been calculated using all flood data during the calibration or validation period values of all four models during the calibration period exceeded 0 50 during the validation period model 3 outperformed the other three models in bingyugou manjiang baiyachang yaodian peihe songbai and qingyang meanwhile model 2 performed the best among the four models in wangan and model 4 yielded the highest performance among them in zhangdou for the 4 models the average continuous nse of the five northern catchments during the validation period are 0 60 0 73 0 80 and 0 52 respectively and the average continuous nse of the four southern catchments during the validation period are 0 78 0 79 0 79 and 0 77 respectively these indicate that the model 3 performs best in the five northern catchments and all four models can perform well in the four southern catchments without obvious difference difference of nse is less than 0 1 according to the standard for hydrological information and hydrological forecasting in china liang 2010 the forecasting results are acceptable when the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is greater than 0 5 and rainfall runoff forecasting uses 20 of the measured peak flow as the allowable error the allowable error for the peak time is 30 of the time difference between the forecast time and the actual peak flow time and if it is less than 3 h or one calculation period then 3 h or one calculation period is used as the allowable error in this paper we use the criteria of nse 0 5 and eqp 20 to define good liang 2010 additionally since our calculation interval is 1 h we consider etp 1 h as meeting the good standard liang 2010 table 5 presents the average percentage values of good for all flood events across the three hydrological model performances nse eqp and etp in the northern and southern catchments the average good percentage of nse in northern catchments for the four models are 71 9 68 4 72 0 and 56 0 in southern catchments the average good percentage of nse for the four models are 71 2 74 0 76 1 and 70 0 this indicates that model 3 has the best nse performance the average good percentage of eqp in northern catchments for the four models are 70 2 71 5 77 8 and 69 1 in southern catchments the average good percentage of eqp for the four models is 63 2 67 9 70 5 and 67 4 this indicates that model 3 has the best performance in eqp in both northern and southern catchments with model 2 coming second the average good percentage of etp in northern china for the four models are 48 2 51 2 76 6 and 49 1 in southern china on the other hand they are 53 0 58 3 62 7 and 48 9 this also shows that model 3 has better performance in etp than other models in both northern and southern catchments with model2 following closely behind in conclusion these results confirm that model 3 has better overall performance compared to other models across all three hydrological model performances nse eqp and etp when analyzing flood events across both northern and southern catchments in china 4 3 2 model performance comparisons based on contingency scores the results of the contingency scores all data including calibration and validation periods evaluating the flood warning performance are presented in table 6 this study reaches average pod scores of 0 79 0 90 for 2 year floods and 0 69 0 80 for 10 year floods the csi scores that are achieved for the same return periods are 0 55 0 76 and 0 43 0 63 respectively zhang et al 2022 have set up encoder decoder lstm model for flood prediction in china the average pod and csi scores for 2 year return periods that they calculated are 0 79 and 0 66 respectively for separate regions of china these values increase to up to 0 89 and 0 76 which are similar to the scores calculated in this study pod 0 72 0 90 csi 0 55 0 76 table 6 the large difference between pod and csi indicates that the number of false alerts was high for the 2 year return period events the model 3 had the best performances for detecting streamflow peaks pod values of 0 90 sr values of 0 82 and csi values of 0 76 considering all catchments the performance pod of the model 3 was 8 higher than the other models similarly model 3 has a better success rate and critical success index in comparison to the other 3 models for the 10 year return period events all models contingency scores decreased by at least 8 in line with the 2 year return period predictions model 3 showed the best performance pod of 0 8 considering all catchments the results of model 4 table 6 indicate that model detection performances were affected by the climate in wetter climate i e the southern catchments better prediction abilities were observed than in the drier regions i e the northern catchments this finding is consistent with the research conducted by adamovic et al 2016 ragettli et al 2017 and zhang et al 2022 on the other hand models 1 2 and 3 had slightly better prediction abilities in drier regions compared to wetter regions this suggests that the mrhms model based on unit hydrograph has better prediction abilities than the one based on kinematic wave 4 3 3 model performance comparisons based on scatter plots fig 6 shows scatterplots and related statistics based on the discharge of nine catchments for the four models the results indicate that for bingyugou baiyachang yaodian wangan zhangdou and peihe catchment the model 3 performed the best out of the four models this was evidenced by its lowest rmse value of 29 2 m3 s 8 9 m3 s 12 3 m3 s 35 3 m3 s 5 8 m3 s and 4 8 m3 s respectively and its highest cc value 0 95 0 92 0 94 0 94 0 90 and 0 92 respectively as shown in fig 6 however for the manjiang songbai and qingyang catchment all four models had similar values of rmse and cc after comparing the linear regression lines of the four models in each catchment it was observed that all linear regression lines were on the lower right side of the reference line this indicates that all models generally underestimated discharge in nine catchments except for model 3 in the wangan catchment this underestimation could be attributed to the objective function used during the calibration period which was nse the calibration results obtained from nse consider the goodness of fit between the overall simulated data and overall observed data however since most of the data in the dataset are much smaller than the flood peak values a good fit with these data does not necessarily indicate a good fit with the flood peak values this means that the simulated flood peak values are usually smaller than the observed flood peak values resulting in the underestimation shown in fig 7 to address the issue of underestimation one potential solution is to employ alternative objective functions that consider the flood peak values also known as high flow for instance nsqp ragettli et al 2017 or kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 mizukami et al 2019 could be used for calibration there were only thirteen flood events recorded in the ten years of data available in the wangan basin table 1 and out of these only three were relatively large flood events refer to fig s 7 in the supplementary material file in these three flood events the peak flows simulated by model 3 closely matched the observed peak flows whereas the peaks simulated by the other three models were all lower than the observed peaks this difference is attributed to model 3 s accurate simulation of the runoff components hence as shown in fig 7 model 3 did not underestimate the flow in the wangan basin more streamflow information for the four models during the calibration and validation periods can be found in the supplementary material file 4 4 runoff components and soil moisture as shown in table 4 nse value of model 3 in yaodian catchment in northern china is above 0 85 in the both calibration and validation periods while nse values of the other three models are less than 0 7 yaodian catchment is in the northwest of china where it is usually dry runoff generation is more likely to occur due to infiltration excess jin et al 2015 kan et al 2017 rui 2013 zhao 1984 in order to find out why model 3 is much better than the other three models in yaodian we analyzed the runoff components of all four model for example fig 7 shows the simulated flood process in yaodian catchment on august 7 2003 the main runoff component of models 1 2 and 4 are fast interflow while the main runoff component of model 3 is hortonian i e infiltration excess flow four models have the same runoff generation methods the only difference is their overland flow routing method model 1 employs a triangle unit hydrograph tuh which has a constant peak time t p for different flood events in a given catchment resulting in a fixed basin lag time i e the time between the center of mass of rainfall and the center of mass of runoff across events model 2 relies on a geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh whose parameters come directly from the digital elevation model dem the equivalent velocity of giuh remains constant across different flood events resulting in uniform basin lag time model 3 couples with geomorphoclimatic instantaneous unit hydrograph gciuh that describes basin lag time as a function of surface runoff intensity this implies that higher surface runoff intensity leads to shorter basin lag time causing variable basin lag times across flood events lastly model 4 uses skby model which employs kinematic wave for overland flow routing process and specifies basin lag times during parameterization therefore models 1 2 and 4 exhibit constant basin lag times during long term series floods simulation while model 3 shows variable basin lag times due to varying surface runoff intensity this indicates than in the four overland flow routing methods only gciuh can simulate different basin lag time in different flood events during a long term series of flood simulations this explains why model 3 generally performs better than the other three models such as yaodian catchment as shown in table 7 furthermore this indicates that the model s structure plays a crucial role in the accuracy of the mrhms simulations the results indicate that the mechanism of runoff generation revealed by model 3 is closer to the actual situation therefore model 3 was applied for the comparison of the runoff components and soil moisture in northern and southern catchments as shown in table 7 the average value of soil moisture at the time of the peak flow i e the soil water content in southern catchments is 0 38 which is much higher than in northern catchments 0 17 and the soil moisture of 10 year floods is higher than that of 2 year floods as shown in table 7 the average fraction of hortonian value in northern catchments is 0 89 which is significantly greater than it in southern catchments 0 09 the mean fractions of fast interflow and slow interflow in southern catchments are 0 45 and 0 43 respectively which are significantly greater than those in northern catchments 0 02 and 0 04 respectively the mean fraction of fast interflow in the northern rises from 0 04 to 0 10 with the increase in precipitation when comparing 2 year floods with 10 year floods similarly the mean fraction of slow interflow in the northern rises from 0 07 to 0 16 this shows that in the northern catchments as precipitation increases soil moisture increases leading to a higher fraction of fast interflow and slow interflow however the main runoff component remains hortonian i e infiltration excess surface runoff table 7 shows that in both northern and southern catchments the fraction of dunnian saturation excess surface flow and groundwater flow are less than 0 05 this indicates that it is difficult for the soil to reach saturation during the short duration floods in small mountainous catchments and the short duration precipitation has little effect on groundwater ragettli et al 2017 analyzed 35 catchments in china using prms oms and applied a classification and regression tree cart method to explore parameter transferability in the full space of catchment descriptors for hydrological modelling zhang et al 2022 compared prms oms cart regional pub prediction in ungagged basins and the encoder decoder long short term memory neural network ed lstm model in 35 catchments across china liu et al 2019a compared the skby model model 4 in this study with eight other hydrological models in 15 small watersheds in china and found that skby performed better than the other eight models they found that all these models perform better in southern china than in northern china in this study we found that the model 3 mrhms gciuh presented in this study performs better than model 4 skby and model 3 perform well in both southern and northern china according to zhang et al 2022 for deep learning models it is essential to focus on developing model structures that can be adaptable in dry regions one approach is the development of physically informed hybrid models that embed the hydrological dynamics into the recurrent neural network architecture 5 conclusions in this study we aimed to investigate the factors that influence the calibration of hydrological models using a semi distributed mixed runoff hydrological model system mrhms to achieve this goal we integrated four different slope confluence methods into the mrhms model and categorized the hydrological model parameters based on the hydrological process we then examined whether changing the order of different parameter types in parameter calibration would affect the results of parameter calibration in nine typical small mountain catchments five in northern china and four in southern china we compared and analyzed the runoff components and parameter sensitivity in different regions based on our findings we draw the following main conclusions 1 the sensitivity parameters of the mrhms in northern and southern china are related to their main runoff components in northern china the most sensitive parameters are those that govern infiltration excess surface flow processes while in southern china the most sensitive parameters are those that control interflow processes 2 different parameter orders in automatic calibration of mrhms result in different model performances and the suggested parameter orders in northern and southern catchments are ppc 4132 and 2341 respectively these recommended parameter orders are consistent with the sensitivity of the parameters in northern and southern china 3 the model structure is also very important for hydrological models in the four mrhms models mrhms tuh mrhms giuh and skby models exhibit superior performance in southern catchments compared to northern catchments however mrhms gciuh model can equally represent streamflows in both northern and southern catchments and outperforms the other three models due to its consideration of variable rainfall intensity 4 soil moisture at the time of peak flow and primary runoff components differ significantly between northern and southern china by automatic parameter calibration of the mrhms gciuh model soil moisture in northern china is lower than in southern china and the major runoff component in northern china is infiltration excess surface runoff while in southern china it is subsurface runoff overall overall the mrhms gciuh model enhances our understanding of runoff formation mechanisms in china s heterogeneous hydroclimatic landscape it offers reliable runoff components and accurate peak time simulations making it a promising tool for a nationwide flood prediction and warning system this paper presents some useful conclusions but there are still some limitations in the study firstly although the mrhms model can automatically switch between daily and flood modes during calculation due to the lack of observed daily runoff data the model only uses observed flood data for parameter calibration and model verification there is no observation data available for runoff components in different catchments for model calibration and verification and only qualitative analysis of runoff components from literature reviews is possible if there are observed daily runoff data and runoff components available in future research the applicability of mrhms model will be better verified secondly none of the nine catchments studied are located in the qinghai tibet plateau or northwest china further research may consider catchments in these regions to provide more comprehensive conclusions that may be applicable to these regions therefore the conclusions drawn from this study may not necessarily be applicable to these regions the mrhms gciuh model can effectively capture the interaction between soil rainfall evaporation and streamflow making it suitable for future deep learning applications by incorporating hydrological dynamics into recurrent neural network architecture deep learning models can be applied more widely beyond the regimes covered by training data therefore using mrhms gciuh model for analysis of runoff generation driving factors with continuous daily and flood data can provide valuable insights into factors affecting runoff generation this will be particularly helpful for future research using machine learning techniques in hydrology credit authorship contribution statement lei wen conceptualization

7683,study region nine mountain catchments 5 in northern and 4 in southern china study focus flash floods in small mountain catchments are some of the most frequent and most destructive natural disasters of china mixed runoff hydrological model is a popular method for flood warning and forecasting however the key factors affecting runoff components in hydrological model parameter calibration need to be further studied in this study four different overland flow routing techniques are implemented into a semi distributed mixed runoff hydrological model system mrhms which are the triangle unit hydrograph tuh geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh geomorphoclimatic instantaneous unit hydrograph gciuh and kinematic wave kw mrhms kw is the previously developed spatiotemporally mixed runoff skby model new hydrological insights for the region the study finds that sensitivity parameters of the mrhms in northern and southern china are related to their main runoff components different parameter orders in automatic calibration of mrhms result in different model performances and the suggested parameter orders are consistent with the sensitivity of parameters in northern and southern china soil moisture and primary runoff components in northern and southern china differ significantly only mrhms gciuh can achieve similar performance in northern and southern catchments mrhms gciuh therefore enhances our understanding of runoff formation mechanisms in the heterogeneous hydroclimatic landscape of china and is a promising tool for a nationwide flood prediction and flood warning system graphical abstract ga1 keywords hydrological model geomorphoclimatic instantaneous unit hydrograph sensitivity analysis china data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the semi distributed hydrological model is a popular method for simulating catchment water balance it combines distributed and lumped models to capture hydrological process spatial variability while maintaining computational efficiency beven 2011 proposed an infiltration and saturation excess model for catchment response which was extended to account for soil property spatial variability resulting in more accurate runoff generation simulations researchers kan et al 2017 rui 2013 have discovered that in humid regions of china such as the yangtze river basin and many southern parts of china where annual rainfall exceeds 800 mm vegetation thrives the vadose zone generally contains some moisture with a small water deficit that can be satisfied by a single rainfall event and may cause saturation excess runoff in contrast researchers jin et al 2015 kan et al 2017 rui 2013 wang et al 2011 have discovered that the vegetation of the arid area is usually poor and the vadose zone is very thick here evaporation exceeds precipitation by several or even ten times resulting in a significant water deficit in the vadose zone that cannot be satisfied by one rainfall event instead localized high intensity short duration rainstorms often exceed the infiltration rate and cause infiltration excess runoff in china lots of watersheds can be categorized into either saturation excess based watershed or infiltration excess based watershed and the flood forecasting usually achieves satisfactory accuracy using xinanjiang watershed rainfall runoff hydrological model xaj zhao 1984 1992 1993 and northern shaanxi watershed rainfall runoff hydrological model zhao 1984 respectively however further flood forecasting applications reveal that some watersheds cannot be accurately predicted using only the saturation excess or infiltration excess runoff generation mechanisms due to the complex spatial temporal variations and heterogeneities of the meteorological forcing hydrological processes and geological underlying conditions the saturation excess and infiltration excess mechanisms may interweave with each other for a specific watershed saturation excess and infiltration excess can successively happen at a specific location for different time or can simultaneously happen at different locations at the same time liu et al 2019b developed a spatiotemporally mixed runoff model skby model which can simultaneously consider the saturation and infiltration excess mechanisms and liu et al 2019a compared skby model with eight other hydrological models in 15 small watersheds in china they demonstrated that the skby model performed best among nine hydrological models the physical processes of rainfall runoff transformation are simulated with parameters representing soil land surface and climate properties that are optimized for each geographic location using observations however semi distributed mixed runoff hydrological models are complex due to multiple parameters and equations describing different physical processes therefore when observed discharge data are the only available data for calibrating hydrological models one of the key issues is that different sets of runoff components can provide acceptable discharge estimates qiang et al 2021 ma et al 2022 however some of these sets may include irrational runoff components for example the actual runoff components in arid regions were suggested as infiltration excess surface flow kan et al 2017 rui 2013 zhao 1984 however the models may present interflow or saturated excess flow as the primary runoff component which is completely different from the actual runoff components slope confluence also known as overland flow routing is a crucial factor in hydrological modeling as it affects the storage transfer and release of water within a drainage basin accurate representation of slope confluence can improve the performance of hydrological models by reducing uncertainty and increasing predictive accuracy the geometry and hydraulic properties of slope confluences determine how water is routed through channels or overland flow pathways to downstream areas modelling slope confluences requires accurate representation of their geometry hydraulic properties and connectivity with other parts of the watershed hornberger et al 2014 various methods have been developed to capture the complexity of slope confluences such as reasoning formula method contour of equal travel time method unit hydrograph method linear reservoir method nonlinear reservoir method and hydrodynamic method unit hydrograph is widely used to evaluate the response of the catchment to various meteorological events such as storms and floods and to estimate the flow rate characteristics of rivers and streams nash 1960 proposed a method for calculating unit hydrographs based on linear reservoir models while scs soil conservation service united states developed statistical procedures for deriving synthetic unit hydrographs mishra and singh 2003 noto and la loggia 2007 utilized remote sensing and gis techniques to integrate a distributed unit hydrograph d uh model that considers the variations in velocity between hillslopes and the stream system thereby enhancing the classical unit hydrograph theory mesa and mifflin 1986 developed a simple model to investigate the relative role of network geometry and hillslope in basin response where the network geometry is quantified in a width function that reflects the distribution of runoff with flow distance from the outlet grimaldi et al 2012 compared the one parameter width function instantaneous unit hydrograph wfiuh 1par model with the geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh model for 25 rainfall runoff flood events observed in five watersheds the parameters of d uh model wfiuh 1par model and giuh model must be calibrated for different flood events bamufleh et al 2020 developed a giuh using equivalent horton strahler ratios for flash flood prediction the parameters of the giuh can be obtained directly from digital elevation model dem data thus making this giuh applicable to different flood events with the same parameters geomorphoclimatic instantaneous unit hydrograph gciuh rodríguez iturbe et al 1982 bamufleh et al 2020 has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional unit hydrographs as it considers the effects of catchment morphology and climate on runoff response models based on gciuh provide better results than traditional models when considering variable rainfall intensity and soil moisture addor et al 2017 arash et al 2009 although many different methods of slope confluence process can be selected when establishing hydrological models it is important to choose the most suitable method to achieve accurate results once the model is set up a sensitivity analysis sa is performed to quantify the variations in its results due to variations in its parameters pianosi et al 2016 saltelli et al 2010 global sensitivity analysis gsa corresponds to evaluating the sensitivity of the model for large variations of input gsa can be used before model calibration to identify the most significant parameters and regions in the parameter space where the model produces extreme values pianosi et al 2016 there are several methods for performing gsa that generally require significant computational effort when models have more than tens of input parameters designing a sampling strategy of the parameter space applied to obtain a good representation of the input and results of the model at reasonable computational effort requires a sophisticated mathematical approach doherty 2015 erdal and cirpka 2019 gilbert et al 2016 morris 1991 sobol 2001 song et al 2015 gsa methods based on probabilistic or random sampling of the parameter space can be applied to any mathematical model that depends on multiple inputs and produces multiple outputs morris 1991 pianosi et al 2016 gsa can also be used to rank parameters according to their importance for model results usually resulting in a more reliable measure of parameter importance for non linear models at the cost of additional computational effort mishra et al 2009 song et al 2015 parameter sensitivity analysis psa of a hydrological model is key to quantifying model uncertainty however effectively validating the model and identifying dominant parameters for distributed hydrological models are impediments to achieving parameter optimization song et al 2012 the complexity of models and large number of parameters make optimization difficult psa speeds up calibration and validation by identifying which parameters produce the largest changes in model output in response to perturbations demaria et al 2007 cuo et al 2011 scollo et al 2008 several available methods for conventional psa have been proposed fang et al 2015 conducted psa using a sensitivity analysis approach called state dependent parameter method for an application of swat to kaidu river basin in china s tianshan mountains song et al 2012 assessed parameter sensitivity of a distributed hydrological model dtvgm distributed time variant gain model by combining water balance coefficient nash sutcliffe coefficient and correlation coefficient zhan et al 2013 proposed an approach that integrates morris screening method with a qualitative analysis method based on statistical emulator to analyze parameter sensitivity of dtvgm jiang et al 2015 performed psa and calibration for a distributed hims hydro information modeling system applied to china s luanhe river basin using morris screening method one factor at a time oat from these examples two aspects of psa can be identified oat has been widely used and proven useful approach psa has mostly been carried out for some typical hydrological models huang et al 2020 li et al 2021 indicate that optimizing the sensitivity parameters can greatly reduce the computational costs of swat streamflow simulations while ensuring their accuracy however it is difficult to calibrate the parameters of hydrological models in poorly gauged or ungauged basins in a study by wi et al 2015 various calibration strategies were tested for a spatially distributed hydrologic model with the aim of improving the accuracy of model simulations and understanding the uncertainty in predictions for interior ungauged sites in a sparsely gauged watershed the authors found that increasing parameter complexity did not significantly increase the uncertainty in streamflow projections despite the emergence of parameter equifinality kuchment and gelfan 2009 demonstrated that by using measurements and runoff generation models in proxy basins the number of parameters requiring calibration can be limited to two or three castiglioni et al 2010 showed that regional information can be highly effective in setting up hydrological models vélez et al 2009 reported that the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua algorithm can be used for automatic calibration of distributed conceptual models and the resulting calibrated model can be applied to ungauged basins montanari and toth 2007 discovered that the use of whittle s maximum likelihood estimator for calibrating the parameters of hydrological models could be a valuable opportunity in the context of ungauged or scarcely gauged catchments as the only information required for model parameterization is the spectral density function of the actual process simulated by the model in the application of the spatiotemporally mixed runoff hydrological model unreasonable runoff components are often obtained by automatically calibrating model parameters the common method to solve this problem is to manually modify some key parameters or narrow the range of parameters to a range with regional characteristics can the reasonable runoff components be obtained by automatically calibrating the parameters of spatiotemporally mixed runoff hydrological model is still a problem in this study the key issues that we emphasize are as follows 1 can the parameters be automatically optimized to obtain reasonable runoff components in different regions of china 2 what factors affect the results of runoff components that are automatically calibrated by the semi distributed mixed runoff hydrological model 3 does the order of calibration for hydrological model parameters affect the results to achieve these goals firstly we developed a semi distributed mixed runoff hydrological model system mrhms based on the object modeling system oms david et al 2013 and oms is coupled with the shuffled complex evolution sce global search parameter optimization algorithm mrhms coupled with four overland flow methods are referred to as model 1 mrhms tuh model 2 mrhms giuh model 3 mrhms gciuh and model 4 skby in this study the four overland flow routing methods include 1 a triangle unit hydrograph tuh saefulloh et al 2018 2 a geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh sulistyowati et al 2018 bamufleh et al 2020 3 a geomorphoclimatic instantaneous unit hydrograph gciuh arash et al 2009 and 4 kinematic wave method the same with skby model liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b mrhms can operate in both daily and hourly modes it can automatically switch between these modes during long term time series flood simulations based on whether daily or hourly data is being used and the daily mode provides the initial state variables for flood mode secondly we utilized nine typical small mountainous catchments in china with unique geomorphic and climatic characteristics thirdly for the four models hydrological parameters have been categorized into four parameter types pt based on the hydrological processes and we changed the order of parameter calibration and analyzed the sensitivity of model parameters by the sobol sensitivity analysis method sobol 2001 saltelli et al 2010 fourthly we evaluated the four models with model performances and the flood warning ability with three contingency scores fifthly the runoff components and soil moisture in different regions were analyzed finally some useful advice will be given to model developers and users as guidelines when building flood forecasting schemes in china 2 study area data and catchment properties 2 1 study area and data nine representative small mountainous catchments are located in nine different chinese provinces fig 1 anhui hubei jiangxi beijing gansu hebei jilin liaoning and henan and each catchment has different weather soil types and vegetation the classification of study catchments into north and south table 1 reflects the traditional geographical south north division of china which is called the qinling mountain huaihe river line fig 1 more detailed information about the nine catchments can be found in fig s 2 of the supplementary material file this line approximates the 0 c january isotherm and the 800 mm isohyet zhao et al 2015 the qin mountains extend along a west east axis from gansu province into shaanxi and henan provinces and act as a climatic barrier a sharp northward decrease in annual precipitation further east the climate changes more gradually from humid in southern china to semi humid and semi arid northern of the huaihe river the annual mean precipitation in the five northern catchments is on average 48 lower than in the four southern study catchments and annual mean temperature is on average 9 c lower all study catchments have in common that winters are dry and flash floods occur after intensive summer rainstorms the catchment areas range between 17 and 521 km2 table 1 and the average area of catchments is 198 km2 meteorological data are available from 27 rain gauges located within or in the close vicinity of the 9 catchments and 10 county weather stations provided by the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn fig 1 data from rain gauges and hydrological stations are available only for the summer storm events which includes hourly rainfall and hourly observed discharge data provided by china institute of water resources and hydropower research the county weather stations provide the information about daily rainfall amounts outside of the storm events and daily air temperature data on average 21 years of data are available for each study catchment with 1 3 storm events occurring per year the simulation periods and the number of storm events in each study catchment are listed in table 1 2 2 catchments properties the attributes have been selected for their potential to affect catchment hydrology e g addor et al 2017 berghuijs et al 2014 singh et al 2014 and are available for whole china the attributes are extracted from the following data sets 2 2 1 elevation topographical attributes such as altitude aspect or slope are extracted from digital elevation model dem data and the resolution of the dem in this study is 30 m which was provided by the geospatial data cloud site the computer network information center and the chinese academy of sciences http www gscloud cn 2 2 2 soil texture information about soil is provided by the soil and terrain database soter for china version 1 0 at scale 1 1 million compiled by the institute of soil science chinese academy of science issas and isric world soil information dijkshoorn et al 2008 the soil texture was resampled to 30 m with the same resolution as dem in this study 2 2 3 landuse and vegetation landuse and vegetation information is provided by the 2009 global land cover map globcover bontemps et al 2011 the land cover map has a resolution of 300 m for this study it was resampled to 30 m with the same resolution as dem 3 methodology 3 1 mrhms model the semi distributed mixed runoff hydrological model system mrhms has been developed based on the object modeling system oms david et al 2013 mrhms calculates the runoff generation processes for each sub catchment and provides daily mode and flood mode and the methods used in the daily mode are the same as those with the prms iv model see markstrom et al 2015 for the flood mode mrhms calculates the evaporation interception depression and infiltration on every sub catchment each sub catchment generates five runoff components hortonian surface runoff r h namely infiltration excess surface runoff dunnian surface runoff r d namely saturated excess surface runoff slow interflow r i fast interflow r p and groundwater flow r g respectively the two surface runoffs converge at the outlet of sub catchment through an overland flow routing process while interflows and groundwater flow directly into channel routing process fig 2 the evaporation process use an empirical method alexandris and kerkides 2003 the interception and depression processes are the same as described by leavesley et al 1983 the infiltration process uses one dimensional infiltration and water redistribution calculation methods lai et al 2015 three methods are employed in this study for the overland flow routing process triangle dimensionless unit hydrograph tuh saefulloh et al 2018 geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh bamufleh et al 2020 and geomorphoclimatic instantaneous unit hydrograph gciuh arash et al 2009 the kinematic wave method is used for the channel routing process in this study the mrhms with three overland flow routing methods are referred to as model 1 model 2 and model 3 the spatiotemporally mixed runoff skby liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b model based on the kinematic wave method hayes 1970 is referred to as model 4 all hydrological processes in the mrhms are described in detail in the supplementary material file 3 2 model calibration and validation it is relatively easy to fit peak flows accurately when calibrating for a single flood even though different models may have varying runoff components however it is crucial that the model accurately reflects the mechanism of runoff generation when calibrating over a long term series of different floods in order to investigate the main factors affecting runoff components in mrhms through automatic optimization based on observed discharge this study employs a multi step calibration technique that integrates oms with sce method hay et al 2006a 2006b for model parameter calibration in the multi step calibration technique a step is associated with a parameter set which contains one or more parameters values and a round consists of one or more steps in this study the parameters of mrhms are categorized into four parameter types pt for four steps based on the hydrological processes table 2 the ranges of parameter calibration are based on the studies by liu et al 2019b and markstrom et al 2015 parameters in pt 1 are related to evaporation and infiltration processes which mainly influence the hortonian runoff r h parameters in pt 2 primarily affect the dunnain runoff r d slow interflow r i and fast interflow r p parameters in pt 3 mainly influence the groundwater flow r g while parameters in pt 4 mainly affect overland flow routing and channel flow routing process the hydrological model is calibrated in four steps with different parameter types in each step there are 24 permutations of parameter calibration ppcs with each ppc indicating the type of parameters used in each step for example 4132 indicates that the parameters used in the first step belong to pt 4 those in the second step belong to pt 1 those in the third step belong to pt 3 and those in the last step belong to pt 2 this study involves five rounds of parameter calibration with each step obtaining optimal parameters that served as default parameters for the subsequent step as described by klemeš 1986 and shen et al 2022 there are two methods to split data into calibration and validation period that is the first 50 for calibration and the last 50 for validation when the data period length is insufficient the two data splitting schemes are the first 70 for calibration and the last 30 for validation therefore in this study due to the lack of observed daily discharge data we use 70 of flood events for calibration and the last 30 of flood events for validation as shown in table 1 in order to reduce uncertainty in initial state variables such as initial soil moisture during calibration and validation for different flood events models run with long term time series data including daily and hourly data the daily mode only provides the initial state variables for the flood mode for example out of the 30 flood events that occurred in bingyugou catchment 21 flood events from 2004 to 2012 were used for parameter calibration while the remaining nine flood events from 2013 to 2013 were used for model validation all four models calibrated the streamflow with 24 pms in the nine typical catchments with each catchment having the same default parameters and parameter ranges table 2 3 3 sensitivity analysis sobol sensitivity analysis sobol 2001 is a global sensitivity analysis method that is employed in this study to investigate the parameter sensitivity of four models initially morris screening method campolongo et al 2007 morris 1991 is used for parameter sampling subsequently the sobol sensitivity analysis method is utilized to calculate the sensitivity of parameters in nine catchments for each of the four models next we compute the average sensitivity of the same parameters for each model in northern and southern catchments to derive the parameter sensitivity of mrhms lastly we sum up the sensitivity of parameters for each parameter type in northern and southern catchments 3 4 model evaluation the evaluation of the model performance aimed to 1 assess the capacity of the model to reproduce an overall streamflow fit at the event scale and 2 evaluate its ability to accurately identify streamflow extremes i e the peak flow and the peak time which are important for flood warning the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 metric is used to assess the overall streamflow fit and the absolute peak flood error eqp and absolute difference of peak time etp are used to evaluate the performance of peak flow table 3 a warning system for flash floods depends on reliable warnings for flood events exceeding a given return period in this paper researchers evaluated the ability of four models to accurately identify streamflow extremes using flood frequency analysis the p iii distribution is used for the flood frequency analysis as it is recommended by the chinese ministry of water resources xiong et al 2015 the return periods table 3 for simulated and observed peaks have been estimated we have determined if the maximum hourly streamflow exceeded a reference flood quantile of a given return period for each storm event we consider the 2 year return period to represent common high streamflow while the 10 year return period represents a severe flood see ragettli et al 2017 for example three cases for flood prediction performance following javelle et al 2016 are identified 1 hit h when both the simulated and observed streamflow exceed the flow threshold corresponding to a specific return period indicating high flow 2 miss m when the simulated streamflow is below the threshold and does not agree with the high flow detected by observations and 3 false alert fa when the simulated streamflow indicates high flow but the observed streamflow does not three contingency scores table 3 are computed for evaluating the flood warning ability 1 the probability of detection pod which is the fraction of correct event predictions hits in all observed high flow events 2 the success rate sr which is the fraction of hits in the total number of all high flow event predictions 3 and the critical success index csi which is the fraction of hits in the total number of event predictions plus the number of missed observations 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of the calibration order for four models in order to explore the influence of parameter calibration order on the calibration results of hydrological model we conducted calibration for 24 different permutations of parameter calibration ppcs in nine catchments and then subsequently validated the model using identical parameter values across all 24 ppcs with the continuous performance nse of all flood events in validation period were calculated fig 3 illustrates the minimum median and maximum nse values obtained for 24 ppcs in the five northern catchments the results show that all four models each with 24 ppcs exhibit significant variation in the minimum median and maximum nse values the minimum nse values for model 1 model 2 model 3 and model 4 range from 0 09 to 0 40 0 13 0 58 0 17 0 63 and 0 10 0 35 respectively the median nse values for model 1 model 2 model 3 and model 4 range from 0 37 to 0 60 0 36 0 75 0 50 0 86 and from 0 18 to 0 61 respectively the maximum nse values for model 1 model 2 model 3 and model 4 range from 0 59 to 0 74 0 57 0 87 0 66 0 95 and from 0 41 to 0 80 respectively comparing with the nse values of 24 ppcs reveals that for all four models 4132 has the highest median nse value this indicates that the best ppcs in northern china s five catchments is 4132 thus suggesting that when calibrating hydrological models in the catchments of northern china it is recommended to follow a specific order the first calibration step should involve calibrating the parameters of the routing processes which includes overland flow routing and channel routing processes the second calibration step should focus on calibrating the parameters of the surface runoff generation processes such as evaporation and infiltration processes in the third calibration step it is recommended to calibrate the parameters of groundwater finally in the last calibration step it is suggested to calibrate the parameters of subsurface processes such as fast interflow and slow interflow processes fig 4 illustrates the minimum median and maximum nse values obtained for 24 ppcs in the four southern catchments the results show that all four models each with 24 ppcs also exhibit significant variation in the minimum median and maximum nse values the minimum nse values for model 1 model 2 model 3 and model 4 range from 0 22 to 0 72 0 36 0 72 0 45 0 68 and 0 04 0 73 respectively the median nse values for model 1 model 2 model 3 and model 4 range from 0 53 to 0 80 0 57 0 81 0 67 0 82 and from 0 58 to 0 77 respectively the maximum nse values for model 1 model 2 model 3 and model 4 range from 0 61 to 0 82 0 62 0 81 0 77 0 84 and from 0 64 to 0 84 respectively comparing with the nse values of 24 ppcs reveals that for all four models 2341 has the highest median nse value this indicates that the best ppcs in southern china s four catchments is 2341 thus suggesting that when calibrating hydrological models in the catchments of southern china it is recommended to follow a specific order the first calibration step should involve calibrating the parameters of the subsurface processes such as fast interflow and slow interflow processes the second calibration step should focus on calibrating the parameters of groundwater in the third calibration step it is recommended to calibrate the parameters of the routing processes which includes overland flow routing and channel routing processes finally in the last calibration step it is suggested to calibrate the parameters of the surface runoff generation processes such as evaporation and infiltration processes fig 3 and fig 4 indicate that the influence of the parameter order of the hydrological model on the model results is different in the north and south of china the best ppc in the north and south of china are 4132 and 2341 respectively the ppc 1234 means that the order of parameter calibration is the same as the hydrological process order from surface runoff generation processes subsurface flow groundwater flow to overland flow routing and channel routing process which was not the best ppc in both northern and southern china in this study 4 2 sensitivity analysis fig 5 presents the parameter sensitivity spectrum of mrhms which was calculated using sobol sensitivity analysis the results indicate that the parameter sensitivity of mrhms differs in northern and southern china in the northern catchments the parameters of routing processes α ω and m ω are parameters of channel routing process and k v is parameter of gciuh have the highest sensitivity as shown in table 2 and fig 5 a the next sensitive parameters are the percentage of preferential flow d p and soil depth h in the southern catchments parameters of subsurface flow processes including fast interflow and slow interflow have the highest sensitivity as shown in table 2 and fig 5 a ground water linear coefficient k g follows as the next important parameter in southern catchments in both northern and southern catchments the evaporating dish conversion coefficient k c is the least sensitive parameter with a total index of sobol sensitivity of less than 1 this may be because during the flood process evaporation has a minimal impact due to its short duration after summarizing the parameter sensitivity for each parameter type pie graphs in fig 5 indicate that pt4 representing overland flow and channel flow parameters table 2 is the highest sensitivity parameter type in northern catchments while pt2 representing subsurface parameters table 2 is in southern catchments pt1 representing infiltration and evaporation parameters table 2 is the parameter type with the second highest sensitivity in northern catchments while pt3 representing groundwater parameters table 2 holds this designation in southern catchments the third sensitive parameter types are pt3 and pt 4 in northern and southern catchments respectively the least sensitive parameter types are pt2 and pt 1 in northern and southern catchments respectively these results are consistent with the results of automatic calibration with 24 ppcs in the following parts of this study the ppc 4132 and ppc 2341 were applied in the northern and southern catchments respectively the results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that in dry regions the primary component of runoff is infiltration excess surface flow and the most sensitive parameters are those that control infiltration excess surface flow processes however in wet regions the primary component of runoff is interflow and the most sensitive parameters are those that control interflow processes 4 3 model performance comparisons 4 3 1 model performance comparisons based on nse eqp and etp as presented in table 4 the continuous nse which has been calculated using all flood data during the calibration or validation period values of all four models during the calibration period exceeded 0 50 during the validation period model 3 outperformed the other three models in bingyugou manjiang baiyachang yaodian peihe songbai and qingyang meanwhile model 2 performed the best among the four models in wangan and model 4 yielded the highest performance among them in zhangdou for the 4 models the average continuous nse of the five northern catchments during the validation period are 0 60 0 73 0 80 and 0 52 respectively and the average continuous nse of the four southern catchments during the validation period are 0 78 0 79 0 79 and 0 77 respectively these indicate that the model 3 performs best in the five northern catchments and all four models can perform well in the four southern catchments without obvious difference difference of nse is less than 0 1 according to the standard for hydrological information and hydrological forecasting in china liang 2010 the forecasting results are acceptable when the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is greater than 0 5 and rainfall runoff forecasting uses 20 of the measured peak flow as the allowable error the allowable error for the peak time is 30 of the time difference between the forecast time and the actual peak flow time and if it is less than 3 h or one calculation period then 3 h or one calculation period is used as the allowable error in this paper we use the criteria of nse 0 5 and eqp 20 to define good liang 2010 additionally since our calculation interval is 1 h we consider etp 1 h as meeting the good standard liang 2010 table 5 presents the average percentage values of good for all flood events across the three hydrological model performances nse eqp and etp in the northern and southern catchments the average good percentage of nse in northern catchments for the four models are 71 9 68 4 72 0 and 56 0 in southern catchments the average good percentage of nse for the four models are 71 2 74 0 76 1 and 70 0 this indicates that model 3 has the best nse performance the average good percentage of eqp in northern catchments for the four models are 70 2 71 5 77 8 and 69 1 in southern catchments the average good percentage of eqp for the four models is 63 2 67 9 70 5 and 67 4 this indicates that model 3 has the best performance in eqp in both northern and southern catchments with model 2 coming second the average good percentage of etp in northern china for the four models are 48 2 51 2 76 6 and 49 1 in southern china on the other hand they are 53 0 58 3 62 7 and 48 9 this also shows that model 3 has better performance in etp than other models in both northern and southern catchments with model2 following closely behind in conclusion these results confirm that model 3 has better overall performance compared to other models across all three hydrological model performances nse eqp and etp when analyzing flood events across both northern and southern catchments in china 4 3 2 model performance comparisons based on contingency scores the results of the contingency scores all data including calibration and validation periods evaluating the flood warning performance are presented in table 6 this study reaches average pod scores of 0 79 0 90 for 2 year floods and 0 69 0 80 for 10 year floods the csi scores that are achieved for the same return periods are 0 55 0 76 and 0 43 0 63 respectively zhang et al 2022 have set up encoder decoder lstm model for flood prediction in china the average pod and csi scores for 2 year return periods that they calculated are 0 79 and 0 66 respectively for separate regions of china these values increase to up to 0 89 and 0 76 which are similar to the scores calculated in this study pod 0 72 0 90 csi 0 55 0 76 table 6 the large difference between pod and csi indicates that the number of false alerts was high for the 2 year return period events the model 3 had the best performances for detecting streamflow peaks pod values of 0 90 sr values of 0 82 and csi values of 0 76 considering all catchments the performance pod of the model 3 was 8 higher than the other models similarly model 3 has a better success rate and critical success index in comparison to the other 3 models for the 10 year return period events all models contingency scores decreased by at least 8 in line with the 2 year return period predictions model 3 showed the best performance pod of 0 8 considering all catchments the results of model 4 table 6 indicate that model detection performances were affected by the climate in wetter climate i e the southern catchments better prediction abilities were observed than in the drier regions i e the northern catchments this finding is consistent with the research conducted by adamovic et al 2016 ragettli et al 2017 and zhang et al 2022 on the other hand models 1 2 and 3 had slightly better prediction abilities in drier regions compared to wetter regions this suggests that the mrhms model based on unit hydrograph has better prediction abilities than the one based on kinematic wave 4 3 3 model performance comparisons based on scatter plots fig 6 shows scatterplots and related statistics based on the discharge of nine catchments for the four models the results indicate that for bingyugou baiyachang yaodian wangan zhangdou and peihe catchment the model 3 performed the best out of the four models this was evidenced by its lowest rmse value of 29 2 m3 s 8 9 m3 s 12 3 m3 s 35 3 m3 s 5 8 m3 s and 4 8 m3 s respectively and its highest cc value 0 95 0 92 0 94 0 94 0 90 and 0 92 respectively as shown in fig 6 however for the manjiang songbai and qingyang catchment all four models had similar values of rmse and cc after comparing the linear regression lines of the four models in each catchment it was observed that all linear regression lines were on the lower right side of the reference line this indicates that all models generally underestimated discharge in nine catchments except for model 3 in the wangan catchment this underestimation could be attributed to the objective function used during the calibration period which was nse the calibration results obtained from nse consider the goodness of fit between the overall simulated data and overall observed data however since most of the data in the dataset are much smaller than the flood peak values a good fit with these data does not necessarily indicate a good fit with the flood peak values this means that the simulated flood peak values are usually smaller than the observed flood peak values resulting in the underestimation shown in fig 7 to address the issue of underestimation one potential solution is to employ alternative objective functions that consider the flood peak values also known as high flow for instance nsqp ragettli et al 2017 or kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 mizukami et al 2019 could be used for calibration there were only thirteen flood events recorded in the ten years of data available in the wangan basin table 1 and out of these only three were relatively large flood events refer to fig s 7 in the supplementary material file in these three flood events the peak flows simulated by model 3 closely matched the observed peak flows whereas the peaks simulated by the other three models were all lower than the observed peaks this difference is attributed to model 3 s accurate simulation of the runoff components hence as shown in fig 7 model 3 did not underestimate the flow in the wangan basin more streamflow information for the four models during the calibration and validation periods can be found in the supplementary material file 4 4 runoff components and soil moisture as shown in table 4 nse value of model 3 in yaodian catchment in northern china is above 0 85 in the both calibration and validation periods while nse values of the other three models are less than 0 7 yaodian catchment is in the northwest of china where it is usually dry runoff generation is more likely to occur due to infiltration excess jin et al 2015 kan et al 2017 rui 2013 zhao 1984 in order to find out why model 3 is much better than the other three models in yaodian we analyzed the runoff components of all four model for example fig 7 shows the simulated flood process in yaodian catchment on august 7 2003 the main runoff component of models 1 2 and 4 are fast interflow while the main runoff component of model 3 is hortonian i e infiltration excess flow four models have the same runoff generation methods the only difference is their overland flow routing method model 1 employs a triangle unit hydrograph tuh which has a constant peak time t p for different flood events in a given catchment resulting in a fixed basin lag time i e the time between the center of mass of rainfall and the center of mass of runoff across events model 2 relies on a geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh whose parameters come directly from the digital elevation model dem the equivalent velocity of giuh remains constant across different flood events resulting in uniform basin lag time model 3 couples with geomorphoclimatic instantaneous unit hydrograph gciuh that describes basin lag time as a function of surface runoff intensity this implies that higher surface runoff intensity leads to shorter basin lag time causing variable basin lag times across flood events lastly model 4 uses skby model which employs kinematic wave for overland flow routing process and specifies basin lag times during parameterization therefore models 1 2 and 4 exhibit constant basin lag times during long term series floods simulation while model 3 shows variable basin lag times due to varying surface runoff intensity this indicates than in the four overland flow routing methods only gciuh can simulate different basin lag time in different flood events during a long term series of flood simulations this explains why model 3 generally performs better than the other three models such as yaodian catchment as shown in table 7 furthermore this indicates that the model s structure plays a crucial role in the accuracy of the mrhms simulations the results indicate that the mechanism of runoff generation revealed by model 3 is closer to the actual situation therefore model 3 was applied for the comparison of the runoff components and soil moisture in northern and southern catchments as shown in table 7 the average value of soil moisture at the time of the peak flow i e the soil water content in southern catchments is 0 38 which is much higher than in northern catchments 0 17 and the soil moisture of 10 year floods is higher than that of 2 year floods as shown in table 7 the average fraction of hortonian value in northern catchments is 0 89 which is significantly greater than it in southern catchments 0 09 the mean fractions of fast interflow and slow interflow in southern catchments are 0 45 and 0 43 respectively which are significantly greater than those in northern catchments 0 02 and 0 04 respectively the mean fraction of fast interflow in the northern rises from 0 04 to 0 10 with the increase in precipitation when comparing 2 year floods with 10 year floods similarly the mean fraction of slow interflow in the northern rises from 0 07 to 0 16 this shows that in the northern catchments as precipitation increases soil moisture increases leading to a higher fraction of fast interflow and slow interflow however the main runoff component remains hortonian i e infiltration excess surface runoff table 7 shows that in both northern and southern catchments the fraction of dunnian saturation excess surface flow and groundwater flow are less than 0 05 this indicates that it is difficult for the soil to reach saturation during the short duration floods in small mountainous catchments and the short duration precipitation has little effect on groundwater ragettli et al 2017 analyzed 35 catchments in china using prms oms and applied a classification and regression tree cart method to explore parameter transferability in the full space of catchment descriptors for hydrological modelling zhang et al 2022 compared prms oms cart regional pub prediction in ungagged basins and the encoder decoder long short term memory neural network ed lstm model in 35 catchments across china liu et al 2019a compared the skby model model 4 in this study with eight other hydrological models in 15 small watersheds in china and found that skby performed better than the other eight models they found that all these models perform better in southern china than in northern china in this study we found that the model 3 mrhms gciuh presented in this study performs better than model 4 skby and model 3 perform well in both southern and northern china according to zhang et al 2022 for deep learning models it is essential to focus on developing model structures that can be adaptable in dry regions one approach is the development of physically informed hybrid models that embed the hydrological dynamics into the recurrent neural network architecture 5 conclusions in this study we aimed to investigate the factors that influence the calibration of hydrological models using a semi distributed mixed runoff hydrological model system mrhms to achieve this goal we integrated four different slope confluence methods into the mrhms model and categorized the hydrological model parameters based on the hydrological process we then examined whether changing the order of different parameter types in parameter calibration would affect the results of parameter calibration in nine typical small mountain catchments five in northern china and four in southern china we compared and analyzed the runoff components and parameter sensitivity in different regions based on our findings we draw the following main conclusions 1 the sensitivity parameters of the mrhms in northern and southern china are related to their main runoff components in northern china the most sensitive parameters are those that govern infiltration excess surface flow processes while in southern china the most sensitive parameters are those that control interflow processes 2 different parameter orders in automatic calibration of mrhms result in different model performances and the suggested parameter orders in northern and southern catchments are ppc 4132 and 2341 respectively these recommended parameter orders are consistent with the sensitivity of the parameters in northern and southern china 3 the model structure is also very important for hydrological models in the four mrhms models mrhms tuh mrhms giuh and skby models exhibit superior performance in southern catchments compared to northern catchments however mrhms gciuh model can equally represent streamflows in both northern and southern catchments and outperforms the other three models due to its consideration of variable rainfall intensity 4 soil moisture at the time of peak flow and primary runoff components differ significantly between northern and southern china by automatic parameter calibration of the mrhms gciuh model soil moisture in northern china is lower than in southern china and the major runoff component in northern china is infiltration excess surface runoff while in southern china it is subsurface runoff overall overall the mrhms gciuh model enhances our understanding of runoff formation mechanisms in china s heterogeneous hydroclimatic landscape it offers reliable runoff components and accurate peak time simulations making it a promising tool for a nationwide flood prediction and warning system this paper presents some useful conclusions but there are still some limitations in the study firstly although the mrhms model can automatically switch between daily and flood modes during calculation due to the lack of observed daily runoff data the model only uses observed flood data for parameter calibration and model verification there is no observation data available for runoff components in different catchments for model calibration and verification and only qualitative analysis of runoff components from literature reviews is possible if there are observed daily runoff data and runoff components available in future research the applicability of mrhms model will be better verified secondly none of the nine catchments studied are located in the qinghai tibet plateau or northwest china further research may consider catchments in these regions to provide more comprehensive conclusions that may be applicable to these regions therefore the conclusions drawn from this study may not necessarily be applicable to these regions the mrhms gciuh model can effectively capture the interaction between soil rainfall evaporation and streamflow making it suitable for future deep learning applications by incorporating hydrological dynamics into recurrent neural network architecture deep learning models can be applied more widely beyond the regimes covered by training data therefore using mrhms gciuh model for analysis of runoff generation driving factors with continuous daily and flood data can provide valuable insights into factors affecting runoff generation this will be particularly helpful for future research using machine learning techniques in hydrology credit authorship contribution statement lei wen conceptualization

7684,study region yangtze river basin study focus to improve the potential of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission for estimating terrestrial water storage variations δtws in smaller basins than its typical footprints 150 000 200 000 km2 an improved method named the multi lagrange multiplier method mlmm is proposed to decrease leakage errors and restore signals from an independent hydrologic model the mlmm is applied to estimate δtws in the yangtze river basin yrb and eleven of its sub basins and is assessed from different grace solutions and ground based precipitation p evapotranspiration et and runoff r results indicate that mlmm estimates the leakage correction satisfactorily for small sub basins in the tai lake basin the leakage ratio is improved by 16 excluding the han river basin δtws from mlmm over the yrb are the best among different tested methods with a nash sutcliffe efficiency larger than 0 80 and the best root means square error 1 34 cm new hydrological insights for the region the main contributor to δtws over the yrb is p with 60 the contribution of et to δtws is more extensive than that of r over the middle of yrb the δtws and the total groundwater and surface water were all increasing over the yrb and eleven of its sub basins this paper concludes that the proposed mlmm is helpful for δtws estimation in the small ungauged basins graphical abstract ga1 keywords multi lagrange multiplier method grace terrestrial water storage change yangtze river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites can detect the spatiotemporal changes in terrestrial water storage δtws by measuring the changes in the earth s gravity field at the spatial scale of 100 000 km2 300 km 300 km or larger and the temporal scales longer than 10 day or one month tapley et al 2019 2004 the grace mission provided for the first time a new global monthly dataset for hydrological studies and applications such as estimating changes in tws pokhrel et al 2021 rodell et al 2018 scanlon et al 2018 ice sheets bevis et al 2019 wang et al 2021 yang et al 2019 snow notarnicola 2020 yi et al 2020 regional groundwater storage chao et al 2020 feng et al 2018 frappart et al 2019 surface water storage frappart et al 2018 wang et al 2018 zhong et al 2020 and runoff chen et al 2020 eom et al 2017 sneeuw et al 2014 various processing approaches baur and sneeuw 2011 luthcke et al 2013 save et al 2016 schrama et al 2014 swenson and wahr 2002 wahr et al 1998 watkins et al 2015 yi and sun 2014 have been developed to utilize grace gravity measurement data to estimate δtws with the most common type of solutions being the spherical harmonics sh solution wahr et al 1998 and the mascon solutions luthcke et al 2013 because the signals from grace sh coefficients shc contain various sources of noises an effective post processing technique is required to remove the noises this includes the truncation of the high degree and order of shc which are strongly affected by noise and further filtering however these truncation and filtering processes simultaneously attenuate the original gravity signals eicker et al 2016 the signal attenuation issue can be reduced by using the scaling method landerer and swenson 2012 of which the same processing methods as that in grace is adopted this process requires the spatial patterns of δtws which were usually borrowed from the large scale hydrological model simulations the application of the scaling factor sf to the hydrologic simulations is necessary in order to minimize the differences between the unfiltered and filtered modelled δtws landerer and swenson 2012 long et al 2015 in contrast to shc the noise reduction and signal restoration in the mascon solutions can be applied during the gravity inversion process through regularization or stabilization the aforementioned methods of estimating δtws using the sh and mascon solutions both require post processing i e de striping and smoothing techniques as well as the use of sf to derive δtws the sf was obtained by the least square fit between spatially averaged filtered and unfiltered hydrologic simulation δtws landerer and swenson 2012 δtws estimated from grace differ from that simulated by hydrologic models signal aliasing may occur when fitting grace δtws with the modeled δtws estimation of sf highly depends on the specific hydrologic models used different models lead to different sf values especially in the over irrigated areas where human induced interactions between surface water and groundwater are intensive long et al 2015 different hydrologic models simulate different tws variations and most of them may not simulate surface and groundwater storage changes well long et al 2015 the lagrange multiplier method lmm was proposed by swenson and wahr 2002 to determine regional δtws the δtws of six river basins in north america from swenson and wahr 2002 was one by one inferred using lmm although lmm was developed to fix leakage satellite errors and minimizing the satellite leakage errors without any filter the effect was the same as filtering it also needs signal restoration and correction in this study the newly multi lagrange multiplier method mlmm is proposed to simultaneously estimate δtws at several sub basins and the signal restoration and correction were also processed with an independent hydrologic model chao et al 2019 vishwakarma et al 2016 numerous grace hydrological application studies have been reported over global large river basins like amazon congo tigris euphrates colorado mississippi and the yellow river basin castle et al 2014 chao et al 2018 frappart et al 2019 lin et al 2019 ndehedehe et al 2018 rodell et al 2007 the previous grace studies targeting on the yangtze river basin yrb chao and wang 2017 ferreira et al 2020 jiang et al 2016 long et al 2015 sun et al 2018 have not considered δtws in the sub basins of yrb and therefore they cannot accurately reflect the spatial variations of δtws over the different sub basins in the yrb our study area is the yrb and eleven of its sub basins fig 1 the yangtze river with 6300 km length is the third longest river in the world the total basin area is 1 8 million km2 which is about one fifth of the total mainland china area fig 1 yrb is the most significant cultural and socioeconomic region in china and it also plays important roles in national water resources and ecological conservation cai et al 2016 cao et al 2011 ferreira et al 2020 huang et al 2013 the yrb covers a vast territory with extensive terrain changes and various climatic conditions and hydrologic characteristics the entire yrb can be divided into eleven sub basins with the upper yrb basin including five sub basins the jinsha river 458 592 km2 min river 135 378 km2 jialing river 156 736 km2 upper tributary 96 816 km2 wu river 83 035 km2 basins middle yrb basin including three sub basins the han river 144 683 km2 middle tributary 93 294 km2 doting lake 249 323 km2 basins and the lower yrb basin including three sub basins poyang lake 162 225 km2 lower tributary 74 989 km2 and tai lake 49 249 km2 basins fig 1 most of the major sub basins in the yrb are smaller than the typical footprint of grace δtws 150 000 200 000 km2 yeh et al 2006 apart from the resolution limitation the signal strength is another critical concern for smaller basins lorenz et al 2015 the primary challenges to be addressed for the small sub basin applications of grace δtws are mainly the issues of correcting leakage errors and signal attenuation the main influx precipitation p and two main outfluxes evapotranspiration et and runoff r play the key roles in the global and regional water cycles and they are dominant factors in controlling δtws along with anthropogenic effects huntington 2006 quantitative analyses of the relative contributions of p et and r to δtws are important for improving our understanding of the impacts of various environmental changes on tws rodell et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 δtws is a critical water budget variable in the hydrologic cycle and in water resource management ramillien et al 2008 it is thus necessary to quantify the dynamics and changes δtws over all these sub basins of yrb to help manage water resources and mitigate water disasters flood and drought under current and future climate change the main objectives of this study are therefore 1 to explore the potential of grace to track δtws in the yrb and eleven of its sub basins by using the new mlmm method 2 to verify the estimated results against observation based hydroclimatic data including p et and r 3 to quantify the relative contribution of p et and r to δtws and 4 to discuss the spatiotemporal variations of δtws and groundwater and surface water storage in the yrb 2 datasets 2 1 grace δtws data in this study δtws was estimated from the grace level 2 release 06 monthly time variable gravity field models provided by different solution centers the second orders of the shc solutions were replaced by the satellite laser ranging data cheng et al 2011 the degree one was added based on the approaches proposed by from swenson et al 2008 the glacial isostatic adjustment gia effect was corrected by using models from a et al 2013 δtws were then estimated from four different solutions namely the scaling factor sf method landerer and swenson 2012 with center for space research csr and from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl rl06 mascons product wiese et al 2018 the csr rl06 mascons product save et al 2016 and the goddad space flight center gsfc mascons product version 2 3b luthcke et al 2013 2 2 global land data assimilation system gldas data gldas includes the community land model the mosaic model the variable infiltration capacity model and the national centers for environmental prediction oregon state university air force hydrologic research lab model noah rodell et al 2004 in this study gldas with a spatiotemporal resolution of 1 1 and a monthly temporal resolution during 1979 2020 was used the total of groundwater and surface water storage changes gswsc was acquired from the δtws subtracting the canopy snow and soil moisture water storage changes from gldas naoh joodaki et al 2014 2 3 precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff data 1 p this study used p data from china ground climate daily observation data cgcd http data cma cn en which includes 224 weather stations in the yrb 2 et et is also from cgcd 3 r we obtained r at datong it is the hydrological controlled station of the yrb r data at the other hydrological control stations monitoring the eleven sub basins over the yrb were also obtained these stations were for the water bodies of the jinsha river wu river min river jialing river han river dongting lake and poyang lake basins in addition to r data the station data included p and et table 1 which were from the chang jiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources in china however there were no hydrological stations for the sub basins of tai lake upper tributary middle tributary and lower tributary basins the detailed information on the hydrological control stations is shown in table s1 table 1 lists the datasets the bilinear interpolation was utilized to make the spatiotemporal resolution of different datasets consistent 1 1 each dataset in each basin was averaged to represent the final results in sub basins 3 methods 3 1 multi lagrange multiplier method for recovering δtws owing to the insufficient spatial resolution of grace δtws is the average of grid values rather than the point magnitude the gaussian smoothing method cannot effectively extract δtws in a specific region like in yrb and its sub basins alternatively there were three methods available for this purpose 1 using a gaussian filter jekeli 1981 to smooth the real average kernel 2 minimizing the total of leakage and satellite errors and 3 using the lagrange multiplier method lmm to fix the leakage or satellite measurement errors to a given value and then minimize them swenson and wahr 2002 the proposed mlmm method is characterized by minimizing the signal leakage and satellite measurement errors without using prior information the mlmm establishes multiple kernels and changes the one mask function ϑ θ λ to ϑ p θ i λ i in the p th basin p 1 2 n here n 12 θ λ is the colatitude and longitude and then estimate δtws in multiple basins simultaneously the unique novelty of mlmm is to simultaneously isolate δtws in multiple basins by minimizing the signal leakage error in satellite measurements and then restore and correct δtws signals without using the hydrologic modeling data the vertical integration of water storage in any average area can be obtained 1 δ m p 1 s p δ σ θ i λ i ϑ p θ i λ i d s i where δ σ θ i λ i is the surface mass change and d s i sin θ i d θ i d λ i is a solid angle element and represents the integration over the given spherical domain s p spherical area then δ m p will also undergo signal restoration and correction following eqs 7 13 and 14 as used in chao et al 2019 details of the derivation of the mlmm method are depicted in appendix a and chao et al 2019 3 2 hierarchical partitioning analysis the hierarchical partitioning analysis hpa chevan and sutherland 1991 was applied to derive the importance of each independent variable e g p with the dependent variable i e δtws which is displayed by the percentage contribution to the multivariate linear regression model zhang et al 2019 applied hpa to calculate the contributions of p et and r to the δtws over 168 river basins here hpa was implemented among δtws and p et r over the yrb and eleven of its sub basins 3 3 assessment of δtws using water cycle balance and performance rules to validate δtws we use the following time derivative of δtws as used by famiglietti et al 2011 2 d s d t p e t r d s d t d δ t w s d t δ t w s t 1 δ t w s t δ t owing to the use of the central difference scheme in deriving δtws the following smoothing method as used in swenson and wahr 2006 will be used in this study 3 f t 1 4 f t 1 1 2 f t 1 4 f t 1 where f is d s d t and d δ t w s d t from eq 2 here we followed the methods in famiglietti et al 2011 and landerer et al 2010 to verify the δtws estimates from different post processing grace data six commonly used statistical metrics including the root means square error rmse the maximum absolute error m a e 1 n v i 1 n v y i o i y i and o i are δtws from grace and in situ observed values respectively n v is the number of data used the scaled rmse r r m s e σ 0 σ 0 is the standard deviation of δtws from in situ observational value the correlation coefficient cc the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the centered rms difference crmsd were used together to assess the accuracy of δtws sun 2013 3 4 uncertainty estimation the main sources of uncertainty when using grace to infer δtws are measurement and leakage errors to address these issues mlmm was proposed as a method for minimizing signal leakage and satellite measurement errors therefore the uncertainty of δtws from the mlmm has been estimated as the total of the grace measurement errors and the bias leakage correction errors p and et estimates uncertainty was calculated as the standard deviation from different source data pan et al 2017 tiwari et al 2009 the uncertainty in the linear trend of δtws and gswsc was determined from grace measurement and leakage errors as well as the gldas model output errors joodaki et al 2014 assuming that there is no correlation between monthly grace data we estimated the contribution to the uncertainty as the 2 sigma formal error of the trend finally the total uncertainty was obtained by adding the model and measurement uncertainty in quadrature 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of δtws estimated from mlmm 4 1 1 comparison of the multi lagrange multiplier and gaussian smoothing methods in this study the entire yrb 1 705 383 km2 and three representative sub basins of different spatial extent namely jinsha river 458 592 km2 middle tributary 93 294 km2 and tai lake 49 249 km2 are used as examples to compare the leakage ratio as a function of the satellite error and the spatial correlation length cl with 10 km 100 km 300 km and 500 km from the gaussian smoothing method and mlmm the results are shown in fig 2 in the smallest area that of tai lake fig 2 a d when δtws are correlated over approximately 10 km the truncation error is approximately 68 5 of the signal variance additionally the leakage ratio r l k g is approximately 0 69 and 0 82 based on the mlmm and gaussian smoothing methods respectively fig 2 a as the signal correlation length increases the amplitude of the short wavelength components of the δtws decreases and the truncation error decreases fig 2 a d as the truncation error decreases the differences between the mlmm and gaussian smoothing methods become more apparent fig 2 e p for example leakages due to the gaussian method with 5 4 cm satellite error and 300 km correlation length are almost double those of the mlmm for the tai lake and middle tributary and obviously smaller areas fig 2 e l as the basin area increases the satellite and leakage errors decreased fig 2 a p in the largest area the entire yrb the leakage is 0 15 cm based on the mlmm and 0 39 cm based on the gaussian smoothing method with a satellite error of 0 2 cm and a correlation length of 300 km fig 2 o to eliminate leakage when the correlation length is 500 km the satellite errors are 6 cm 5 cm 2 5 cm and 0 8 cm for tai lake middle tributary jinsha river and the entire yrb respectively fig 2 d h l p the above results suggest that the mlmm can decrease satellite measurement and signal leakage errors and improve signal to noise ratios especially in small sub basins 4 1 2 δtws from different grace products and in situ hydroclimatic data because there were only in situ hydroclimatic stations data in yrb and seven of its sub basins jinsha river wu river min river jialing river han river dongting lake and poyang lake basins table 1 we only show the comparison between δtws from grace data and in situ hydroclimatic data p et and r based on eq 2 and eq 3 in the yrb and these seven sub basins figs s1 s2 the comparison shows that grace δtws from different post processing solutions and in situ data p et and r solution generally agree well with each other but there are also differences especially in the amplitude of seasonal patterns fig s2 in the whole yrb rmse between δtws from different grace solutions and in situ hydroclimatic data p et and r agree well at a level of 2 6 cm and 2 4 cm respectively fig 3 a the accuracy of δtws from different solutions is basically the same and the improvement of mlmm is small in the yrb fig 3 a however as the area of sub basins decreases the difference of δtws from different solutions is obvious especially in the doting lake and poyang lake basins fig 3 which have only between 10 and 15 of the size of the yrb in the doting lake basin the rmse of δtws from jpl mascon are 4 3 cm and 2 4 cm respectively while mlmm yields 2 5 cm and 2 0 cm which is an improvement of 40 and 17 respectively in the poyang lake basin the rmse of δtws from jpl mascon are 5 0 cm and 2 3 cm respectively while mlmm yields 3 4 cm and 1 8 cm here an improvement of 32 and 20 respectively in the smallest sub basins with hydrologic data available wu river 83 035 km2 the best performance of δtws is from mlmm with the smallest rmse 1 36 cm improving by 25 compared with the mean rmse 1 81 cm the above results show that mlmm can be beneficial to obtain δtws in the sub basins the above results show that grace δtws are more consistent with in situ hydroclimatic data after smoothing with eq 3 fig 3 therefore this method eq 3 is adopted to further assess δtws from mlmm and other grace solutions table 2 lists the statistical results of δtws between the different grace solutions and in situ hydroclimatic stations solution basing on eq 3 fig s3 plots the taylor diagram taylor 2001 for comparisons between δtws estimated from in situ hydroclimatic observations and estimated from different grace solutions using eq 3 the correlation dashed blue lines standard deviation dashed black lines and the centered rms difference crmsd dashed green lines of δtws from in situ hydroclimatic observations are 1 0 1 and 0 respectively which are defined as the reference values ref both the standard deviations and crmsds of δtws from grace solutions have been normalized by the standard deviation of the observed δtws the closer the grace δtws is to the ref point on the x axis the higher correlation and the lower crmsd with the observed δtws these results figs s2 3 and table 2 indicate that different grace solutions agree well in the yrb and eleven of its sub basins with a cc of 0 8 rmse of 2 cm and nse of 0 8 δtws from the mlmm in general shows fairly good accuracy over all different study domains in particular satisfactory over the entire yrb nse 0 83 r 0 31 rmse 2 31 cm jinsha river nse 0 88 r 0 33 rmse 1 66 cm wu river nse 0 88 r 0 33 rmse 1 36 cm jialing river nse 0 89 r 0 39 rmse 1 34 cm doting lake nse 0 87 r 0 31 rmse 2 01 cm and poyang lake nse 0 85 r 0 34 rmse 1 75 cm basins the jpl and csr mascons exhibit the highest accuracy over the wu river nse 0 85 r 0 33 rmse 1 67 cm and han river nse 0 81 r 0 33 rmse 1 55 cm basins however the mascons products show less convincing performance in the doting lake nse 0 72 r 0 37 rmse 2 43 cm and poyang lake nse 0 68 r 0 41 rmse 2 70 cm basins 4 2 the contributions of p et and r to δtws over the yrb and eleven of its sub basins the shaded envelopes in fig 4 represent the corresponding uncertainties fig 4 a h displays the seasonal signal of the δtws p et and r where there were in situ r measurements over the yrb and its sub basins the δtws based on the water balance p et r from in situ data δtwsin situ were determined and compare with the δtws from mlmm δtwsgrace fig 4 a h also shows the mean explained variance r 2 for multivariate regression models of δtwsin situ and δtwsgrace and the contributions of p et and r to the δtws using hpa the two δtws δtwsgrace and δtwsin situ over the yrb and its sub basins agreed well suggesting a consistent seasonal cycle the amplitude of the two δtws shows some differences this could have resulted in several aspects but the most likely reason may be the uncertainties in different datasets soni and syed 2015 the r 2 of δtws in the whole yrb and min river basins are over 70 and in the jinsha river basin 65 the r 2 of jialing river han river wu river doting lake and poyang lake basins are all greater than 55 thereby showing the models relatively strong capability in explaining the δtws the contributions of p to the δtws in the whole yrb han river and wu river basins are all greater than 60 and in the jinsha river min river jialing river doting lake and poyang lake basins they are all greater than 50 in the above eight basins the most massive contributions to the δtws is p the factor with the second largest contributions to the δtws is r throughout the yrb jinsha river min river jialing river wu river and poyang lake basins the factor with the second largest contributions to the δtws is et in the han river and doting lake basins the above results indicate greater consistency in the seasonal cycles of the δtws and p over the yrb a lower character in the seasonal processes for r and et moreover in the location closer to the upper or lower basins of the yrb r s contributions to the δtws are more extensive than that of et in the location closer to the middle basin of the yrb the contributions of et to the δtws are larger than that of r 4 3 spatiotemporal variations of δtws and gswsc in the yrb the monthly seasonal and annual scales of the regional average δtws are shown in figs s4 5 and s5 respectively moreover table 3 displays the regional average δtws trend in the yrb and eleven of its sub basins as obtained from the mlmm and jpl mascon datasets as well as the total changes in groundwater and surface water storage gswsc as obtained from the gracemlmm and gldas datasets for the period between 2003 and 2015 the results indicate δtws from different solutions are basically the same with each other δtws generally reached a maximum in summer and a minimum in winter the annual of δtws in the yrb and eleven of its sub basins show an apparent increase the regional average δtws and gswsc trend for each sub basin of the yrb increased during the period of 2003 2015 table 3 chao and wang 2017 and liu et al 2020 also found that the trend of δtws and groundwater was increasing as mlmm was a region averaging method from grace level 2 shc data and thus was unable to generate the spatial maps in each sub basin the spatial form of δtws s trend between 2003 and 2015 was obtained from jpl mascon rl06 fig 6 a the results indicate that δtws in the west and south of the jinsha river basin shows a rapid decrease fig 6 a which may be caused by glacier melting in the qing tibet plateau gardner et al 2013 and several drought events in yunnan in recent years chao et al 2016 the δtws in the min river jialing river and upper tributary basins show apparently increases however δtws in the northern hanjiang river basin shows decreases it may be influenced by the continued droughts in recent several years qian et al 2011 the δtws in the southeast of dongting lake and the southern part of poyang lake basins show a decrease persistent with the recent nearly dried up in the poyang lake basin liu et al 2013 the δtws in the lower tributary and tai lake basins show a decreasing trend which are generally persistent with the accelerated surface subsidence in recent years zhang et al 2005 additionally the linear trend of the total of groundwater and surface water storage changes gswsc was acquired from the δtws subtracting the gldas data joodaki et al 2014 the trend of gswsc is shown in fig 6 b which pictured an increase except for the middle and lower parts of the jinsha river basin the upper part of the minjiang river and hanjiang river basins the middle of the jialing river and tai lake basins liu et al 2020 used grace and baseflow recession data to derive changes in groundwater storage which revealed an increase in groundwater in the yrb however the increase in groundwater in the yrb can be attributed to various factors including climate change land use and cover change and human activities moreover fig 6 a and b indicate that the spatial patterns of the δtws and the gswsc are similar and show increasing trends around the three gorges reservoir tgr owing to the low spatiotemporal resolution of the grace and lacking in situ data it is difficult to find the causes of the increased gswsc such as whether tgr impoundment can grow in the gswsc over the yrb to find the reasons for the increased gswsc we need to combine more in situ data e g well data around the tgr 5 conclusions a new method of mlmm was proposed to improve the ability of grace δtws in the small sub basins and was verified by in situ hydroclimatic stations data of p et and r comparing with the previous method landerer and swenson 2012 luthcke et al 2013 save et al 2016 swenson and wahr 2002 wahr et al 1998 the advantage of mlmm was simultaneously to isolate the results of δtws in the multiple basins by decreasing the leakage error and to restore the signal with an independent hydrological model in an easy way to verify the improvement in δtws estimated by mlmm δtws from mlmm was compared with different grace solutions such as sf lmm and mascons and in situ hydroclimatic station data mlmm was a region averaging method from grace level 2 shc data and thus was unable to generate the spatial maps in each sub basin however δtws from the mlmm of each sub basin can be considered as a spatial distribution of the whole yrb furthermore the contributions of p et and r to the δtws were also acquired using hpa the main conclusions were as follows 1 the δtws calculated with different methods and based on different grace derived input data generally agree well with each other compared to hydrological ground observations δtws from the mlmm is the best with the highest nse 0 8 and lowest rmse 2 3 cm excluding the han river basin 2 the mascons products in poyang lake and doting lake basins show less convincing performance with nse 0 7 and rmse 2 5 cm while nse is larger than 0 8 and rmse smaller than 2 cm from mlmm 3 the mlmm can effectively decrease δtws errors improve signal to noise ratios especially for small sub basins and enhance the reliability of δtws results 4 the δtws and gswsc was increasing in the yrb p in the yrb showed an immense contribution to the δtws 60 however the contributions of et to the δtws were more extensive than that of r over the middle basin of the yrb han river 25 9 vs 10 1 and doting lake 23 0 vs 20 7 basins the grace follow on gfo twin satellite mission was launched in 2018 and already provides observational data with improved precision and high spatiotemporal resolution landerer et al 2020 although grace gfo has made a significant contribution to hydrology its focus has mainly been on a large scale therefore it would be a tremendous achievement to improve the spatial and temporal resolutions of grace gfo while the proposed mlmm was designed to enhance the detection of δtws from grace in small sub basins its application in this study yielded average regional results and did not provide information on spatial changes a new method should be developed to infer the spatial changes in tws within sub basins basing on the grace and gfo data improving the ability of grace and gfo to detect δtws in small basins is crucial for hydrology particularly in runoff studies the reliable estimation of δtws from mlmm by using grace gfo data can effectively improve runoff forecasting in global basins especially in small basins where in situ hydrological data is unavailable therefore we will use the δtws from mlmm on a global scale and deep learning techniques to reconstruct long term high precision and reliable runoff data for global drought and flood analyses credit authorship

7684,study region yangtze river basin study focus to improve the potential of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission for estimating terrestrial water storage variations δtws in smaller basins than its typical footprints 150 000 200 000 km2 an improved method named the multi lagrange multiplier method mlmm is proposed to decrease leakage errors and restore signals from an independent hydrologic model the mlmm is applied to estimate δtws in the yangtze river basin yrb and eleven of its sub basins and is assessed from different grace solutions and ground based precipitation p evapotranspiration et and runoff r results indicate that mlmm estimates the leakage correction satisfactorily for small sub basins in the tai lake basin the leakage ratio is improved by 16 excluding the han river basin δtws from mlmm over the yrb are the best among different tested methods with a nash sutcliffe efficiency larger than 0 80 and the best root means square error 1 34 cm new hydrological insights for the region the main contributor to δtws over the yrb is p with 60 the contribution of et to δtws is more extensive than that of r over the middle of yrb the δtws and the total groundwater and surface water were all increasing over the yrb and eleven of its sub basins this paper concludes that the proposed mlmm is helpful for δtws estimation in the small ungauged basins graphical abstract ga1 keywords multi lagrange multiplier method grace terrestrial water storage change yangtze river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellites can detect the spatiotemporal changes in terrestrial water storage δtws by measuring the changes in the earth s gravity field at the spatial scale of 100 000 km2 300 km 300 km or larger and the temporal scales longer than 10 day or one month tapley et al 2019 2004 the grace mission provided for the first time a new global monthly dataset for hydrological studies and applications such as estimating changes in tws pokhrel et al 2021 rodell et al 2018 scanlon et al 2018 ice sheets bevis et al 2019 wang et al 2021 yang et al 2019 snow notarnicola 2020 yi et al 2020 regional groundwater storage chao et al 2020 feng et al 2018 frappart et al 2019 surface water storage frappart et al 2018 wang et al 2018 zhong et al 2020 and runoff chen et al 2020 eom et al 2017 sneeuw et al 2014 various processing approaches baur and sneeuw 2011 luthcke et al 2013 save et al 2016 schrama et al 2014 swenson and wahr 2002 wahr et al 1998 watkins et al 2015 yi and sun 2014 have been developed to utilize grace gravity measurement data to estimate δtws with the most common type of solutions being the spherical harmonics sh solution wahr et al 1998 and the mascon solutions luthcke et al 2013 because the signals from grace sh coefficients shc contain various sources of noises an effective post processing technique is required to remove the noises this includes the truncation of the high degree and order of shc which are strongly affected by noise and further filtering however these truncation and filtering processes simultaneously attenuate the original gravity signals eicker et al 2016 the signal attenuation issue can be reduced by using the scaling method landerer and swenson 2012 of which the same processing methods as that in grace is adopted this process requires the spatial patterns of δtws which were usually borrowed from the large scale hydrological model simulations the application of the scaling factor sf to the hydrologic simulations is necessary in order to minimize the differences between the unfiltered and filtered modelled δtws landerer and swenson 2012 long et al 2015 in contrast to shc the noise reduction and signal restoration in the mascon solutions can be applied during the gravity inversion process through regularization or stabilization the aforementioned methods of estimating δtws using the sh and mascon solutions both require post processing i e de striping and smoothing techniques as well as the use of sf to derive δtws the sf was obtained by the least square fit between spatially averaged filtered and unfiltered hydrologic simulation δtws landerer and swenson 2012 δtws estimated from grace differ from that simulated by hydrologic models signal aliasing may occur when fitting grace δtws with the modeled δtws estimation of sf highly depends on the specific hydrologic models used different models lead to different sf values especially in the over irrigated areas where human induced interactions between surface water and groundwater are intensive long et al 2015 different hydrologic models simulate different tws variations and most of them may not simulate surface and groundwater storage changes well long et al 2015 the lagrange multiplier method lmm was proposed by swenson and wahr 2002 to determine regional δtws the δtws of six river basins in north america from swenson and wahr 2002 was one by one inferred using lmm although lmm was developed to fix leakage satellite errors and minimizing the satellite leakage errors without any filter the effect was the same as filtering it also needs signal restoration and correction in this study the newly multi lagrange multiplier method mlmm is proposed to simultaneously estimate δtws at several sub basins and the signal restoration and correction were also processed with an independent hydrologic model chao et al 2019 vishwakarma et al 2016 numerous grace hydrological application studies have been reported over global large river basins like amazon congo tigris euphrates colorado mississippi and the yellow river basin castle et al 2014 chao et al 2018 frappart et al 2019 lin et al 2019 ndehedehe et al 2018 rodell et al 2007 the previous grace studies targeting on the yangtze river basin yrb chao and wang 2017 ferreira et al 2020 jiang et al 2016 long et al 2015 sun et al 2018 have not considered δtws in the sub basins of yrb and therefore they cannot accurately reflect the spatial variations of δtws over the different sub basins in the yrb our study area is the yrb and eleven of its sub basins fig 1 the yangtze river with 6300 km length is the third longest river in the world the total basin area is 1 8 million km2 which is about one fifth of the total mainland china area fig 1 yrb is the most significant cultural and socioeconomic region in china and it also plays important roles in national water resources and ecological conservation cai et al 2016 cao et al 2011 ferreira et al 2020 huang et al 2013 the yrb covers a vast territory with extensive terrain changes and various climatic conditions and hydrologic characteristics the entire yrb can be divided into eleven sub basins with the upper yrb basin including five sub basins the jinsha river 458 592 km2 min river 135 378 km2 jialing river 156 736 km2 upper tributary 96 816 km2 wu river 83 035 km2 basins middle yrb basin including three sub basins the han river 144 683 km2 middle tributary 93 294 km2 doting lake 249 323 km2 basins and the lower yrb basin including three sub basins poyang lake 162 225 km2 lower tributary 74 989 km2 and tai lake 49 249 km2 basins fig 1 most of the major sub basins in the yrb are smaller than the typical footprint of grace δtws 150 000 200 000 km2 yeh et al 2006 apart from the resolution limitation the signal strength is another critical concern for smaller basins lorenz et al 2015 the primary challenges to be addressed for the small sub basin applications of grace δtws are mainly the issues of correcting leakage errors and signal attenuation the main influx precipitation p and two main outfluxes evapotranspiration et and runoff r play the key roles in the global and regional water cycles and they are dominant factors in controlling δtws along with anthropogenic effects huntington 2006 quantitative analyses of the relative contributions of p et and r to δtws are important for improving our understanding of the impacts of various environmental changes on tws rodell et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 δtws is a critical water budget variable in the hydrologic cycle and in water resource management ramillien et al 2008 it is thus necessary to quantify the dynamics and changes δtws over all these sub basins of yrb to help manage water resources and mitigate water disasters flood and drought under current and future climate change the main objectives of this study are therefore 1 to explore the potential of grace to track δtws in the yrb and eleven of its sub basins by using the new mlmm method 2 to verify the estimated results against observation based hydroclimatic data including p et and r 3 to quantify the relative contribution of p et and r to δtws and 4 to discuss the spatiotemporal variations of δtws and groundwater and surface water storage in the yrb 2 datasets 2 1 grace δtws data in this study δtws was estimated from the grace level 2 release 06 monthly time variable gravity field models provided by different solution centers the second orders of the shc solutions were replaced by the satellite laser ranging data cheng et al 2011 the degree one was added based on the approaches proposed by from swenson et al 2008 the glacial isostatic adjustment gia effect was corrected by using models from a et al 2013 δtws were then estimated from four different solutions namely the scaling factor sf method landerer and swenson 2012 with center for space research csr and from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl rl06 mascons product wiese et al 2018 the csr rl06 mascons product save et al 2016 and the goddad space flight center gsfc mascons product version 2 3b luthcke et al 2013 2 2 global land data assimilation system gldas data gldas includes the community land model the mosaic model the variable infiltration capacity model and the national centers for environmental prediction oregon state university air force hydrologic research lab model noah rodell et al 2004 in this study gldas with a spatiotemporal resolution of 1 1 and a monthly temporal resolution during 1979 2020 was used the total of groundwater and surface water storage changes gswsc was acquired from the δtws subtracting the canopy snow and soil moisture water storage changes from gldas naoh joodaki et al 2014 2 3 precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff data 1 p this study used p data from china ground climate daily observation data cgcd http data cma cn en which includes 224 weather stations in the yrb 2 et et is also from cgcd 3 r we obtained r at datong it is the hydrological controlled station of the yrb r data at the other hydrological control stations monitoring the eleven sub basins over the yrb were also obtained these stations were for the water bodies of the jinsha river wu river min river jialing river han river dongting lake and poyang lake basins in addition to r data the station data included p and et table 1 which were from the chang jiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources in china however there were no hydrological stations for the sub basins of tai lake upper tributary middle tributary and lower tributary basins the detailed information on the hydrological control stations is shown in table s1 table 1 lists the datasets the bilinear interpolation was utilized to make the spatiotemporal resolution of different datasets consistent 1 1 each dataset in each basin was averaged to represent the final results in sub basins 3 methods 3 1 multi lagrange multiplier method for recovering δtws owing to the insufficient spatial resolution of grace δtws is the average of grid values rather than the point magnitude the gaussian smoothing method cannot effectively extract δtws in a specific region like in yrb and its sub basins alternatively there were three methods available for this purpose 1 using a gaussian filter jekeli 1981 to smooth the real average kernel 2 minimizing the total of leakage and satellite errors and 3 using the lagrange multiplier method lmm to fix the leakage or satellite measurement errors to a given value and then minimize them swenson and wahr 2002 the proposed mlmm method is characterized by minimizing the signal leakage and satellite measurement errors without using prior information the mlmm establishes multiple kernels and changes the one mask function ϑ θ λ to ϑ p θ i λ i in the p th basin p 1 2 n here n 12 θ λ is the colatitude and longitude and then estimate δtws in multiple basins simultaneously the unique novelty of mlmm is to simultaneously isolate δtws in multiple basins by minimizing the signal leakage error in satellite measurements and then restore and correct δtws signals without using the hydrologic modeling data the vertical integration of water storage in any average area can be obtained 1 δ m p 1 s p δ σ θ i λ i ϑ p θ i λ i d s i where δ σ θ i λ i is the surface mass change and d s i sin θ i d θ i d λ i is a solid angle element and represents the integration over the given spherical domain s p spherical area then δ m p will also undergo signal restoration and correction following eqs 7 13 and 14 as used in chao et al 2019 details of the derivation of the mlmm method are depicted in appendix a and chao et al 2019 3 2 hierarchical partitioning analysis the hierarchical partitioning analysis hpa chevan and sutherland 1991 was applied to derive the importance of each independent variable e g p with the dependent variable i e δtws which is displayed by the percentage contribution to the multivariate linear regression model zhang et al 2019 applied hpa to calculate the contributions of p et and r to the δtws over 168 river basins here hpa was implemented among δtws and p et r over the yrb and eleven of its sub basins 3 3 assessment of δtws using water cycle balance and performance rules to validate δtws we use the following time derivative of δtws as used by famiglietti et al 2011 2 d s d t p e t r d s d t d δ t w s d t δ t w s t 1 δ t w s t δ t owing to the use of the central difference scheme in deriving δtws the following smoothing method as used in swenson and wahr 2006 will be used in this study 3 f t 1 4 f t 1 1 2 f t 1 4 f t 1 where f is d s d t and d δ t w s d t from eq 2 here we followed the methods in famiglietti et al 2011 and landerer et al 2010 to verify the δtws estimates from different post processing grace data six commonly used statistical metrics including the root means square error rmse the maximum absolute error m a e 1 n v i 1 n v y i o i y i and o i are δtws from grace and in situ observed values respectively n v is the number of data used the scaled rmse r r m s e σ 0 σ 0 is the standard deviation of δtws from in situ observational value the correlation coefficient cc the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the centered rms difference crmsd were used together to assess the accuracy of δtws sun 2013 3 4 uncertainty estimation the main sources of uncertainty when using grace to infer δtws are measurement and leakage errors to address these issues mlmm was proposed as a method for minimizing signal leakage and satellite measurement errors therefore the uncertainty of δtws from the mlmm has been estimated as the total of the grace measurement errors and the bias leakage correction errors p and et estimates uncertainty was calculated as the standard deviation from different source data pan et al 2017 tiwari et al 2009 the uncertainty in the linear trend of δtws and gswsc was determined from grace measurement and leakage errors as well as the gldas model output errors joodaki et al 2014 assuming that there is no correlation between monthly grace data we estimated the contribution to the uncertainty as the 2 sigma formal error of the trend finally the total uncertainty was obtained by adding the model and measurement uncertainty in quadrature 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of δtws estimated from mlmm 4 1 1 comparison of the multi lagrange multiplier and gaussian smoothing methods in this study the entire yrb 1 705 383 km2 and three representative sub basins of different spatial extent namely jinsha river 458 592 km2 middle tributary 93 294 km2 and tai lake 49 249 km2 are used as examples to compare the leakage ratio as a function of the satellite error and the spatial correlation length cl with 10 km 100 km 300 km and 500 km from the gaussian smoothing method and mlmm the results are shown in fig 2 in the smallest area that of tai lake fig 2 a d when δtws are correlated over approximately 10 km the truncation error is approximately 68 5 of the signal variance additionally the leakage ratio r l k g is approximately 0 69 and 0 82 based on the mlmm and gaussian smoothing methods respectively fig 2 a as the signal correlation length increases the amplitude of the short wavelength components of the δtws decreases and the truncation error decreases fig 2 a d as the truncation error decreases the differences between the mlmm and gaussian smoothing methods become more apparent fig 2 e p for example leakages due to the gaussian method with 5 4 cm satellite error and 300 km correlation length are almost double those of the mlmm for the tai lake and middle tributary and obviously smaller areas fig 2 e l as the basin area increases the satellite and leakage errors decreased fig 2 a p in the largest area the entire yrb the leakage is 0 15 cm based on the mlmm and 0 39 cm based on the gaussian smoothing method with a satellite error of 0 2 cm and a correlation length of 300 km fig 2 o to eliminate leakage when the correlation length is 500 km the satellite errors are 6 cm 5 cm 2 5 cm and 0 8 cm for tai lake middle tributary jinsha river and the entire yrb respectively fig 2 d h l p the above results suggest that the mlmm can decrease satellite measurement and signal leakage errors and improve signal to noise ratios especially in small sub basins 4 1 2 δtws from different grace products and in situ hydroclimatic data because there were only in situ hydroclimatic stations data in yrb and seven of its sub basins jinsha river wu river min river jialing river han river dongting lake and poyang lake basins table 1 we only show the comparison between δtws from grace data and in situ hydroclimatic data p et and r based on eq 2 and eq 3 in the yrb and these seven sub basins figs s1 s2 the comparison shows that grace δtws from different post processing solutions and in situ data p et and r solution generally agree well with each other but there are also differences especially in the amplitude of seasonal patterns fig s2 in the whole yrb rmse between δtws from different grace solutions and in situ hydroclimatic data p et and r agree well at a level of 2 6 cm and 2 4 cm respectively fig 3 a the accuracy of δtws from different solutions is basically the same and the improvement of mlmm is small in the yrb fig 3 a however as the area of sub basins decreases the difference of δtws from different solutions is obvious especially in the doting lake and poyang lake basins fig 3 which have only between 10 and 15 of the size of the yrb in the doting lake basin the rmse of δtws from jpl mascon are 4 3 cm and 2 4 cm respectively while mlmm yields 2 5 cm and 2 0 cm which is an improvement of 40 and 17 respectively in the poyang lake basin the rmse of δtws from jpl mascon are 5 0 cm and 2 3 cm respectively while mlmm yields 3 4 cm and 1 8 cm here an improvement of 32 and 20 respectively in the smallest sub basins with hydrologic data available wu river 83 035 km2 the best performance of δtws is from mlmm with the smallest rmse 1 36 cm improving by 25 compared with the mean rmse 1 81 cm the above results show that mlmm can be beneficial to obtain δtws in the sub basins the above results show that grace δtws are more consistent with in situ hydroclimatic data after smoothing with eq 3 fig 3 therefore this method eq 3 is adopted to further assess δtws from mlmm and other grace solutions table 2 lists the statistical results of δtws between the different grace solutions and in situ hydroclimatic stations solution basing on eq 3 fig s3 plots the taylor diagram taylor 2001 for comparisons between δtws estimated from in situ hydroclimatic observations and estimated from different grace solutions using eq 3 the correlation dashed blue lines standard deviation dashed black lines and the centered rms difference crmsd dashed green lines of δtws from in situ hydroclimatic observations are 1 0 1 and 0 respectively which are defined as the reference values ref both the standard deviations and crmsds of δtws from grace solutions have been normalized by the standard deviation of the observed δtws the closer the grace δtws is to the ref point on the x axis the higher correlation and the lower crmsd with the observed δtws these results figs s2 3 and table 2 indicate that different grace solutions agree well in the yrb and eleven of its sub basins with a cc of 0 8 rmse of 2 cm and nse of 0 8 δtws from the mlmm in general shows fairly good accuracy over all different study domains in particular satisfactory over the entire yrb nse 0 83 r 0 31 rmse 2 31 cm jinsha river nse 0 88 r 0 33 rmse 1 66 cm wu river nse 0

highest accuracy over the wu river nse 0 85 r 0 33 rmse 1 67 cm and han river nse 0 81 r 0 33 rmse 1 55 cm basins however the mascons products show less convincing performance in the doting lake nse 0 72 r 0 37 rmse 2 43 cm and poyang lake nse 0 68 r 0 41 rmse 2 70 cm basins 4 2 the contributions of p et and r to δtws over the yrb and eleven of its sub basins the shaded envelopes in fig 4 represent the corresponding uncertainties fig 4 a h displays the seasonal signal of the δtws p et and r where there were in situ r measurements over the yrb and its sub basins the δtws based on the water balance p et r from in situ data δtwsin situ were determined and compare with the δtws from mlmm δtwsgrace fig 4 a h also shows the mean explained variance r 2 for multivariate regression models of δtwsin situ and δtwsgrace and the contributions of p et and r to the δtws using hpa the two δtws δtwsgrace and δtwsin situ over the yrb and its sub basins agreed well suggesting a consistent seasonal cycle the amplitude of the two δtws shows some differences this could have resulted in several aspects but the most likely reason may be the uncertainties in different datasets soni and syed 2015 the r 2 of δtws in the whole yrb and min river basins are over 70 and in the jinsha river basin 65 the r 2 of jialing river han river wu river doting lake and poyang lake basins are all greater than 55 thereby showing the models relatively strong capability in explaining the δtws the contributions of p to the δtws in the whole yrb han river and wu river basins are all greater than 60 and in the jinsha river min river jialing river doting lake and poyang lake basins they are all greater than 50 in the above eight basins the most massive contributions to the δtws is p the factor with the second largest contributions to the δtws is r throughout the yrb jinsha river min river jialing river wu river and poyang lake basins the factor with the second largest contributions to the δtws is et in the han river and doting lake basins the above results indicate greater consistency in the seasonal cycles of the δtws and p over the yrb a lower character in the seasonal processes for r and et moreover in the location closer to the upper or lower basins of the yrb r s contributions to the δtws are more extensive than that of et in the location closer to the middle basin of the yrb the contributions of et to the δtws are larger than that of r 4 3 spatiotemporal variations of δtws and gswsc in the yrb the monthly seasonal and annual scales of the regional average δtws are shown in figs s4 5 and s5 respectively moreover table 3 displays the regional average δtws trend in the yrb and eleven of its sub basins as obtained from the mlmm and jpl mascon datasets as well as the total changes in groundwater and surface water storage gswsc as obtained from the gracemlmm and gldas datasets for the period between 2003 and 2015 the results indicate δtws from different solutions are basically the same with each other δtws generally reached a maximum in summer and a minimum in winter the annual of δtws in the yrb and eleven of its sub basins show an apparent increase the regional average δtws and gswsc trend for each sub basin of the yrb increased during the period of 2003 2015 table 3 chao and wang 2017 and liu et al 2020 also found that the trend of δtws and groundwater was increasing as mlmm was a region averaging method from grace level 2 shc data and thus was unable to generate the spatial maps in each sub basin the spatial form of δtws s trend between 2003 and 2015 was obtained from jpl mascon rl06 fig 6 a the results indicate that δtws in the west and south of the jinsha river basin shows a rapid decrease fig 6 a which may be caused by glacier melting in the qing tibet plateau gardner et al 2013 and several drought events in yunnan in recent years chao et al 2016 the δtws in the min river jialing river and upper tributary basins show apparently increases however δtws in the northern hanjiang river basin shows decreases it may be influenced by the continued droughts in recent several years qian et al 2011 the δtws in the southeast of dongting lake and the southern part of poyang lake basins show a decrease persistent with the recent nearly dried up in the poyang lake basin liu et al 2013 the δtws in the lower tributary and tai lake basins show a decreasing trend which are generally persistent with the accelerated surface subsidence in recent years zhang et al 2005 additionally the linear trend of the total of groundwater and surface water storage changes gswsc was acquired from the δtws subtracting the gldas data joodaki et al 2014 the trend of gswsc is shown in fig 6 b which pictured an increase except for the middle and lower parts of the jinsha river basin the upper part of the minjiang river and hanjiang river basins the middle of the jialing river and tai lake basins liu et al 2020 used grace and baseflow recession data to derive changes in groundwater storage which revealed an increase in groundwater in the yrb however the increase in groundwater in the yrb can be attributed to various factors including climate change land use and cover change and human activities moreover fig 6 a and b indicate that the spatial patterns of the δtws and the gswsc are similar and show increasing trends around the three gorges reservoir tgr owing to the low spatiotemporal resolution of the grace and lacking in situ data it is difficult to find the causes of the increased gswsc such as whether tgr impoundment can grow in the gswsc over the yrb to find the reasons for the increased gswsc we need to combine more in situ data e g well data around the tgr 5 conclusions a new method of mlmm was proposed to improve the ability of grace δtws in the small sub basins and was verified by in situ hydroclimatic stations data of p et and r comparing with the previous method landerer and swenson 2012 luthcke et al 2013 save et al 2016 swenson and wahr 2002 wahr et al 1998 the advantage of mlmm was simultaneously to isolate the results of δtws in the multiple basins by decreasing the leakage error and to restore the signal with an independent hydrological model in an easy way to verify the improvement in δtws estimated by mlmm δtws from mlmm was compared with different grace solutions such as sf lmm and mascons and in situ hydroclimatic station data mlmm was a region averaging method from grace level 2 shc data and thus was unable to generate the spatial maps in each sub basin however δtws from the mlmm of each sub basin can be considered as a spatial distribution of the whole yrb furthermore the contributions of p et and r to the δtws were also acquired using hpa the main conclusions were as follows 1 the δtws calculated with different methods and based on different grace derived input data generally agree well with each other compared to hydrological ground observations δtws from the mlmm is the best with the highest nse 0 8 and lowest rmse 2 3 cm excluding the han river basin 2 the mascons products in poyang lake and doting lake basins show less convincing performance with nse 0 7 and rmse 2 5 cm while nse is larger than 0 8 and rmse smaller than 2 cm from mlmm 3 the mlmm can effectively decrease δtws errors improve signal to noise ratios especially for small sub basins and enhance the reliability of δtws results 4 the δtws and gswsc was increasing in the yrb p in the yrb showed an immense contribution to the δtws 60 however the contributions of et to the δtws were more extensive than that of r over the middle basin of the yrb han river 25 9 vs 10 1 and doting lake 23 0 vs 20 7 basins the grace follow on gfo twin satellite mission was launched in 2018 and already provides observational data with improved precision and high spatiotemporal resolution landerer et al 2020 although grace gfo has made a significant contribution to hydrology its focus has mainly been on a large scale therefore it would be a tremendous achievement to improve the spatial and temporal resolutions of grace gfo while the proposed mlmm was designed to enhance the detection of δtws from grace in small sub basins its application in this study yielded average regional results and did not provide information on spatial changes a new method should be developed to infer the spatial changes in tws within sub basins basing on the grace and gfo data improving the ability of grace and gfo to detect δtws in small basins is crucial for hydrology particularly in runoff studies the reliable estimation of δtws from mlmm by using grace gfo data can effectively improve runoff forecasting in global basins especially in small basins where in situ hydrological data is unavailable therefore we will use the δtws from mlmm on a global scale and deep learning techniques to reconstruct long term high precision and reliable runoff data for global drought and flood analyses credit authorship

substituted into eq a16 to determine w basin finally δtws can be determined from eq a12 δtws will also undergo signal restoration and correction following eqs 7 13 and 14 as used in chao et al 2019
