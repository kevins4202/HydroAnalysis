6300,to investigate the seasonal variation of chemical weathering and its controlling factors in the central tibetan plateau tp hydrochemistry of stream water in two alpine catchments the niyaqu and qugaqie was studied at an unprecedented temporal resolution from july 2016 to september 2017 chemical compositions of river water in the two catchments were dominated by ca2 and hco 3 so 4 2 in the stream water mainly derived from sulfide oxidation but sulfuric acid played a minor role in rock weathering compared with carbonic acid the contributions of atmospheric input silicate weathering carbonate weathering and sulfide oxidation to riverine solutes of the niyaqu which overlies tuff sandstone shale and carbonate and is mainly recharged by groundwater were about 5 12 65 and 18 respectively these contributions to dissolved loads of the qugaqie where lithology consists of granite and sandstone and nearly half the stream water originates from glaciers meltwater were 10 35 34 and 20 respectively contribution of different sources to riverine solutes in the niyaqu were almost invariant between different seasons while the percentage of these sources in the stream water of the qugaqie showed significant seasonal variations especially for the weathering of silicate and carbonate average value of the former increased from 29 in the monsoon season to 45 during the nonmonsoon period on the contrary average value of the latter decreased from 37 to 29 in the corresponding periods carbonate weathering rates cwr and silicate weathering rates swr in the study areas exhibited distinct seasonal variability during the monsoon season the average cwr and swr values in the niyaqu were 34 3 t km2 y and 6 8 t km2 y respectively and their corresponding values in the qugaqie were 16 7 t km2 y and 11 0 t km2 y respectively which means that the average value of cwr in the niyaqu during the monsoon season is comparable with the cwr average for one year in catchments located in the eastern tp and the swr in the qugaqie during the monsoon season is close to the swr average for one year of some basins at the south slope of the himalaya chemical denudation rates decreased sharply during the nonmonsoon period indicating little chemical exhumation within that time due to cold and arid weather runoff was the most important factor that controls chemical weathering in both the niyaqu and qugaqie followed by physical erosion rates and the influence of temperature seems to be insignificant in the niyaqu while at the same time crucial in the qugaqie keywords chemical weathering seasonal variation runoff glacier central tibetan plateau 1 introduction chemical weathering plays a vital role in regulating the atmospheric co2 levels over geological times scales moon et al 2009 raymond 2017 quantifying rates or fluxes of chemical weathering and clarifying its controlling factors are significant in interpreting and predicting past and future changes of global climate moon et al 2009 wang et al 2016 rivers are major conduits for materials and energy exchange between terrestrial atmospheric and oceanic reservoirs atkins et al 2017 palmer et al 2001 as river water is both a cause of chemical weathering and carrier of weathering products such as solutes and suspended particles the chemical composition of river water can shed light on chemical weathering processes in its recharge area donnini et al 2016 gaillardet et al 1999 chemical denudation of rocks is the most important provenance of solutes in most rivers pant et al 2017 zakharova et al 2005 chemical weathering is assumed to mainly occur by reaction with carbonic acid formed by the dissolution of carbon dioxide in water hindshaw et al 2016 though sulfuric acid formed by the oxidation of sulfide mineral can also induce and accelerate rock weathering physical erosion and chemical weathering influence one another physical erosion may depend on the chemical breakdown and thus weakening of rock and chemical weathering depends on the availability of fresh mineral surfaces created by physical erosion riebe et al 2004 these weathering processes and rates depend strongly on fluid residence times and fluid flow rates maher 2010 and are controlled by such factors as temperature runoff precipitation lithology vegetation and physical erosion rates per dupré et al 2003 goudie and viles 2012 wolff boenisch et al 2009 the tibetan plateau tp with an average elevation over 4000 m a s l is the world s highest cenozoic plateau and is referred to as the third pole qiu 2008 yao et al 2012 numerous research findings in the tp have focused on large exoreic rivers on margins of the plateau while few studies have been conducted in small watersheds with homogeneous geology galy and france lanord 1999 hren et al 2007 pant et al 2017 singh et al 2005 wang et al 2016 wolff boenisch et al 2009 wu et al 2005 the major advantage of large rivers research is that it gives global information integrating over large portions of continental crust and varying climatic regions gaillardet et al 1999 however the study of chemical weathering in small streams can constrain controlling factors better than large rivers for the magnitude and uncertainty of critical parameters namely solute fluxes water discharge temperature and physical weathering rates can be more accurately measured west et al 2002 the tp is the most concentrated glacier distributed region in the middle and low latitudes and is also the center of the glacier distribution in china and the high asia yao et al 2004 currently information about chemical weathering and its controlling factors in the glacier covered areas of the tp is restricted by limited research hodson et al 2002 singh et al 2014 west et al 2002 the central tp is experiencing climatic change with a period of warming that has led to glacial retreat over the past several decades kang et al 2010 hydrological changes resulting from this glacial retreat yao et al 2012 and changes of air temperature and precipitation may modify the chemical weathering processes and cationic denudation rates in these glacier covered basins besides mounting research has found large seasonal variations in the major cations in dissolved loads indicating a climatic sensitivity of weathering processes however most of these studies have focused on selected rivers draining the himalaya eastern and northeast part of the tp and little information about this topic has been obtained on the central tp dalai et al 2002 jin et al 2011 li et al 2014b quade et al 2003 wolff boenisch et al 2009 zhang et al 2013a in this study we present chemical weathering data in the form of stream discharge physio chemical water properties and carbonate and silicate weathering rates for two typical catchments the niyaqu and qugaqie on central of the tp for two monsoon seasons and one nonmonsoon season at an unprecedented temporal resolution the catchments differ in their underlying lithology and water sources and both experience significant seasonal fluctuation thus these two watersheds provide an ideal backdrop to evaluate seasonal variation of chemical weathering and its sensitivity to lithology runoff precipitation per temperature and other environmental factors on the central tp 2 study site the nam co basin is located at the northern slope of the nyaingêntanglha mountains with an altitude ranging from 4729 m to 7111 m a s l fig 1 according to the classification developed by the chinese meteorological administration the nam co basin has a semi arid subarctic plateau climate gao et al 2011 the weather in the monsoon season is relatively warm and wet with over 95 of the annual precipitation occurring during this time gao et al 2015 zhang et al 2013b but becomes chilly and dry during the nonmonsoon period strong seasonality in both temperature and precipitation are linked with the alternation between the india monsoon and the westerly jet stream li et al 2014a wang et al 2017 the niyaqu catchment with an elevation between 4732 and 5703 m a s l drains an area of 388 km2 groundwater is the majority recharge source of runoff in the niyaqu even though 0 3 km2 land in the eastern part is covered by glaciers tuff is distributed in the northwest of the basin while shale sandstone and carbonate lens are mainly distributed in the southeastern part a small proportion of biotite adamellite and biotite plagioclase metagranulitite are located at the northeastern part of the catchment stream channels and their adjacent areas are covered by quaternary unconsolidated sediments which are mainly sourced from upstream the qugaqie basin with an area of 59 km2 is located at the northern slope of nyaingêntanglha with an altitude ranging from 4760 m to 6090 m gao et al 2015 the glaciers overlay an area 5 km2 in the southeast of this basin accounting for about 9 of the whole area a large deficit of the glaciers in summer resulted in negative annual mass balances of approximately 1200 mm during 2005 2012 qu et al 2014 as a glacier fed drainage basin glacier meltwater is the main recharge source to the qugaqie accounting for about 50 of the total runoff in 2006 2008 gao et al 2015 the underlying lithology in the qugaqie is silicate with biotite adamellites and granodiorites distributed in the southern and middle parts with a patch of sandstone in the north central area and quaternary unconsolidated sediments covering the northern part and the surrounding area of stream channels fig 2 3 methodology the monitoring campaign for hydrochemistry of stream water was carried out from july 16 2016 to september 29 2017 covering two monsoon seasons and one nonmonsoon season air temperature and precipitation were obtained from the automatic weather station aws located between the two study areas fig 1 30 41 14 n 91 3 22 e 5165 m a s l automatic water stage recorders onset hobo u20 were set in the gauging stations s1 and s2 in fig 2 at the beginning of the monsoon season and were removed at the end of the monsoon period synchronous water discharge was measured after sampling at s1 four 48 hour diel discharge monitoring campaigns were conducted in s2 at a 2 h frequency in august and october 2016 and may and august 2017 consequently a rating curve was developed to calculate water discharge in the monsoon season based on the relationship of synchronous discharge and recorded water stages water discharge during the nonmonsoon period was obtained by instantaneous water flux measurements through chiseling the surface ice layer river water sampling was conducted weekly in the monsoon season and biweekly during the nonmonsoon period at the monitoring sites s1 and s2 fig 2 water samples were collected using 1 l acid washed nitric acid polyethylene pe bottles after being pre rinsed with river water ultimately 46 and 31 samples were collected at the monitoring gauging stations for the s1 niyaqu and s2 qugaqie respectively in addition 27 atmospheric precipitation samples were collected at the nam co station for multisphere observation and research namor fig 1 17 of which were obtained during the monsoon season twelve surface snow and ice samples at surface of the zhadang glacier were collected in august and october 2016 and august and october 2017 soon after collection these samples were preserved in a refrigerator 18 c at the namor until filtration temperature specific conductivity at 25 c and ph of the river water were measured in the field using a portable multi parameter meter hanna hi98129 with resolutions of 0 1 c 1 μs cm 1 and 0 01 respectively alkalinity was obtained by the aquamerck alkalinity test in the field with a resolution of 0 1 mmol l hco 3 is considered equivalent to alkalinity due to alkaline river water in the study areas all water samples were transported to the key laboratory of tibetan environment changes and land surface process branch lhasa suspended particulate matter spm concentrations of stream water were obtained by filtering a known weight of water samples through pre weighted lcr hydrophilic ptfe membrane filters millipore with a diameter of 47 mm and pore size of 0 45 μm two volumes of 50 ml filtered water were transferred into two pre rinsed pe bottles one of which was acidified to ph 2 with three drops of ultrapure hno3 to preserve cation concentrations preventing algal growth and carbonate precipitation acidified samples were used for cation analysis by inductivity coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes prodigy leeman with a resolution of 0 001 mg l the non acidified filtered sample was used for anion measurement by ion chromatography ic ics 900 dionex with a resolution of 0 01 mg l all ion analysis was conducted at key laboratory of continental collision and plateau uplift chinese academy of sciences total cationic charge tz was calculated as the sum of cations na k 2ca2 2 mg2 in μmolc l where molc denotes micromoles of charges total anionic charge tz was calculated as the sum of anions cl no 3 2 so 4 2 hco 3 normalized inorganic charge balance nicb was calculated between total cationic and anionic charges as tz tz tz 100 total dissolved solids tds was then calculated as a sum of the concentrations of major cations and anions k na ca2 mg2 sio2 cl no 3 so 4 2 hco 3 in mg l river bed sediments were collected with clean plastic bags and then naturally air dried in the laboratory about 50 g of sediments were ground to fine powder and sieved to 2 mm then about 30 mg of these sediments were weighed and transferred into a 15 ml teflon beaker along with the teflon filter membranes that carried the suspended particulate matter calcite in these samples was leached for 24 h by 7 ml 0 5 mol l acetic acid and then the supernatants in the container were removed carefully after centrifugation washing the residue with 10 ml of ultrapure water three times to dislodge calcium and magnesium the remaining silicate materials were digested by hydrofluoric and nitric acid and then measured by the icp oes to get the elemental composition of silicate using the elemental composition of silicate weathering rates of carbonate and silicate cwr and swr respectively were calculated by the following equations 1 cwr 2 ca 2 car 2 mg 2 car discharge contributing area 2 swr k sil na sil ca sil 2 mg 2 sil sio 2 riv discharge contributing area where ca2 car and mg2 ca are cations produced by carbonate dissolution k sil na sil ca2 sil and mg2 sil represent cations originated from silicate weathering sio2riv denotes the concentration of sio2 in the stream water both weathering rates are expressed in t km2 y it is assumed that the silicate derived alkalinity is charge balanced by silicate derived cations and the charge balance is independent of aqueous silica concentration xu and liu 2007 4 results 4 1 meteorological data from october 2015 to september 2016 and october 2016 to september 2017 the precipitation and annual average air temperature were 413 mm 437 mm 0 02 c and 0 46 c respectively about 95 of the precipitation occurred in the monsoon season air temperatures during the whole nonmonsoon period were almost all below 0 c with mean values of 4 6 c and 3 9 c respectively while the mean air temperatures in the monsoon season were 6 4 c 6 6 c respectively 4 2 stream discharge the discharges of the niyaqu from may to october in 2016 and 2017 were 1 16 108 m3 and 0 99 108 m3 respectively water discharge in the nonmonsoon period november 2016 to april 2017 was 0 33 108 m3 thus the total water fluxes from may 2016 to april 2017 and from november 2016 to october 2017 were 1 49 108 m3 and 1 33 108 m3 respectively with discharge occurring during the monsoon season accounting for 78 and 74 respectively the discharges of the qugaqie from may to october in 2016 and 2017 were 0 69 108 m3 and 0 46 108 m3 respectively water flux during the nonmonsoon period was only 0 02 108 m3 as water at site s2 dried up during the period of january to april 2017 therefore the discharge produced in the monsoon season accounted for 97 and 95 of the total discharge in may 2016 to april 2017 and november 2016 to october 2017 respectively water discharges of both the niyaqu and qugaqie were much larger in the monsoon season than that during the nonmonsoon period by nearly 2 orders of magnitude water discharge of the niyaqu showed a bimodal pattern with the summits appearing in july and september lagging slightly behind the peak of precipitation fig 3 discharge of the qugaqie showed a monomodal pattern with the peak appearing in late july or early august when air temperature reached its maximum and the glaciers were undergoing intense ablation 4 3 physio chemical parameters of stream water water temperature of the niyaqu and qugaqie ranged from 0 1 c to 17 6 c and 0 1 c to 14 8 c respectively all stream waters were mildly alkaline with average ph values in a complete year october 2016 to september 2017 of 8 4 8 1 9 0 and 8 3 7 5 8 7 for the niyaqu and qugaqie respectively table 1 the average concentration of spm in the niyaqu was 15 0 mg l 1 3 82 7 mg l with the maximum and minimum occurring in april 2017 and january 2017 respectively fig 3 mean value of spm concentration in the qugaqie was 75 2 mg l varying from 7 2 mg l to 306 8 mg l tds of the niyaqu during the period of november 2016 to september 2017 varied from 116 7 mg l to 163 9 mg l with a mean value of 141 8 mg l and was lower in the monsoon season showing an opposite trend compared with discharge fig 3 similarly tds of the qugaqie during the same period ranged from 25 9 to 81 0 mg l with an average of 49 5 mg l and its value was also higher in the nonmonsoon period it is noteworthy that the concentration of solutes in both the niyaqu and qugaqie decreased slightly during the monsoon season while their discharge increased by over a magnitude during the same time total cationic charges tz of the niyaqu and qugaqie from october 2016 to september 2017 ranged from 1350 to 1980 μmolc l and 282 to 857 μmolc l with average values of 1672 μmolc l and 518 μmolc l respectively μmolc denotes micromoles of charges total anionic charges tz of the niyaqu and qugaqie during the same period ranged from 1406 μmolc l to 1977 μmolc l and 272 to 906 μmolc l with average values of 1714 μmolc l and 565 μmolc l respectively the normalized inorganic charge balances nicb of the niyaqu and qugaqie during the period mentioned above ranged from 13 to 10 and from 19 to 7 with average values of 2 and 8 respectively indicating cations and anions in most stream water was well balanced those water samples with nicb values lower than 10 may be caused by the overestimate of hco 3 which was measured in the field major ion concentrations of stream water are depicted in fig 4 and table 1 concentrations of cations in stream water of the niyaqu followed an order of ca2 mg2 na k contributing 66 16 15 and 3 to tz respectively fig 4 bicarbonate the most abundant anion accounted for 81 of tz other anions followed an order of so 4 2 sio2 cl with a proportion of 9 9 and 1 of tz respectively neither cations nor anions showed obviously seasonal variations in their proportion ca2 and mg2 were 1 2 larger in the monsoon season while na sio2 and so 4 2 were larger in the nonmonsoon period by 2 4 1 2 and 2 respectively cationic concentrations in the qugaqie followed an order of ca2 na mg2 k accounting for 50 33 9 and 7 of tz respectively while anionic concentrations followed an order of hco 3 sio2 so 4 2 cl with an average proportion of 73 17 9 and 2 respectively the proportion of anions changed little during the whole monitoring period while cations showed significant variation the average proportion of na to tz was 14 17 larger during the nonmonsoon season in contrast ca2 in the nonmonsoon season was 9 11 lower than that in the monsoon season precipitation exhibited a wide range of elemental concentrations all ionic concentrations were higher in the nonmonsoon period than those in the monsoon season with mean tds values of 6 1 mg l and 4 7 mg l respectively the proportion of cations during the monitoring period followed a sequence of ca2 na k mg2 with average values of 50 37 10 and 3 of tz respectively anions followed the order of hco 3 cl so 4 2 sio2 accounting for 60 32 6 and 3 respectively all cations except mg2 exhibited significant variation but did not show seasonal variation anions showed seasonal variations especially for cl and hco 3 and the former was 25 higher in the nonmonsoon while the latter was 27 lower in the nonmonsoon period concentrations of ions in the zhadang glacier with an average tds value of 4 02 mg l were lower than that in the precipitation samples collected at the namor similar with the precipitation samples cations in the zhadang glacier followed a sequence of ca2 na k mg2 and their average contribution to tz were 54 27 14 and 6 respectively anions followed an order of hco 3 cl sio2 so 4 2 with proportions of 50 25 18 and 7 respectively the chemical composition of fluvial deposits and suspended particles in the niyaqu and qugaqie are listed in table 2 mean values of ca na sil in riverbed sediments for both the niyaqu and qugaqie did not differ largely from that in spm mg k sil of the spm on the contrary were remarkably larger than that in the sediments studies have found that the dissolution of biotite is active in glacial environments anderson et al 2000 anderson et al 1997 as a glacier covered basin potassium bearing minerals in the qugaqie may experience significant weathering this process may also be active in niyaqu because of their similar climatic conditions compared with the sediments more potassium in the spm can be leached out as particles of the latter are smaller nevertheless riverine sediments are relatively coarse and the properties of bedrocks can be conserved better than spm a phenomenon validated by other studies blum et al 1998 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2008 therefore riverbed sand is more preferable to constrain the elemental composition of silicate in this study the mean value of ca na sil ratios is calculated from sediments and suspended particles while the mean value of mg k sil ratios is ciphered out using sediments elemental composition only 5 discussion 5 1 provenance of solutes in river water generally hydrochemistry of modern inland water is influenced by various natural and anthropogenic factors chetelat et al 2008 gibbs 1970 such as atmospheric precipitation liu et al 2016 chemical weathering of rocks li et al 2009 raymond 2017 xu and liu 2010 and anthropogenic inputs pant et al 2017 5 1 1 anthropogenic inputs the environment of both catchments is fairly pristine only a few herders live in the niyaqu while there are no permanent residents in the qugaqie and nomadic activities only prevail in the monsoon season as a tracer of anthropogenic activities cl in river water of the niyaqu and qugaqie only accounted for 1 and 2 of tz respectively similarly no3 in river water of the niyaqu and qugaqie only accounted for 1 2 of tds respectively low concentrations of these anions confirm that human influence on solutes of river water in the study areas is negligible thus atmospheric inputs and chemical weathering of rocks can be considered the two main sources of riverine loads in the study areas 5 1 2 atmospheric inputs atmospheric inputs were calculated using the rainwater correction method grosbois et al 2000 3 x x cl rain cl ref where x refers to the corrected concentration derived from rainwater x cl rain denotes measured ions cl in rainwater and clref refers to the concentration of cl derived from precipitation clref is calculated by multiplying the weighted average cl content of precipitation clave by the concentration factor f i e clref f clave f is the evapotranspiration coefficient and can be calculated using the following equation 4 f p r p refers to the total precipitation in mm y and r is the runoff in mm y in drainage basins discharge in the niyaqu from october 2016 to november 2017 was 1 394 108 m3 i e 359 mm and the amount of precipitation in the same period was 437 mm hence the value of f can be calculated as 1 22 the precipitation samples can be divided into two groups for better constraining seasonal atmospheric contributions group i is the samples collected during the monsoon season with the remaining samples in group ii for the niyaqu weighted average ionic concentration of group i can be used to subtract atmospheric inputs to riverine loads in the monsoon season weighted average ion concentrations of precipitation in a hydrological year are taken for the correction of precipitation inputs during the nonmonsoon period which is more reasonable because too limited precipitation occurred during the nonmonsoon period to maintain the discharge in the niyaqu within that time groundwater stored in aquifers during the monsoon season likely recharge the river during nonmonsoon low water level periods for the qugaqie ion concentrations of both glacier snow samples collected at the surface of the zhadang glacier and precipitation collected at the namor are used for the atmospheric correction because both of them are important recharge sources gao et al 2015 which is expressed as the following equation 5 x precipitation x glacier 1 22 x rain i 2 xglacier refers to ions of glacier or snow xraini refers to the average weighted ionic concentration of precipitation in group i this assumption may overestimate the contribution of atmospheric inputs during the monsoon season while underestimate its contribution in the nonmonsoon period as the proportion of meltwater would be larger during the former period and lower in the latter the calculated results are shown in fig 6 5 1 3 rock weathering inputs molar ratios of ca2 na hco 3 na and mg2 na in river water after precipitation correction can be used to reveal chemical weathering processes gaillardet et al 1999 goldsmith et al 2010 as shown in fig 5 most stream water samples collected from the niyaqu and qugaqie fall between the endmembers of silicate and carbonate suggesting chemical weathering of the two rocks are both important sources of the riverine solutes chemical weathering of silicate in the qugaqie seems to be playing a more crucial role when compared with that in the niyaqu because the former is closer to the silicate endmember both streams waters during the monsoon season are closer to the carbonate dissolution endmember indicating that the contribution of carbonate dissolution to riverine solutes is larger within that time in contrast the proportion of silicate weathering to solutes in river water is larger during the nonmonsoon period the points shown in fig 5 approach the endmember of evaporites dissolution to some extent especially for ca2 na vs mg2 na which indicate that both rivers are affected by evaporites dissolution however the fact that no halite or evaporite deposits are found in the niyaqu does not support this assumption additionally there is no strong correlation r2 0 12 p 0 05 between cl and so 4 2 in the niyaqu river waters further evidence that evaporites dissolution is not their main source this situation is similar for the qugaqie which drains granites and sandstones although a positive correlation exists r2 0 44 p 0 01 between the two anions therefore it is more reasonable to assume so 4 2 in the river water comes from sulfide mineral oxidation and that cl stems from atmospheric inputs rather than treating them as the dissolution of evaporites understanding the degree to which carbonic or sulfuric acid is responsible for mineral dissolution is important for quantifying the contribution of sulfuric acid weathering to global chemical weathering fluxes additionally sulfide oxidation coupled to carbonate dissolution is a key process determining stream water chemistry in glaciated catchments by virtue of exposing trace weatherable trace carbonate and pyrite minerals anderson et al 2000 bottrell and tranter 2002 darmody et al 2000 hindshaw et al 2016 therefore exploring the impacts of sulfuric acid on chemical weathering in the study areas is important in understanding chemical weathering processes in the central tp the reactions of carbonate and silicate with carbonic or sulfuric acids can be depicted by ratios of cations versus so 4 2 and hco 3 hindshaw et al 2016 wadham et al 2010 theoretical and observed values of ca2 mg2 and cations versus so 4 2 and hco 3 are shown in table 3 for carbonate ca and mg are the predominant cations produced in its dissolution process and other cations can be ignored making the value of tz so 4 2 and tz hco 3 in the dissolution of carbonate approximately equal to ca2 mg2 so 4 2 and ca2 mg2 hco 3 respectively all ions in this table have been corrected from precipitation inputs denoted by ratios of ca2 mg2 so 4 2 and tz so 4 2 in the niyaqu and qugaqie larger than two in both monsoon and nonmonsoon periods provide evidence that sulfuric acid formed by sulfide oxidation does not exert significant influence on chemical weathering of carbonate and silicate on the contrary ca2 mg2 hco 3 and tz hco 3 of most samples fell in the range between one and two which means that rock weathering is dominated by carbonic acid according to the observed ionic ratios listed in table 3 chemical weathering in the qugaqie is less impacted by sulfuric acids compared with the niyaqu average values of tz so 4 2 and ca2 mg2 so 4 2 for both niyaqu and qugaqie were larger in the nonmonsoon period while tz hco 3 and ca2 mg2 hco 3 were lower in the nonmonsoon period thus the influence of sulfuric acid on chemical weathering in the study areas is stronger during the monsoon season than in the nonmonsoon period 5 1 4 quantification of different sources to riverine solutes the forward modeling suggested by galy and france lanord 1999 is used to quantify the relative contribution of different sources to riverine solutes the sources can be expressed by the following equation 6 x river x atmospheric x carbonate x silicate x sulfide where x atmospheric x carbonate x silicate and x sulfide denote the proportion of dissolved cations from atmospheric inputs chemical weathering of carbonate and silicate and sulfide oxidation respectively the results are shown in fig 6 the atmospheric inputs in the niyaqu accounted for about 5 of the total cationic tds the average contribution of silicate weathering accounted for about 12 range of 9 18 within the monitoring period in comparison carbonate weathering contributed on average 65 57 69 the average contribution of sulfide oxidation was near 18 13 25 the contribution of different sources to riverine solutes in the niyaqu was almost invariant between different seasons with differences between monsoon and nonmonsoon values in silicate weatering and sulfide oxidation of 1 2 different from the niyaqu the average contribution of atmospheric inputs in the qugaqie during the period of october 2016 to september 2017 was 10 7 15 the average contribution of silicate and carbonate weathering was 35 19 60 and 34 12 47 during the same period respectively sulfide oxidation accounted for about 20 16 24 silicate weathering accounted for 29 during the monsoon season in 2017 while its value increased to 45 in the nonmonsoon period the average contribution of carbonate dissolution to riverine solutes was 37 during the monsoon season in 2017 whereas its value decreased to 29 in the nonmonsoon period the contribution of carbonate weathering decreased as time passed within the nonmonsoon period and its value reached the lowest 12 at the end of this period in comparison silicate weathering increased within the same period and reached its maximum 60 at the end of the nonmonsoon season both contributions of atmospheric input and sulfide oxidation were larger in the monsoon season than nonmonsoon period by 4 and 3 respectively the decrease of atmospheric inputs is consistent with the decrease of meltwater of snow ice and precipitation sulfide oxidation in the qugaqie would be suppressed by limited precipitation during the nonmonsoon period additionally the production of fresh rock flour decreased during the nonmonsoon period indicated by the reduction of spm as weakened abrasion provided less sulfide mineral thus restricting sulfide oxidation as a small watershed draining silicate rocks only carbonate formation is absent in the qugaqie dissolution of trace calcite minerals contained in bulk rock is the main source of carbonate weathering in monsoon season water rock reaction time is short which would favor carbonate dissolution and suppress the weathering of silicate minerals for the latter process is relatively slow compared with the former however water rock interaction in the nonmonsoon season is stronger because of longer residence time which favors silicate weathering for its slow solvability resulting in the proportion of silicate weathering to riverine solutes exceeding the contribution of carbonate dissolution average ca si ratios in stream water of both the niyaqu and qugaqie were higher in the monsoon season 8 7 and 3 6 respectively than nonmonsoon period 7 4 and 3 0 respectively which verifies the importance of residence time of water in controlling hydrochemistry in the study areas hindshaw et al 2011 as for the niyaqu the mixing of groundwater in the aquifer during different seasons may be the potential reason for the constant percentage of different resources to riverine solutes this hypothesis can be partly proved by the appreciable water flux during the nonmonsoon period even though the weather is extremely arid in this period however this area requires further research 5 2 seasonal variations of chemical weathering rates the results of cwr and swr during the monsoon and nonmonsoon seasons for both catchments are shown in table 4 during the period of october 2016 to september 2017 the average values of the cwr in the niyaqu and qugaqie were 24 8 t km2 y and 9 1 t km2 y respectively and the average values of the swr in the niyaqu and qugaqie were 5 1 t km2 y and 6 1 t km2 y respectively chemical weathering rates of carbonate and silicate showed significant seasonal variation for both the niyaqu and qugaqie fig 7 and table 4 the peak of cwr and swr in the niyaqu occurred in september different from the niyaqu the values of cwr and swr in the qugaqie reached a maximum in late july or early august the average values of cwr and swr in the niyaqu were about five times and four times larger during the monsoon season than that in nonmonsoon period respectively for the qugaqie the average values of cwr and swr in the monsoon season were nearly eight times and six times higher than their values in the nonmonsoon period respectively although solutes concentration in river water of the niyaqu and qugaqie during the nonmonsoon season were 1 4 times and 3 1 times higher than the corresponding values in the monsoon season respectively chemical weathering rates were low for the minimal discharge within that period the cwr in the niyaqu was larger than that in the qugaqie during both the monsoon and nonmonsoon season which is consistent with the difference of lithology in those two catchments the average value of swr in the qugaqie was larger than that in the niyaqu during the monsoon season seasonal variation of weathering in the niyaqu was less than the value in the qugaqie possibly due to the smaller variation in runoff amplitude and per in the former catchment seasonal variation of cwr seems more dramatic than swr implying carbonate weathering is more sensitive to the changes of moisture and heat to better understand chemical weathering of the study areas we compiled the chemical weathering rates of catchments located in the eastern tp south slope of the himalaya and high latitude areas table 4 and fig 8 the average values of cwr in the niyaqu and qugaqie for one complete year are far less than basins in the south slope of the himalaya and eastern part of the tp but are comparable with watersheds located at high latitude regions and the world average value the average annual values of swr in the study areas are less than basins in the south slope of the himalaya and comparable with that of basins located in the eastern tp and the world average value the values of swr in the study areas are greater than in basins located in the northern temperate or frigid zone by nearly an order of magnitude indicating that chemical weathering rates in rapidly uplifting and young orogenic belts are stronger than that in high latitude regions even though they share similar climatic characteristics chemical weathering rates exhibit a dramatic seasonal variation denoted by dash line in fig 8 especially for the qugaqie the cwr of the niyaqu during the monsoon season is close to that in catchments located in the eastern tp the swr of the qugaqie is comparable with basins located along the south slope of the himalaya both cwr and swr in the niyaqu and qugaqie during the nonmonsoon period are low and are comparable with that in high latitude catchments indicating that there is little chemical exhumation in the nonmonsoon season in cold arid climates similar phenomena are also found in catchments located at the nepalese high himalaya wolff boenisch et al 2009 5 3 controlling factors on chemical weathering rates many factors could exert critical control on chemical weathering rates such as temperature runoff precipitation lithology or mineralogy vegetation and per dupré et al 2003 goudie and viles 2012 wolff boenisch et al 2009 however some interlinkages exist between them making it difficult to distinguish the principal factors that govern chemical denudation especially for large drainage basins where environmental factors are complicated lithology is one of the most important factors to impact chemical denudation for it is the solutes provider different rocks composed of different minerals and structures are more or less resistant to chemical weathering and will thus experience different weathering rates goudie and viles 2012 meybeck 1987 have proved that the weathering rates of carbonate volcanoes sandstone and shales are 12 1 5 1 3 and 2 5 times larger than granites respectively the cwr in the niyaqu was 2 7 times higher than qugaqie due to the underlying carbonate lens in theory the swr in the niyaqu basin should also be larger than that in the qugaqie because the tuff and shale rocks distributed in the former catchment are more susceptible to chemical weathering than the granite and sandstone in the qugaqie however the observed results show that the annual swr in the niyaqu is slightly lower than that in the qugaqie and the average value during the monsoon season in the latter is much larger than that in the former catchment therefore other environmental factors such as high runoff and high abundance of fresh silicate flour produced by glaciation have inverted this assumption disruption of mineral lattices by grinding increases dissolution rates and high surface area would make glacial sediments exceptionally weatherable anderson et al 1997 additionally relatively higher runoff in the qugaqie 828 mm km2 y caused by the melting of the glaciers than the niyaqu 343 mm km2 y facilitate silicate weathering water discharge in the qugaqie during the nonmonsoon period was much less than that in the niyaqu 0 02 108 m3 versus 0 33 108 m3 which is the reason for the qugaqie s lower swr value than that in the niyaqu in this period as a parameter in the calculation of chemical weathering rates runoff has been suggested as a major factor controlling chemical erosion across many environments as it is a reactant supply in weathering processes gaillardet et al 1999 singh et al 2005 kump et al 2000 believe that the clearest correlation in the field is between chemical weathering rates and runoff indicative of an important dependence on the intensity of the hydrological cycle similarly the correlation analysis conducted in two small catchments located on northeastern tp shows that silicate weathering is strongly dependent on water discharge in the semi arid area zhang et al 2013a stachnik et al 2016 also proved that the high rates of chemical denudation in werenskioldbreen svalbard was mostly caused by the high rates of discharge and ablation yde et al 2014 demonstrated that increasing discharge leads to increasing solute export at the catchment scale as described before seasonal variation of rock weathering rates in the two catchments is highly consistent with the variation of water flux which means that runoff is the primary factor to control the rates of chemical weathering in the study areas the relationship between temperature and chemical weathering has long been a concern of scientists due to the proposed feedbacks between chemical weathering and atmospheric co2 berner et al 1983 raymond 2017 though laboratory studies have manifested that mineral dissolution of rocks is strongly dependent on temperature the expression of this dependence in the field is often obscured by other environmental factors that co vary with temperature kump et al 2000 the impact of temperature on reaction rates of minerals can be quantified by the arrhenius type laws white et al 1999 thus making an exponential function a better fitting equation than others per was calculated by multiplying spm concentration and water discharge using the per value of river water in the monitoring section to characterize the intensity of physical erosion conditions for the whole basin is reasonable though some uncertainties caused by suspended particle matter experiencing sedimentation before river water arriving at s1 and s2 may exist however the short distance between outlet of mountain and monitoring section 5 8 km and 0 8 km for the niyaqu and qugaqie respectively and the relatively fast water velocity 1 5 m s and 2 8 m s for s1 and s2 during the monsoon season in 2016 respectively constrained these uncertainties the relationships between chemical weathering rates and runoff water temperature and per in study areas are depicted in figs 9 and 10 both cwr and swr show a strong linear positive correlation with runoff in both the niyaqu and qugaqie cwr and swr increase with the increase of water temperature for the niyaqu which coincides with the arrhenius law that dissolution rates of minerals increase with temperature white and blum 1995 yet low correlations have illustrated that water temperature is not their primary controlling factor on the contrary cwr and swr in the qugaqie increase exponentially with water temperature implying water temperature played important roles in chemical weathering this situation is fairly obvious in small catchments occupied by active glaciers fluctuation of air temperature influences the yield of meltwater and the movement of glaciers and then affect discharge and physical erosion besides meltwater under glacier accelerates abrasion and produces more fine fresh mineral particles the distribution of water temperature vs cwr or swr are scattered in fig 10 suggesting that runoff and per influenced cation denudation rates more directly in the qugaqie although the temperature is the authentic driving factor behind them the per and chemical weathering rates exhibit logarithmic relation in the niyaqu chemical weathering rates increase rapidly when per 10 t km2 y with smaller increases when per 10 t km2 y the relationships between per and cation denudation rates in the qugaqie are more consistent with the logarithmic variation and a threshold value around 100 t km2 y after which smaller increases are seen the logarithmic relationship with threshold values between weathering rates and per can be explained by two different situations transport limited and kinetic limited gabet et al 2010 gaillardet et al 1999 moore et al 2013 water is a restrictive factor for chemical weathering in the study areas due to the semi arid subarctic climate in nonmonsoon or early monsoon season extremely limited precipitation and low temperature hinder the interaction between water and rocks leading to inhibited chemical weathering in addition these weathering products e g solutes and suspended particles could not be transported to river water due to the shortage of flowing groundwater even if weathering processes may have occurred within the study catchments therefore this condition can be summarized as transport limited regime the water shortage situation would not be relieved until the monsoon season comes during the monsoon period restrictive factors for chemical weathering are the kinetics of minerals dissolution because high erosion rates have provided abundant weatherable materials as a result chemical weathering rates would reach a plateau and increase slowly when per reaches its threshold values distinct differences of per threshold values among the two catchments may be caused by their different recharge forms nearly half of the river water in the qugaqie is derived from meltwater and fine rock particles produced by glaciation could be directly flushed into the stream the niyaqu is mainly recharged by groundwater so most suspended particles are intercepted by the soil layer or aquifer even though plentiful fresh minerals may have been produced by freeze thaw weathering and thermal expansion weathering 6 conclusions and implications influenced by seasonal change in environmental factors cwr and swr in both catchments of the niyaqu and qugaqie show significant seasonal variation with greater values during the monsoon season than in the nonmonsoon period runoff is the most important factor controlling chemical weathering in the niyaqu followed by per and the influence of water temperature seems insignificant furthermore discharge of the niyaqu is controlled by atmospheric precipitation which indicates that the chemical weathering processes in small catchments where groundwater is the overwhelming recharge form are mainly controlled by precipitation runoff is also the governing factor for chemical weathering in the qugaqie followed by water temperature and per both meltwater and groundwater are significant recharge forms for the qugaqie and they are influenced by air temperature and precipitation therefore both temperature and precipitation are the controlling factors of chemical denudation in catchments occupied by active alpine glaciers this information implies that chemical weathering intensity in central of the tp may become stronger due to the trend of warming and wetting in the future chemical weathering rates on the tp exhibit remarkable spatial variability the average swr value on the central tp is relatively low when compared with basins located at the margin of the tp where the geographical setting is characterized by higher precipitation and rapid tectonic uplift across the tp precipitation decreases towards the northwest and the weather becomes colder as such chemical weathering of large areas in central parts of the tp are suppressed by the limited precipitation and frigid temperature as weathering rates are controlled by runoff and temperature as evidenced by findings in the niyaqu and qugaqie catchments declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing

6300,to investigate the seasonal variation of chemical weathering and its controlling factors in the central tibetan plateau tp hydrochemistry of stream water in two alpine catchments the niyaqu and qugaqie was studied at an unprecedented temporal resolution from july 2016 to september 2017 chemical compositions of river water in the two catchments were dominated by ca2 and hco 3 so 4 2 in the stream water mainly derived from sulfide oxidation but sulfuric acid played a minor role in rock weathering compared with carbonic acid the contributions of atmospheric input silicate weathering carbonate weathering and sulfide oxidation to riverine solutes of the niyaqu which overlies tuff sandstone shale and carbonate and is mainly recharged by groundwater were about 5 12 65 and 18 respectively these contributions to dissolved loads of the qugaqie where lithology consists of granite and sandstone and nearly half the stream water originates from glaciers meltwater were 10 35 34 and 20 respectively contribution of different sources to riverine solutes in the niyaqu were almost invariant between different seasons while the percentage of these sources in the stream water of the qugaqie showed significant seasonal variations especially for the weathering of silicate and carbonate average value of the former increased from 29 in the monsoon season to 45 during the nonmonsoon period on the contrary average value of the latter decreased from 37 to 29 in the corresponding periods carbonate weathering rates cwr and silicate weathering rates swr in the study areas exhibited distinct seasonal variability during the monsoon season the average cwr and swr values in the niyaqu were 34 3 t km2 y and 6 8 t km2 y respectively and their corresponding values in the qugaqie were 16 7 t km2 y and 11 0 t km2 y respectively which means that the average value of cwr in the niyaqu during the monsoon season is comparable with the cwr average for one year in catchments located in the eastern tp and the swr in the qugaqie during the monsoon season is close to the swr average for one year of some basins at the south slope of the himalaya chemical denudation rates decreased sharply during the nonmonsoon period indicating little chemical exhumation within that time due to cold and arid weather runoff was the most important factor that controls chemical weathering in both the niyaqu and qugaqie followed by physical erosion rates and the influence of temperature seems to be insignificant in the niyaqu while at the same time crucial in the qugaqie keywords chemical weathering seasonal variation runoff glacier central tibetan plateau 1 introduction chemical weathering plays a vital role in regulating the atmospheric co2 levels over geological times scales moon et al 2009 raymond 2017 quantifying rates or fluxes of chemical weathering and clarifying its controlling factors are significant in interpreting and predicting past and future changes of global climate moon et al 2009 wang et al 2016 rivers are major conduits for materials and energy exchange between terrestrial atmospheric and oceanic reservoirs atkins et al 2017 palmer et al 2001 as river water is both a cause of chemical weathering and carrier of weathering products such as solutes and suspended particles the chemical composition of river water can shed light on chemical weathering processes in its recharge area donnini et al 2016 gaillardet et al 1999 chemical denudation of rocks is the most important provenance of solutes in most rivers pant et al 2017 zakharova et al 2005 chemical weathering is assumed to mainly occur by reaction with carbonic acid formed by the dissolution of carbon dioxide in water hindshaw et al 2016 though sulfuric acid formed by the oxidation of sulfide mineral can also induce and accelerate rock weathering physical erosion and chemical weathering influence one another physical erosion may depend on the chemical breakdown and thus weakening of rock and chemical weathering depends on the availability of fresh mineral surfaces created by physical erosion riebe et al 2004 these weathering processes and rates depend strongly on fluid residence times and fluid flow rates maher 2010 and are controlled by such factors as temperature runoff precipitation lithology vegetation and physical erosion rates per dupré et al 2003 goudie and viles 2012 wolff boenisch et al 2009 the tibetan plateau tp with an average elevation over 4000 m a s l is the world s highest cenozoic plateau and is referred to as the third pole qiu 2008 yao et al 2012 numerous research findings in the tp have focused on large exoreic rivers on margins of the plateau while few studies have been conducted in small watersheds with homogeneous geology galy and france lanord

integrating over large portions of continental crust and varying climatic regions gaillardet et al 1999 however the study of chemical weathering in small streams can constrain controlling factors better than large rivers for the magnitude and uncertainty of critical parameters namely solute fluxes water discharge temperature and physical weathering rates can be more accurately measured west et al 2002 the tp is the most concentrated glacier distributed region in the middle and low latitudes and is also the center of the glacier distribution in china and the high asia yao et al 2004 currently information about chemical weathering and its controlling factors in the glacier covered areas of the tp is restricted by limited research hodson et al 2002 singh et al 2014 west et al 2002 the central tp is experiencing climatic change with a period of warming that has led to glacial retreat over the past several decades kang et al 2010 hydrological changes resulting from this glacial retreat yao et al 2012 and changes of air temperature and precipitation may modify the chemical weathering processes and cationic denudation rates in these glacier covered basins besides mounting research has found large seasonal variations in the major cations in dissolved loads indicating a climatic sensitivity of weathering processes however most of these studies have focused on selected rivers draining the himalaya eastern and northeast part of the tp and little information about this topic has been obtained on the central tp dalai et al 2002 jin et al 2011 li et al 2014b quade et al 2003 wolff boenisch et al 2009 zhang et al 2013a in this study we present chemical weathering data in the form of stream discharge physio chemical water properties and carbonate and silicate weathering rates for two typical catchments the niyaqu and qugaqie on central of the tp for two monsoon seasons and one nonmonsoon season at an unprecedented temporal resolution the catchments differ in their underlying lithology and water sources and both experience significant seasonal fluctuation thus these two watersheds provide an ideal backdrop to evaluate seasonal variation of chemical weathering and its sensitivity to lithology runoff precipitation per temperature and other environmental factors on the central tp 2 study site the nam co basin is located at the northern slope of the nyaingêntanglha mountains with an altitude ranging from 4729 m to 7111 m a s l fig 1 according to the classification developed by the chinese meteorological administration the nam co basin has a semi arid subarctic plateau climate gao et al 2011 the weather in the monsoon season is relatively warm and wet with over 95 of the annual precipitation occurring during this time gao et al 2015 zhang et al 2013b but becomes chilly and dry during the nonmonsoon period strong seasonality in both temperature and precipitation are linked with the alternation between the india monsoon and the westerly jet stream li et al 2014a wang et al 2017 the niyaqu catchment with an elevation between 4732 and 5703 m a s l drains an area of 388 km2 groundwater is the majority recharge source of runoff in the niyaqu even though 0 3 km2 land in the eastern part is covered by glaciers tuff is distributed in the northwest of the basin while shale sandstone and carbonate lens are mainly distributed in the southeastern part a small proportion of biotite adamellite and biotite plagioclase metagranulitite are located at the northeastern part of the catchment stream channels and their adjacent areas are covered by quaternary unconsolidated sediments which are mainly sourced from upstream the qugaqie basin with an area of 59 km2 is located at the northern slope of nyaingêntanglha with an altitude ranging from 4760 m to 6090 m gao et al 2015 the glaciers overlay an area 5 km2 in the southeast of this basin accounting for about 9 of the whole area a large deficit of the glaciers in summer resulted in negative annual mass balances of approximately 1200 mm during 2005 2012 qu et al 2014 as a glacier fed drainage basin glacier meltwater is the main recharge source to the qugaqie accounting for about 50 of the total runoff in 2006 2008 gao et al 2015 the underlying lithology in the qugaqie is silicate with biotite adamellites and granodiorites distributed in the southern and middle parts with a patch of sandstone in the north central area and quaternary unconsolidated sediments covering the northern part and the surrounding area of stream channels fig 2 3 methodology the monitoring campaign for hydrochemistry of stream water was carried out from july 16 2016 to september 29 2017 covering two monsoon seasons and one nonmonsoon season air temperature and precipitation

stations s1 and s2 in fig 2 at the beginning of the monsoon season and were removed at the end of the monsoon period synchronous water discharge was measured after sampling at s1 four 48 hour diel discharge monitoring campaigns were conducted in s2 at a 2 h frequency in august and october 2016 and may and august 2017 consequently a rating curve was developed to calculate water discharge in the monsoon season based on the relationship of synchronous discharge and recorded water stages water discharge during the nonmonsoon period was obtained by instantaneous water flux measurements through chiseling the surface ice layer river water sampling was conducted weekly in the monsoon season and biweekly during the nonmonsoon period at the monitoring sites s1 and s2 fig 2 water samples were collected using 1 l acid washed nitric acid polyethylene pe bottles after being pre rinsed with river water ultimately 46 and 31 samples were collected at the monitoring gauging stations for the s1 niyaqu and s2 qugaqie respectively in addition 27 atmospheric precipitation samples were collected at the nam co station for multisphere observation and research namor fig 1 17 of which were obtained during the monsoon season twelve surface snow and ice samples at surface of the zhadang glacier were collected in august and october 2016 and august and october 2017 soon after collection these samples were preserved in a refrigerator 18 c at the namor until filtration temperature specific conductivity at 25 c and ph of the river water were measured in the field using a portable multi parameter meter hanna hi98129 with resolutions of 0 1 c 1 μs cm 1 and 0 01 respectively alkalinity was obtained by the aquamerck alkalinity test in the field with a resolution of 0 1 mmol l hco 3 is considered equivalent to alkalinity due to alkaline river water in the study areas all water samples were transported to the key laboratory of tibetan environment changes and land surface process branch lhasa suspended particulate matter spm concentrations of stream water were obtained by filtering a known weight of water samples through pre weighted lcr hydrophilic ptfe membrane filters millipore with a diameter of 47 mm and pore size of 0 45 μm two volumes of 50 ml filtered water were transferred into two pre rinsed pe bottles one of which was acidified to ph 2 with three drops of

hco 3 in mg l river bed sediments were collected with clean plastic bags and then naturally air dried in the laboratory about 50 g of sediments were ground to fine powder and sieved to 2 mm then about 30 mg of these sediments were weighed and transferred into a 15 ml teflon beaker along with the teflon filter membranes that carried the suspended particulate matter calcite in these samples was leached for 24 h by 7 ml 0 5 mol l acetic acid and then the supernatants in the container were removed carefully after centrifugation washing the residue with 10 ml of ultrapure water three times to dislodge calcium and magnesium the remaining silicate materials were digested by hydrofluoric and nitric acid and then measured by the icp oes to get the elemental composition of silicate using the elemental composition of silicate weathering rates of carbonate and silicate cwr and swr respectively were calculated by the following equations 1 cwr 2 ca 2 car 2 mg 2 car discharge contributing area

originated from silicate weathering sio2riv denotes the concentration of sio2 in the stream water both weathering rates are expressed in t km2 y it is assumed that the silicate derived alkalinity is charge balanced by silicate derived cations and the charge balance is independent of aqueous silica concentration xu and liu 2007 4 results 4 1 meteorological data from october 2015 to september 2016 and october 2016 to september 2017 the precipitation and annual average air temperature were 413 mm 437 mm 0 02 c and 0 46 c respectively about 95 of the precipitation occurred in the monsoon season air temperatures during the whole nonmonsoon period were almost all below 0 c with mean values of 4 6 c and 3 9 c respectively while the mean air temperatures in the monsoon season were 6 4 c 6 6 c respectively 4 2 stream discharge the discharges of the niyaqu from may to october in 2016 and 2017 were 1 16 108 m3 and 0 99 108 m3 respectively water discharge in the nonmonsoon period november 2016 to april 2017 was 0 33 108 m3 thus the total water fluxes from may 2016 to april 2017 and from november 2016 to october 2017 were 1 49 108 m3 and 1 33 108 m3 respectively with discharge occurring during the monsoon season accounting for 78 and 74 respectively the discharges of the qugaqie from may to october in 2016 and 2017 were 0 69 108 m3 and 0 46 108 m3 respectively water flux during the nonmonsoon period was only 0 02 108 m3 as water at site s2 dried up during the period of january to april 2017 therefore the discharge produced in the monsoon season accounted for 97 and 95 of the total discharge in may 2016 to april 2017 and november 2016 to october 2017 respectively water discharges of both the niyaqu and qugaqie were much larger in the monsoon season than that during the nonmonsoon period by nearly 2 orders of magnitude water discharge of the niyaqu showed a bimodal pattern with the summits appearing in july and september lagging slightly behind the peak of precipitation fig 3 discharge of the qugaqie showed a monomodal pattern with the peak appearing in late july or early august when air temperature reached its maximum and the glaciers were undergoing intense ablation 4 3 physio chemical parameters of stream water water temperature of the niyaqu and qugaqie ranged from 0 1 c to 17 6 c and 0 1 c to 14 8 c respectively all stream waters were mildly alkaline with average ph values in a complete year october 2016 to september 2017 of 8 4 8 1 9 0 and 8 3 7 5 8 7 for the niyaqu and qugaqie respectively table 1 the average concentration of spm in the niyaqu was 15 0 mg l 1 3 82 7 mg l with the maximum and minimum occurring in april 2017 and january 2017 respectively fig 3 mean value of spm concentration in the qugaqie was 75 2 mg l varying from 7 2 mg l to 306 8 mg l tds of the niyaqu during the period of november 2016 to september 2017 varied from 116 7 mg l to 163 9 mg l with a mean value of 141 8 mg l and was lower in the monsoon season showing an opposite trend compared with discharge fig 3 similarly tds of the qugaqie during the same period ranged from 25 9 to 81 0 mg l with an average of 49 5 mg l and its value was also higher in the nonmonsoon period it is noteworthy that the concentration of solutes in both the niyaqu and qugaqie decreased slightly during the monsoon season while their discharge increased by over a magnitude during the same time total cationic charges tz of the niyaqu and qugaqie from october 2016 to september 2017 ranged from 1350 to 1980 μmolc l and 282 to 857 μmolc l with average values of 1672 μmolc l and 518 μmolc l respectively μmolc denotes micromoles of charges total anionic charges tz of the niyaqu and qugaqie during the same period ranged from 1406 μmolc l to 1977 μmolc l and 272 to 906 μmolc l with average values of 1714 μmolc l and 565 μmolc l respectively the normalized inorganic charge balances nicb of the niyaqu and qugaqie during the period mentioned above ranged from 13 to 10 and from 19 to 7 with average values of 2 and 8 respectively indicating cations and anions in most stream water was well balanced those water samples with nicb values lower than 10 may be caused by the overestimate of hco 3 which was measured in the field major ion concentrations of stream water are depicted in fig 4 and table 1 concentrations of cations in stream water of the niyaqu followed an order of ca2 mg2 na k contributing 66 16 15 and 3 to tz respectively fig 4 bicarbonate the most abundant anion accounted for 81 of tz other anions followed an order of so 4 2 sio2 cl with a proportion of 9 9 and 1 of tz respectively neither cations nor anions showed obviously seasonal variations in their proportion ca2 and mg2 were 1 2 larger in the monsoon season while na sio2 and so 4 2 were larger in the nonmonsoon period by 2 4 1 2 and 2 respectively cationic concentrations in the qugaqie followed an order of ca2 na mg2 k accounting for 50 33 9 and 7 of tz respectively while anionic concentrations followed an order of hco 3 sio2 so 4 2 cl with an average proportion of 73 17 9 and 2 respectively the proportion of anions changed little during the whole monitoring period while cations showed significant variation the average proportion of na to tz was 14 17 larger during the nonmonsoon season in contrast ca2 in the nonmonsoon season was 9 11 lower than that in the monsoon season precipitation exhibited a wide range of elemental concentrations all ionic concentrations were higher in the nonmonsoon period than those in the monsoon season with mean tds values of 6 1 mg l and 4 7 mg l respectively the proportion of cations during the monitoring period followed a sequence of ca2 na k mg2 with average values of 50 37 10 and 3 of tz respectively anions followed the order of hco 3 cl so 4 2 sio2 accounting for 60 32 6 and 3 respectively all cations except mg2 exhibited significant variation but did not show seasonal variation anions showed seasonal variations especially for cl and hco 3 and the former was 25 higher in the nonmonsoon while the latter was 27 lower in the nonmonsoon period concentrations of ions in the zhadang glacier with an average tds value of 4 02 mg l were lower than that in the precipitation samples collected at the namor similar with the precipitation samples cations in the zhadang glacier followed a sequence of ca2 na k mg2 and their average contribution to tz were 54 27 14 and 6 respectively anions followed an order of hco 3 cl sio2 so 4 2 with proportions of 50 25 18 and 7 respectively the chemical composition of fluvial deposits and suspended particles in the niyaqu and qugaqie are listed in table 2 mean values of ca na sil in riverbed sediments for both the niyaqu and qugaqie did not differ largely from that in spm mg k sil of the spm on the contrary were remarkably larger than that in the sediments studies have found that the dissolution of biotite is active in glacial environments anderson et al 2000 anderson et al 1997 as a glacier covered basin potassium bearing minerals in the qugaqie may experience significant weathering this process may also be active in niyaqu because of their similar climatic conditions compared with the sediments more potassium in the spm can be leached out as particles of the latter are smaller nevertheless riverine sediments are relatively coarse and the properties of bedrocks can be conserved better than spm a phenomenon validated by other studies blum et al 1998 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2008 therefore riverbed sand is more preferable to constrain the elemental composition of silicate in this study the mean value of ca na sil ratios is calculated from sediments and suspended particles while the mean value of mg k sil ratios is ciphered out using sediments elemental composition only 5 discussion 5 1 provenance of solutes in river water generally hydrochemistry of modern inland water is influenced by various natural and anthropogenic factors chetelat et al 2008 gibbs 1970 such as atmospheric precipitation liu et al 2016 chemical weathering of rocks li et al 2009 raymond 2017 xu and liu 2010 and anthropogenic inputs pant et al 2017 5 1 1 anthropogenic inputs the environment of both catchments is fairly pristine only a few herders live in the niyaqu while there are no permanent residents in the qugaqie and nomadic activities only prevail in the monsoon season as a tracer of anthropogenic activities cl in river water of the niyaqu and qugaqie only accounted for 1 and 2 of tz respectively similarly no3 in river water of the niyaqu and qugaqie only accounted for 1 2 of tds respectively low concentrations of these anions confirm that human influence on solutes of river water in the study areas is negligible thus atmospheric inputs and chemical weathering of rocks can be considered the two main sources of riverine loads in the study areas 5 1 2 atmospheric inputs atmospheric inputs were calculated using the rainwater correction method grosbois et al 2000 3 x x cl rain cl ref where x refers to the corrected concentration derived from rainwater x cl rain denotes measured ions cl in rainwater and clref refers to the concentration of cl derived from precipitation clref is calculated by multiplying the weighted average cl content of precipitation clave by the concentration factor f i e clref f clave f is the evapotranspiration coefficient and can be calculated using the following equation 4 f p r p refers to the total precipitation in mm y and r is the runoff in mm y in drainage basins discharge in the niyaqu from october 2016 to november 2017 was 1 394 108 m3 i e 359 mm and the amount of precipitation in the same period was 437 mm hence the value of f can be calculated as 1 22 the precipitation samples can be divided into two groups for better constraining seasonal atmospheric contributions group i is the samples collected during the monsoon season with the remaining samples in group ii for the niyaqu weighted average ionic concentration of group i can be used to subtract atmospheric inputs to riverine loads in the monsoon season weighted average ion concentrations of precipitation in a hydrological year are taken for the correction of precipitation inputs during the nonmonsoon period which is more reasonable because too limited precipitation occurred during the nonmonsoon period to maintain the discharge in the niyaqu within that time groundwater stored in aquifers during the monsoon season likely recharge the river during nonmonsoon low water level periods for the qugaqie ion concentrations of both glacier snow samples collected at the surface of the zhadang glacier and precipitation collected at the namor are used for the atmospheric correction because both of them are important recharge sources gao et al 2015 which is expressed as the following equation 5 x precipitation x glacier 1 22 x rain i 2 xglacier refers to ions of glacier or snow xraini refers to the average weighted ionic concentration of precipitation in group i this assumption may overestimate the contribution of atmospheric inputs during the monsoon season while underestimate its contribution in the nonmonsoon period as the proportion of meltwater would be larger during the former period and lower in the latter the calculated results are shown in fig 6 5 1 3 rock weathering inputs molar ratios of ca2 na hco 3 na and mg2 na in river water after precipitation correction can be used to reveal chemical weathering processes gaillardet et al 1999 goldsmith et al 2010 as shown in fig 5 most stream water samples collected from the niyaqu and qugaqie fall between the endmembers of silicate and carbonate suggesting chemical weathering of the two rocks are both important sources of the riverine solutes chemical weathering of silicate in the qugaqie seems to be playing a more crucial role when compared with that in the niyaqu because the former is closer to the silicate endmember both streams waters during the monsoon season are closer to the carbonate dissolution endmember indicating that the contribution of carbonate dissolution to riverine solutes is larger within that time in contrast the proportion of silicate weathering to solutes in river water is larger during the nonmonsoon period the points shown in fig 5 approach the endmember of evaporites dissolution to some extent especially for ca2 na vs mg2 na which indicate that both rivers are affected by evaporites dissolution however the fact that no halite or evaporite deposits are found in the niyaqu does not support this assumption additionally there is no strong correlation r2 0 12 p 0 05 between cl and so 4 2 in the niyaqu river waters further evidence that evaporites dissolution is not their main source this situation is similar for the qugaqie which drains granites and sandstones although a positive correlation exists r2 0 44 p 0 01 between the two anions therefore it is more reasonable to assume so 4 2 in the river water comes from sulfide mineral oxidation and that cl stems from atmospheric inputs rather than treating them as the dissolution of evaporites understanding the degree to which carbonic or sulfuric acid is responsible for mineral dissolution is important for quantifying the contribution of sulfuric acid weathering to global chemical weathering fluxes additionally sulfide oxidation coupled to carbonate dissolution is a key process determining stream water chemistry in glaciated catchments by virtue of exposing trace weatherable trace carbonate and pyrite minerals anderson et al 2000 bottrell and tranter 2002 darmody et al 2000 hindshaw et al 2016 therefore exploring the impacts of sulfuric acid on chemical weathering in the study areas is important in understanding chemical weathering processes in the central tp the reactions of carbonate and silicate with carbonic or sulfuric acids can be depicted by ratios of cations versus so 4 2 and hco 3 hindshaw et al 2016 wadham et al 2010 theoretical and observed values of ca2 mg2 and cations versus so 4 2 and hco 3 are shown in table 3 for carbonate ca and mg are the predominant cations produced in its dissolution process and other cations can be ignored making the value of tz so 4 2 and tz hco 3 in the dissolution of carbonate approximately equal to ca2 mg2 so 4 2 and ca2 mg2 hco 3 respectively all ions in this table have been corrected from precipitation inputs denoted by ratios of ca2 mg2 so 4 2 and tz so 4 2 in the niyaqu and qugaqie larger than two in both monsoon and nonmonsoon periods provide evidence that sulfuric acid formed by sulfide oxidation does not exert significant influence on chemical weathering of carbonate and silicate on the contrary ca2 mg2 hco 3 and tz hco 3 of most samples fell in the range between one and two which means that rock weathering is dominated by carbonic acid according to the observed ionic ratios listed in table 3 chemical weathering in the qugaqie is less impacted by sulfuric acids compared with the niyaqu average values of tz so 4 2 and ca2 mg2 so 4 2 for both niyaqu and qugaqie were larger in the nonmonsoon period while tz hco 3 and ca2 mg2 hco 3 were lower in the nonmonsoon period thus the influence of sulfuric acid on chemical weathering in the study areas is stronger during the monsoon season than in the nonmonsoon period 5 1 4 quantification of different sources to riverine solutes the forward modeling suggested by galy and france lanord 1999 is used to quantify the relative contribution of different sources to riverine solutes the sources can be expressed by the following equation 6 x river x atmospheric x carbonate x silicate x sulfide where x atmospheric x carbonate x silicate and x sulfide denote the proportion of dissolved cations from atmospheric inputs chemical weathering of carbonate and silicate and sulfide oxidation respectively the results are shown in fig 6 the atmospheric inputs in the niyaqu accounted for about 5 of the total cationic tds the average contribution of silicate weathering accounted for about 12 range of 9 18 within the monitoring period in comparison carbonate weathering contributed on average 65 57 69 the average contribution of sulfide oxidation was near 18 13 25 the contribution of different sources to riverine solutes in the niyaqu was almost invariant between different seasons with differences between monsoon and nonmonsoon values in silicate weatering and sulfide oxidation of 1 2 different from the niyaqu the average contribution of atmospheric inputs in the qugaqie during the period of october 2016 to september 2017 was 10 7 15 the average contribution of silicate and carbonate weathering was 35 19 60 and 34 12 47 during the same period respectively sulfide oxidation accounted for about 20 16 24 silicate weathering accounted for 29 during the monsoon season in 2017 while its value increased to 45 in the nonmonsoon period the average contribution of carbonate dissolution to riverine solutes was 37 during the monsoon season in 2017 whereas its value decreased to 29 in the nonmonsoon period the contribution of carbonate weathering decreased as time passed within the nonmonsoon period and its value reached the lowest 12 at the end of this period in comparison silicate weathering increased within the same period and reached its maximum 60 at the end of the nonmonsoon season both contributions of atmospheric input and sulfide oxidation were larger in the monsoon season than nonmonsoon period by 4 and 3 respectively the decrease of atmospheric inputs is consistent with the decrease of meltwater of snow ice and precipitation sulfide oxidation in the qugaqie would be suppressed by limited precipitation during the nonmonsoon period additionally the production of fresh rock flour decreased during the nonmonsoon period indicated by the reduction of spm as weakened abrasion provided less sulfide mineral thus restricting sulfide oxidation as a small watershed draining silicate rocks only carbonate formation is absent in the qugaqie dissolution of trace calcite minerals contained in bulk rock is the main source of carbonate weathering in monsoon season water rock reaction time is short which would favor carbonate dissolution and suppress the weathering of silicate minerals for the latter process is relatively slow compared with the former however water rock interaction in the nonmonsoon season is stronger because of longer residence time which favors silicate weathering for its slow solvability resulting in the proportion of silicate weathering to riverine solutes exceeding the contribution of carbonate dissolution average ca si ratios in stream water of both the niyaqu and qugaqie were higher in the monsoon season 8 7 and 3 6 respectively than nonmonsoon period 7 4 and 3 0 respectively which verifies the importance of residence time of water in controlling hydrochemistry in the study areas hindshaw et al 2011 as for the niyaqu the mixing of groundwater in the aquifer during different seasons may be the potential reason for the constant percentage of different resources to riverine solutes this hypothesis can be partly proved by the appreciable water flux during the nonmonsoon period even though the weather is extremely arid in this period however this area requires further research 5 2 seasonal variations of chemical weathering rates the results of cwr and swr during the monsoon and nonmonsoon seasons for both catchments are shown in table 4 during the period of october 2016 to september 2017 the average values of the cwr in the niyaqu and qugaqie were 24 8 t km2 y and 9 1 t km2 y respectively and the average values of the swr in the niyaqu and qugaqie were 5 1 t km2 y and 6 1 t km2 y respectively chemical weathering rates of carbonate and silicate showed significant seasonal variation for both the niyaqu and qugaqie fig 7 and table 4 the peak of cwr and swr in the niyaqu occurred in september different from the niyaqu the values of cwr and swr in the qugaqie reached a maximum in late july or early august the average values of cwr and swr in the niyaqu were about five times and four times larger during the monsoon season than that in nonmonsoon period respectively for the qugaqie the average values of cwr and swr in the monsoon season were nearly eight times and six times higher than their values in the nonmonsoon period respectively although solutes concentration in river water of the niyaqu and qugaqie during the nonmonsoon season were 1 4 times and 3 1 times higher than the corresponding values in the monsoon season respectively chemical weathering rates were low for the minimal discharge within that period the cwr in the niyaqu was larger than that in the qugaqie during both the monsoon and nonmonsoon season which is consistent with the difference of lithology in those two catchments the average value of swr in the qugaqie was larger than that in the niyaqu during the monsoon season seasonal variation of weathering in the niyaqu was less than the value in the qugaqie possibly due to the smaller variation in runoff amplitude and per in the former catchment seasonal variation of cwr seems more dramatic than swr implying carbonate weathering is more sensitive to the changes of moisture and heat to better understand chemical weathering of the study areas we compiled the chemical weathering rates of catchments located in the eastern tp south slope of the himalaya and high latitude areas table 4 and fig 8 the average values of cwr in the niyaqu and qugaqie for one complete year are far less than basins in the south slope of the himalaya and eastern part of the tp but are comparable with watersheds located at high latitude regions and the world average value the average annual values of swr in the study areas are less than basins in the south slope of the himalaya and comparable with that of basins located in the eastern tp and the world average value the values of swr in the study areas are greater than in basins located in the northern temperate or frigid zone by nearly an order of magnitude indicating that chemical weathering rates in rapidly uplifting and young orogenic belts are stronger than that in high latitude regions even though they share similar climatic characteristics chemical weathering rates exhibit a dramatic seasonal variation denoted by dash line in fig 8 especially for the qugaqie the cwr of the niyaqu during the monsoon season is close to that in catchments located in the eastern tp the swr of the qugaqie is comparable with basins located along the south slope of the himalaya both cwr and swr in the niyaqu and qugaqie during the nonmonsoon period are low and are comparable with that in high latitude catchments indicating that there is little chemical exhumation in the nonmonsoon season in cold arid climates similar phenomena are also found in catchments located at the nepalese high himalaya wolff boenisch et al 2009 5 3 controlling factors on chemical weathering rates many factors could exert critical control on chemical weathering rates such as temperature runoff precipitation lithology or mineralogy vegetation and per dupré et al 2003 goudie and viles 2012 wolff boenisch et al 2009 however some interlinkages exist between them making it difficult to distinguish the principal factors that govern chemical denudation especially for large drainage basins where environmental factors are complicated lithology is one of the most important factors to impact chemical denudation for it is the solutes provider different rocks composed of different minerals and structures are more or less resistant to chemical weathering and will thus experience different weathering rates goudie and viles 2012 meybeck 1987 have proved that the weathering rates of carbonate volcanoes sandstone and shales are 12 1 5 1 3 and 2 5 times larger than granites respectively the cwr in the niyaqu was 2 7 times higher than qugaqie due to the underlying carbonate lens in theory the swr in the niyaqu basin should also be larger than that in the qugaqie because the tuff and shale rocks distributed in the former catchment are more susceptible to chemical weathering than the granite and sandstone in the qugaqie however the observed results show that the annual swr in the niyaqu is slightly lower than that in the qugaqie and the average value during the monsoon season in the latter is much larger than that in the former catchment therefore other environmental factors such as high runoff and high abundance of fresh silicate flour produced by glaciation have inverted this assumption disruption of mineral lattices by grinding increases dissolution rates and high surface area would make glacial sediments exceptionally weatherable anderson et al 1997 additionally relatively higher runoff in the qugaqie 828 mm km2 y caused by the melting of the glaciers than the niyaqu 343 mm km2 y facilitate silicate weathering water discharge in the qugaqie during the nonmonsoon period was much less than that in the niyaqu 0 02 108 m3 versus 0 33 108 m3 which is the reason for the qugaqie s lower swr value than that in the niyaqu in this period as a parameter in the calculation of chemical weathering rates runoff has been suggested as a major factor controlling chemical erosion across many environments as it is a reactant supply in weathering processes gaillardet et al 1999 singh et al 2005 kump et al 2000 believe that the clearest correlation in the field is between chemical weathering rates and runoff indicative of an important dependence on the intensity of the hydrological cycle similarly the correlation analysis conducted in two small catchments located on northeastern tp shows that silicate weathering is strongly dependent on water discharge in the semi arid area zhang et al 2013a stachnik et al 2016 also proved that the high rates of chemical denudation in werenskioldbreen svalbard was mostly caused by the high rates of discharge and ablation yde et al 2014 demonstrated that increasing discharge leads to increasing solute export at the catchment scale as described before seasonal variation of rock weathering rates in the two catchments is highly consistent with the variation of water flux which means that runoff is the primary factor to control the rates of chemical weathering in the study areas the relationship between temperature and chemical weathering has long been a concern of scientists due to the proposed feedbacks between chemical weathering and atmospheric co2 berner et al 1983 raymond 2017 though laboratory studies have manifested that mineral dissolution of rocks is strongly dependent on temperature the expression of this dependence in the field is often obscured by other environmental factors that co vary with temperature kump et al 2000 the impact of temperature on reaction rates of minerals can be quantified by the arrhenius type laws white et al 1999 thus making an exponential function a better fitting equation than others per was calculated by multiplying spm concentration and water discharge using the per value of river water in the monitoring section to characterize the intensity of physical erosion conditions for the whole basin is reasonable though some uncertainties caused by suspended particle matter experiencing sedimentation before river water arriving at s1 and s2 may exist however the short distance between outlet of mountain and monitoring section 5 8 km and 0 8 km for the niyaqu and qugaqie respectively and the relatively fast water velocity 1 5 m s and 2 8 m s for s1 and s2 during the monsoon season in 2016 respectively constrained these uncertainties the relationships between chemical weathering rates and runoff water temperature and per in study areas are depicted in figs 9 and 10 both cwr and swr show a strong linear positive correlation with runoff in both the niyaqu and qugaqie cwr and swr increase with the increase of water temperature for the niyaqu which coincides with the arrhenius law that dissolution rates of minerals increase with temperature white and blum 1995 yet low correlations have illustrated that water temperature is not their primary controlling factor on the contrary cwr and swr in the qugaqie increase exponentially with water temperature implying water temperature played important roles in chemical weathering this situation is fairly obvious in small catchments occupied by active glaciers fluctuation of air temperature influences the yield of meltwater and the movement of glaciers and then affect discharge and physical erosion besides meltwater under glacier accelerates abrasion and produces more fine fresh mineral particles the distribution of water temperature vs cwr or swr are scattered in fig 10 suggesting that runoff and per influenced cation denudation rates more directly in the qugaqie although the temperature is the authentic driving factor behind them the per and chemical weathering rates exhibit logarithmic relation in the niyaqu chemical weathering rates increase rapidly when per 10 t km2 y with smaller increases when per 10 t km2 y the relationships between per and cation denudation rates in the qugaqie are more consistent with the logarithmic variation and a threshold value around 100 t km2 y after which smaller increases are seen the logarithmic relationship with threshold values between weathering rates and per can be explained by two different situations transport limited and kinetic limited gabet et al 2010 gaillardet et al 1999 moore et al 2013 water is a restrictive factor for chemical weathering in the study areas due to the semi arid subarctic climate in nonmonsoon or early monsoon season extremely limited precipitation and low temperature hinder the interaction between water and rocks leading to inhibited chemical weathering in addition these weathering products e g solutes and suspended particles could not be transported to river water due to the shortage of flowing groundwater even if weathering processes may have occurred within the study catchments therefore this condition can be summarized as transport limited regime the water shortage situation would not be relieved until the monsoon season comes during the monsoon period restrictive factors for chemical weathering are the kinetics of minerals dissolution because high erosion rates have provided abundant weatherable materials as a result chemical weathering rates would reach a plateau and increase slowly when per reaches its threshold values distinct differences of per threshold values among the two catchments may be caused by their different recharge forms nearly half of the river water in the qugaqie is derived from meltwater and fine rock particles produced by glaciation could be directly flushed into the stream the niyaqu is mainly recharged by groundwater so most suspended particles are intercepted by the soil layer or aquifer even though plentiful fresh minerals may have been produced by freeze thaw weathering and thermal expansion weathering 6 conclusions and implications influenced by seasonal change in environmental factors cwr and swr in both catchments of the niyaqu and qugaqie show significant seasonal variation with greater values during the monsoon season than in the nonmonsoon period runoff is the most important factor controlling chemical weathering in the niyaqu followed by per and the influence of water temperature seems insignificant furthermore discharge of the niyaqu is controlled by atmospheric precipitation which indicates that the chemical weathering processes in small catchments where groundwater is the overwhelming recharge form are mainly controlled by precipitation runoff is also the governing factor for chemical weathering in the qugaqie followed by water temperature and per both meltwater and groundwater are significant recharge forms for the qugaqie and they are influenced by air temperature and precipitation therefore both temperature and precipitation are the controlling factors of chemical denudation in catchments occupied by active alpine glaciers this information implies that chemical weathering intensity in central of the tp may become stronger due to the trend of warming and wetting in the future chemical weathering rates on the tp exhibit remarkable spatial variability the average swr value on the central tp is relatively low when compared with basins located at the margin of the tp where the geographical setting is characterized by higher precipitation and rapid tectonic uplift across the tp precipitation decreases towards the northwest and the weather becomes colder as such chemical weathering of large areas in central parts of the tp are suppressed by the limited precipitation and frigid temperature as weathering rates are controlled by runoff and temperature as evidenced by findings in the niyaqu and qugaqie catchments declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing

6301,parametric budyko method has been widely used to assess water availability under changing environment its single parameter w controlling the shape of the budyko curve is of critical importance to water availability assessment waa here the water availability is defined as the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation in the context of budyko hypothesis as an unobserved variable w is generally estimated through incorporating the long term water balance model and budyko hypothesis i e estimating w as a function of precipitation runoff and potential evapotranspiration over a long term time series of these variables inevitably the estimated value of w is subject to uncertainty resulting from hydro meteorological records with limited size further this uncertainty affects waa in context of budyko hypothesis the uncertainty and its propagation issue is often overlooked in past research in this paper we develop a bootstrap based algorithm to reveal aforementioned uncertainty moreover a partial derivative based sensitivity analysis is performed for understanding the propagation of w uncertainty on waa three catchments located in the yellow river basin china are used as case study sites results indicate that there exists remarkable uncertainty in parameter w which varies with the data length the impact of such uncertainty on waa increases quickly under the humid condition thereafter reaches a peak under the mild condition and decreases slowly under the arid condition the reason behind this phenomenon is the largest sensitivity of waa to parameter w under the mild climate condition moreover a general analytical expression for determining the critical value of climate condition which maximizes the impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa is derived in this paper results of this study can enhance the reliability and robustness of budyko based models keywords budyko model uncertainty bootstrap water availability assessment 1 introduction climate change combined with anthropogenic activities brings about remarkable changes in water availability and in turn results in lots of water resources problems in the development of society economy and ecology vörösmarty et al 2000 hubacek and sun 2005 alcamo et al 2007 donohue et al 2012 xiong et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a b 2016 to tackle these water related problems successfully assessing water availability is indispensable to date a wealth of studies has been devoted to assessing water availability with application of different hydrologic models li et al 2011 mango et al 2011 fan et al 2016 xu et al 2013a b bourgault et al 2014 chang et al 2016a b among them budyko curve budyko 1974 has experienced a revitalization in recent years choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2007 donohue et al 2012 wang and hejazi 2011 xiong and guo 2012 li et al 2013 greve et al 2015 2016 gudmundsson et al 2016 zeng and cai 2015 2016 wu et al 2016 the budyko curve treats the partitioning of annual precipitation p into actual evapotranspiration e and runoff r at catchment scale as a functional balance between water supply p and demand potential evapotranspiration pe from the atmosphere water availability can be defined as the ratio of annual e and p i e e p in the budyko hypothesis greve et al 2015 2016 gudmundsson et al 2016 generally the budyko type equations can be classified into two categories namely parameterless pike 1964 budyko 1974 and parametric ones zhang et al 2001 fu et al 2007 compared with the parameterless ones the single parameter budyko type equations present greater flexibility to adapt to different watershed characteristics jiang et al 2015 wu et al 2016 thus attracting widespread attention from hydrologists and water resources managers donohue et al 2012 wang and hejazi 2011 li et al 2013 liang et al 2015 its specific expression can be given as e p f ϕ w where ϕ indicates the ratio of pe to p i e the so called aridity index w represents the unique parameter of the budyko curve and controls the specific shape of the curve li et al 2013 liang et al 2015 undoubtedly the unique parameter w is of critical importance for the so called water availability assessment hereafter denoted as waa i e e p assessment in the context of budyko hypothesis singh and kumar 2015 physically parameter w is generally considered to be an integrative property of climate seasonality and watershed characteristics such as vegetation cover soil properties yang et al 2007 wang and tang 2014 zeng and cai 2018 hence its value should not be fixed but instead varies across different basins yang et al 2007 2009 xu et al 2013a b i e the so called basin specific w value li et al 2013 here worthy of note is that unlike the observed p and r data budyko parameter w is not a directly observable quantity which should be estimated through some statistical methods gudmundsson et al 2016 generally methods used for w estimation are established through coupling the budyko model and catchment water balance theory using the historical p pe and r data wang and hejazi 2011 teng et al 2012 li et al 2013 liang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 trancoso et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 these methods can be classified into two categories i e the so called optimized and calibrated ones yang et al 2007 the optimized method is established through coupling budyko model and annual water balance hypothesis xu et al 2013a b liu and liang 2015 trancoso et al 2016 while the calibrated method employs the long term mean water balance hypothesis wang and hejazi 2011 sun et al 2014 liang et al 2015 zeng and cai 2015 2016 for example xu et al 2013a b optimized parameter w in a budyko type curve using a least square technique with annual p pe and r data over 23 years for each of the 256 basins worldwide sun et al 2014 calibrated the parameter in budyko curve using the mean annual p pe and r of the pre runoff change point period 1970 1989 30 years for the upper hanjiang river basin yang et al 2007 identified the parameter in budyko curve for 108 catchments in the yellow river basin through the optimized and calibrated methods using historical hydro meteorological observations ranging in length from 6 to 46 years their results highlighted that there exists quite high correlation between optimized and calibrated w values which indicates that parameter w uncertainty resulting from methods is negligible in addition to the method uncertainty data uncertainty resulting from limited hydro meteorological records is another primary uncertainty source however it is worthy of note that the length of data that can be used in practice varies from region to region while the minimum in aforementioned studies is merely 6 years in general parameter w uncertainty resulting from limited hydro meteorological samples is classified as epistemic uncertainty undoubtedly more available data is beneficial for reducing such uncertainty but on the other hand the uncertainty would be remarkably large due to the used data with small sample size lyn et al 2007 guo et al 2017 thus data of sufficient length is of critical importance for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of parameter estimation serinaldi 2013 tong et al 2014 as well as for parameter w estimation in the budyko curve however worthy of note is that only finite and limited hydro meteorological records which includes insufficient or incomplete information can be obtained in practice such records generally fail to fully characterize the basin scale properties of hydrologic cycle kennard et al 2010 sikorska et al 2014 zhang et al 2015b consequently not desired but inevitable the computed parameter w contains considerable uncertainty resulting from these limited hydro meteorological records overlooking parameter w uncertainty could produce incomplete or even misleading conclusions however studies investigating parameter w uncertainty resulting from limited hydro meteorological records remain few and in particular research is needed to disclose the impact of such uncertainty on waa in the context of budyko hypothesis given the above concerns a framework coupling bootstrap algorithm efron and tibshirani 1986 1993 and the budyko model is designed for disclosing parameter w uncertainty resulting from limited hydro meteorological records the bootstrap method is an elegant approach for uncertainty quantification of unknown quantities it is extremely practical particularly when analytical solutions and modeling techniques couldn t be easily performed serinaldi and kilsby 2015 freschi et al 2017 as a data driven method the method relies on the resampling of the original dataset relaxes distributional assumptions in the variables and presents an assessment of parameter uncertainty by realistic asymmetric confidence interval vigiak and bende michl 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 to date this method has received widespread attention within the hydrologic community rustomji and wilkinson 2008 vigiak and bende michl 2013 guillod et al 2015 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 ganey et al 2017 therefore this study employs the bootstrap method to reveal parameter w uncertainty in the budyko curve additionally parameter w uncertainty would inevitably lead to waa uncertainty in the context of budyko hypothesis therefore once the uncertainty of parameter w estimation is disclosed exploring the impact of such uncertainty on waa becomes indispensable sensitivity analysis is one suitable means for quantifying how the response uncertainty is apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in inputs saltelli 2002 in present study one fundamental and widely used technique for sensitivity analysis the partial derivative based sensitivity analysis method is implemented wang et al 2008 hu and lu 2016 more specifically the partial derivative of waa with respect to parameter w is computed for expounding the impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa three catchments with different climate conditions lying in the yellow river basin are selected as study regions which are the upper catchment of yellow river basin humid region fenhe and weihe river basin arid and semiarid regions in view of above the main objective of this work is 1 disclosing parameter w uncertainty resulting from limited hydro meteorological records through a bootstrap resampling method and 2 exploring the impact of such uncertainty on waa through the partial derivative based sensitivity analysis method it constitutes the primary significance of this study and related results are expected to provide more robust insights for budyko based model although methods proposed in present study are applied in the three representative catchments there have been no restrictions that would prevent them from being applied to other regions the rest of paper is constructed as follows section 2 describes the study area and dataset section 3 describes the methods adopted in this study results and discussion are described in section 4 section 5 shows the main conclusions drawn from this study 2 study area and dataset 2 1 study area the designed framework is applied to the yellow river basin yrb china the yellow river also known as mother river of china is the second largest river in china the yrb contributes 13 of the cultivated area in china but holds only 3 of the country s water resources cai et al 2011 it is one of the most economically politically and culturally important basins in china to date the yrb has received widespread attention from the government and international organizations due to the serious water related issues such as water shortages soil erosion sedimentation and drying up wang et al 2012 to address these water related issues a large number of engineering measures such as reservoirs landscape engineering terracing has been implemented as a result the hydrological processes have presented significant changes in present study we select three important catchments lying in the upper and middle yrb as study regions shown in fig 1 i e the upper yellow river basin uyrb weihe river basin wrb and fenhe river basin frb respectively the uyrb the area from upstream to tangnaihai station is the main source of water resources in the yrb it contributes 35 of total water resources of the yrb but has an area that is only 16 of the whole yrb lan et al 2006 brierley et al 2016 wei et al 2016 the uyrb is crucial for the water resources of the whole basin in northwest china topographically the elevation decreases from the west basin to the south basin climatically the uyrb is semi humid region of the tibetan plateau annual mean daily temperature ranges from 4 c to 2 c mean annual precipitation varies between 250 and 810 mm of which approximately 75 falls between june and september the weihe river is the largest tributary of the yellow river as a state key economic development zone and important agricultural production area the wrb hosts 76 major cities with a total population of 22 million across three provinces chang et al 2016a b the guanzhong plain located in the wrb is one of the most important industrial and agricultural production zones in china guo et al 2016 shao et al 2017 the wrb is characterized by high soil erosion rates and heavy sediment loads zhang et al 2008 fan et al 2017 the average annual natural runoff is 10 4 billion m3 accounting for 17 3 of the total yellow river s total discharge the mean annual temperature ranges from 7 8 c to 13 5 c the temporal distribution of precipitation is uneven with that more than 60 falling in the wet season june to october the fenhe river is the second largest tributary of the yellow river and the largest river in shanxi province north china as the most economically developed area of the shanxi province the frb holds more than 50 of the whole shanxi province s industrial output which plays a critical role in the economic growth of shanxi province moreover the drainage area of frb also is a major agricultural production area in the shanxi province similar to the wrb the frb suffers from high soil erosion rates and heavy sediment loads in the past century lots of hydraulic engineering measures have been implemented for the rational utilization of water resources in the frb extensive hydraulic engineering measures along with climate variations have brought significant alteration to the regional hydrological cycle the frb locates in semi arid climate zone annual basin averaged daily

stations tangnaihai denoted as tnh huaxian denoted as hx and hejin denoted as hj in the uyrb wrb and frb are utilized in this study table 1 the data are provided by the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission which takes the main responsibility of monitoring collecting and disposing hydrological information in the yrb data quality are strictly controlled before being released the meteorological data 1960 2010 including daily and monthly p daily mean maximum minimum temperature air pressure relative humidity wind velocity and sunshine duration are provided by the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn daily pe from each individual station is calculated by the fao56 penman monteith method using meteorological data allen et al 1998 areal p and pe in these study regions are calculated by the thiessen polygon method on the arcgis platform the daily areal p and pe are converted into yearly for the budyko related analyses in this study 3 methodologies here the outline of the methodological framework used in this study is briefly described first the cumulative sum cusum method and pettitt method are used together to identify the change point of streamflow series based on the change point the whole study period is split into two sub periods i e the pre variation and variation period readers interested in theoretical details of the two methods are referred to the paper by pettitt 1979 second the so called calibrated method is applied to calculate parameter w in the budyko curve with annual p pe and r data in the pre variation period third the bootstrap resampling technique is incorporated with the calibration method for disclosing parameter w uncertainty next is to examine the impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa for the three representative catchments last the partial derivative based sensitivity analysis is performed for expounding such impact on waa in the following part we will first introduce the budyko framework 3 1 budyko framework the physical principle of budyko framework is that long term e p is primarily limited by the water energy balance which can be described as the long term pe p dryness index wang and hejazi 2011 liang et al 2015 for a catchment under humid conditions pe p 1 energy is the limiting factor while under arid conditions pe p 1 water supply is the limiting factor yang et al 2007 to date a couple of mathematical equations has been proposed to represent the budyko framework present study employs the commonly used budyko fu equation derived from simple physical assumptions fu et al 2007 1 e p 1 pe p 1 pe p w 1 w where w 1 p e and pe denote the long term mean p e and pe respectively the calibrated method for parameter w estimation is carried out through incorporating the long term catchment water balance and the budyko hypothesis for a given watershed the long term water balance equation can be defined as 2 p e r δ s where r indicates the long term mean r δs represents the change in water storage in the watershed here δs can be neglected over long periods and thus atmospheric water is the only source for e and r given that p and r are known inputs the value of e can be determined by eq 2 integrating eqs 1 and 2 over long periods it can be derived 3 p r δ s e 1 pe p 1 pe p w 1 w p hence given r p and pe at the long term scale parameter w can be calibrated statistically by solving eq 3 from eq 3 it can be found that r p pe is the function of w i e w g r p pe here p 1 n i 1 n p pe 1 n i 1 n pe r 1 n i 1 n r as aforementioned in the introduction section the waa is defined as the ratio of e to p in the context of budyko hypothesis in addition to uncovering w uncertainty another object is to explore the impact of such uncertainty on waa to achieve this purpose we employ the partial derivative based sensitivity analysis method in this study the partial derivative is generally referred as exact sensitivity coefficient hamby 1994 for simplicity the budyko fu equation is written as 4 waa e p f ϕ w 1 ϕ 1 ϕ w 1 w the partial derivative of waa with respect to parameter w is defined as 5 w a a w f w ϕ w 1 1 w ϕ w ln ϕ w ϕ w 1 ln ϕ w 1 w 2 from eq 5 it can be found that w a a w is conditional on w and ϕ in other words the sensitivity of waa to w is a function of w and ϕ 3 2 nonparametric bootstrap based algorithm for budyko parameter w uncertainty estimation the nonparametric bootstrap resampling method is a powerful and versatile computational technique for estimating the distribution of targets particularly in small sample situations kybic 2010 it mimics the random mechanism of the underlying target by sampling with replacement from the original sample thus leading to an empirical distribution of the underlying target khosravi et al 2013 then the empirical distribution can be used to generate confidence intervals for the underlying target compared with the parametric bootstrap the nonparametric bootstrap method does not require any preselected distributional assumption about the underlying population specifically the nonparametric bootstrap method generates samples from the original sample itself the empirical distribution instead of from a preselected theoretical distribution i e the parametric bootstrap method it fully utilizes the information existed in the available data in certain circumstances this empirical distribution is considered to be the least prejudiced estimate possible of the underlying distribution anything else imposes biases or preconceptions possibly accurate but also potentially misleading cevenini and barbini 2010 through integrating the calibrated method for parameter w estimation into the budyko framework as described in section 3 1 the following bootstrap based algorithm for revealing w uncertainty is designed 1 predefine a large number of bootstrap samplings b present study sets b 10 000 2 implement the resampling with replacement from observed pairs r p pe to obtain the bootstrap dataset denoted as r p pe the r p and pe have the same size as r p pe respectively 3 calculate the means r p p e for bootstrap dataset r p pe 4 calibrate parameter w through plugging r p p e into function w eq 5 5 repeat steps 2 4 b times after this the b bootstrap estimates w can be obtained the empirical distribution is referred to as the bootstrap distribution of statistic w 6 estimate confidence interval denoted as ci to measure parameter w uncertainty in the budyko curve in present study the percentile method is used to estimate bootstrap ci for the b bootstrap estimates w the percentile method performs well in the case of unbiasedness and constant variance of the sampling distribution cheung and lau 2007 timmerman et al 2009 as an extremely simple yet powerful method for determining bootstrap ci it employs the central 1 2α part of the cumulative bootstrap distribution to approximately denote the central 1 2α 100 ci thus the lower and upper confidence intervals for w are given by w α w 1 α here w α indicates the 100 α th percentile of the bootstrap distribution 4 results and discussion 4 1 change point of annual r in the study regions results of the cusum and pettitt tests for annual r in tnh hx and hj stations are displayed in fig 2 it can be found that in the first iteration 1989 1990 and 1971 are significant change points of annual r in tnh hx and hj stations respectively to avoid the neglect of the existence of multiple change points the cusum and pettitt tests are applied again to each new segment i e periods before and after change point obtained in the first iteration until no further change points are detected for hj station there is a significant change point 1971 at 95 confidence level in the second iteration none change point is detected in the third iteration there is no change point in the second iteration for annual r in tnh and hx stations employing the first change point the whole study period is divided into two sub periods period before the change point is defined as the pre variation period which is considered as one period with less impact of human activities hence 1960 1989 1960 1990 and 1969 1971 are referred as the pre variation periods for the uyrb wrb and frb respectively data in the pre variation periods are used to estimate parameter w in the budyko curve thus length of data used for parameter w estimation are 30 31 and 12 years in the uyrb wrb and frb respectively 4 2 disclosure of parameter w uncertainty before looking at the bootstrap ci we employ the histograms to present the distributions of 10 000 bootstrapped parameter w in the three study regions fig 3 the resampled mean and 95 ci of the bootstrapped estimates w are also presented in fig 3 the histogram itself can be regarded as an empirical representation of the posterior distribution of w it can be easily seen from fig 3 that the w distributions in the three study regions are all unimodal and relatively symmetric about the mean therefore we can conclude that the bootstrapped sample w is adequate for the percentile method based ci estimation in this study we set α 0 05 yielding 95 ci the 95 ci ranges from 2 44 to 2 62 in the uyrb from 3 01 to 3 28 in the wrb and from 2 88 to 3 57 in the frb parameter w estimated by the original data in uyrb wrb and frb are 2 53 3 14 and 3 20 respectively to quantitatively measure parameter w uncertainty resulting from limited hydro meteorological records the index rl i e relative length of ci is employed in present study the index is defined as the ratio of the difference between the lower and upper boundary w values of 95 ci to the point estimate w higher value of rl denotes larger uncertainty in parameter w vice versa among the three study regions rl is the highest 21 56 in the frb which is nearly 3 fold greater than that in the uyrb 7 11 and wrb 8 60 it means that parameter w uncertainty is the largest in the frb uyrb and wrb following here note that the spatial change of parameter w uncertainty exhibits contrary relationship with that of the length of the original data specifically parameter w uncertainty is the most remarkable in the frb while the data length is minimum just 12 in comparison parameter w uncertainty in the uyrb and wrb are relatively less while the length of the data in the two regions are relatively longer these results highlight that size of hydrological records is closely related to the parameter w uncertainty more available data is beneficial for reducing parameter w uncertainty due to the existence of much information for characterizing the basin scale properties of hydrologic cycle contrarily less available data would increase parameter uncertainty undoubtedly take the frb as an example if the data length is less than 12 it may be extremely hard to take the result of parameter w seriously thus expanding size of hydrological samples is extremely indispensable for reducing parameter w uncertainty fig 4 displays the budyko curves in the context of parameter w uncertainty the wider band of the budyko curves means the larger impact of parameter w uncertainty from fig 4 it can be easily found that in band of the budyko curves is the widest in the frb due to the largest uncertainty of parameter w under same climate condition pe p compared with that in the uyrb and wrb hydro meteorological records with the smallest size is the primary reason behind the widest band of budyko curve in the frb 4 3 impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa as aforementioned in the introduction section following greve et al 2015 water availability is defined as the ratio of annual e and p to quantitatively measure the impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa the vertical distance denoted as vd between the low and up confidence branches of budyko curves is computed upper left panel of fig 4 larger vd indicates larger impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa vice versa hence as shown in fig 4 the largest parameter w uncertainty in the frb results in the most remarkable impact on waa under given climate condition compared with that in the uyrb and wrb additionally from fig 4 we can find that vd doesn t stay constant but varies with pe p i e impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa varies with pe p we can intuitively infer that the vd first increases and then decreases with increase of pe p vd value i e the impact of w uncertainty on waa is rather low under extremely humid and arid conditions by contrast worthy of note is that the impact is higher under comparatively mild condition thus pouring enough attention on water availability in the context of parameter w uncertainty under comparatively mild condition is extremely indispensable fig 5 illustrates variability of vd with changes of pe p more specifically from fig 5 it can be easily found that the vd is conditional on the climatic conditions under given confidence limit of parameter w the vd rapidly increases initially with increasing pe p and then slowly decreases at pe p 1 37 1 20 and 1 19 vds i e impacts of w uncertainty on waa reach the extremum in the uyrb wrb and frb respectively primary reason for such variability of vd is that the sensitivity of waa to parameter w is largest for comparatively mild condition greve et al 2016 above contents present the impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa in the pre variation period for the variation period or the future period information on water availability and e with less impact of human activities such as water withdraw reservoir operations and so on is extremely beneficial for making water related public policies in the context of budyko hypothesis the information can be obtained through eq 1 using the long term mean p and pe in the variation period and the determined the parameter w in the pre variation period here the pre variation period is assumed to be a period with less impact of human activities the rl index is employed again to measure impact of parameter w uncertainty on water availability and e assessment in the context of budyko hypothesis related results are listed in table 2 it can be found from table 2 that impacts of w uncertainty on water availability and e assessment vary from 2 43 to 4 97 the impacts are largest in the frb due to the largest uncertainty of parameter w compared with other catchments because present paper defines water availability as the ratio of annual e to p the rlwaa is same with rl e widely known is that runoff is tightly correlated with water resources planning and management which is of critical importance for socio economic development in practice it is generally considered as one index to reflect characteristics of regional available water budyko model is particularly effective for runoff assessment in combination with long term water balance equation xiong et al 2014 liang et al 2015 zeng and cai 2015 2016 here we estimate long term natural runoff r in the variation period through integrating eqs 1 and 2 using p and pe in this period related results are listed in table 2 from table 2 it can be found that in spite of the small rl in water availability and e assessment impact of parameter w uncertainty on r estimation is considerably remarkable the corresponding rl of r estimation ranges from 10 21 to 68 17 in the three study regions which is largest in the frb undoubtedly this considerably remarkable impact greatly challenges decision making in water resources planning and management any attempt to obscure parameter w uncertainty could create incomplete or even false conclusion in decision making in the context of budyko based models in other words taking the uncertainty into account seriously particularly when developing water related policies is of critical importance moreover in practice expanding size of hydrological records is indispensable for reducing parameter w uncertainty and enhancing reliability of water availability assessment 4 4 sensitivity of waa to parameter w as aforementioned in figs 4 and 5 impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa reaches maximum under comparatively mild condition in order to have a deeper insight into the variation of such impact the derived eq 5 is implemented in this section from eq 5 we can find that the partial derivative of waa with respect to parameter w i e w a a w is conditional on w and ϕ in light of this fig 6 presents how w a a w varies with w and ϕ specifically it can be found from the left panel of fig 6 that w a a w decreases with increasing w under given ϕ and the decreasing tendency decreases with increasing w in other words under given climate condition waa is more sensitive to the change of w along with w increasing the right panel of fig 6 exhibits variations of w a a w with changes in ϕ under given w it follows from fig 6 that w a a w increases quickly along with ϕ and reaches its maximum afterwards goes down gradually phenomenon of fig 6 matches well with that of fig 5 in essence partial derivate of waa with respect to parameter w is the slope of the tangent line to the budyko curve at w ϕ larger w a a w denotes bigger slope of the tangent line at point w ϕ which means waa is more vulnerable or sensitive to the change of parameter w at point w ϕ following from fig 6 value of w a a w reaches its maximum when ϕ is larger than 1 at the critical point of ϕ waa is extremely vulnerable to parameter w change due to this as shown in fig 6 impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa in the three representative studies reaches maximum under the transitional climate conditions i e near the critical point of ϕ the particularity of transitional climate regions i e the so called critical point of ϕ in the budyko curve is also mentioned in the work of greve et al 2015 greve et al 2015 roughly determined that vd between budyko curves under the 75th and 25th percentile of parameter w reaches its maximum value at ϕ 1 4 however analytically determining the critical value of ϕ maximizing the sensitivity of waa to parameter w has not been conducted to date from the statistical point of view if function h has a local extremum at point a b and the first order partial derivatives of h exist at a b then h x a b h y a b 0 the point a b is generally called the critical point of h hence the so called critical point ϕ in the budyko curve under given w is the point maximizing the w a a w ϕ curve shown in the right panel of fig 6 let h ϕ w w a a w therefore value of ϕ which satisfies the condition h ϕ 0 is the critical point of w a a w ϕ curve under given w present study derives partial derivative of function h ϕ w with respect to ϕ appendix a which is given by 6 h ϕ 1 w ϕ w 1 ϕ w 1 1 w 1 ln ϕ w 1 w ln ϕ ϕ w w ϕ w 1 here ϕ 0 and w 1 therefore 1 w ϕ w 1 ϕ w 1 1 w 1 0 to achieve h ϕ 0 ln ϕ w 1 w ln ϕ ϕ w w ϕ w 1 should be zero thus under given w value of ϕ which satisfies 7 ln ϕ w 1 w ln ϕ ϕ w w ϕ w 1 is the critical point of function h i e the critical point of w a a w ϕ curve on the basis of eq 7 fig 7 displays critical points ϕ denoted as ϕ cp and related w a a w under various w w a a w under ϕ cp w is written as w a a w cp it can be easily found from fig 7 that ϕ cp and w a a w cp decrease with increasing w through the specific relation exhibited by fig 7 or eq 7 we can clearly and explicitly determine ϕ cp which maximizes w a a w under given w at these critical points ϕ cp waa is mostly sensitive to the change of parameter w it should receive critical concern when making policies for water resources management with application of budyko curve 5 conclusions the budyko curve particularly the parametric budyko has been extensively applied for water availability assessment waa due to the relatively simple structure and concise physical mechanism worthy of note is that its single parameter w is easily subject to uncertainty resulting from limited hydrometeorological records the primary aim of this work is to investigate such parameter w uncertainty for budyko curve and further examine its impact on waa to achieve this purpose the bootstrap method is integrated into the budyko model for revealing parameter w uncertainty in this study moreover the partial derivative based sensitivity analysis method is performed for expounding the impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa results of this study are beneficial for constituting a more reliable and robust budyko model and enhancing its practicality three catchments with different climate conditions lying in the yellow river basin are selected as study regions the general conclusions and specific inferences are drawn as follows parameter w of budyko fu curve in different regions exhibits noteworthy uncertainty fig 5 the larger uncertainty of parameter w leads to wider band of budyko curve fig 6 parameter w uncertainty varies with data length gathering as much data as possible is of great significance for reducing the uncertainty in w estimation moreover impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa varies with climate condition which reaches the maximum under comparatively mild climate condition fig 7 in terms of runoff assessment in the variation period the relative length of the confidence interval of estimated annual mean runoff in the context of parameter w uncertainty ranges from 10 21 to 68 17 in study regions table 2 above results indicate that for water related factors assessment in the variation period or the future period in the context of budyko model pouring enough attention on parameter w uncertainty is indispensable particularly under the mild climate condition besides above the partial derivative based sensitivity analysis denotes that the largest sensitivity of waa to parameter w under the mild climate condition is the primary reason behind the largest impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa at pe p 1 37 1 20 and 1 19 in the three representative regions eq 6 and fig 7 to provide technical support for determining the critical value of pe p maximizing impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa the analytic expression is derived in this paper eq 7 in light of above it can be concluded that parameter w uncertainty resulting from limited hydro meteorological records shouldn t be omitted and taking it into account is extremely beneficial for advancing the robustness of budyko model moreover the comparative analysis of results in the three study regions indicate that increasing the size of hydro meteorological records as much as possible is an effective way to reduce the uncertainty of parameter w and lower its impact on water related factors assessment declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science

6301,parametric budyko method has been widely used to assess water availability under changing environment its single parameter w controlling the shape of the budyko curve is of critical importance to water availability assessment waa here the water availability is defined as the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation in the context of budyko hypothesis as an unobserved variable w is generally estimated through incorporating the long term water balance model and budyko hypothesis i e estimating w as a function of precipitation runoff and potential evapotranspiration over a long term time series of these variables inevitably the estimated value of w is subject to uncertainty resulting from hydro meteorological records with limited size further this uncertainty affects waa in context of budyko hypothesis the uncertainty and its propagation issue is often overlooked in past research in this paper we develop a bootstrap based algorithm to reveal aforementioned uncertainty moreover a partial derivative based sensitivity analysis is performed for understanding the propagation of w uncertainty on waa three catchments located in the yellow river basin china are used as case study sites results indicate that there exists remarkable uncertainty in parameter w which varies with the data length the impact of such uncertainty on waa increases quickly under the humid condition thereafter reaches a peak under the mild condition and decreases slowly under the arid condition the reason behind this phenomenon is the largest sensitivity of waa to parameter w under the mild climate condition moreover a general analytical expression for determining the critical value of climate condition which maximizes the impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa is derived in this paper results of this study can enhance the reliability and robustness of budyko based models keywords budyko model uncertainty bootstrap water availability assessment 1 introduction climate change combined with anthropogenic activities brings about remarkable changes in water availability and in turn results in lots of water resources problems in the development of society economy and ecology vörösmarty et al 2000 hubacek and sun 2005 alcamo et al 2007 donohue et al 2012 xiong et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a b 2016 to tackle these water related problems successfully assessing water availability is indispensable to date a wealth of studies has been devoted to assessing water availability with application of different hydrologic models li et al 2011 mango et al 2011 fan et al 2016 xu et al 2013a b bourgault et al 2014 chang et al 2016a b among them budyko curve budyko 1974 has experienced a revitalization in recent years choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2007 donohue et al 2012 wang and hejazi 2011 xiong and guo 2012 li et al 2013 greve et al 2015 2016 gudmundsson et al 2016 zeng and cai 2015 2016 wu et al 2016 the budyko curve treats the partitioning of annual precipitation p into actual evapotranspiration e and runoff r at catchment scale as a functional balance between water supply p and demand potential evapotranspiration pe from the atmosphere water availability can be defined as the ratio of annual e and p i e e p in the budyko hypothesis greve et al 2015 2016 gudmundsson et al 2016 generally the budyko type equations can be classified into two categories namely parameterless pike 1964 budyko 1974 and parametric ones zhang et al 2001 fu et al 2007 compared with the parameterless ones the single parameter budyko type equations present greater flexibility to adapt to different watershed characteristics jiang et al 2015 wu et al 2016 thus attracting widespread attention from hydrologists and water resources managers donohue et al 2012 wang and hejazi 2011 li et al 2013 liang et al 2015 its specific expression can be given as e p f ϕ w where ϕ indicates the ratio of pe to p i e the so called aridity index w represents the unique parameter of the budyko curve and controls the specific shape of the curve li et al 2013 liang et al 2015 undoubtedly the unique parameter w is of critical importance for the so called water availability assessment hereafter denoted as waa i e e p assessment in the context of budyko hypothesis singh and kumar 2015 physically parameter w is generally considered to be an integrative property of climate seasonality and watershed characteristics such as vegetation cover soil properties yang et al 2007 wang and tang 2014 zeng and cai 2018 hence its value should not be fixed but instead varies across different basins yang et al 2007 2009 xu et al 2013a b i e the so called basin specific w value li et al 2013 here worthy of note is that unlike the observed p and r data budyko parameter w is not a directly observable quantity which should be estimated through some statistical methods gudmundsson et al 2016 generally methods used for w estimation are established through coupling the budyko model and catchment water balance theory using the historical p pe and r data wang and hejazi 2011 teng et al 2012 li et al 2013 liang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 trancoso et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 these methods can be classified into two categories i e the so called optimized and calibrated ones yang et al 2007 the optimized method is established through coupling budyko model and annual water balance hypothesis xu et al 2013a b liu and liang 2015 trancoso et al 2016 while the calibrated method employs the long term mean water balance hypothesis wang and hejazi 2011 sun et al 2014 liang et al 2015 zeng and cai 2015 2016 for example xu et al 2013a b optimized parameter w in a budyko type curve using a least square technique with annual p pe and r data over 23 years for each of the 256 basins worldwide sun et al 2014 calibrated the parameter in budyko curve using the mean annual p pe and r of the pre runoff change point period 1970 1989 30 years for the upper hanjiang river basin yang et al 2007 identified the parameter in budyko curve for 108 catchments in the yellow river basin through the optimized and calibrated methods using historical hydro meteorological observations ranging in length from 6 to 46 years their results highlighted that there exists quite high correlation between optimized and calibrated w values which indicates that parameter w uncertainty resulting from methods is negligible in addition to the method uncertainty data uncertainty resulting from limited hydro meteorological records is another primary uncertainty source however it is worthy of note that the length of data that can be used in practice varies from region to region while the minimum in aforementioned studies is merely 6 years in general parameter w uncertainty resulting from limited hydro meteorological samples is classified as epistemic uncertainty undoubtedly more available data is beneficial for reducing such uncertainty but on the other hand the uncertainty would be remarkably large due to the used data with small sample size lyn et al 2007 guo et al 2017 thus data of sufficient length is of critical importance for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of parameter estimation serinaldi 2013 tong et al 2014 as well as for parameter w estimation in the budyko curve however worthy of note is that only finite and limited hydro meteorological records which includes insufficient or incomplete information can be obtained in practice such records generally fail to fully characterize the basin scale properties of hydrologic cycle kennard et al 2010 sikorska et al 2014 zhang et al 2015b consequently not desired but inevitable the computed parameter w contains considerable uncertainty resulting from these limited hydro meteorological records overlooking parameter w uncertainty could produce incomplete or even misleading conclusions however studies investigating parameter w uncertainty resulting from limited hydro meteorological records remain few and in particular research is needed to disclose the impact of such uncertainty on waa in the context of budyko hypothesis given the above concerns a framework coupling bootstrap algorithm efron and tibshirani 1986 1993 and the budyko model is designed for disclosing parameter w uncertainty resulting from limited hydro meteorological records the bootstrap method is an elegant approach for uncertainty quantification of unknown quantities it is extremely practical particularly when analytical solutions and modeling techniques couldn t be easily performed serinaldi and kilsby 2015 freschi et al 2017 as a data driven method the method relies on the resampling of the original dataset relaxes distributional assumptions in the variables and presents an assessment of parameter uncertainty by realistic asymmetric confidence interval vigiak and bende michl 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 to date this method has received widespread attention within the hydrologic community rustomji and wilkinson 2008 vigiak and bende michl 2013 guillod et al 2015 serinaldi and kilsby 2015 ganey et al 2017 therefore this study employs the bootstrap method to reveal parameter w uncertainty in the budyko curve additionally parameter w uncertainty would inevitably lead to waa uncertainty in the context of budyko hypothesis therefore once the uncertainty of parameter w estimation is disclosed exploring the impact of such uncertainty on waa becomes indispensable sensitivity analysis is one suitable means for quantifying how the response uncertainty is apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in inputs saltelli 2002 in present study one fundamental and widely used technique for sensitivity analysis the partial derivative based sensitivity analysis method is implemented wang et al 2008 hu and lu 2016 more specifically the partial derivative of waa with respect to parameter w is computed for expounding the impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa three catchments with different climate conditions lying in the yellow river basin are selected as study regions which are the upper catchment of yellow river basin humid region fenhe and weihe river basin arid and semiarid regions in view of above the main objective of this work is 1 disclosing parameter w uncertainty resulting from limited hydro meteorological records through a bootstrap resampling method and 2 exploring the impact of such uncertainty on waa through the partial derivative based sensitivity analysis method it constitutes the primary significance of this study and related results are expected to provide more robust insights for budyko based model although methods proposed in present study are applied in the three representative catchments there have been no restrictions that would prevent them from being applied to other regions the rest of paper is constructed as follows section 2 describes the study area and dataset section 3 describes the methods adopted in this study results and discussion are described in section 4 section 5 shows the main conclusions drawn from this study 2 study area and dataset 2 1 study area the designed framework is applied to the yellow river basin yrb china the yellow river also known as mother river of china is the second largest river in china the yrb contributes 13 of the cultivated area in china but holds only 3 of the country s water resources cai et al 2011 it is one of the most economically politically and culturally important basins in china to date the yrb has received widespread attention from the government and international organizations due to the serious water related issues such as water shortages soil erosion sedimentation and drying up wang et al 2012 to address these water related issues a large number of engineering measures such as reservoirs landscape engineering terracing has been implemented as a result the hydrological processes have presented significant changes in present study we select three important catchments lying in the upper and middle yrb as study regions shown in fig 1 i e the upper yellow river basin uyrb weihe river basin wrb and fenhe river basin frb respectively the uyrb the area from upstream to tangnaihai station is the main source of water resources in the yrb it contributes 35 of total water resources of the yrb but has an area that is only 16 of the whole yrb lan et al 2006 brierley et al 2016 wei et al 2016 the uyrb is crucial for the water resources of the whole basin in northwest china topographically the elevation decreases from the west basin to the south basin climatically the uyrb is semi humid region of the tibetan plateau annual mean daily temperature ranges from 4 c to 2 c mean annual precipitation varies between 250 and 810 mm of which approximately 75 falls between june and september the weihe river is the largest tributary of the yellow river as a state key economic development zone and important agricultural production area the wrb hosts 76 major cities with a total population of 22 million across three provinces chang et al 2016a b the guanzhong plain located in the wrb is one of the most important industrial and agricultural production zones in china guo et al 2016 shao et al 2017 the wrb is characterized by high soil erosion rates and heavy sediment loads zhang et al 2008 fan et al 2017 the average annual natural runoff is 10 4 billion m3 accounting for 17 3 of the total yellow river s total discharge the mean annual temperature ranges from 7 8 c to 13 5 c the temporal distribution of precipitation is uneven with that more than 60 falling in the wet season june to october the fenhe river is the second largest tributary of the yellow river and the largest river in shanxi province north china as the most economically developed area of the shanxi province the frb holds more than 50 of the whole shanxi province s industrial output which plays a critical role in the economic growth of shanxi province moreover the drainage area of frb also is a major agricultural production area in the shanxi province similar to the wrb the frb suffers from high soil erosion rates and heavy sediment loads in the past century lots of hydraulic engineering measures have been implemented for the rational utilization of water resources in the frb extensive hydraulic engineering measures along with climate variations have brought significant alteration to the regional hydrological cycle the frb locates in semi arid climate zone annual basin averaged daily temperature varies between 6 and 13 c from the north to the south annual precipitation ranges from 300 mm in the north to 700 mm in the south 2 2 dataset annual r data 1960 2010 from hydrological stations tangnaihai denoted as tnh huaxian denoted as hx and hejin denoted as hj in the uyrb wrb and frb are utilized in this study table 1 the data are provided by the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission which takes the main responsibility of monitoring collecting and disposing hydrological information in the yrb data quality are strictly controlled before being released the meteorological data 1960 2010 including daily and monthly p daily mean maximum minimum temperature air pressure relative humidity wind velocity and sunshine duration are provided by the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn daily pe from each individual station is calculated by the fao56 penman monteith method using meteorological data allen et al 1998 areal p and pe in these study regions are calculated by the thiessen polygon method on the arcgis platform the daily areal p and pe are converted into yearly for the budyko related analyses in this study 3 methodologies here the outline of the methodological framework used in this study is briefly described first the cumulative sum cusum method and pettitt method are used together to identify the change point of streamflow series based on the change point the whole study period is split into two sub periods i e the pre variation and variation period readers interested in theoretical details of the two methods are referred to the paper by pettitt 1979 second the so called calibrated method is applied to calculate parameter w in the budyko curve with annual p pe and r data in the pre variation period third the bootstrap resampling technique is incorporated with the calibration method for disclosing parameter w uncertainty next is to examine the impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa for the three representative catchments last the partial derivative based sensitivity analysis is performed for expounding such impact on waa in the following part we will first introduce the budyko framework 3 1 budyko framework the physical principle of budyko framework is that long term e p is primarily limited by the water energy balance which can be described as the long term pe p dryness index wang and hejazi 2011 liang et al 2015 for a catchment under humid conditions pe p 1 energy is the limiting factor while under arid conditions pe p 1 water supply is the limiting factor yang et al 2007 to date a couple of mathematical equations has been proposed to represent the budyko framework present study employs the commonly used budyko fu equation derived from simple physical assumptions fu et al 2007 1 e p 1 pe p 1 pe p w 1 w where w 1 p e and pe denote the long term mean p e and pe respectively the calibrated method for parameter w estimation is carried out through incorporating the long term catchment water balance and the budyko hypothesis for a given watershed the long term water balance equation can be defined as 2 p e r δ s where r indicates the long term mean r δs represents the change in water storage in the watershed here δs can be neglected over long periods and thus atmospheric water is the only source for e and r given that p and r are known inputs the value of e can be determined by eq 2 integrating eqs 1 and 2 over long periods it can be derived 3 p r δ s e 1 pe p 1 pe p w 1 w p hence given r p and pe at the long term scale parameter w can be calibrated statistically by solving eq 3 from eq 3 it can be found that r p pe is the function of w i e w g r p pe here p 1 n i 1 n p pe 1 n i 1 n pe r 1 n i 1 n r as aforementioned in the introduction section the waa is defined as the ratio of e to p in the context of budyko hypothesis in addition to uncovering w uncertainty another object is to explore the impact of such uncertainty on waa to achieve this purpose we employ the partial derivative based sensitivity analysis method in this study the partial derivative is generally referred as exact sensitivity coefficient hamby 1994 for simplicity the budyko fu equation is written as 4 waa e p f ϕ w 1 ϕ 1 ϕ w 1 w the partial derivative of waa with respect to parameter w is defined as 5 w a a w f w ϕ w 1 1 w ϕ w ln ϕ w ϕ w 1 ln ϕ w 1 w 2 from eq 5 it can be found that w a a w is conditional on w and ϕ in other words the sensitivity of waa to w is a function of w and ϕ 3 2 nonparametric bootstrap based algorithm for budyko parameter w uncertainty estimation the nonparametric bootstrap resampling method is a powerful and versatile computational technique for estimating the distribution of targets particularly in small sample situations kybic 2010 it mimics the random mechanism of the underlying target by sampling with replacement from the original sample thus leading to an empirical distribution of the underlying target khosravi et al 2013 then the empirical distribution can be used to generate confidence intervals for the underlying target compared with the parametric bootstrap the nonparametric bootstrap method does not require any preselected distributional assumption about the underlying population specifically the nonparametric bootstrap method generates samples from the original sample itself the empirical distribution instead of from a preselected theoretical distribution i e the parametric bootstrap method it fully utilizes the information existed in the available data in certain circumstances this empirical distribution is considered to be the least prejudiced estimate possible of the underlying distribution anything else imposes biases or preconceptions possibly accurate but also potentially misleading cevenini and barbini 2010 through integrating the calibrated method for parameter w estimation into the budyko framework as described in section 3 1 the following bootstrap based algorithm for revealing w uncertainty is designed 1 predefine a large number of bootstrap samplings b present study sets b 10 000 2 implement the resampling with replacement from observed pairs r p pe to obtain the bootstrap dataset denoted as r p pe the r p and pe have the same size as r p pe respectively 3 calculate the means r p p e for bootstrap dataset r p pe 4 calibrate parameter w through plugging r p p e into function w eq 5 5 repeat steps 2 4 b times after this the b bootstrap estimates w can be obtained the empirical distribution is referred to as the bootstrap distribution of statistic w 6 estimate confidence interval denoted as ci to measure parameter w uncertainty in the budyko curve in present study the percentile method is used to estimate bootstrap ci for the b bootstrap estimates w the percentile method performs well in the case of unbiasedness and constant variance of the sampling distribution cheung and lau 2007 timmerman et al 2009 as an extremely simple yet powerful method for determining bootstrap ci it employs the central 1 2α part of the cumulative bootstrap distribution to approximately denote the central 1 2α 100 ci thus the lower and upper confidence intervals for w are given by w α w 1 α here w α indicates the 100 α th percentile of the bootstrap distribution 4 results and discussion 4 1 change point of annual r in the study regions results of the cusum and pettitt tests for annual r in tnh hx and hj stations are displayed in fig 2 it can be found that in the first iteration 1989 1990 and 1971 are significant change points of annual r in tnh hx and hj stations respectively to avoid the neglect of the existence of multiple change points the cusum and pettitt tests are applied again to each new segment i e periods before and after change point obtained in the first iteration until no further change points are detected for hj station there is a significant change point 1971 at 95 confidence level in the second iteration none change point is detected in the third iteration there is no change point in the second iteration for annual r in tnh and hx stations employing the first change point the whole study period is divided into two sub periods period before the change point is defined as the pre variation period which is considered as one period with less impact of human activities hence 1960 1989 1960 1990 and 1969 1971 are referred as the pre variation periods for the uyrb wrb and frb respectively data in the pre variation periods are used to estimate parameter w in the budyko curve thus length of data used for parameter w estimation are 30 31 and 12 years in the uyrb wrb and frb respectively 4 2 disclosure of parameter w uncertainty before looking at the bootstrap ci we employ the histograms to present the distributions of 10 000 bootstrapped parameter w in the three study regions fig 3 the resampled mean and 95 ci of the bootstrapped estimates w are also presented in fig 3 the histogram itself can be regarded as an empirical representation of the posterior distribution of w it can be easily seen from fig 3 that the w distributions in the three study regions are all unimodal and relatively symmetric about the mean therefore we can conclude that the bootstrapped sample w is adequate for the percentile method based ci estimation in this study we set α 0 05 yielding 95 ci the 95 ci ranges from 2 44 to 2 62 in the uyrb from 3 01 to 3 28 in the wrb and from 2 88 to 3 57 in the frb parameter w estimated by the original data in uyrb wrb and frb are 2 53 3 14 and 3 20 respectively to quantitatively measure parameter w uncertainty resulting from limited hydro meteorological records the index rl i e relative length of ci is employed in present study the index is defined as the ratio of the difference between the lower and upper boundary w values of 95 ci to the point estimate w higher value of rl denotes larger uncertainty in parameter w vice versa among the three study regions rl is the highest 21 56 in the frb which is nearly 3 fold greater than that in the uyrb 7 11 and wrb 8 60 it means that parameter w uncertainty is the largest in the frb uyrb and wrb following here note that the spatial change of parameter w uncertainty exhibits contrary relationship with that of the length of the original data specifically parameter w uncertainty is the most remarkable in the frb while the data length is minimum just 12 in comparison parameter w uncertainty in the uyrb and wrb are relatively less while the length of the data in the two regions are relatively longer these results highlight that size of hydrological records is closely related to the parameter w uncertainty more available data is beneficial for reducing parameter w uncertainty due to the existence of much information for characterizing the basin scale properties of hydrologic cycle contrarily less available data would increase parameter uncertainty undoubtedly take the frb as an example if the data length is less than 12 it may be extremely hard to take the result of parameter w seriously thus expanding size of hydrological samples is extremely indispensable for reducing parameter w uncertainty fig 4 displays the budyko curves in the context of parameter w uncertainty the wider band of the budyko curves means the larger impact of parameter w uncertainty from fig 4 it can be easily found that in band of the budyko curves is the widest in the frb due to the largest uncertainty of parameter w under same climate condition pe p compared with that in the uyrb and wrb hydro meteorological records with the smallest size is the primary reason behind the widest band of budyko curve in the frb 4 3 impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa as aforementioned in the introduction section following greve et al 2015 water availability is defined as the ratio of annual e and p to quantitatively measure the impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa the vertical distance denoted as vd between the low and up confidence branches of budyko curves is computed upper left panel of fig 4 larger vd indicates larger impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa vice versa hence as shown in fig 4 the largest parameter w uncertainty in the frb results in the most remarkable impact on waa under given climate condition compared with that in the uyrb and wrb additionally from fig 4 we can find that vd doesn t stay constant but varies with pe p i e impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa varies with pe p we can intuitively infer that the vd first increases and then decreases with increase of pe p vd value i e the impact of w uncertainty on waa is rather low under extremely humid and arid conditions by contrast worthy of note is that the impact is higher under comparatively mild condition thus pouring enough attention on water availability in the context of parameter w uncertainty under comparatively mild condition is extremely indispensable fig 5 illustrates variability of vd with changes of pe p more specifically from fig 5 it can be easily found that the vd is conditional on the climatic conditions under given confidence limit of parameter w the vd rapidly increases initially with increasing pe p and then slowly decreases at pe p 1 37 1 20 and 1 19 vds i e impacts of w uncertainty on waa reach the extremum in the uyrb wrb and frb respectively primary reason for such variability of vd is that the sensitivity of waa to parameter w is largest for comparatively mild condition greve et al 2016 above contents present the impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa in the pre variation period for the variation period or the future period information on water availability and e with less impact of human activities such as water withdraw reservoir operations and so on is extremely beneficial for making water related public policies in the context of budyko hypothesis the information can be obtained through eq 1 using the long term mean p and pe in the variation period and the determined the parameter w in the pre variation period here the pre variation period is assumed to be a period with less impact of human activities the rl index is employed again to measure impact of parameter w uncertainty on water availability and e assessment in the context of budyko hypothesis related results are listed in table 2 it can be found from table 2 that impacts of w uncertainty on water availability and e assessment vary from 2 43 to 4 97 the impacts are largest in the frb due to the largest uncertainty of parameter w compared with other catchments because present paper defines water availability as the ratio of annual e to p the rlwaa is same with rl e widely known is that runoff is tightly correlated with water resources planning and management which is of critical importance for socio economic development in practice it is generally considered as one index to reflect characteristics of regional available water budyko model is particularly effective for runoff assessment in combination with long term water balance equation xiong et al 2014 liang et al 2015 zeng and cai 2015 2016 here we estimate long term natural runoff r in the variation period through integrating eqs 1 and 2 using p and pe in this period related results are listed in table 2 from table 2 it can be found that in spite of the small rl in water availability and e assessment impact of parameter w uncertainty on r estimation is considerably remarkable the corresponding rl of r estimation ranges from 10 21 to 68 17 in the three study regions which is largest in the frb undoubtedly this considerably remarkable impact greatly challenges decision making in water resources planning and management any attempt to obscure parameter w uncertainty could create incomplete or even false conclusion in decision making in the context of budyko based models in other words taking the uncertainty into account seriously particularly when developing water related policies is of critical importance moreover in practice expanding size of hydrological records is indispensable for reducing parameter w uncertainty and enhancing reliability of water availability assessment 4 4 sensitivity of waa to parameter w as aforementioned in figs 4 and 5 impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa reaches maximum under comparatively mild condition in order to have a deeper insight into the variation of such impact the derived eq 5 is implemented in this section from eq 5 we can find that the partial derivative of waa with respect to parameter w i e w a a w is conditional on w and ϕ in light of this fig 6 presents how w a a w varies with w and ϕ specifically it can be found from the left panel of fig 6 that w a a w decreases with increasing w under given ϕ and the decreasing tendency decreases with increasing w in other words under given climate condition waa is more sensitive to the change of w along with w increasing the right panel of fig 6 exhibits variations of w a a w with changes in ϕ under given w it follows from fig 6 that w a a w increases quickly along with ϕ and reaches its maximum afterwards goes down gradually phenomenon of fig 6 matches well with that of fig 5 in essence partial derivate of waa with respect to parameter w is the slope of the tangent line to the budyko curve at w ϕ larger w a a w denotes bigger slope of the tangent line at point w ϕ which means waa is more vulnerable or sensitive to the change of parameter w at point w ϕ following from fig 6 value of w a a w reaches its maximum when ϕ is larger than 1 at the critical point of ϕ waa is extremely vulnerable to parameter w change due to this as shown in fig 6 impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa in the three representative studies reaches maximum under the transitional climate conditions i e near the critical point of ϕ the particularity of transitional climate regions i e the so called critical point of ϕ in the budyko curve is also mentioned in the work of greve et al 2015 greve et al 2015 roughly determined that vd between budyko curves under the 75th and 25th percentile of parameter w reaches its maximum value at ϕ 1 4 however analytically determining the critical value of ϕ maximizing the sensitivity of waa to parameter w has not been conducted to date from the statistical point of view if function h has a local extremum at point a b and the first order partial derivatives of h exist at a b then h x a b h y a b 0 the point a b is generally called the critical point of h hence the so called critical point ϕ in the budyko curve under given w is the point maximizing the w a a w ϕ curve shown in the right panel of fig 6 let h ϕ w w a a w therefore value of ϕ which satisfies the condition h ϕ 0 is the critical point of w a a w ϕ curve under given w present study derives partial derivative of function h ϕ w with respect to ϕ appendix a which is given by 6 h ϕ 1 w ϕ w 1 ϕ w 1 1 w 1 ln ϕ w 1 w ln ϕ ϕ w w ϕ w 1 here ϕ 0 and w 1 therefore 1 w ϕ w 1 ϕ w 1 1 w 1 0 to achieve h ϕ 0 ln ϕ w 1 w ln ϕ ϕ w w ϕ w 1 should be zero thus under given w value of ϕ which satisfies 7 ln ϕ w 1 w ln ϕ ϕ w w ϕ w 1 is the critical point of function h i e the critical point of w a a w ϕ curve on the basis of eq 7 fig 7 displays critical points ϕ denoted as ϕ cp and related w a a w under various w w a a w under ϕ cp w is written as w a a w cp it can be easily found from fig 7 that ϕ cp and w a a w cp decrease with increasing w through the specific relation exhibited by fig 7 or eq 7 we can clearly and explicitly determine ϕ cp which maximizes w a a w under given w at these critical points ϕ cp waa is mostly sensitive to the change of parameter w it should receive critical concern when making policies for water resources management with application of budyko curve 5 conclusions the budyko curve particularly the parametric budyko has been extensively applied for water availability assessment waa due to the relatively simple structure and concise physical mechanism worthy of note is that its single parameter w is easily subject to uncertainty resulting from limited hydrometeorological records the primary aim of this work is to investigate such parameter w uncertainty for budyko curve and further examine its impact on waa to achieve this purpose the bootstrap method is integrated into the budyko model for revealing parameter w uncertainty in this study moreover the partial derivative based sensitivity analysis method is performed for expounding the impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa results of this study are beneficial for constituting a more reliable and robust budyko model and enhancing its practicality three catchments with different climate conditions lying in the yellow river basin are selected as study regions the general conclusions and specific inferences are drawn as follows parameter w of budyko fu curve in different regions exhibits noteworthy uncertainty fig 5 the larger uncertainty of parameter w leads to wider band of budyko curve fig 6 parameter w uncertainty varies with data length gathering as much data as possible is of great significance for reducing the uncertainty in w estimation moreover impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa varies with climate condition which reaches the maximum under comparatively mild climate condition fig 7 in terms of runoff assessment in the variation period the relative length of the confidence interval of estimated annual mean runoff in the context of parameter w uncertainty ranges from 10 21 to 68 17 in study regions table 2 above results indicate that for water related factors assessment in the variation period or the future period in the context of budyko model pouring enough attention on parameter w uncertainty is indispensable particularly under the mild climate condition besides above the partial derivative based sensitivity analysis denotes that the largest sensitivity of waa to parameter w under the mild climate condition is the primary reason behind the largest impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa at pe p 1 37 1 20 and 1 19 in the three representative regions eq 6 and fig 7 to provide technical support for determining the critical value of pe p maximizing impact of parameter w uncertainty on waa the analytic expression is derived in this paper eq 7 in light of above it can be concluded that parameter w uncertainty resulting from limited hydro meteorological records shouldn t be omitted and taking it into account is extremely beneficial for advancing the robustness of budyko model moreover the comparative analysis of results in the three study regions indicate that increasing the size of hydro meteorological records as much as possible is an effective way to reduce the uncertainty of parameter w and lower its impact on water related factors assessment declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science

6302,adjustment of weather radar estimates using observed precipitation has been an accepted procedure for decades ground observations of precipitation typically come from rain gauges but can also include data from diverse networks of sensors with different levels of reliability this study presents a standardized framework for evaluating adjustment algorithms using synthetically constructed but realistic rain grids and weather radar rainfall ground observation points are randomly placed throughout the synthetic storm domain and the precipitation for each sensor is extracted from the true rain then a subset of the sensors are defined as unreliable and a log normal error factor is applied at those locations this double network of rain sensors could be applicable for example when rainfall is derived from signal attenuation between commercial microwave link cml antennas past research has tested cml observations as a source of precipitation data and validated various radar adjustment algorithms however a comprehensive evaluation of adjustment algorithms using accurate gauge data mixed with cml observations at different densities is lacking five adjustment algorithms are applied to the synthetic radar grid mean field bias mfb a multiplicative algorithm mixed additive and multiplicative conditional merge condmerge and kriging with external drift ked generation of the synthetic framework and application of the adjustment algorithms is repeated for 150 realizations comparison of coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error and linear regression for all adjustment procedures over all realizations indicates the following results only mfb and ked adjustments performed well when using accurate gauges the kriging based ked was able to achieve good adjustment also with the addition of error prone sensors condmerge and the mixed and multiplicative however resulted in poorer adjustments keywords weather radar rainfall gauges commercial microwave links synthetic model 1 introduction shortly after weather radar became an accepted source of precipitation data efforts began to improve quantitative precipitation estimates qpe by merging ground based observations for example krajewski 1987 and seo 1998 presented early applications of kriging to correct radar rainfall with gauge data gjertsen et al 2004 explained the advantages and disadvantages of both radar rainfall and gauge observations concluding that proper adjustment of radar rainfall with ground based observations is crucial to achieving accurate qpe work by velasco forero et al 2009 demonstrated a unique non parametric method of determining covariance for the gauge data before applying the kriging interpolations a bayesian approach was introduced by todini 2001 and further developed in mazzetti and todini 2004 co kriging was applied successfully by sideris et al 2014 they prepared an accurate precipitation estimate where the primary variable was gauge observations at one time interval and three additional secondary variables were gauge observations from an earlier time interval and radar values at gauge locations from both time steps a different co kriging approach presented recently by foehn et al 2018 created precipitation estimates using two independent and non collocated gauge networks they preformed inverse distance weighted regression kriging and regression co kriging in all cases they corrected for non stationarity of gauge data by calculating and removing the trend which was produced from residuals between gauges and radar their approach enabled successful qpe for short time intervals in a mountainous region with severe beam blockage of the available radar images some of these techniques were applied operationally by amorati et al 2012 and berg et al 2016 several national meteorological services among them the german deutcher wetterdienst dwd https www dwd de en ourservices radar products radar products html and the royal netherlands meteorological service https data knmi nl datasets publish adjusted weather radar regularly a review of the application of radar rain gauge adjustments across europe appears in gjertsen et al 2004 research papers over the past decade have addressed the ability of commercial microwave link cml attenuation data to represent rain rates and the uncertainty involved signal attenuation from cml antennas and the derived rain rate are impacted by several sources of uncertainty non linear attenuation response distance between antennas interference resulting from water accumulating on the antennas similar to wet radome attenuation in weather radar calibration parameters for the attenuation rain rate relationship microwave frequency drop size distribution in leijnse et al 2010 the authors show that distance between cml antennas becomes a major source of uncertainty at certain microwave frequencies with distant greater than 5 km antennas they point to drop size distribution as the major cause of uncertainty in cml precipitation rates bianchi et al 2013 added data from cml as a second ground based source for radar adjustment in an early work berne and uijlenhoet 2007 described the source of errors in cml derived rain rates more recently van leth et al 2018 carefully analyzed the uncertainties in attenuation of a microwave link at a controlled research installation evaluations of the various adjustment algorithms have appeared in many research papers one of the early assessments was done by goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 since then wang et al 2012 and mckee and binns 2016 have covered a broad selection of the adjustment procedures an overview of adjustment algorithm categories that appears in hasan et al 2016 investigated the issue of error independence between the adjusted and true rain grids ly et al 2013 categorized the various adjustment methods into deterministic and geo statistical they concluded that geo statistical methods out perform deterministic in long temporal aggregations of rainfall synthetic data sets have been employed in climate and meteorology research to address complicated and multivariate systems for example edouard et al 2018 used synthetic data to determine uncertainty in flash flood forecasting they performed a sensitivity analysis by artificially applying a range of soil parameters in a combined modeling framework similarly musayev et al 2018 recently examined the rainwater harvesting potential under several global climate models using synthetically generated daily rainfall a new radar adjustment method combining both gauge and crowd sourced data was presented by yang and ng 2019 their method applied bayesian regression to synthetically produced rain and radar fields as well as synthetically derived gauge and crowd sourced data the aim of this research is to present a standardized fully reproducible framework for determining which adjustment procedures achieve the best correlation to the true rain using varying mixtures of reliable and error prone ground based observations 2 methods the procedure described below created 150 realizations of a synthetic framework by constructing simulated rain grids incorporating a noise component to produce radar grids and randomly distributing observation locations throughout the grid extent this procedure was implemented using r r development core team 2008 software with functions adapted from guenzi et al 2016 nerini et al 2017 and morin and gabella 2007 a uniform random number seed was applied throughout making the procedure fully reproducible 2 1 synthetic framework the synthetic model presented in this work does not attempt to be an exact representation of any real rain event radar data or distribution of gauges rather like any model certain characteristics of reality were distilled to create an analysis framework under which specific aspects of radar adjustments could be examined refer to yang and ng 2019 where similar simplifications were adopted in creating synthetic rain radar and gauge inputs this framework included initial true rain distributions across a predefined grid referred to as the domain the domain size 100 100 km was chosen to represent the range covered by a typical c band radar the temporal resolution was assumed to be 24 h and the accumulated precipitation was chosen under that assumption while operational adjustment of radar is performed on individual radar scans or short aggregations calibration and evaluation of adjustments are applied to long time aggregations following goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 this 24 h aggregation avoids short term effects due to the high temporal variability of rainfall as described in marra and morin 2018 weather radar measurements involve several sources of uncertainty summarized in villarini and krajewski 2010 some of which were encapsulated into the test framework of this work by applying configurable noise structures the true rain grid was multiplied by three spatially varying noise grids fig 1 to simulate the radar grids similarly to the combined uncertainty model suggested by ciach et al 2007 and later by villarini and krajewski 2009b the first was a multiplicative bias level varying radially from the center of the domain assumed to be the location of the radar this noise grid was designed to mimic range degradation fig 1 panel a range degradation results from several unrelated causes increased sampling volume due to the expanding radar beam attenuation from atmospheric moisture or dust and various effects attributed to the vertical profile of reflectivity vpr krajewski et al 2011 and vignal and krajewski 2001 show that vpr effects are the most significant cause of range degradation at long ranges reflectance from melting ice hydrometeors usually at altitudes between 2 and 4 km causes the bright band effect leading to high reflectance at altitudes above the bright band reflectance drops more or less linearly due to the expanding radar beam at lower altitude on the other hand vpr has very little effect on range degradation thus the lowest radar elevation angle will not reach the bright band and not be affected by vpr but at the second and higher radar elevation angles the beam reaches the bright band altitude closer to the radar this current work considers the storm domain to be 100 km 100 km with the radar at the center so the maximum range covered in this simulation is 74 km krajewski et al 2011 show that up to 70 km vpr has no effect on the range dependent error at the lowest elevation angle the second elevation angle has a small effect at 70 km and at the third elevation angle a more substantial effect 20 to 40 error at 50 to 70 km respectively range degradation was split into two zones by sebastianelli et al 2012 they considered the zone near to the radar to be affected mostly by the z r relationship and rain rate with almost no range dependent decrease in radar reflectivity in their study of an s band radar range dependent uncertainly appeared only beyond the 50 km range due to radar beam spread and vertical profile of reflectivity this same two zone approach appeared and was validated also in chumchean et al 2003 both of these works contained a discontinuity in the error model between the zones on the other hand michelson and koistinen 2000 presented a radar degradation relation whereby the log of the gauge radar ratio followed a second order polynomial of range r log g r r r a b r c r 2 expanding on the above studies the range dependent error component in this work was defined as a gaussian function eq 1 also chosen by villarini and krajewski 2009a in their error model thus near the radar antenna the error factor of 1 0 did not incur any change in the true rain and at larger radial distances the error factor decreased following a gaussian curve approximating the two zone range degradation presented above but avoiding discontinuity in the function furthermore a gaussian curve drops more slowly at small ranges than the polynomial used by michelson and koistinen 2000 thus we maintain almost no degradation up to 15 km from the radar then the range degradation error grows to 25 at the maximum range of 70 km refer to panel a of fig 2 to see the slight effect of this error at the corners of the domain 1 err r a e r b 2 2 c 2 where err is the error factor r is the distance from radar a b c are empirical constants chosen to emulate almost no range degradation near the radar a 1 and a gaussian decreasing value b 4 and c 100 such that the error level at the maximum range of 70 km is 0 75 the second radar noise grid was created from a log normally distributed random multiplicative field to represent uncertainty in the power law z r relationship non uniform beam filling non uniform drop size distributions etc the third noise grid was constructed from a spatial structure defined following the methods in nerini et al 2017 the theoretical base for this stochastic method was developed by seed 2002 and implemented in the short term ensemble prediction system steps probabilistic forecast scheme by bowler et al 2006 this spatial structure was derived from the true rain grid thus providing a precipitation dependent error these three radar noise grids once multiplied together contained error values from 0 to above 3 0 thus the resulting radar the product of the true rain and this error grid acquired values both above and below the true rain those introduced error grids are multiplicative in nature and their combination aimed at reproducing realistic observational conditions the noise levels used to create this radar grid and the error levels applied to the simulated error prone observation locations section 2 2 are all configurable allowing construction of uniform and reproducible test frameworks for the various adjustment procedures fig 2 illustrates an example of the resulting radar rainfall 2 2 ground based precipitation sensors two types of ground sensors were simulated in this framework reliable and error prone observation locations were placed randomly throughout the storm domain with 50 reliable gauge locations and three sets of error prone 50 100 and 200 additional locations while gauges actually do sustain errors modern rain rate measuring equipment has reduced the measurement uncertainty to approximately 5 see for example colli et al 2013 thus gauge data were assumed to be accurate in the simulated framework their aggregated precipitation was extracted directly from the initial true grid throughout this work the terms gauges and reliable sensors are used interchangeably in operational weather monitoring gauge networks are quite sparse for a global survey of gauge densities see kidd et al 2017 the influence of gauge density on radar gauge merging was reported by otieno et al 2014 and shafiei et al 2014 further assessed the importance of gauge density and distribution the density of gauges chosen for this work 1 gauge per 200 km 2 attempted to mirror a typical gauge network see further reports by ahrens 2006 tian et al 2018 and otieno et al 2014 the source of error prone observations can be a second less reliable network of gauges alternatively microwave signal attenuation in cml networks has become accepted as a source of point precipitation data fencl et al 2017 goldshtein et al 2009 overeem et al 2013 this current work does not assert that cml derived precipitation is inherently inaccurate however much work has been done to investigate the uncertainty associated with this source of precipitation data i e leijnse et al 2010 zinevich et al 2010 while attenuation data between cml towers represents the aggregated signal strength along the line of sight between towers most research i e overeem et al 2013 and goldshtein et al 2009 simplifies this linear feature into a single observation point at the center between the towers in their analysis of rainfall estimation from cml networks zinevich et al 2010 refer to link lengths from 0 5 to 8 km with increasing uncertainty in longer links the report by overeem et al 2016 covering a long term qpe program in the netherlands discusses an average link length of 3 6 km for over 2000 links in this work the term error prone sensor refers to point observations that could represent the midpoints along cml links this geographic simplification together with other uncertainties see leijnse et al 2010 and additional references in section 1 in cml observations concur in creating the overall cml error however so far no explicit model for such an error is available in this study we chose to use a multiplicative error model in order to i deal with a reduced number of parameters and ii make the model easily adaptable to other remote sensing instruments tian et al 2013 and tang et al 2015 to do so a random log normally distributed multiplicative error has been applied to the true precipitation to simulate error prone observations this error shares the log normal distribution parameters and thus the error magnitude distribution with the multiplicative error used for radar fields but with an independent spatial pattern in each simulation furthermore cml towers are usually installed at high density compared to rain gauges for example chwala et al 2012 report one cml link per 3 km 2 in southern germany therefore cml derived precipitation offers a possible real world case with a mixture of few reliable gauge and many less reliable cml point precipitation sensors locations for error prone data observations were therefore placed at three configurable densities one observation location per 200 km 2 identical to the gauge network one per 100 km 2 and one per 50 km 2 four times as many error prone sensors as reliable thus the densities of reliable and error prone sensors together were 50 reliable only representing rain gauges at 1 gauge per 200 km 2 additional 50 error prone observation locations totaling one observation location per 100 km 2 additional 100 error prone totaling one observation per 66 km 2 additional 200 error prone totaling one observation per 40 km 2 2 3 adjustment procedures this work implemented and tested five adjustment algorithms mean field bias mfb multiplicative mixed conditional merge condmerge and kriging with external drift ked the choice of these five among the full spectrum of adjustment procedures covered the range of both deterministic mfb and geostatistical methods multiplicative condmerge and ked employ variations of kriging implemented with the gstat package pebesma 2004 in r furthermore the mixed procedure allows comparison with an additive bias method and condmerge as explained below also applies an additive spatially varying correction on the other hand mfb and ked adjustments adjust the radar solely by a multiplicative factor 2 3 1 mean field bias the first mfb determines the average multiplicative bias shift between the radar grid and observed precipitation then corrects for that shift globally this is the only adjustment algorithm that applies a correction which does not vary spatially each of the other algorithms calculates a spatially varying correction from the differences between the observation locations and radar pixels at those locations 2 3 2 mixed and multiplicative both the multiplicative and mixed algorithms 1 adapted in this work fromhttps docs wradlib org en stable adjust html 1 that are explained in a technical report pfaff 2010 in german apply spatially varying corrections by interpolating the residuals between radar and sensors at the sensor locations using ordinary kriging multiplicative adjustment interpolates a correction grid by ordinary kriging of the residuals between the observation locations and the radar grid the radar grid is multiplied by this correction grid to obtain the adjusted result the mixed algorithm works similarly but determines two correction grids an additive component and a multiplicative component the adjusted grid results from multiplying the radar by the multiplicative factor then adding the additive component 2 3 3 conditional merge the condmerge algorithm initially introduced by sinclair and pegram 2005 and implemented by guenzi et al 2016 applies ordinary kriging to two different point sets the values of the true rain grid at gauge locations and the values of the radar grid at those locations the adjusted grid results from adding to the radar grid the kriging interpolation of the gauges then subtracting the interpolation of the radar values categorizing this procedure as additive in this way the procedure conditions the gauge adjustment by the radar precipitation values at gauge locations this procedure was applied successfully by berndt et al 2014 in addition rabiei and haberlandt 2015 compared conditional merging to kriging with external drift in the context of a new bias correction protocol they reported that conditional merging performed best after applying an initial bias correction 2 3 4 kriging with external drift among the geostatistical adjustment algorithms ked has been applied widely this interpolation method uses a secondary variable the radar precipitation itself in this case to add a trend to the gauge observations in addition to research by berndt et al 2014 and rabiei and haberlandt 2015 cited above schiemann et al 2011 also found that ked attained better correlation to the original rain than ordinary kriging ok methods delrieu et al 2014 further reported that ked out performed ok for twelve rain events in france 2 4 realizations the evaluation in this work was performed on 150 realizations of synthetic data initial true storms radar grids derived from the true rain by applying noise and bias factors and randomly placed ground based sensor locations the true storm grids were created using sequential gaussian simulations sgs similar to the approach used by nour et al 2006 to choose gauge locations and by teo and grimes 2007 sgs was used also by cecinati et al 2018 to create a realistic rainfall simulation they then applied different gauge distributions and error models to that simulation to determine the gauge uncertainty by kriging for uncertain data a method introduced by mazzetti and todini 2008 in this current work a multiplicative error grid was applied to all simulations of true rain to obtain 150 synthesized radar precipitation grids the radar noise structure used to create the radar grids is described in section 2 1 and error levels of ground based sensors in section 2 2 fig 1 shows the error grids and in fig 2 the true and resulting radar grids for one sample realization are shown the five adjustment procedures detailed in section 2 3 were then applied to each realization analysis of the results in section 2 5 calculated the mean values of several correlation statistics for each adjustment the choice of 150 realizations was determined after testing from 10 to 300 iterations coefficients of variation cv the ratio of variance to mean given by cv σ μ for rmse and r 2 were determined and averaged at different numbers of realizations see fig 3 the variation of these statistical measures over the range of realizations stabilized after about 100 realizations a larger number did not substantially change the means of cv for the different test statistics at the four error sensor densities thus 150 realizations was considered sufficient 2 5 analysis of adjustments in order to examine the success of each adjustment algorithm a set of 400 validation points was randomly chosen within the domain this number resulted from slovin s formula to select sample size eq 2 2 n samp n 1 n e 2 with e 0 05 confidence level of 95 and n 10 000 total pixels in the domain values of the original true rain and each of the adjusted grids were extracted at these validation points for all realizations separately and rmse was calculated examining adjustment algorithms in the context of a synthesized test framework insured that results were uniform and reproducible each adjustment was applied to all 150 rain realizations and with four densities of error prone observation locations then average coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse as well as linear regression slope and intercept between the adjusted grids and the initial true storm were calculated and examined table 1 presents mean statistics for each of these tests initially in order to justify use of a linear regression two tests were applied to check for normality of residuals anderson darling and shapiro wilk the p values of both were very small 10 6 supplying evidence that the null hypothesis of normality should be rejected therefore a box cox transform box and cox 1964 was applied to the set of adjusted values this transform was used by both erdin et al 2012 and cecinati et al 2016 in the context of kriging based radar adjustment the optimal box cox λ parameter was determined then the transformed data were again tested for normality repeating the anderson darling test as well as homoscedasticity using the breusch pagan test implemented in the car package in r fox and weisberg 2011 these tests showed p values above 0 2 for all realizations breusch pagan p values above 0 08 thus rejection of the null hypothesis was not suggested at a confidence level of 95 and preconditions for linear analysis were upheld visual examination of q q plots for a few realizations reinforced this conclusion then r 2 and rmse were obtained from linear regressions of the box cox transformed distributions to compare values of the true and adjusted rain grids at the validation locations 3 results three sets of figures are presented below first images of the adjusted rain grids appear for certain representative adjustment procedures mfb condmerge and ked figs 4 6 each figure includes adjustment results for all four densities of error prone observations these images show that the higher density of error prone sensors panels d in each figure are somewhat more speckled whereas the gauges only images panels a more closely resemble the true rain refer to fig 2 the next group figs 7 12 show scatter plots of true versus adjusted precipitation at the 400 validation points note that these plots represent the original precipitation value before the box cox transform explained above in 2 5 again each adjustment procedure appears four times for all densities of reliable error prone locations scatter plots in which the spread of points and thus the regression line approaches the 45 slope represent successful adjustment additionally those scatter plots where dispersion of the points grows compared to the unadjusted plot i e compare fig 7 to fig 8 indicate cases where the adjustment actually adds additional noise to the result the third set of figures box whisker plots of correlation statistics best reveals the success of adjustment all four statistics are presented r 2 rmse slope and intercept of the fitted linear regression line figs 13 16 these plots show the mean values of each statistic averaged over 150 realizations as well as first and third quartiles at the height of the boxes the whisker lines extend to 1 5 iqr inter quartile range and outliers appear as orange dots the height of the boxes and length of the whiskers give a clear representation of the variance of each statistic across all realizations rmse values that appear in fig 14 with a low mean indicate successful adjustment and short whisker lines mirror the dispersion of points in the scatter plots results of all correlation statistics averaged over 150 realizations appear in table 1 4 discussion the intention in this work was to demonstrate a reproducible synthetic test framework for evaluating weather radar adjustment procedures and to spotlight cases where additional error prone precipitation observations improve adjustment the framework was constructed from multiple realizations of a synthetic rain grid using sgs by choosing a large enough number of realizations we ensured that no single rain or error distribution would skew the results due to randomization effects configurable parameters for radar noise structure and four combinations of reliable and error prone sensors from zero error prone to four times as many error prone as reliable were applied to complete the synthetic framework the resulting radar grids were adjusted by five algorithms mfb mixed multiplicative condmerge and ked then values of the true rain and adjusted precipitation grids were extracted at 400 validation points means of several statistics comparing the adjusted and true rain were then calculated results were analyzed at two levels localized and domain wide higher r 2 values and lower rmse occur when there is a good average match at validation points between the true rain and the adjusted values the closeness of slope and intercept to the 45 one one line reveals adjustment methods that achieve good bias correction at the domain scale however when the slope nears 1 0 45 but the intercept does not go through zero then multiplicative bias is corrected but not additive bias thus methods with lower rmse results are considered to attain better local adjustment to the true rain slope values near 1 0 show good multiplicative bias correction and if the intercept is also close to zero then additive bias is also corrected from the scatter plots clearly only two adjustment algorithms improved correspondence between the true rain and adjusted grids mfb and ked referring to the unadjusted scatter plot fig 7 we note a somewhat high slope and intercept value far from zero this is expected due to the error fields applied to the true rain the shift of regression lines in all adjustments closer to the 45 slope demonstrates correction of the multiplicative bias however scatter plots of the adjustments show some increased dispersion of the points referring to the slope box whisker plots fig 15 the height of the boxes and whisker lines especially for the mfb and ked adjustments demonstrate this dispersion the algorithms introduce additional noise into the adjusted grid while correcting the overall bias conversely the mixed multiplicative and condmerge algorithms did not cause this added noise their scatter plots and box whisker plots of slope and intercept are more compact however the slope and intercept values for these adjustments are farther from the ideal furthermore the mixed and multiplicative adjustments show slightly higher rmse values and lower r 2 figs 14 and 13 than the ked adjustment also evident in the summary table 1 we therefore determine that mixed multiplicative and condmerge perform satisfactorily at the local scale avoiding additional noise in the correction procedure but at the price of somewhat poorer overall correction of multiplicative bias condmerge displays similar but slightly better results with rmse lower than both mixed and multiplicative especially with the addition of error prone sensors yet the slope and intercept values of condmerge are not as good as mfb so this conditioning algorithm reaches a good compromise with higher r 2 lower rmse but at the price of poorer bias correction interestingly the mfb adjustment achieves rmse lower than the unadjusted grid for all densities of error prone locations the slope is slightly nearer to 45 and the intercept close to zero these results reflect the fact that mfb applies a domain wide uniform correction of bias thus it is adjusting for multiplicative but not additive bias we also note a slight compression of the size of the slope and intercept box whisker plots for mfb with higher density of error prone observations so this adjustment can gain somewhat from additional error prone sensors the lowest rmse values for all densities of error prone sensors appear in the ked adjusted grid since ked takes into account radar values at the validation locations as the secondary trend variable this result is expected furthermore ked shows the highest r 2 among all methods and at all densities of error prone sensors in fact both rmse and r 2 improve as the number of error prone sensors increases we conclude therefore that ked is resistant to and actually benefits from a large number of error prone precipitation measurements it is worthwhile to focus on correlation statistics that display a decrease in variation as the number of error prone sensors grows this is evident from the size of the box and whisker plots the variation in r 2 decreases somewhat for ked at the 100 and 200 error prone fig 13 panels c and d densities ked shows a more pronounced decrease in the variation of rmse fig 14 panel d at the highest density of error prone this result is also evident in the scatter plot fig 12 panel d the regression line tightly matches the one one 45 slope yet the dispersion of points decreases with more error prone observations among the kriging based algorithms ked displays a good match to the ideal slope and intercept values with a slope almost as high as mfb and intercept very near to zero thus ked achieves the best local adjustment as well as good correction for bias and even improves with a large number of error prone sensors these results are in good agreement with goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 berndt et al 2014 and erdin et al 2012 and others who consistently showed that ked achieved better correspondence between adjusted and observed precipitation in parallel research by sinclair and pegram 2005 and kim et al 2007 showed that the condmerge algorithm successfully adjusted weather radar grids in this current work we found that the non linear patterns in the synthetic radar grid are not well adjusted by additive techniques such as condmerge and mixed in constructing the synthetic test framework examination of radar adjustment procedures using different densities of error prone sensors with a range of error levels was made possible past research goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 wang et al 2012 mckee and binns 2016 bruno et al 2014 conducted evaluations of adjustment procedures but using data from a specific gauge and radar network under certain storm events for example work by berg et al 2016 was located in sweden while the recent research by foehn et al 2018 was conducted in switzerland however a generic evaluation framework to the best of our knowledge is lacking this current work attempts to fill that gap by offering such a standardized test framework furthermore two sets of ground based observations were combined in the synthesized framework reliable and error prone with tests for different densities of error prone observations in previous research both foehn et al 2018 and sideris et al 2014 chose co kriging to adjust radar with two sets of ground observations the procedure chosen by sideris et al 2014 merged radar and gauge observations at two time steps but did not address different error levels on the other hand foehn et al 2018 applied co kriging to two independent gauge networks with different levels of reliability the less reliable network in that work consisted of a smaller number of gauges than the reliable network while this current work does not implement co kriging two sets of ground observations one reliable and the other error prone were merged the proportion of error prone sensors in this work was varied up to four times the number of reliable sensors the procedure and results in this work demonstrate that a large number of error prone precipitation observations can be combined with reliable gauge observations and used for radar adjustment the analysis presented is reproducible and configuration parameters can be chosen to match a real world situation application of this method can guide research and operational qpe to chose the optimal mix of reliable and error prone observations and the most appropriate adjustment method the authors are aware of additional parameters that might affect adjustment procedures that are not included in this work topography can both interfere with radar signals through beam blockage and can influence storm intensity by orographic forcing germann et al 2006 discussed the challenges facing weather radar in mountainous regions and xu et al 2017 compared ground based validation of satellite borne radar at different elevation levels yet topography was not taken into account in this work since such effects are very localized no generic synthetic framework could include topography without causing a dramatic local influence on the results the underlying assumption in this work considers the radar rainfall to be corrected for beam blockage and we further assume that the synthetic rain grids already included effects due to orographic forcing furthermore the temporal resolution of radar data compared to gauge or cml data can also negatively influence adjustment efforts as discussed by cristiano et al 2017 emmanuel et al 2012 and marra and morin 2018 radar images capture a single point in time snapshot whereas gauges represent aggregated rainfall over some albeit short time interval it is possible that radar misses a short lived convective storm or that the storm moves between one radar sweep and the next what s more radar views the rain rate aloft while ground based sensors collect precipitation at the surface there could be a time lag between the two introducing additional uncertainty into adjustment algorithms to overcome these temporal effects adjustment parameters are determined and methods are chosen based on very long aggregations of radar and gauge data within the context of this synthetic framework the assumed time resolution was at least one day the initial true rain created as described in section 2 4 was based on 150 realizations of sequential gaussian simulations however the final result was a single true rain grid the evaluations examined only levels of error in the error prone gauges no attempt was made to evaluate various types of storms further research using the synthetic framework presented here could investigate three issues first various types of rain storms could be created by altering the parameters when preparing the initial true rain next different error distributions could be applied to the error prone subset of observations finally additional adjustment algorithms such as co kriging as well as combinations of algorithms could be implemented and compared 5 conclusions this research presented a standardized reproducible test framework that was constructed to analyze adjustment of synthetic weather radar rainfall several adjustment algorithms were applied to the radar by using synthesized ground based observation data representing a mix of reliable and error prone sensors at varying densities then statistical tests were used to validate the success of these algorithms in reconstructing the true rain the framework included configurable parameters density and error level of ground observations and the noise structure of the radar grid results indicate all adjustment procedures perform fairly well in correcting for multiplicative bias the conditional merge performs satisfactorily with addition of error prone observations attaining lower rmse than other additive algorithms kriging with external drift is the most resistant to a high number of error prone observations mean field bias performs fairly well at all densities of error prone correcting only bias as expected but adding some noise variance into the adjusted grid mixed and multiplicative adjustments avoid addition of noise into the adjusted grid but tend to poorer overall correction higher rmse than all other adjustments acknowledgements erick

6302,adjustment of weather radar estimates using observed precipitation has been an accepted procedure for decades ground observations of precipitation typically come from rain gauges but can also include data from diverse networks of sensors with different levels of reliability this study presents a standardized framework for evaluating adjustment algorithms using synthetically constructed but realistic rain grids and weather radar rainfall ground observation points are randomly placed throughout the synthetic storm domain and the precipitation for each sensor is extracted from the true rain then a subset of the sensors are defined as unreliable and a log normal error factor is applied at those locations this double network of rain sensors could be applicable for example when rainfall is derived from signal attenuation between commercial microwave link cml antennas past research has tested cml observations as a source of precipitation data and validated various radar adjustment algorithms however a comprehensive evaluation of adjustment algorithms using accurate gauge data mixed with cml observations at different densities is lacking five adjustment algorithms are applied to the synthetic radar grid mean field bias mfb a multiplicative algorithm mixed additive and multiplicative conditional merge condmerge and kriging with external drift ked generation of the synthetic framework and application of the adjustment algorithms is repeated for 150 realizations comparison of coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error and linear regression for all adjustment procedures over all realizations indicates the following results only mfb and ked adjustments performed well when using accurate gauges the kriging based ked was able to achieve good adjustment also with the addition of error prone sensors condmerge and the mixed and multiplicative however resulted in poorer adjustments keywords weather radar rainfall gauges commercial microwave links synthetic model 1 introduction shortly after weather radar became an accepted source of precipitation data efforts began to improve quantitative precipitation estimates qpe by merging ground based observations for example krajewski 1987 and seo 1998 presented early applications of kriging to correct radar rainfall with gauge data gjertsen et al 2004 explained the advantages and disadvantages of both radar rainfall and gauge observations concluding that proper adjustment of radar rainfall with ground based observations is crucial to achieving accurate qpe work by velasco forero et al 2009 demonstrated a unique non parametric method of determining covariance for the gauge data before applying the kriging interpolations a bayesian approach was introduced by todini 2001 and further developed in mazzetti and todini 2004 co kriging was applied successfully by sideris et al 2014 they prepared an accurate precipitation estimate where the primary variable was gauge observations at one time interval and three additional secondary variables were gauge observations from an earlier time interval and radar values at gauge locations from both time steps a different co kriging approach presented recently by foehn et al 2018 created precipitation estimates using two independent and non collocated gauge networks they preformed inverse distance weighted regression kriging and regression co kriging in all cases they corrected for non stationarity of gauge data by calculating and removing the trend which was produced from residuals between gauges and radar their approach enabled successful qpe for short time intervals in a mountainous region with severe beam blockage of the available radar images some of these techniques were applied operationally by amorati et al 2012 and berg et al 2016 several national meteorological services among them the german deutcher wetterdienst dwd https www dwd de en ourservices radar products radar products html and the royal netherlands meteorological service https data knmi nl datasets publish adjusted weather radar regularly a review of the application of radar rain gauge adjustments across europe appears in gjertsen et al 2004 research papers over the past decade have addressed the ability of commercial microwave link cml attenuation data to represent rain rates and the uncertainty involved signal attenuation from cml antennas and the derived rain rate are impacted by several sources of uncertainty non linear attenuation response distance between antennas interference resulting from water accumulating on the antennas similar to wet radome attenuation in weather radar calibration parameters for the attenuation rain rate relationship microwave frequency drop size distribution in leijnse et al 2010 the authors show that distance between cml antennas becomes a major source of uncertainty at certain microwave frequencies with distant greater than 5 km antennas they point to drop size distribution as the major cause of uncertainty in cml precipitation rates bianchi et al 2013 added data from cml as a second ground based source for radar adjustment in an early work berne and uijlenhoet 2007 described the source of errors in cml derived rain rates more recently van leth et al 2018 carefully analyzed the uncertainties in attenuation of a microwave link at a controlled research installation evaluations of the various adjustment algorithms have appeared in many research papers one of the early assessments was done by goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 since then wang et al 2012 and mckee and binns 2016 have covered a broad selection of the adjustment procedures an overview of adjustment algorithm categories that appears in hasan et al 2016 investigated the issue of error independence between the adjusted and true rain grids ly et al 2013 categorized the various adjustment methods into deterministic and geo statistical they concluded that geo statistical methods out perform deterministic in long temporal aggregations of rainfall synthetic data sets have been employed in climate and meteorology research to address complicated and multivariate systems for example edouard et al 2018 used synthetic data to determine uncertainty in flash flood forecasting they performed a sensitivity analysis by artificially applying a range of soil parameters in a combined modeling framework similarly musayev et al 2018 recently examined the rainwater harvesting potential under several global climate models using synthetically generated daily rainfall a new radar adjustment method combining both gauge and crowd sourced data was presented by yang and ng 2019 their method applied bayesian regression to synthetically produced rain and radar fields as well as synthetically derived gauge and crowd sourced data the aim of this research is to present a standardized fully reproducible framework for determining which adjustment procedures achieve the best correlation to the true rain using varying mixtures of reliable and error prone ground based observations 2 methods the procedure described below created 150 realizations of a synthetic framework by constructing simulated rain grids incorporating a noise component to produce radar grids and randomly distributing observation locations throughout the grid extent this procedure was implemented using r r development core team 2008 software with functions adapted from guenzi et al 2016 nerini et al 2017 and morin and gabella 2007 a uniform random number seed was applied throughout making the procedure fully reproducible 2 1 synthetic framework the synthetic model presented in this work does not attempt to be an exact representation of any real rain event radar data or distribution of gauges rather like any model certain characteristics of reality were distilled to create an analysis framework under which specific aspects of radar adjustments could be examined refer to yang and ng 2019 where similar simplifications were adopted in creating synthetic rain radar and gauge inputs this framework included initial true rain distributions across a predefined grid referred to as the domain the domain size 100 100 km was chosen to represent the range covered by a typical c band radar the temporal resolution was assumed to be 24 h and the accumulated precipitation was chosen under that assumption while operational adjustment of radar is performed on individual radar scans or short aggregations calibration and evaluation of adjustments are applied to long time aggregations following goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 this 24 h aggregation avoids short term effects due to the high temporal variability of rainfall as described in marra and morin 2018 weather radar measurements involve several sources of uncertainty summarized in villarini and krajewski 2010 some of which were encapsulated into the test framework of this work by applying configurable noise structures the true rain grid was multiplied by three spatially varying noise grids fig 1 to simulate the radar grids similarly to the combined uncertainty model suggested by ciach et al 2007 and later by villarini and krajewski 2009b the first was a multiplicative bias level varying radially from the center of the domain assumed to be the location of the radar this noise grid was designed to mimic range degradation fig 1 panel a range degradation results from several unrelated causes increased sampling volume due to the expanding radar beam attenuation from atmospheric moisture or dust and various effects attributed to the vertical profile of reflectivity vpr krajewski et al 2011 and vignal and krajewski 2001 show that vpr effects are the most significant cause of range degradation at long ranges reflectance from melting ice hydrometeors usually at altitudes between 2 and 4 km causes the bright band effect leading to high reflectance at altitudes above the bright band reflectance drops more or less linearly due to the expanding radar beam at lower altitude on the other hand vpr has very little effect on range degradation thus the lowest radar elevation angle will not reach the bright band and not be affected by vpr but at the second and higher radar elevation angles the beam reaches the bright band altitude closer to the radar this current work considers the storm domain to be 100 km 100 km with the radar at the center so the maximum range covered in this simulation is 74 km krajewski et al 2011 show that up to 70 km vpr has no effect on the range dependent error at the lowest elevation angle the second elevation angle has a small effect at 70 km and at the third elevation angle a more substantial effect 20 to 40 error at 50 to 70 km respectively range degradation was split into two zones by sebastianelli et al 2012 they considered the zone near to the radar to be affected mostly by the z r relationship and rain rate with almost no range dependent decrease in radar reflectivity in their study of an s band radar range dependent uncertainly appeared only beyond the 50 km range due to radar beam spread and vertical profile of reflectivity this same two zone approach appeared and was validated also in chumchean et al 2003 both of these works contained a discontinuity in the error model between the zones on the other hand michelson and koistinen 2000 presented a radar degradation relation whereby the log of the gauge radar ratio followed a second order polynomial of range r log g r r r a b r c r 2 expanding on the above studies the range dependent error component in this work was defined as a gaussian function eq 1 also chosen by villarini and krajewski 2009a in their error model thus near the radar antenna the error factor of 1 0 did not incur any change in the true rain and at larger radial distances the error factor decreased following a gaussian curve approximating the two zone range degradation presented above but avoiding discontinuity in the function furthermore a gaussian curve drops more slowly at small ranges than the polynomial used by michelson and koistinen 2000 thus we maintain almost no degradation up to 15 km from the radar then the range degradation error grows to 25 at the maximum range of 70 km refer to panel a of fig 2 to see the slight effect of this error at the corners of the domain 1 err r a e r b 2 2 c 2 where err is the error factor r is the distance from radar a b c are empirical constants chosen to emulate almost no range degradation near the radar a 1 and a gaussian decreasing value b 4 and c 100 such that the error level at the maximum range of 70 km is 0 75 the second radar noise grid was created from a log normally distributed random multiplicative field to represent uncertainty in the power law z r relationship non uniform beam filling non uniform drop size distributions etc the third noise grid was constructed from a spatial structure defined following the methods in nerini et al 2017 the theoretical base for this stochastic method was developed by seed 2002 and implemented in the short term ensemble prediction system steps probabilistic forecast scheme by bowler et al 2006 this spatial structure was derived from the true rain grid thus providing a precipitation dependent error these three radar noise grids once multiplied together contained error values from 0 to above 3 0 thus the resulting radar the product of the true rain and this error grid acquired values both above and below the true rain those introduced error grids are multiplicative in nature and their combination aimed at reproducing realistic observational conditions the noise levels used to create this radar grid and the error levels applied to the simulated error prone observation locations section 2 2 are all configurable allowing construction of uniform and reproducible test frameworks for the various adjustment procedures fig 2 illustrates an example of the resulting radar rainfall 2 2 ground based precipitation sensors two types of ground sensors were simulated in this framework reliable and error prone observation locations were placed randomly throughout the storm domain with 50 reliable gauge locations and three sets of error prone 50 100 and 200 additional locations while gauges actually do sustain errors modern rain rate measuring equipment has reduced the measurement uncertainty to approximately 5 see for example colli et al 2013 thus gauge data were assumed to be accurate in the simulated framework their aggregated precipitation was extracted directly from the initial true grid throughout this work the terms gauges and reliable sensors are used interchangeably in operational weather monitoring gauge networks are quite sparse for a global survey of gauge densities see kidd et al 2017 the influence of gauge density on radar gauge merging was reported by otieno et al 2014 and shafiei et al 2014 further assessed the importance of gauge density and distribution the density of gauges chosen for this work 1 gauge per 200 km 2 attempted to mirror a typical gauge network see further reports by ahrens 2006 tian et al 2018 and otieno et al 2014 the source of error prone observations can be a second less reliable network of gauges alternatively microwave signal attenuation in cml networks has become accepted as a source of point precipitation data fencl et al 2017 goldshtein et al 2009 overeem et al 2013 this current work does not assert that cml derived precipitation is inherently inaccurate however much work has been done to investigate the uncertainty associated with this source of precipitation data i e leijnse et al 2010 zinevich et al 2010 while attenuation data between cml towers represents the aggregated signal strength along the line of sight between towers most research i e overeem et al 2013 and goldshtein et al 2009 simplifies this linear feature into a single observation point at the center between the towers in their analysis of rainfall estimation from cml networks zinevich et al 2010 refer to link lengths from 0 5 to 8 km with increasing uncertainty in longer links the report by overeem et al 2016 covering a long term qpe program in the netherlands discusses an average link length of 3 6 km for over 2000 links in this work the term error prone sensor refers to point observations that could represent the midpoints along cml links this geographic simplification together with other uncertainties see leijnse et al 2010 and additional references in section 1 in cml observations concur in creating the overall cml error however so far no explicit model for such an error is available in this study we chose to use a multiplicative error model in order to i deal with a reduced number of parameters and ii make the model easily adaptable to other remote sensing instruments tian et al 2013 and tang et al 2015 to do so a random log normally distributed multiplicative error has been applied to the true precipitation to simulate error prone observations this error shares the log normal distribution parameters and thus the error magnitude distribution with the multiplicative error used for radar fields but with an independent spatial pattern in each simulation furthermore cml towers are usually installed at high density compared to rain gauges for example chwala et al 2012 report one cml link per 3 km 2 in southern germany therefore cml derived precipitation offers a possible real world case with a mixture of few reliable gauge and many less reliable cml point precipitation sensors locations for error prone data observations were therefore placed at three configurable densities one observation location per 200 km 2 identical to the gauge network one per 100 km 2 and one per 50 km 2 four times as many error prone sensors as reliable thus the densities of reliable and error prone sensors together were 50 reliable only representing rain gauges at 1 gauge per 200 km 2 additional 50 error prone observation locations totaling one observation location per 100 km 2 additional 100 error prone totaling one observation per 66 km 2 additional 200 error prone totaling one observation per 40 km 2 2 3 adjustment procedures this work implemented and tested five adjustment algorithms mean field bias mfb multiplicative mixed conditional merge condmerge and kriging with external drift ked the choice of these five among the full spectrum of adjustment procedures covered the range of both deterministic mfb and geostatistical methods multiplicative condmerge and ked employ variations of kriging implemented with the gstat package pebesma 2004 in r furthermore the mixed procedure allows comparison with an additive bias method and condmerge as explained below also applies an additive spatially varying correction on the other hand mfb and ked adjustments adjust the radar solely by a multiplicative factor 2 3 1 mean field bias the first mfb determines the average multiplicative bias shift between the radar grid and observed precipitation then corrects for that shift globally this is the only adjustment algorithm that applies a correction which does not vary spatially each of the other algorithms calculates a spatially varying correction from the differences between the observation locations and radar pixels at those locations 2 3 2 mixed and multiplicative both the multiplicative and mixed algorithms 1 adapted in this work fromhttps docs wradlib org en stable adjust html 1 that are explained in a technical report pfaff 2010 in german apply spatially varying corrections by interpolating the residuals between radar and sensors at the sensor locations using ordinary kriging multiplicative adjustment interpolates a correction grid by ordinary kriging of the residuals between the observation locations and the radar grid the radar grid is multiplied by this correction grid to obtain the adjusted result the mixed algorithm works similarly but determines two correction grids an additive component and a multiplicative component the adjusted grid results from multiplying the radar by the multiplicative factor then adding the additive component 2 3 3 conditional merge the condmerge algorithm initially introduced by sinclair and pegram 2005 and implemented by guenzi et al 2016 applies ordinary kriging to two different point sets the values of the true rain grid at gauge locations and the values of the radar grid at those locations the adjusted grid results from adding to the radar grid the kriging interpolation of the gauges then subtracting the interpolation of the radar values categorizing this procedure as additive in this way the procedure conditions the gauge adjustment by the radar precipitation values at gauge locations this procedure was applied successfully by berndt et al 2014 in addition rabiei and haberlandt 2015 compared conditional merging to kriging with external drift in the context of a new bias correction protocol they reported that conditional merging performed best after applying an initial bias correction 2 3 4 kriging with external drift among the geostatistical adjustment algorithms ked has been applied widely this interpolation method uses a secondary variable the radar precipitation itself in this case to add a trend to the gauge observations in addition to research by berndt et al 2014 and rabiei and haberlandt 2015 cited above schiemann et al 2011 also found that ked attained better correlation to the original rain than ordinary kriging ok methods delrieu et al 2014 further reported that ked out performed ok for twelve rain events in france 2 4 realizations the evaluation in this work was performed on 150 realizations of synthetic data initial true storms radar grids derived from the true rain by applying noise and bias factors and randomly placed ground based sensor locations the true storm grids were created using sequential gaussian simulations sgs similar to the approach used by nour et al 2006 to choose gauge locations and by teo and grimes 2007 sgs was used also by cecinati et al 2018 to create a realistic rainfall simulation they then applied different gauge distributions and error models to that simulation to determine the gauge uncertainty by kriging for uncertain data a method introduced by mazzetti and todini 2008 in this current work a multiplicative error grid was applied to all simulations of true rain to obtain 150 synthesized radar precipitation grids the radar noise structure used to create the radar grids is described in section 2 1 and error levels of ground based sensors in section 2 2 fig 1 shows the error grids and in fig 2 the true and resulting radar grids for one sample realization are shown the five adjustment procedures detailed in section 2 3 were then applied to each realization analysis of the results in section 2 5 calculated the mean values of several correlation statistics for each adjustment the choice of 150 realizations was determined after testing from 10 to 300 iterations coefficients of variation cv the ratio of variance to mean given by cv σ μ for rmse and r 2 were determined and averaged at different numbers of realizations see fig 3 the variation of these statistical measures over the range of realizations stabilized after about 100 realizations a larger number did not substantially change the means of cv for the different test statistics at the four error sensor densities thus 150 realizations was considered sufficient 2 5 analysis of adjustments in order to examine the success of each adjustment algorithm a set of 400 validation points was randomly chosen within the domain this number resulted from slovin s formula to select sample size eq 2 2 n samp n 1 n e 2 with e 0 05 confidence level of 95 and n 10 000 total pixels in the domain values of the original true rain and each of the adjusted grids were extracted at these validation points for all realizations separately and rmse was calculated examining adjustment algorithms in the context of a synthesized test framework insured that results were uniform and reproducible each adjustment was applied to all 150 rain realizations and with four densities of error prone observation locations then average coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse as well as linear regression slope and intercept between the adjusted grids and the initial true storm were calculated and examined table 1 presents mean statistics for each of these tests initially in order to justify use of a linear regression two tests were applied to check for normality of residuals anderson darling and shapiro wilk the p values of both were very small 10 6 supplying evidence that the null hypothesis of normality should be rejected therefore a box cox transform box and cox 1964 was applied to the set of adjusted values this transform was used by both erdin et al 2012 and cecinati et al 2016 in the context of kriging based radar adjustment the optimal box cox λ parameter was determined then the transformed data were again tested for normality repeating the anderson darling test as well as homoscedasticity using the breusch pagan test implemented in the car package in r fox and weisberg 2011 these tests showed p values above 0 2 for all realizations breusch pagan p values above 0 08 thus rejection of the null hypothesis was not suggested at a confidence level of 95 and preconditions for linear analysis were upheld visual examination of q q plots for a few realizations reinforced this conclusion then r 2 and rmse were obtained from linear regressions of the box cox transformed distributions to compare values of the true and adjusted rain grids at the validation locations 3 results three sets of figures are presented below first images of the adjusted rain grids appear for certain representative adjustment procedures mfb condmerge and ked figs 4 6 each figure includes adjustment results for all four densities of error prone observations these images show that the higher density of error prone sensors panels d in each figure are somewhat more speckled whereas the gauges only images panels a more closely resemble the true rain refer to fig 2 the next group figs 7 12 show scatter plots of true versus adjusted precipitation at the 400 validation points note that these plots represent the original precipitation value before the box cox transform explained above in 2 5 again each adjustment procedure appears four times for all densities of reliable error prone locations scatter plots in which the spread of points and thus the regression line approaches the 45 slope represent successful adjustment additionally those scatter plots where dispersion of the points grows compared to the unadjusted plot i e compare fig 7 to fig 8 indicate cases where the adjustment actually adds additional noise to the result the third set of figures box whisker plots of correlation statistics best reveals the success of adjustment all four statistics are presented r 2 rmse slope and intercept of the fitted linear regression line figs 13 16 these plots show the mean values of each statistic averaged over 150 realizations as well as first and third quartiles at the height of the boxes the whisker lines extend to 1 5 iqr inter quartile range and outliers appear as orange dots the height of the boxes and length of the whiskers give a clear representation of the variance of each statistic across all realizations rmse values that appear in fig 14 with a low mean indicate successful adjustment and short whisker lines mirror the dispersion of points in the scatter plots results of all correlation statistics averaged over 150 realizations appear in table 1 4 discussion the intention in this work was to demonstrate a reproducible synthetic test framework for evaluating weather radar adjustment procedures and to spotlight cases where additional error prone precipitation observations improve adjustment the framework was constructed from multiple realizations of a synthetic rain grid using sgs by choosing a large enough number of realizations we ensured that no single rain or error distribution would skew the results due to randomization effects configurable parameters for radar noise structure and four combinations of reliable and error prone sensors from zero error prone to four times as many error prone as reliable were applied to complete the synthetic framework the resulting radar grids were adjusted by five algorithms mfb mixed multiplicative condmerge and ked then values of the true rain and adjusted precipitation grids were extracted at 400 validation points means of several statistics comparing the adjusted and true rain were then calculated results were analyzed at two levels localized and domain wide higher r 2 values and lower rmse occur when there is a good average match at validation points between the true rain and the adjusted values the closeness of slope and intercept to the 45 one one line reveals adjustment methods that achieve good bias correction at the domain scale however when the slope nears 1 0 45 but the intercept does not go through zero then multiplicative bias is corrected but not additive bias thus methods with lower rmse results are considered to attain better local adjustment to the true rain slope values near 1 0 show good multiplicative bias correction and if the intercept is also close to zero then additive bias is also corrected from the scatter plots clearly only two adjustment algorithms improved correspondence between the true rain and adjusted grids mfb and ked referring to the unadjusted scatter plot fig 7 we note a somewhat high slope and intercept value far from zero this is expected due to the error fields applied to the true rain the shift of regression lines in all adjustments closer to the 45 slope demonstrates correction of the multiplicative bias however scatter plots of the adjustments show some increased dispersion of the points referring to the slope box whisker plots fig 15 the height of the boxes and whisker lines especially for the mfb and ked adjustments demonstrate this dispersion the algorithms introduce additional noise into the adjusted grid while correcting the overall bias conversely the mixed multiplicative and condmerge algorithms did not cause this added noise their scatter plots and box whisker plots of slope and intercept are more compact however the slope and intercept values for these adjustments are farther from the ideal furthermore the mixed and multiplicative adjustments show slightly higher rmse values and lower r 2 figs 14 and 13 than the ked adjustment also evident in the summary table 1 we therefore determine that mixed multiplicative and condmerge perform satisfactorily at the local scale avoiding additional noise in the correction procedure but at the price of somewhat poorer overall correction of multiplicative bias condmerge displays similar but slightly better results with rmse lower than both mixed and multiplicative especially with the addition of error prone sensors yet the slope and intercept values of condmerge are not as good as mfb so this conditioning algorithm reaches a good compromise with higher r 2 lower rmse but at the price of poorer bias correction interestingly the mfb adjustment achieves rmse lower than the unadjusted grid for all densities of error prone locations the slope is slightly nearer to 45 and the intercept close to zero these results reflect the fact that mfb applies a domain wide uniform correction of bias thus it is adjusting for multiplicative but not additive bias we also note a slight compression of the size of the slope and intercept box whisker plots for mfb with higher density of error prone observations so this adjustment can gain somewhat from additional error prone sensors the lowest rmse values for all densities of error prone sensors appear in the ked adjusted grid since ked takes into account radar values at the validation locations as the secondary trend variable this result is expected furthermore ked shows the highest r 2 among all methods and at all densities of error prone sensors in fact both rmse and r 2 improve as the number of error prone sensors increases we conclude therefore that ked is resistant to and actually benefits from a large number of error prone precipitation measurements it is worthwhile to focus on correlation statistics that display a decrease in variation as the number of error prone sensors grows this is evident from the size of the box and whisker plots the variation in r 2 decreases somewhat for ked at the 100 and 200 error prone fig 13 panels c and d densities ked shows a more pronounced decrease in the variation of rmse fig 14 panel d at the highest density of error prone this result is also evident in the scatter plot fig 12 panel d the regression line tightly matches the one one 45 slope yet the dispersion of points decreases with more error prone observations among the kriging based algorithms ked displays a good match to the ideal slope and intercept values with a slope almost as high as mfb and intercept very near to zero thus ked achieves the best local adjustment as well as good correction for bias and even improves with a large number of error prone sensors these results are in good agreement with goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 berndt et al 2014 and erdin et al 2012 and others who consistently showed that ked achieved better correspondence between adjusted and observed precipitation in parallel research by sinclair and pegram 2005 and kim et al 2007 showed that the condmerge algorithm successfully adjusted weather radar grids in this current work we found that the non linear patterns in the synthetic radar grid are not well adjusted by additive techniques such as condmerge and mixed in constructing the synthetic test framework examination of radar adjustment procedures using different densities of error prone sensors with a range of error levels was made possible past research goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 wang et al 2012 mckee and binns 2016 bruno et al 2014 conducted evaluations of adjustment procedures but using data from a specific gauge and radar network under certain storm events for example work by berg et al 2016 was located in sweden while the recent research by foehn et al 2018 was conducted in switzerland however a generic evaluation framework to the best of our knowledge is lacking this current work attempts to fill that gap by offering such a standardized test framework furthermore two sets of ground based observations were combined in the synthesized framework reliable and error prone with tests for different densities of error prone observations in previous research both foehn et al 2018 and sideris et al 2014 chose co kriging to adjust radar with two sets of ground observations the procedure chosen by sideris et al 2014 merged radar and gauge observations at two time steps but did not address different error levels on the other hand foehn et al 2018 applied co kriging to two independent gauge networks with different levels of reliability the less reliable network in that work consisted of a smaller number of gauges than the reliable network while this current work does not implement co kriging two sets of ground observations one reliable and the other error prone were merged the proportion of error prone sensors in this work was varied up to four times the number of reliable sensors the procedure and results in this work demonstrate that a large number of error prone precipitation observations can be combined with reliable gauge observations and used for radar adjustment the analysis presented is reproducible and configuration parameters can be chosen to match a real world situation application of this method can guide research and operational qpe to chose the optimal mix of reliable and error prone observations and the most appropriate adjustment method the authors are aware of additional parameters that might affect adjustment procedures that are not included in this work topography can both interfere with radar signals through beam blockage and can influence storm intensity by orographic forcing germann et al 2006 discussed the challenges facing weather radar in mountainous regions and xu et al 2017 compared ground based validation of satellite borne radar at different elevation levels yet topography was not taken into account in this work since such effects are very localized no generic synthetic framework could include topography without causing a dramatic local influence on the results the underlying assumption in this work considers the radar rainfall to be corrected for beam blockage and we further assume that the synthetic rain grids already included effects due to orographic forcing furthermore the temporal resolution of radar data compared to gauge or cml data can also negatively influence adjustment efforts as discussed by cristiano et al 2017 emmanuel et al 2012 and marra and morin 2018 radar images capture a single point in time snapshot whereas gauges represent aggregated rainfall over some albeit short time interval it is possible that radar misses a short lived convective storm or that the storm moves between one radar sweep and the next what s more radar views the rain rate aloft while ground based sensors collect precipitation at the surface there could be a time lag between the two introducing additional uncertainty into adjustment algorithms to overcome these temporal effects adjustment parameters are determined and methods are chosen based on very long aggregations of radar and gauge data within the context of this synthetic framework the assumed time resolution was at least one day the initial true rain created as described in section 2 4 was based on 150 realizations of sequential gaussian simulations however the final result was a single true rain grid the evaluations examined only levels of error in the error prone gauges no attempt was made to evaluate various types of storms further research using the synthetic framework presented here could investigate three issues first various types of rain storms could be created by altering the parameters when preparing the initial true rain next different error distributions could be applied to the error prone subset of observations finally additional adjustment algorithms such as co kriging as well as combinations of algorithms could be implemented and compared 5 conclusions this research presented a standardized reproducible test framework that was constructed to analyze adjustment of synthetic weather radar rainfall several adjustment algorithms were applied to the radar by using synthesized ground based observation data representing a mix of reliable and error prone sensors at varying densities then statistical tests were used to validate the success of these algorithms in reconstructing the true rain the framework included configurable parameters density and error level of ground observations and the noise structure of the radar grid results indicate all adjustment procedures perform fairly well in correcting for multiplicative bias the conditional merge performs satisfactorily with addition of error prone observations attaining lower rmse than other additive algorithms kriging with external drift is the most resistant to a high number of error prone observations mean field bias performs fairly well at all densities of error prone correcting only bias as expected but adding some noise variance into the adjusted grid mixed and multiplicative adjustments avoid addition of noise into the adjusted grid but tend to poorer overall correction higher rmse than all other adjustments acknowledgements erick

streamflow stations being used in the current research 2 3 singular value decomposition svd svd is a powerful statistical tool for identifying coupled relationships between two spatial temporal fields bretherton et al 1992 provides a detailed discussion of the theory of svd while tootle et al 2008 and tootle and piechota 2006 provide a brief description of svd as applied in the current research table 2 initially a matrix of standardized ao sst anomalies and a matrix of standardized streamflow anomalies were developed the time dimension of each matrix i e 65 years must be equal while the spatial component i e ao sst cells and streamflow stations can vary in dimension the cross covariance matrix was then computed for the two spatial temporal matrices and svd was applied to the cross covariance matrix and physical information regarding the relationship between the two was obtained the resulting svd of the cross covariance matrix created two matrices of singular vectors and one matrix of singular values the singular values were ordered such that the first singular value 1st mode was greater than the second singular value and so on bretherton et al 1992 defines the squared covariance fraction scf as a useful measurement for comparing the relative importance of modes in the decomposition each singular value was squared and divided by the sum of all the squared singular values to produce a fraction or percentage of squared covariance for each mode finally the two matrices of singular vectors were examined generally referred to as the left i e ao ssts matrix and the right i e streamflow matrix the first column of the left matrix 1st mode was projected onto the standardized ao ssts anomalies matrix and the first column of the right matrix 1st mode was projected onto the standardized streamflow anomalies matrix this resulted in the 1st temporal expansion series of the left and right fields respectively the left heterogeneous correlation values for the 1st mode were determined by correlating the ao sst values of the left matrix with 1st temporal expansion series of the right field and the right heterogeneous correlation values for the 1st mode were determined by correlating the streamflow values of the right matrix with the 1st temporal expansion series of the left field utilizing a approach similar to rajagopalan et al 2000 and uvo et al 1998 heterogeneous correlation figures displaying significant correlation values for ao ssts were developed for each predictor season jfmamj amjjas and jasond similarly significant streamflow stations for each predictor season were also identified while svd is a powerful tool for the statistical analysis of two spatial temporal fields there exist several limitations to its use that should be investigated newman and sardeshmukh 1995 generally if the leading 1st 2nd 3rd modes explain a significant amount of the variance of the two fields then svd can be applied to determine the strength of the coupled variability present newman and sardeshmukh 1995 however when using svd to examine two fields the examiner must exhibit caution when attempting to explain the physical cause of the results newman and sardeshmukh 1995 3 results 3 1 svd analysis the cumulative scf for the first three modes was above 90 in all cases jfmamj amjjas jasond generally if the leading three modes explain a significant greater than 80 amount of the variance between the two fields then svd can be applied to determine the strength of the coupled variability present newman and sardeshmukh 1995 therefore svd can and has been applied successfully in the current research efforts the results of this study show that the majority of the variability in the data is explained in the 1st mode the 1st mode square covariance fractions scf ranged from 81 to 85 for the jfmamj amjjas and jasond predictor periods given that the overwhelming majority of the variability was explained in the first mode only results for the first mode were provided 3 1 1 ao ssts and seus streamflow three maps jfmamj amjjas and jasond were developed for the 1st mode and the ao sst region 99 significance was highlighted in grey fig

vast majority of unimpaired streamflow stations for each season were also significant 3 2 seus ao sst index for each of the three predictor periods jfmamj amjjas and jasond cells were identified with in the grey zone which exceeded 99 9 significance a time series 1951 2015 was developed in which the standardized sst for each cell selected was averaged for each year thus a yearly 1951 2015 svd sst index for seus streamflow was developed for each predictor period jfmamj amjjas and jasond this svd sst index 1951 2015 was then compared to standardized unfiltered yearly streamflow average for twenty six stations from 1952 to 2016 to assess the decadal to multi decadal signals in the svd sst index and the average annual streamflow data a 20 year filter was applied to all data fig 4 when correlating the 20 year filtered svd sst index for each predictor period jfmamj amjjas and jasond with 20 year filtered seus streamflow average for 26 stations the variance r2 explained was 93 91 and 90 respectively the r2 value reflects the relationship between the 20 year filtered data seasonal svd sst indices and average annual streamflow for 26 gages the results clearly show the warming trend in ao ssts that began in the 1980 s coincides with a rapid decline in seus streamflow thus svd validated a multi decadal teleconnection between north atlantic ocean ssts and seus streamflow a further investigation of the seasonal svd sst indices and each streamflow station at a yearly resolution revealed highly significant relationships for the jfmamj svd sst predictor period 81 of the gages achieved a significance of 95 p 0 05 while 69 of the gages achieved a significance of 99 p 0 01 for the amjjas svd sst predictor period 85 of the gages achieved a significance of 95 p 0 05 while 65 of the gages achieved a significance of 99 p 0 01 for the jasond svd sst predictor period 81 of the gages achieved a significance of 95 p 0 05 while 62 of the gages achieved a significance of 99 p 0 01 thus the svd sst indices developed for each predictor period season were highly correlated with individual streamflow gages for the various 6 3 and 0 month lead times while the relationship between atlantic ocean ssts and se streamflow response clearly exhibits a multi decadal pattern the yearly relationship was very encouraging and may provide predictive skill in long lead time forecasting of streamflow in this region 4 discussion 4 1 climatic drivers of seus streamflow decline was the recent decline in seus streamflow predicted amo pdo and united states water resources including streamflow have been investigated for the southeastern united states tootle et al 2004 wang and asefa 2017 engström and waylen 2018 maleski and martinez 2018 when evaluating water year unimpaired streamflow from 1952 to 2002 an amo signal was identified in the southeast united states such that the amo cold warm phase was associated with increased decreased streamflow tootle et al 2004 engström and waylen 2018 further identified that both amo and enso conditions had the strongest influence in the fall corresponding to the dry season in southern states amplifying water shortage the amo began shifting from a cold to warm phase during the early 1990 s and was considered to be in a warm phase beginning around 1996 trenberth and fasullo 2017 it should be noted the amo warm phase appeared to peak around 2008 and the peak was the highest in the observed record 1870 to present trenberth and fasullo 2017 thus the amo warm phase which is associated with decreased moisture in the southeast united states appears to coincide with the recent southeast united states streamflow record lows within the observed record and the magnitude of the amo warm phase appears to mirror that of the southeast united states decrease tootle et al 2005 confirmed an amo signal in seus streamflow in which the warm cold phase of the amo results in decreased increased streamflow furthermore it also confirmed an enso signal in seus streamflow in which cold la nina warm el nino results in decreased increased streamflow the coupling of amo warm and enso warm la nina also showed significant decreases in seus streamflow tootle et al 2005 stated that given the current amo warm phase the development of a la nina could severely impact decreased streamflow i e drought in the southeastern united states while the current svd analysis confirms the teleconnection of a multi decadal north atlantic perhaps amo like sst pattern with seus streamflow and a plausible explanation of the multi decadal decline in seus streamflow was the extraordinary decline in seus streamflow since 2000 enhanced by multiple la nina events five la nina events 2000 2007 2008 2010 and 2011 have occurred since 2000 for the twenty six seus streamflow stations the average annual deficit streamflow measured in standard deviations of annual flow for the five la nina events was 1 02 with a range of 0 38 to 1 43 thus from 2000 to 2016 17 years the five la nina years resulted in an average cumulative deficit of just over five standard deviations of annual streamflow volume spatially the decline in annual streamflow was consistent across the twenty six gage seus region when evaluating the cumulative deficit of streamflow measured in standard deviations of annual flow since 2000 2000 2016 all twenty six gages displayed deficit flows table 1 johnson et al 2013 evaluated climate signals in the apalachicola chattahoochee flint acf river basin which encompasses a large region of the seus while their study was limited to pre defined pacific ocean and atlantic ocean indices e g nino 3 4 amo they confirmed a similar coupling effect of amo and enso in seus streamflow as tootle et al 2005 since enso specifically la nina type conditions are a known driver for droughts within the southeastern united states with a cycle of 2 3 years via modulating moisture flux transport kam and sheffield 2016 the combination of warm phase of the amo a cool phase of the pdo and la nina conditions would likely result in enhanced drought conditions within the southeastern united states as noted in mccabe et al 2004 and tootle et al 2005 and observed within the recent record of historically low flows within the southeastern united states forecasting the end to the recent decrease in southeast united states streamflow is very uncertain if as indicated by the svd analysis amo warm phase is enhancing la nina conditions resulting in the recent historically low streamflow in the southeastern united states the extent and magnitude of the current amo phase may provide some predictive information the preceding amo cold phase around 1965 1995 was approximately 30 years in length while the amo warm phase around 1925 1965 preceding the cold phase was approximately 40 years in length given that the current amo warm phase began around 1995 we would anticipate that the amo enhancement of weak to moderate la nina years would end between 2025 and 2035 4 2 paleo perspectives on recent seus streamflow declines paleo reconstructions using tree ring proxies of streamflow in the southeast united states are relatively limited in this region however they by and large indicate that the instrumental period is not representative of the full range of natural variability extremes of both hydrological drought and pluvial periods of greater duration and magnitude than those observed in the 20th century are common and the influence of large scale circulation features generally do not appear to be consistent through time e g stahle and cleaveland 1992 cook et al 2007 seager et al 2009 pederson et al 2012 harley et al 2017 ho et al 2017 maxwell et al 2017 however both the work by stahle and cleaveland 1992 and maxwell et al 2017 suggest that the north atlantic subtropical high nash has a strong influence on precipitation in the southeast the nash is a circulation anomaly embedded within the amo and warm cold amo conditions lead to weakening strengthening of the nash that in turns leads to drier wetter conditions over north america in general and particularly in the eastern united states during the warm season also see hu et al 2011 the findings by stahle and cleaveland 1992 and maxwell et al 2017 suggest that the association between the current warm amo and streamflow decreases in southeast united states streamflow over the past two decades identified in our analysis may be consistent over longer periods than can be identified in the observational record future work will necessitate an expanded network of paleo reconstructions of streamflow throughout the seus to place the impact of ssts within the observed record into a long term context allowing for a more complete understanding of the influence of both high and low frequency large scale climate teleconnections within the region 5 conclusions recent streamflow declines drought conditions and population growth have resulted in water conflicts between several of the southern states bearden and andreen 2017 with half of the interstate water conflict cases currently pending before the supreme court are in the seus low streamflow will remain one of the top water policy issues to watch in the seus water resources spectrum necessitating the need for better understanding of the climatic drivers of low streamflow throughout the region the current research utilizing raw ao sst datasets confirmed a strong teleconnection with seus streamflow and thus a likely explanation of the historic decline of seus streamflow in the multi decadal warming of north atlantic ssts enhanced by multiple la nina events since 2000 the seus ao sst index developed for the jfmamj six month lead time the amjjas three month lead time and jasond zero month lead time may prove useful in long lead time forecasting of seus streamflow and will likely increase forecast model skill when compared to using pre defined indices such as the

thought reserved only for the western u s has now resulted in water wars among several southern states bearden and andreen 2017 population growth throughout the seus including major cities such as atlanta and states such as florida has stressed a once abundant resource streamflow decreased streamflow and the resulting water shortages also catapulted three states alabama florida and georgia into

filed sept 25 2013 bearden and andreen 2017 thus there are concerns amongst water managers planners governments and stakeholders regarding the potential cause s of these recent decreases twenty six unimpaired lins 2012 streamflow stations were identified in the seus fig 1 table 1 and calendar year streamflow was standardized i e mean of zero and standard deviation of one for the period of 1952 to 2016 a twenty year filter i e moving average was then applied to each station the yearly twenty year end year filter values 1971 2016 for each station were then displayed with uncertainty fig 2 fig 2 clearly displays a multi decadal decline in seus streamflow beginning around 1990 with the most recent year in the period of study 2016 being the lowest 20 year filtered value in the observed record given anthropogenic influences are negligible due to the selection of unimpaired streamflow stations understanding the drivers of the climatic variability in the seus is the key to determining the cause of this multi decadal decline in streamflow recognition of the influence of enso on climate in the seus has long been established with el nino la nina generally associated with increased decreased moisture kahya and dracup 1993 with strong seasonal influence well documented within the literature wang and asefa 2017 engström and waylen 2018 maleski and martinez 2018 mccabe et al 2004 evaluated the coupling of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo and attributed more than 50 of the united states spatial and temporal variance in multi decadal drought frequency to the pdo and amo they found that the amo warm phase was associated with seus drought and was enhanced when coupled with a pdo warm phase in evaluating the amo impact on rainfall enfield et al 2001 determined that most of the united states has less than normal rainfall during the amo warm phase when correlating the north atlantic oscillation nao with spring precipitation in southeastern coastal states stahle and cleaveland 1992 did not identify a signal this lack of an nao signal in the seus was later confirmed by tootle et al 2005 when evaluating continental u s streamflow leathers et al 1991 associated the pacific north american pna pattern with seus temperature but a significant correlation was not identified with precipitation furthermore recent work by engstrom and waylen 2018 showed patterns of nao and pna in addition to arctic oscillation varied over the short term with significant yet temporally variable influence while also confirming the

the gages achieved a significance of 99 p 0 01 for the jasond svd sst predictor period 81 of the gages achieved a significance of 95 p 0 05 while 62 of the gages achieved a significance of 99 p 0 01 thus the svd sst indices developed for each predictor period season were highly correlated with individual streamflow gages for the various 6 3 and 0 month lead times while the relationship between atlantic ocean ssts and se streamflow response clearly exhibits a multi decadal pattern the yearly relationship was very encouraging and may provide predictive skill in long lead time forecasting of streamflow in this region 4 discussion 4 1 climatic drivers of seus streamflow decline was the recent decline in seus streamflow predicted amo pdo and united states water resources including streamflow have been investigated for the southeastern united states tootle et al 2004 wang and asefa 2017 engström and waylen 2018 maleski and martinez 2018 when evaluating water year unimpaired streamflow from 1952 to 2002 an amo signal was identified in the southeast united states such that the amo cold warm phase was associated with increased decreased streamflow tootle et al 2004 engström and waylen 2018 further identified that both amo and enso conditions had the strongest influence in the fall corresponding to the dry season in southern states amplifying water shortage the amo began shifting from a cold to warm phase during the early 1990 s and was considered to be in a warm phase beginning around 1996 trenberth and fasullo 2017 it should be noted the amo warm phase appeared to peak around 2008 and the peak was the highest in the observed record 1870 to present trenberth and fasullo 2017 thus the amo warm phase which is associated with decreased moisture in the southeast united states appears to coincide with the recent southeast united states streamflow record lows within the observed record and the magnitude of the amo warm phase appears to mirror that of the southeast united states decrease tootle et al 2005 confirmed an amo signal in seus streamflow in which the warm cold phase of the amo results in decreased increased streamflow furthermore it also confirmed an enso signal in seus streamflow in which cold la nina warm el nino results in decreased increased streamflow the coupling of amo warm and enso warm la nina also showed significant decreases in seus streamflow tootle et al 2005 stated that given the current amo warm phase the development of a la nina could severely impact decreased streamflow i e drought in the southeastern united states while the current svd analysis confirms the teleconnection of a multi decadal north atlantic perhaps amo like sst pattern with seus streamflow and a plausible explanation of the multi decadal decline in seus streamflow was the extraordinary decline in seus streamflow since 2000 enhanced by multiple la nina events five la nina events 2000 2007 2008 2010 and 2011 have occurred since 2000 for the twenty six seus streamflow stations the average annual deficit streamflow measured in standard deviations of annual flow for the five la nina events was 1 02 with a range of 0 38 to 1 43 thus from 2000 to 2016 17 years the five la nina years resulted in an average cumulative deficit of just over five standard deviations of annual streamflow volume spatially the decline in annual streamflow was consistent across the twenty six gage seus region when evaluating the cumulative deficit of streamflow measured in standard deviations of annual flow since 2000 2000 2016 all twenty six gages displayed deficit flows table 1 johnson et al 2013 evaluated climate signals in the apalachicola chattahoochee flint acf river basin which encompasses a large region of the seus while their study was limited to pre defined pacific ocean and atlantic ocean indices e g nino 3 4 amo they confirmed a similar coupling effect of amo and enso in seus streamflow as tootle et al 2005 since enso specifically la nina type conditions are a known driver for droughts within the southeastern united states with a cycle of 2 3 years via modulating moisture flux transport kam and sheffield 2016 the combination of warm phase of the amo a cool phase of the pdo and la nina conditions would likely result in enhanced drought conditions within the southeastern united states as noted in mccabe et al 2004 and tootle et al 2005 and observed within the recent record of historically low flows within the southeastern united states forecasting the end to the recent decrease in southeast united states streamflow is very uncertain if as indicated by the svd analysis amo warm phase is enhancing la nina conditions resulting in the recent historically low streamflow in the southeastern united states the extent and magnitude of the current amo phase may provide some predictive information the preceding amo cold phase around 1965 1995 was approximately 30 years in length while the amo warm phase around 1925 1965 preceding the cold phase was approximately 40 years in length given that the current amo warm phase began around 1995 we would anticipate that the amo enhancement of weak to moderate la nina years would end between 2025 and 2035 4 2 paleo perspectives on recent seus streamflow declines paleo reconstructions using tree ring proxies of streamflow in the southeast united states are relatively limited in this region however they by and large indicate that the instrumental period is not representative of the full range of natural variability extremes of both hydrological drought and pluvial periods of greater duration and magnitude than those observed in the 20th century are common and the influence of large scale circulation features generally do not appear to be consistent through time e g stahle and cleaveland 1992 cook et al 2007 seager et al 2009 pederson et al 2012 harley et al 2017 ho et al 2017 maxwell et al 2017 however both the work by stahle and cleaveland 1992 and maxwell et al 2017 suggest that the north atlantic subtropical high nash has a strong influence on precipitation in the southeast the nash is a circulation anomaly embedded within the amo and warm cold amo conditions lead to weakening strengthening of the nash that in turns leads to drier wetter conditions over north america in general and particularly in the eastern united states during the warm season also see hu et al 2011 the findings by stahle and cleaveland 1992 and maxwell et al 2017 suggest that the association between the current warm amo and streamflow decreases in southeast united states streamflow over the past two decades identified in our analysis may be consistent over longer periods than can be identified in the observational record future work will necessitate an expanded network of paleo reconstructions of streamflow throughout the seus to place the impact of ssts within the observed record into a long term context allowing for a more complete understanding of the influence of both high and low frequency large scale climate teleconnections within the region 5 conclusions recent streamflow declines drought conditions and population growth have resulted in water conflicts between several of the southern states bearden and andreen 2017 with half of the interstate water conflict cases currently pending before the supreme court are in the seus low streamflow will remain one of the top water policy issues to watch in the seus water resources spectrum necessitating the need for better understanding of the climatic drivers of low streamflow throughout the region the current research utilizing raw ao sst datasets confirmed a strong teleconnection with seus streamflow and thus a likely explanation of the historic decline of seus streamflow in the multi decadal warming of north atlantic ssts enhanced by multiple la nina events since 2000 the seus ao sst index developed for the jfmamj six month lead time the amjjas three month lead time and jasond zero month lead time may prove useful in long lead time forecasting of seus streamflow and will likely increase forecast model skill when compared to using pre defined indices such as the amo providing a critical tool in the fight to sustain water resources in the seus now and into the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

6304,the role of preferential flow through unsaturated saprock fractured bedrock with weathering restricted to fracture margins in hillslope hydrology remains inadequately described to address this issue ground penetrating radar gpr controlled infiltration and high frequency subsurface moisture monitoring were integrated to characterize saprock preferential flow spf in the susquehanna shale hills critical zone observatory in pennsylvania u s a in a planar hillslope with shallow fractured shale bedrock starting at 0 1 0 3 m below ground two pulses of water 79 5 l in total were released followed by time lapse gpr surveys differentiating gpr images collected before and after infiltration revealed lateral spf in the direction of bedding plane fractures near the infiltration trench but with limited development of spf down gradient along the hillslope this was confirmed by soil and saprock moisture monitoring at a soil pit 0 2 m downslope of the gpr grid where only one out of fifteen probes responded to the controlled infiltration lateral spf frequently occurred at the gpr grid during a 24 day period with ten rainfall events especially under the wet initial conditions additional infiltration experiments in a convex hillslope and a nearby bare slope with exposed saprock demonstrated the impact of fracture patterns on the routing of spf three types of spf in hillslope hydrology were identified including 1 vertical percolation 2 exfiltration from saprock to soil and 3 stormwater transported downslope from planar and convex hillslopes to concave hillslopes a 3d fill and spill

flow refers to the enhanced flux of fluid gas and solutes through preferred pathways in a porous medium e g macropores root channels animal burrows and cracks in the soil thereby bypassing a large portion of the porous system fluhler et al 1996 gerke 2006 numerous studies have demonstrated the significant impacts of pf on environmental quality and ecosystem services in various soils and landscapes including translation of rainfall into runoff soil erosion hillslope stability streamflow generation groundwater contamination and agricultural production beven and germann 1982 clothier et al 2008 beven and germann 2013 various methods have been established to characterize pf processes across space time scales such as at the pore to core scales by computed tomography ct at the core to pedon scales by breakthrough curve dye staining and x ray scanning and at the hillslope to catchment scales by geophysical imaging and soil moisture monitoring via sensor networks allaire et al 2009 despite advancements in describing understanding and modeling pf at the pore to pedon scales investigating pf at larger scales that are more directly relevant to management e g hillslope to landscape scales however has been lagging jarvis et al 2016 guo and lin 2018 suggested that the magnitude and spatial pattern of pf are regulated by interactions among soil architecture soil properties landscape setting and land use land cover which change with seasonal soil wetness conditions and water input characteristics compared with the extensively studied relationship between pf processes and local soil attributes e g lin 2010 the effects of landscape and geological settings on pf processes at the hillslope and catchment scales remains inadequately described and understood guo et al 2018 graham and lin 2011 and liu and lin 2015 used soil moisture monitoring data from a sensor network and showed that in a headwater catchment pf was more frequent at the hilltop and valley than in hillslopes and more frequent in concave hillslopes than in planar hillslopes the substantial influence of topography on pf patterns was also shown for a hilly catchment with weakly structured loamy soils zehe and fluhler 2001 a watershed with variable topography anderson et al 2010 a semi arid watershed with long slopes van schaik 2009 and for hillslopes with undulating topography roulier and jarvis 2003 gerke et al 2015 besides surface topography the critical role of bedrock topography in pf process at the hillslope scale has been demonstrated in steep upland areas e g freer et al 2002 hopp et al 2011 noguchi et al 1999 for example mcdonnell et al 1996 reported that bedrock topography closely resembled the spatial variation of saturation along the hillslope and flow dynamics monitored at the trench in the panola mountain in georgia u s a hillslopes often have a variably weathered bedrock zone between the soil cover and the fresh bedrock salve et al 2012 rainwater can travel as pf through unsaturated weathered bedrock before encountering the intact bedrock anderson et al 1997 montgomery et al 1997 although the theory of flow through saturated fractures has undergone much development e g therrien and sudicky 1996 understanding pf in unsaturated fractures commonly occurring in steep soil mantled hillslopes with substantial depths to the water table is still evolving berkowitz 2002 tokunaga and wan 1997 this is due to the complexity of the weathered bedrock such as high anisotropy and multi component nature and multiscale behavior of the fracture system neuman 2005 therefore the role of unsaturated weathered bedrock in large scale pf processes and hillslope hydrology e g hydrological connectivity between the hillslope and the valley needs continuous studies hencher 2010 some efforts have been pursued to enhance the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for pf through unsaturated fractures based on laboratory experiments persoff and pruess 1995 suggested that steady state flow conditions were not easily achieved in fractures because of the capillary effects and the viscous flow induced pressure drop further tokunaga and wan 1997 suggested that even unsaturated rough walled large aperture fractures were contributing to flow with film flow as the primary mechanism for rapid unsaturated pf through the fracture network monitoring of controlled irrigation over an 860 m2 catchment in the mettman ridge in oregon u s a indicated that nearly all runoff passed the shallow weathered bedrock through the fractures in the exfoliation zone which increased the velocity of subsurface flow and led to higher water tables after storms anderson et al 1997 montgomery et al 1997 the interplay between the flow in the shallow colluvial soils and near surface fractured bedrock significantly influenced the saturation pattern along the hillslope runoff production and positive pore pressures anderson et al 1997 montgomery et al 1997 moreover dye staining patterns using a strongly absorbing tracer revealed percolation through the fractured bedrock frazier et al 2002 nobles et al 2010 using a minimally absorbing dye visualized downslope pf in the shallow weathered bedrock graham et al 2010 noguchi et al 1999 the dye stained areas indicated that the joint fractures were often interconnected via smaller fractures and sometimes connected to soil macropores forming a complex pf network nobles et al 2010 noguchi et al 1999 field hydrometric observations and subsurface lateral flow collection demonstrated the prevalence of pf through unsaturated fractures in steep forested catchments with thin soil mantles that affected the mean residence times chemical weathering flow routing and storm runoff haria and shand 2004 kelln et al 2009 kosugi et al 2006 salve et al 2012 explored the recharge process in a steep hillslope with a thick layer of unsaturated weathered and fractured argillite and suggested the moisture stored in the fractures constituted an essential moisture reservoir based on a review of previous studies they summarized that the proportion of the amount of the runoff that traveled along unsaturated fracture dominated flow pathways to total storm runoff ranged from 14 to 95 salve et al 2012 they also raised some fundamental questions that remained unresolved such as under what conditions pf through unsaturated fractures could dominate the hydrology regime in the subsurface salve et al 2012 the increasing availability of geophysical techniques has opened new opportunities to address these questions by mapping and monitoring the spatial pattern and temporal dynamics of pf in the field hencher 2010 for example by combining time lapse electrical resistivity tomography ert and simulated rainfall mixed with chloride and bromide travelletti et al 2012 examined the infiltration process in a clay shale slope and identified pf along the fissures in the landslide material composed of weathered black marls doolittle et al 2012 compared ground penetrating radar gpr images collected before and after controlled infiltration in a headwater catchment and distinguished pf pathways through the shallow fractured bedrock in the same catchment repeated gpr investigations revealed seasonal dynamics of moisture distribution in shallow fractured shale likely driven by pf in unsaturated fractures zhang et al 2014 because the fracture properties are significantly impacted by in situ fluid distribution and stress conditions that are challenging to reproduce in the laboratory neuman 2005 suggested geophysical techniques as the promises for the field investigation of pf through unsaturated fractures compared with traditional methods geophysical techniques usually non invasive and repeatable provide information on both subsurface structures and subsurface flow dynamics steelman et al 2012 guo et al 2014 parsekian et al 2015 the relationship between subsurface structure and hydrological processes is considered the forefront of multiphase flow research armstrong et al 2016 therefore to enhance the field investigation of pf through unsaturated fractures in saprock spf and better understand the controls occurrence and dynamics of spf this study combines time lapse geophysical surveys controlled infiltration and high frequency moisture monitoring in soil and saprock in steep hillslopes with near surface fractured shale bedrock an established conceptual model of subsurface runoff generation is then tested and refined to describe the roles of spf in subsurface hydrology at the hillslope and catchment scales this study indicates that the mechanisms responsible for spf are important in the further development of critical zone hydrology 2 study site experiments were conducted in the shaver s creek watershed in central pennsylvania fig 1 this region is underlain by a silurian gray shale with a few interbedded ca rich carbonate zones known as the rose hill shale formation folk 1960 ma et al 2013 the shale bedrock is highly weathered and fractured with folded and faulted bedding planes oriented ne sw n54oe dipping 25 to 76 to the nw jin et al 2010 the climate is typical of the inland northeastern u s with a mean annual air temperature of 10 c and mean annual precipitation of 1070 mm west et al 2013 three experimental sites were selected including two at the susquehanna shale hills critical zone observatory sshczo and one in a nearby bare slope fig 1a b the sshczo 40 39 87 n 77 54 40 w is a small 7 9 ha forested catchment characterized by the low lying fractured shale of the valley and ridge physiographic province an ephemeral first order stream flows west into the shaver s creek watershed site a is located in the

transition zone from soil to highly fractured shale fig 1d between the soil cover and the intact bedrock i e the relatively unfractured and chemically unaltered parent material there is a layer

surface fig 1c bedding planes are evident on the surface extending from ne to sw fracture cleavage has produced some pencil like fragments up to 30 cm long 3 methods and the tested conceptual model 3 1 moisture monitoring in soil and saprock controlled infiltration and time lapse gpr at site a a gpr grid 3 0 m 0 9 m consisting of ten parallel survey lines with a 0 1 m interval was established perpendicular to the slope gradient at site a fig 2 a both ends of each survey line were anchored into the ground by plastic stakes to ensure the reproducibility of the radargrams i e that they were collected over the same line in repeated gpr surveys an infiltration trench 1 m long 0 2 m wide 0 2 m deep and a soil pit 1 m long 0 3 m wide 0 35 m deep were dug perpendicular to the slope 0 2 m upslope and 0 2 m downslope of the gpr grid respectively fig 2a a total of fifteen soil moisture probes ech2o 5te manufactured by meter group inc pullman wa were installed on the pit face at three depths corresponding to the a horizon bw horizon and the saprock and five more were installed in the infiltration trench fig 2b after the infiltration trench and soil pit were refilled the moisture probes remained at site a for 24 days from july 17th to august 8th 2012 when the local soils were seasonally transitioning from a wet stage to a dry stage due to increasing et lin 2006 ten natural rainfall events were recorded during this period the initiation of a new rainfall event was defined when 1 mm rainfall fell at least three hours after the end of the last event the end of an event was defined when 1 mm rainfall fell within three hours graham and lin 2011 liu and lin 2015 rainfall data 10 min resolution were obtained from an automatic weather station fig 1b controlled infiltration experiments were performed on four days july 17th 19th 21st and 22nd each infiltration experiment with two pulses of water injection regular tap water was added to the infiltration trench by pumping it into a 0 9 m long pvc pipe with a diameter of 8 cm and a horizontal slot running its length and both ends sealed by plastic caps a constant head of 0 1 m above the bottom of the infiltration trench was maintained no overland flow occurred throughout the infiltration experiment on each of the experiment days 53 l of water was released in the first pulse of infiltration on july 17th and 19th another 53 l of water was released in the second pulse of infiltration and on july 21st and 22nd 26 5 l of water was released in the second pulse the occurrence of lateral spf was defined when the deepest probe installed in the fractured shale responded to rainfall earlier than both of the shallower probes along five monitoring columns fig 2b when rainwater infiltrates into the subsurface it should pass the upper horizons before percolating to a deeper horizon therefore when the deepest probe responds earlier than the probes above it rainwater likely has traveled via lateral spf pathways from upslope and bypassed the shallower layers lin and zhou 2008 the occurrence of lateral pf through the soil was defined when the middle depth probe responded earlier than the other two probes the sequential flow sf was assigned to indicate a sequential moisture response with increasing depth i e likely reflecting uniform infiltration while a non response event indicated that moisture increase was less than 0 002 m3 m3 hardie et al 2013 wiekenkamp et al 2016 rainfall characteristics duration amount and intensity and the initial wetness state were compared to determine conditions that are favorable for the generation of lateral spf after rainfall time lapse gpr was coupled with the controlled infiltration on july 21st two gpr surveys were conducted to obtain the initial subsurface conditions before water injection on the experiment day table 1 five repeated gpr surveys were conducted after the first infiltration and four more after the second infiltration table 1 and fig 3 a mala proex gpr system abem mala geoscience mala sweden with two types of shielded antenna 500 and 800 mhz was used the first and the eighth surveys were conducted using the 500 mhz antenna 216 samples per trace at a time step of 0 1163 ns for a total record length of 25 12 ns and the other surveys were collected by the 800 mhz antenna 280 samples per trace at a time step of 0 0873 ns for a total record length of 24 44 ns a survey wheel triggered gpr data collection at every centimeter along the survey lines the velocity of the gpr wave 0 0765 m ns in the subsurface was calibrated by hammering a steel plate into the saprock zone at a known depth in a nearby soil pit running a gpr scan over the metal reflector and picking the corresponding arrival time in the radargram to enhance the signal to noise ratio and the clarity of the radargrams collected in the field the following post processing steps were performed 1 aligning the first breaks across the traces and first arrival time zero adjustment 2 dc drift removal by detrending and dewow filtering 3 inverse amplitude gain established using the pre wetting data to compensate gpr energy attenuation with propagation depth for all time lapse gpr data 4 bandpass filtering to remove both the high frequency and low frequency noise and 5 background removal to wipe off antenna reverberation these steps were performed with reflex win 7 2 sandmeier scientific software karlsruhe germany identification of pf pathways was based on the detection of amplitude fluctuations between repeated gpr radargrams e g holden 2004 the repeated radargrams collected over the same survey line were standardized into the same dimension the signatures of lateral spf were distinguished based on the identification of areas with a strong increase in signal amplitude in the post wet radargrams i e signals with amplitudes greater than two standard deviations of the mean amplitude on the differenced radargrams the corresponding lateral spf signatures were connected in neighboring survey lines to reconstruct the possible lateral spf pathways gpr data post processing radargram standardization lateral spf signature identification and flow pathway recovery followed the established protocol of guo et al 2014 3 2 controlled infiltration at sites b and c additional infiltration experiments were carried out at sites b and c to assess the influence of fracture patterns on the routing of spf a monitoring soil pit 1 2 m long 0 5 m wide 0 9 m deep was opened perpendicularly to the slope length at site b in july 2016 two infiltration trenches 0 6 m long 0 2 m wide 0 15 m deep were dug 0 4 m and 1 0 m upslope of the pit respectively perpendicular to the slope length and centered at the pit face first 53 l of tap water was infiltrated through the upper trench two hours later an additional 53 l of water was injected through the other trench the timing and location of the breakthrough of spf on the pit face were recorded and photographed controlled infiltration experiment at site c was conducted in july 2014 a perforated pvc pipe 1 m long and with a diameter of 8 cm was set up at the ridge top perpendicular to slope gradient as a line source a total of 53 l of tap water was poured directly on the saprock surface a terrestrial lidar trimble tx5 3d laser scanner trimble inc ca usa was used to take time lapse images to record flow dynamics on the saprock surface after water was released the lidar images were also used to measure the orientation of the bedding planes and the length and direction of flow pathways on the saprock surface 3 3 the fill and spill model the fill and spill model was developed to describe the generation of stormflow in steep hillslopes which suggests that rainwater accumulates in depressions at the bedrock surface and once the depressions are filled water spills over the micro topographic relief and triggers downslope lateral pf above the fresh bedrock surface tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 follow up studies e g graham et al 2010 mcdonnell 2013 burt and mcdonnell 2015 demonstrated the potential of this 2d model as a hypothesis toward a generalizable characterization of hillslope hydrology given the potentially broad applicability of the fill and spill model additional field investigations are valuable it is also of importance to further enhance the fill and spill mechanism into 3d to better represent subsurface flow processes including possible subsurface water transport perpendicular to the slope gradient 4 results 4 1 the frequency of lateral spf occurrence subsurface moisture dynamics measured in the infiltration trench and soil pit at site a for 24 days are shown in fig 4 a for the infiltration experiment on july 17th none of the fifteen moisture probes responded to water injection fig 4b for the other three infiltration experiments including the one integrated with time lapse gpr only one moisture probe p12 captured the arrival of the infiltration water fig 4b indicating a consistent lateral spf pathway forming only near p12 the lag time between the initiation of infiltration and the response time of the moisture probe was shorter in later infiltration experiments i e reducing from 3 5 to 1 5 h fig 4b this might be caused by the wetter pre infiltration conditions that promoted fast water transportation via the lateral spf pathway major infiltration types in response to rainfall input are summarized in table 2 the identification of lateral spf is illustrated in fig 4c of the total of 50 scenarios 5 monitoring columns 10 events 23 scenarios indicated the occurrence of lateral spf thus the average frequency of lateral spf was 46 during the monitoring period for events no 2 and 10 all of the monitoring columns indicated lateral spf occurrence events no 1 and 7 triggered the formation of lateral spf in four out of five columns however no lateral spf was identified for events no 4 6 and 8 whereas pf through the soil prevailed after event no 6 and sf dominated event no 8 therefore a wet initial condition and a low rainfall intensity likely promoted the generation of lateral spf a dry initial condition and a medium rainfall intensity triggered pf in the soil and a dry initial condition and a high rainfall intensity triggered the fast vertical percolation which led to a sequential response with depth table 2 4 2 the pathways and development of lateral spf time lapse radargrams collected by the 500 mhz antenna at site a are compared before infiltration and 5 min after the 2nd infiltration along survey lines 2 5 and 9 to represent the distribution of the lateral spf signatures identified in the upslope midslope and downslope survey lines respectively fig 5 the gpr signal attenuated at depths 0 8 m due to fractures in the saprock and the inherent conductivity of the shale the interpreted soil saprock interface is characterized by a clear transition from signals with a low level of scattering to enlarged signal scattering fig 5 the soil depth to saprock estimated in the radargrams 0 10 to 0 25 m is consistent with field observations fig 1d some continuous reflections are visible in radargrams indicated by the black dashed lines which agree with the strike direction of the bedding planes seen in the excavation fig 1d reported in nyquist et al 2018 these continuous reflections are reproducible in radargrams collected after infiltration fig 5 in comparison with the pre wet condition signal amplitude in the radargram of survey line 2 0 3 m downslope of the infiltration trench showed an overall increase after the 2nd infiltration fig 5a b indicating a generally wetter saprock due to the arrival of infiltration water however the radargrams of survey lines 5 and 9 0 6 and 0 9 m downslope of the infiltration trench respectively showed a limited signal increase after infiltration fig 5c f this suggests that the overall distribution of moisture in saprock has remained relatively unchanged however some isolated areas with a strong increase in signal amplitude appeared after infiltration fig 5d and f indicating the occurrence of lateral spf time lapse radargrams collected by the 800 mhz antenna are compared before infiltration 15 min after the 1st infiltration and 15 min after the 2nd infiltration fig 6 the 800 mhz radargrams captured more detailed subsurface structures than those collected with the 500 mhz antenna which helped identify lateral spf for all of the selected survey lines 2 5 and 9 radargrams collected after the 1st infiltration showed a limited overall increase in signal amplitude with only a few isolated areas of increased amplitude fig 6b and e this suggests that after the 1st infiltration only limited infiltration water reached the upslope portion of the gpr grid and the development of lateral spf was limited no area with a strong signal increase was observed in the radargram of survey line 9 suggesting no water moved to the downslope portion of the gpr grid after the 1st infiltration fig 6h more areas with a strong amplitude increase appeared after the 2nd infiltration especially in survey line 2 indicating the formation and development of lateral spf fig 6c however only a few localized areas with a strong amplitude increase were visible in the radargrams of survey lines 5 and 9 fig 6f and i this suggests the limited development of the downslope lateral spf that extended throughout the gpr grid even after the 2nd infiltration the areas with strong amplitude increase in the 800 mhz radargrams fig 6c f and i are consistent with those identified in the 500 mhz radargrams fig 5b d and f the correspondence between different antenna frequencies provides support for the use of gpr to locate subsurface areas with moisture changes and pf pathways by connecting the corresponding signatures between the neighboring survey lines we tried to identify the possible pathways of lateral spf the gpr derived lateral spf pathways forming 15 min after the 1st infiltration and 15 min after the 2nd infiltration are shown in fig 7 after the 1st infiltration only two lateral spf pathways extended from the infiltration trench to survey line 3 i e 0 4 m downslope of the infiltration trench and no lateral spf pathway extended throughout the gpr grid this indicates a limited extent of the downslope lateral spf fig 7a a short lateral spf pathway was identified in the middle of the survey grid from survey line 5 to line 7 the water converging to this spf pathway was likely deeper 0 8 m deep than the effective detection range of the gpr used more lateral spf pathways were identified 15 min after the 2nd infiltration but were mainly restricted to survey lines 1 to 3 fig 7b two more pathways appeared between survey lines 9 and 10 however the strength of the lateral spf signals in the downslope survey lines fig 6i was weaker than those in the upslope survey lines fig 6c suggesting a reduced magnitude of lateral spf at the downslope area of the gpr grid fig 7b even after the 2nd infiltration no complex lateral spf network was identified suggesting that the bulk of the infiltration water percolated vertically downward near the infiltration trench fig 7 also indicates that the direction of the lateral spf pathways was tilting to the left of the survey grid ne sw which is consistent with the orientation of the bedding planes fig 1c and d the lateral spf signatures revealed in survey line 2 indicated by the dashed squares in fig 6c appeared to have a horizontal extension which supports the lateral water movement along the bedding orientation these results suggest that in addition to vertical percolation lateral spf pathways likely channeled water along the fractures between the bedding planes and thus the amount of water that entered into the gpr survey grid was limited figs 6 and 7 only one out of the fifteen probes p12 1 3 m downslope of the infiltration trench showed a quick increase 1 5 volumetric moisture content after the 2nd infiltration fig s1 the water arriving p12 might travel along the lateral spf pathway identified in the middle of survey lines 9 and 10 fig 7b all of the other probes showed a relatively constant moisture value during time lapse gpr fig s1 suggesting that the bulk of the infiltration water did not reach the monitoring soil pit this supports the limited development of downslope lateral spf derived from geophysical images 4 3 fracture patterns control the routing of spf the breakthrough of lateral spf in the monitoring pit after controlled infiltration at site b is illustrated in fig s2 two hours after the end of the infiltration of 53 l water from the infiltration trench 1 0 m upslope of the monitoring pit no breakthrough of lateral spf was observed on the pit face thus the extent of the downslope lateral spf was likely less than 1 m long however 25 min after the 2nd infiltration from another infiltration trench located 0 4 m upslope of the monitoring pit the arrival of lateral spf appeared on the pit face indicated by the wetted areas in fig s2 the locations of lateral spf pathways were mainly concentrated on the lower left part of the pit face meaning that the lateral spf likely followed the cleavage patterns of the saprock which indicated by the white dashed lines in fig s2 has a greater slope gradient than the bedding planes i e the layering patterns of the stratigraphy of the saprock indicated by the black dashed lines in fig s2 the controlled infiltration experiment at site c suggests that the direction of the flow at the fractured shale surface is a component of both the slope gradient and bedding orientation fig 8 lateral spf along the bedding planes oriented ne sw is evident i e relatively perpendicular to the slope gradient the extent of the downslope lateral spf crossing bedding planes at the saprock surface can be up to 4 m long fig 8b because of the strong weathering process at the exposed saprock surface many of the fractures are clogged by fine particles and are less permeable water only infiltrates the saprock surface once it encounters a conducting fracture about 5 m downslope from the infiltration source some isolated wetted surfaces appeared suggesting that water exfiltrated from the fractures back to the surface and triggered the return flow as reported in jin et al 2010 some of the fractures in the saprock were formed by the repeated freeze thaw cycles which close at depth when these fractures are hydraulically connected to a perched water table the lower permeability with depth will generate exfiltration after the fractures are filled with water once the water enters the fracture system the lateral movement along the bedding orientation is more significant than along the slope length fig 8b 5 discussion 5 1 controlling factors of spf through unsaturated fractures three major factors that control the spatial pattern and generation of spf through fractured shale were identified including fracture patterns initial wetness conditions and rainfall characteristics vertical pf through the fractured bedrock and the downslope stormflow above the fresh bedrock have been described e g graham et al 2010 salve et al 2012 this study reveals the lateral displacement of flow in the direction of bedding plane fractures that is relatively perpendicular to the slope length due to the fracture patterns in the sshczo figs 7 and 8 consequently spf through the fractured shale appears somewhat unconstrained by the surface and bedrock topography noguchi et al 1999 the spatial distribution of fractures in the saprock provides a potential mechanism for generating locally elevated pressure heads in the overlying soil layer on steep hillslopes after rainfall anderson et al 1997 because water can exfiltrate from saprock after filling a vertical fracture fig 8b the interaction between flow in shallow soils and near surface fractured bedrock impacts soil saturation patterns soil pore pressures runoff production in hillslopes and possible landslides montgomery et al 1997 when the initial conditions are wet and rainfall intensity is relatively low lateral spf becomes the major infiltration type at the early stage of a rainfall event table 2 under wet conditions moisture can be stored in the fractured bedrock which has been validated in the sshczo by zhang et al 2014 and at other study sites e g salve et al 2012 a small amount of water input could drive water flow through the fracture system given the high hydraulic conductivity of the interconnected fracture system of the weathered bedrock frazier et al 2002 the velocity of pf through the fractures is likely higher than that through the soil layer thus the deepest moisture probe first captured the arrival of the rainwater than the two shallower probes table 2 controlled infiltration also showed that wetter initial conditions promote the formation of lateral spf as indicated by a shorter response time fig 4b lateral pf in the soil becomes the major infiltration type when the initial conditions are drier e g rainfall event no 6 a previous study in the sshczo suggested that the moisture is mostly stored in the soil layer at the dry condition in the planar hillslope than in the saprock zhang et al 2014 therefore more substantial water input is required to overcome the soil storage capacity and initiate spf through the fractured saprock the infiltration of rainwater might flow along the lateral roots distributed in the bw horizon forming lateral pf in the soil after big storms with high intensity and significant accumulation e g event no 8 the moisture probes show a sequential response from shallow to deep indicating vertical percolation of the rainwater throughout the soil layer into the saprock 5 2 subsurface hydrology in contrasting soil landform units revealed by geophysical imaging an earlier time lapse gpr investigation by guo et al 2014 in the sshczo revealed a complex lateral pf network in the deep soils of a concave hillslope after the infiltration of 106 l of water the lateral pf pathways could extend 2 m downslope from the infiltration trench the abundant lateral roots and a less permeable soil layer existing in the deep soil profile in the concave hillslope were considered the main contributors to downslope lateral pf however the infiltration experiments conducted in this study in the planar and convex hillslopes in the sshczo with shallow soils underlain by highly fractured shale bedrock suggested limited development of downslope lateral spf both at the soil saprock interface and within the saprock layer 0 5 m fig 7 a recent study visualized the pathways of lateral spf at site a using a dye tracer nyquist et al 2018 and found that the length of the downslope lateral spf pathway was limited to 0 4 m in the saprock the dye staining patterns provided compelling evidence of the limited extent of downslope lateral spf in the shallow fractured shale in the sshczo in addition to vertical percolation water moved along the bedding planes instead of flowing laterally downslope in the saprock figs 1d and 7 this signifies the considerable influence of the fracture characteristics on subsurface hydrological behaviors since the efficiency of geophysical techniques is dependent on local conditions it is important to integrate different geophysical tools to constrain hydrogeological interpretation in this study a gpr system with two antenna frequencies was adopted to enhance the identification of the pf pathways figs 5 and 6 a lower antenna frequency offers a deeper penetration depth but a lower spatial resolution whereas a higher frequency picks up finer structure details but penetrates shallower combining gpr data collected at a lower frequency and a higher frequency allows a high resolution data with deeper penetration nonetheless the effective detection range of both antenna frequencies used in this study 500 mhz and 800 mhz was less than 0 8 m in contrast in the deep soils in the concave hillslope the same 800 mhz gpr system could provide reliable information as deep as 1 5 m guo et al 2014 a combination of multiple geophysical methods will enhance the characterization of the form function relation in the field e g deiana et al 2008 donohue et al 2015 another potential improvement is to conduct geophysical investigations under active conditions e g after rainfall or irrigation because in subsurface environments with complex structures the overall heterogeneity would likely obscure the identification of flow relevant structures under static conditions angermann et al 2017 jackisch et al 2017 previous gpr work on the planar hillslope a few meters away from the gpr grid established in this study also suggested that the fracture patterns of the saprock became more distinct during the wet season zhang et al 2014 5 3 understanding of the role of spf in subsurface hydrology in the sshczo the following 2d hillslope scale model is proposed to describe the hydrological processes along the slope inclination in hillslopes covered by thin soil mantles with shallow fractured shale in the sshczo and similar areas fig 9 a as well as lateral pf from the planar and convex hillslopes to the concave hillslopes fig 9b after storms rainwater rapidly percolates through the soil layer via vertical pf pathways ① due to the permeability of the saprock only limited downslope flow occurs at the soil saprock interface ② whereas the bulk of the water enters the unsaturated fracture system and travels across the bedding planes ③ percolates via the vertical fractures ④ return flow occurs downslope when the fractures intersect the soil layer ⑤ also if a vertical fracture is connected to a water table and is filled with water water exfiltrates from the saprock back to the overlying soil inducing the return flow and or local soil saturation ⑥ see examples in fig 8b when the percolating water encounters the unweathered bedrock transient water tables might perch at local small depressions ⑦ which can trigger downslope flow above the bedrock surface ⑧ bedrock leakage through the faults recharges groundwater ⑨ and drives deep bedrock flow ⑩ it should be noted that the hydrological processes in the deeper zones i e ⑦ ⑨ are not confirmed in this study the limited penetrating depth of gpr energy used in this study cannot explore these processes in addition to the downslope movement of water in the saprock the shallow fractured shale directs rainwater from the planar and convex hillslopes to the adjacent concave hillslopes ⑫ this is because the bedding orientation is parallel to the topographic contour line in the sshczo figs 1b and 8b an earlier effort of integrating gpr and controlled infiltration experiment in the sshczo also demonstrated the occurrence of lateral spf from the planar hillslope to the concave hillslope doolittle et al 2012 fig 9b in addition to the vertical percolation through the soil and saprock ① and ④ lateral displacement of flow occurs in the soil ⑪ such as when water leaves the fracture system and enters the soil ⑤ in a tree throw which occurred at the transition zone between a planar area and a concave area 10 m away from site a abundant roots were observed between the bedding planes fig s3 these roots can act as pf pathways to channel stemflow into the fracture system johnson and lehmann 2006 and then drive water to converge in the concave hillslope larger amounts of infiltrated rainwater into the permeable weathered bedrock through the extensively developed deep root systems have been previously reported in becker and mcdonnell 1998 the significant lateral rainwater movement from the planar and convex hillslope into the concave hillslope implies a more sizable contributing area of the concave hillslope than that traditionally estimated from the surface topography the exclusion of pertinent flow processes in unsaturated fractured soil saprock environments can lead to inaccurate conceptualizations of stormflow behavior of hillslopes we then upscale the observations from the hillslope scale to the catchment scale to understand the role of spf in catchment hydrology of the sshczo including the 3d fill and spill model fig 10 in the planar and convex hillslopes the development of the downslope lateral flow in the soil and across the bedding planes in the saprock is rather restricted where vertical percolation into the permeable fractured shale is a potentially large component of the hillslope water balance because the bedding orientation is along the topographic contour lines in the sshczo water in the saprock can travel in the direction of bedding plane fractures and converge into the concave hillslopes fig 10a after water enters the concave hillslope with deep and structured soil an extensive flow network develops that directs rainwater downslope fig 10b guo et al 2014 this signifies the important impact of subsurface structures of different soil landform units on the subsurface hydrological behaviors even in the same catchment the original fill and spill model has been proposed to predict the lateral flow above the fresh bedrock with water filling local depressions and then overflowing downslope tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 fig 10c our results suggest the fill and spill behavior also happens when water fills the fractures and flows in the direction of bedding plane fractures fig 8b moreover water exfiltration from the saprock to the soil after filling a fracture indicates another type of fill and spill behavior in the vertical direction fig 8b in a fractured rock context positive pressures can extend downgradient from perched water tables creating temporarily saturated fractures that discharge to the soil therefore spf through the fractured shale demonstrates a 3d fill and spill process which can enhance the description and modeling of stormflow generation in steep hillslopes liu and lin 2015 evaluated pf occurrence across the entire sshczo and indicated that the concave hillslopes have a higher frequency of pf 26 than in the planar and convex hillslopes 18 fig 10d that is to say the concave hillslope has higher hydrologic connectivity than in the planar and convex hillslopes fig 10d this catchment scale pattern of pf distribution supports our conceptual model fig 10a that recognizes the concave hillslope as a critical route to conduct rainwater from the ridgetop to the valley floor the mechanisms responsible for pf through the shallow weathered bedrock are important not only in the further development of critical zone hydrology guo and lin 2016 but also for many practical purposes such as moisture storage in the fractured rock that is important for supporting vegetation growth contaminant transport streamwater chemistry groundwater recharge and hillslope stability anderson et al 1997 frazier et al 2002 tokunaga and wan 1997 6 conclusions time lapse gpr controlled infiltration and high frequency moisture monitoring in soil and saprock were combined to investigate different types of spf through the unsaturated fractured shale in the sshczo time lapse gpr and controlled infiltration in the planar hillslope with a thin soil mantle site a suggested limited development of downslope lateral spf this was confirmed by moisture monitoring at a downslope soil pit site a where only one out of fifteen probes responded to infiltration and an additional infiltration experiment in the convex hillslope with shallow saprock site b where the length of the lateral spf pathway was less than 1 m in addition to following the slope gradient lateral spf pathways derived from time lapse gpr at site a were along the bedding plane fractures this was validated by controlled infiltration in a convex hillslope site b and a nearby bare slope with exposed fractured shale site c rather than the topography of the ground surface and fresh bedrock surface the relic bedding exerted significant control on the routing of spf temporally high frequency moisture monitoring at the gpr grid site a during 24 days with ten rainfall events indicated that lateral spf frequently occurred and the wetter initial condition favored the generation of lateral spf through combining the results obtained from all of the study sites a 2d conceptual model fig 9 is proposed to describe the role of spf in hillslope hydrology which includes exfiltration from saprock to soil and lateral water movement from planar and convex hillslopes to concave hillslopes results of this study suggested that fracture characteristics contribute significantly to subsurface hydrology in steep soil mantled hillslopes with shallow weathered bedrock in addition a 3d fill and spill model fig 10 is proposed for the sshczo and similar areas that recognizes the importance of fractured saprock and concave hillslopes as important flow routes to direct lateral downslope movement of stormwater

6304,the role of preferential flow through unsaturated saprock fractured bedrock with weathering restricted to fracture margins in hillslope hydrology remains inadequately described to address this issue ground penetrating radar gpr controlled infiltration and high frequency subsurface moisture monitoring were integrated to characterize saprock preferential flow spf in the susquehanna shale hills critical zone observatory in pennsylvania u s a in a planar hillslope with shallow fractured shale bedrock starting at 0 1 0 3 m below ground two pulses of water 79 5 l in total were released followed by time lapse gpr surveys differentiating gpr images collected before and after infiltration revealed lateral spf in the direction of bedding plane fractures near the infiltration trench but with limited development of spf down gradient along the hillslope this was confirmed by soil and saprock moisture monitoring at a soil pit 0 2 m downslope of the gpr grid where only one out of fifteen probes responded to the controlled infiltration lateral spf frequently occurred at the gpr grid during a 24 day period with ten rainfall events especially under the wet initial conditions additional infiltration experiments in a convex hillslope and a nearby bare slope with exposed saprock demonstrated the impact of fracture patterns on the routing of spf three types of spf in hillslope hydrology were identified including 1 vertical percolation 2 exfiltration from saprock to soil and 3 stormwater transported downslope from planar and convex hillslopes to concave hillslopes a 3d fill and spill

flow refers to the enhanced flux of fluid gas and solutes through preferred pathways in a porous medium e g macropores root channels animal burrows and cracks in the soil thereby bypassing a large portion of the porous system fluhler et al 1996 gerke 2006 numerous studies have demonstrated the significant impacts of pf on environmental quality and ecosystem services in various soils and landscapes including translation of rainfall into runoff soil erosion hillslope stability streamflow generation groundwater contamination and agricultural production beven and germann 1982 clothier et al 2008 beven and germann 2013 various methods have been established to characterize pf processes across space time scales such as at the pore to core scales by computed tomography ct at the core to pedon scales by breakthrough curve dye staining and x ray scanning and at the hillslope to catchment scales by geophysical imaging and soil moisture monitoring via sensor networks allaire et al 2009 despite advancements in describing understanding and modeling pf at the pore to pedon scales investigating pf at larger scales that are more directly relevant to management e g hillslope to landscape scales however has been lagging jarvis et al 2016 guo and lin 2018 suggested that the magnitude and spatial pattern of pf are regulated by interactions among soil architecture soil properties landscape setting and land use land cover which change with seasonal soil wetness conditions and water input characteristics compared with the extensively studied relationship between pf processes and local soil attributes e g lin 2010 the effects of landscape and geological settings on pf processes at the hillslope and catchment scales remains inadequately described and understood guo et al 2018 graham and lin 2011 and liu and lin 2015 used soil moisture monitoring data from a sensor network and showed that in a headwater catchment pf was more frequent at the hilltop and valley than in hillslopes and more frequent in concave hillslopes than in planar hillslopes the substantial influence of topography on pf patterns was also shown for a hilly catchment with weakly structured loamy soils zehe and fluhler 2001 a watershed with variable topography anderson et al 2010 a semi arid watershed with long slopes van schaik 2009 and for hillslopes with undulating topography roulier and jarvis 2003 gerke et al 2015 besides surface topography the critical role of bedrock topography in pf process at the hillslope scale has been demonstrated in steep upland areas e g freer et al 2002 hopp et al 2011 noguchi et al 1999 for example mcdonnell et al 1996 reported that bedrock topography closely resembled the spatial variation of saturation along the hillslope and flow dynamics monitored at the trench in the panola mountain in georgia u s a hillslopes often have a variably weathered bedrock zone between the soil cover and the fresh bedrock salve et al 2012 rainwater can travel as pf through unsaturated weathered bedrock before encountering the intact bedrock anderson et al 1997 montgomery et al 1997 although the theory of flow through saturated fractures has undergone much development e g therrien and sudicky 1996 understanding pf in unsaturated fractures commonly occurring in steep soil mantled hillslopes with substantial depths to the water table is still evolving berkowitz 2002 tokunaga and wan 1997 this is due to the complexity of the weathered bedrock such as high anisotropy and multi component nature and multiscale behavior of the fracture system neuman 2005 therefore the role of unsaturated weathered bedrock in large scale pf processes and hillslope hydrology e g hydrological connectivity between the hillslope and the valley needs continuous studies hencher 2010 some efforts have been pursued to enhance the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for pf through unsaturated fractures based on laboratory experiments persoff and pruess 1995 suggested that steady state flow conditions were not easily achieved in fractures because of the capillary effects and the viscous flow induced pressure drop further tokunaga and wan 1997 suggested that even unsaturated rough walled large aperture fractures were contributing to flow with film flow as the primary mechanism for rapid unsaturated pf through the fracture network monitoring of controlled irrigation over an 860 m2 catchment in the mettman ridge in oregon u s a indicated that nearly all runoff passed the shallow weathered bedrock through the fractures in the exfoliation zone which increased the velocity of subsurface flow and led to higher water tables after storms anderson et al 1997 montgomery et al 1997 the interplay between the flow in the shallow colluvial soils and near surface fractured bedrock significantly influenced the saturation pattern along the hillslope runoff production and positive pore pressures anderson et al 1997 montgomery et al 1997 moreover dye staining patterns using a strongly absorbing tracer revealed percolation through the fractured bedrock frazier et al 2002 nobles et al 2010 using a minimally absorbing dye visualized downslope pf in the shallow weathered bedrock graham et al 2010 noguchi et al 1999 the dye stained areas indicated that the joint fractures were often interconnected via smaller fractures and sometimes connected to soil macropores forming a complex pf network nobles et al 2010 noguchi et al 1999 field hydrometric observations and subsurface lateral flow collection demonstrated the prevalence of pf through unsaturated fractures in steep forested catchments with thin soil mantles that affected the mean residence times chemical weathering flow routing and storm runoff haria and shand 2004 kelln et al 2009 kosugi et al 2006 salve et al 2012 explored the recharge process in a steep hillslope with a thick layer of unsaturated weathered and fractured argillite and suggested the moisture stored in the fractures constituted an essential moisture reservoir based on a review of previous studies they summarized that the proportion of the amount of the runoff that traveled along unsaturated fracture dominated flow pathways to total storm runoff ranged from 14 to 95 salve et al 2012 they also raised some fundamental questions that remained unresolved such as under what conditions pf through unsaturated fractures could dominate the hydrology regime in the subsurface salve et al 2012 the increasing availability of geophysical techniques has opened new opportunities to address these questions by mapping and monitoring the spatial pattern and temporal dynamics of pf in the field hencher 2010 for example by combining time lapse electrical resistivity tomography ert and simulated rainfall mixed with chloride and bromide travelletti et al 2012 examined the infiltration process in a clay shale slope and identified pf along the fissures in the landslide material composed of weathered black marls doolittle et al 2012 compared ground penetrating radar gpr images collected before and after controlled infiltration in a headwater catchment and distinguished pf pathways through the shallow fractured bedrock in the same catchment repeated gpr investigations revealed seasonal dynamics of moisture distribution in shallow fractured shale likely driven by pf in unsaturated fractures zhang et al 2014 because the fracture properties are significantly impacted by in situ fluid distribution and stress conditions that are challenging to reproduce in the laboratory neuman 2005 suggested geophysical techniques as the promises for the field investigation of pf through unsaturated fractures compared with traditional methods geophysical techniques usually non invasive and repeatable provide information on both subsurface structures and subsurface flow dynamics steelman et al 2012 guo et al 2014 parsekian et al 2015 the relationship between subsurface structure and hydrological processes is considered the forefront of multiphase flow research armstrong et al 2016 therefore to enhance the field investigation of pf through unsaturated fractures in saprock spf and better understand the controls occurrence and dynamics of spf this study combines time lapse geophysical surveys controlled infiltration and high frequency moisture monitoring in soil and saprock in steep hillslopes with near surface fractured shale bedrock an established conceptual model of subsurface runoff generation is then tested and refined to describe the roles of spf in subsurface hydrology at the hillslope and catchment scales this study indicates that the mechanisms responsible for spf are important in the further development of critical zone hydrology 2 study site experiments were conducted in the shaver s creek watershed in central pennsylvania fig 1 this region is underlain by a silurian gray shale with a few interbedded ca rich carbonate zones known as the rose hill shale formation folk 1960 ma et al 2013 the shale bedrock is highly weathered and fractured with folded and faulted bedding planes oriented ne sw n54oe dipping 25 to 76 to the nw jin et al

1 moisture monitoring in soil and saprock controlled infiltration and time lapse gpr at site a a gpr grid 3 0 m 0 9 m consisting of ten parallel survey lines with a 0 1 m interval was established perpendicular to the slope gradient at site a fig 2 a both ends of each survey line were anchored into the ground by plastic stakes to ensure the reproducibility of the radargrams i e that they were collected over the same line in repeated gpr surveys an infiltration trench 1 m long 0 2 m wide 0 2 m deep and a soil pit 1 m long 0 3 m wide 0 35 m deep were dug perpendicular to the slope 0 2 m upslope and 0 2 m downslope of the gpr grid respectively fig 2a a total of fifteen soil moisture probes ech2o 5te manufactured by meter group inc pullman wa were installed on the pit face at three depths corresponding to the a horizon bw horizon and the saprock and five more were installed in the infiltration trench fig 2b after the infiltration trench and soil pit were refilled the moisture

rainfall events were recorded during this period the initiation of a new rainfall event was defined when 1 mm rainfall fell at least three hours after the end of the last event the end of an event was defined when 1 mm rainfall fell within three hours graham and lin 2011 liu and lin 2015 rainfall data 10 min resolution were obtained from an automatic weather station fig 1b controlled infiltration experiments were performed on four days july 17th 19th 21st and 22nd each infiltration experiment with two pulses of water injection regular tap water was added to the infiltration trench by pumping it into a 0 9 m long pvc pipe with a diameter of 8 cm and a horizontal slot running its length and both ends sealed by plastic caps a constant head of 0 1 m above the bottom of the infiltration trench was maintained no overland flow occurred throughout the infiltration experiment on each of the experiment days 53 l of water was released in the first pulse of infiltration on july 17th and 19th another 53 l of water was released in the second pulse of infiltration and on july 21st and 22nd 26 5 l of water was released in the second pulse the occurrence of lateral spf was defined when the deepest probe installed in the fractured shale responded to rainfall earlier than both of the shallower probes along five monitoring columns fig 2b when rainwater infiltrates into the subsurface it should pass the upper horizons before percolating to a deeper horizon therefore when the deepest probe responds earlier than the probes above it rainwater likely has traveled via lateral spf pathways from upslope and bypassed the shallower layers lin and zhou 2008 the occurrence of lateral pf through the soil was defined when the middle depth probe responded earlier than the other two probes the sequential flow sf was assigned to indicate a sequential moisture response with increasing depth i e likely reflecting uniform infiltration while a non response event indicated that moisture increase was less than 0 002 m3 m3 hardie et al 2013 wiekenkamp et al 2016 rainfall characteristics duration amount and intensity and the initial wetness state were compared to determine conditions that are favorable for the generation of lateral spf after rainfall time lapse gpr was coupled with the controlled infiltration on july 21st two gpr surveys were conducted to obtain the initial subsurface conditions before water injection on the experiment day table 1 five repeated gpr surveys were conducted after the first infiltration and four more after the second infiltration table 1 and fig 3 a mala proex gpr system abem mala geoscience mala sweden with two types of shielded antenna 500 and 800 mhz was used the first and the eighth surveys were conducted using the 500 mhz antenna 216 samples

record length of 24 44 ns a survey wheel triggered gpr data collection at every centimeter along the survey lines the velocity of the gpr wave 0 0765 m ns in the subsurface was calibrated by hammering a steel plate into the saprock zone at a known depth in a nearby soil pit running a gpr scan over the metal reflector and picking the corresponding arrival time in the radargram to enhance the signal to noise ratio and the clarity of the radargrams collected in the field the following post processing steps were performed 1 aligning the first breaks across the traces and first arrival time zero adjustment 2 dc drift removal by detrending and dewow filtering 3 inverse amplitude gain established using the pre wetting data to compensate gpr energy attenuation with propagation depth for all time lapse gpr data 4 bandpass filtering to remove both the high frequency and low frequency noise and 5 background removal to wipe off antenna reverberation these steps were performed with reflex win 7 2 sandmeier scientific software karlsruhe germany identification of pf pathways was based on the detection of amplitude fluctuations between repeated gpr radargrams e g holden 2004 the repeated radargrams collected over the same survey line were standardized into the same dimension the signatures of lateral spf were distinguished based on the identification of areas with a strong increase in signal amplitude in the post wet radargrams i e signals with amplitudes greater than two standard deviations of the mean amplitude on the differenced radargrams the corresponding lateral spf signatures were connected in neighboring survey lines to reconstruct the possible lateral spf pathways gpr data post processing radargram standardization lateral spf signature identification and flow pathway recovery followed the established protocol of guo et al 2014 3 2 controlled infiltration at sites b and c additional infiltration experiments were carried out at sites b and c to assess the influence of fracture patterns on the routing of spf a monitoring soil pit 1 2 m long 0 5 m wide 0 9 m deep was opened perpendicularly to the slope length at site b in july 2016 two infiltration trenches 0 6 m long 0 2 m wide 0 15 m deep were dug 0 4 m and 1 0 m upslope of the pit respectively perpendicular to the slope length and centered at the pit face first 53 l of tap water was infiltrated through the upper trench two hours later an additional 53 l of water was injected through the other trench the timing and location of the breakthrough of spf on the pit face were recorded and photographed controlled infiltration experiment at site c was conducted in july 2014 a perforated pvc pipe 1 m long and with a diameter of 8 cm was set up at the ridge top perpendicular to slope gradient as a line source a total of 53 l of tap water was poured directly on the saprock surface a terrestrial lidar trimble tx5 3d laser scanner trimble inc ca usa was used to take time lapse images to record flow dynamics on the saprock surface after water was released the lidar images were also used to measure the orientation of the bedding planes and the length and direction of flow pathways on the saprock surface 3 3 the fill and spill model the fill and spill model was developed to describe the generation of stormflow in steep hillslopes which suggests that rainwater accumulates in depressions at the bedrock surface and once the depressions are filled water spills over the micro topographic relief and triggers downslope lateral pf above the fresh bedrock surface tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 follow up studies e g graham et al 2010 mcdonnell 2013 burt and mcdonnell 2015 demonstrated the potential of this 2d model as a hypothesis toward a generalizable characterization of hillslope hydrology given the potentially broad applicability of the fill and spill model additional field investigations are valuable it is also of importance to further enhance the fill and spill mechanism into 3d to better represent subsurface flow processes including possible subsurface water transport perpendicular to the slope gradient 4 results 4 1 the frequency of lateral spf occurrence subsurface moisture dynamics measured in the infiltration trench and soil pit at site a for 24 days are shown in fig 4 a for the infiltration experiment on july 17th none of the fifteen moisture probes responded to water injection fig 4b for the other three infiltration experiments including the one integrated with time lapse gpr only one moisture probe p12 captured the arrival of the infiltration water fig 4b indicating a consistent lateral spf pathway forming only near p12 the lag time between the initiation of infiltration and the response time of the moisture probe was shorter in later infiltration experiments i e reducing from 3 5 to 1 5 h fig 4b this might be caused by the wetter pre infiltration conditions that promoted fast water transportation via the lateral spf pathway major infiltration types in response to rainfall input are summarized in table 2 the identification of lateral spf is illustrated in fig 4c of the total of 50 scenarios 5 monitoring columns 10 events 23 scenarios indicated the occurrence of lateral spf thus the average frequency of lateral spf was 46 during the monitoring period for events no 2 and 10 all of the monitoring columns indicated lateral spf occurrence events no 1 and 7 triggered the formation of lateral spf in four out of five columns however no lateral spf was identified for events no 4 6 and 8 whereas pf through the soil prevailed after event no 6 and sf dominated event no 8 therefore a wet initial condition and a low rainfall intensity likely promoted the generation of lateral spf a dry initial condition and a medium rainfall intensity triggered pf in the soil and a dry initial condition and a high rainfall intensity triggered the fast vertical percolation which led to a sequential response with depth table 2 4 2 the pathways and development of lateral spf time lapse radargrams collected by the 500 mhz antenna at site a are compared before infiltration and 5 min after the 2nd infiltration along survey lines 2 5 and 9 to represent the distribution of the lateral spf signatures identified in the upslope midslope and downslope survey lines respectively fig 5 the gpr signal attenuated at depths 0 8 m due to fractures in the saprock and the inherent conductivity of the shale the interpreted soil saprock interface is characterized by a clear transition from signals with a low level of scattering to enlarged signal scattering fig 5 the soil depth to saprock estimated in the radargrams 0 10 to 0 25 m is consistent with field observations fig 1d some continuous reflections are visible in radargrams indicated by the black dashed lines which agree with the strike direction of the bedding planes seen in the excavation fig 1d reported in nyquist et al 2018 these continuous reflections are reproducible in radargrams collected after infiltration fig 5 in comparison with the pre wet condition signal amplitude in the radargram of survey line 2 0 3 m downslope of the infiltration trench showed an overall increase after the 2nd infiltration fig 5a b indicating a generally wetter saprock due to the arrival of infiltration water however the radargrams of survey lines 5 and 9 0 6 and 0 9 m downslope of the infiltration trench respectively showed a limited signal increase after infiltration fig 5c f this suggests that the overall distribution of moisture in saprock has remained relatively unchanged however some isolated areas with a strong increase in signal amplitude appeared after infiltration fig 5d and f indicating the occurrence of lateral spf time lapse radargrams collected by the 800 mhz antenna are compared before infiltration 15 min after the 1st infiltration and 15 min after the 2nd infiltration fig 6 the 800 mhz radargrams captured more detailed subsurface structures than those collected with the 500 mhz antenna which helped identify lateral spf for all of the selected survey lines 2 5 and 9 radargrams collected after the 1st infiltration showed a limited overall increase in signal amplitude with only a few isolated areas of increased amplitude fig 6b and e this suggests that after the 1st infiltration only limited infiltration water reached the upslope portion of the gpr grid and the development of lateral spf was limited no area with a strong signal increase was observed in the radargram of survey line 9 suggesting no water moved to the downslope portion of the gpr grid after the 1st infiltration fig 6h more areas with a strong amplitude increase appeared after the 2nd infiltration especially in survey line 2 indicating the formation and development of lateral spf fig 6c however only a few localized areas with a strong amplitude increase were visible in the radargrams of survey lines 5 and 9 fig 6f and i this suggests the limited development of the downslope lateral spf that extended throughout the gpr grid even after the 2nd infiltration the areas with strong amplitude increase in the 800 mhz radargrams fig 6c f and i are consistent with those identified in the 500 mhz radargrams fig 5b d and f the correspondence between different antenna frequencies provides support for the use of gpr to locate subsurface areas with moisture changes and pf pathways by connecting the corresponding signatures between the neighboring survey lines we tried to identify the possible pathways of lateral spf the gpr derived lateral spf pathways forming 15 min after the 1st infiltration and 15 min after the 2nd infiltration are shown in fig 7 after the 1st infiltration only two lateral spf pathways extended from the infiltration trench to survey line 3 i e 0 4 m downslope of the infiltration trench and no lateral spf pathway extended throughout the gpr grid this indicates a limited extent of the downslope lateral spf fig 7a a short lateral spf pathway was identified in the middle of the survey grid from survey line 5 to line 7 the water converging to this spf pathway was likely deeper 0 8 m deep than the effective detection range of the gpr used more lateral spf pathways were identified 15 min after the 2nd infiltration but were mainly restricted to survey lines 1 to 3 fig 7b two more pathways appeared between survey lines 9 and 10 however the strength of the lateral spf signals in the downslope survey lines fig 6i was weaker than those in the upslope survey lines fig 6c suggesting a reduced magnitude of lateral spf at the downslope area of the gpr grid fig 7b even after the 2nd infiltration no complex lateral spf network was identified suggesting that the bulk of the infiltration water percolated vertically downward near the infiltration trench fig 7 also indicates that the direction of the lateral spf pathways was tilting to the left of the survey grid ne sw which is consistent with the orientation of the bedding planes fig 1c and d the lateral spf signatures revealed in survey line 2 indicated by the dashed squares in fig 6c appeared to have a horizontal extension which supports the lateral water movement along the bedding orientation these results suggest that in addition to vertical percolation lateral spf pathways likely channeled water along the fractures between the bedding planes and thus the amount of water that entered into the gpr survey grid was limited figs 6 and 7 only one out of the fifteen probes p12 1 3 m downslope of the infiltration trench showed a quick increase 1 5 volumetric moisture content after the 2nd infiltration fig s1 the water arriving p12 might travel along the lateral spf pathway identified in the middle of survey lines 9 and 10 fig 7b all of the other probes showed a relatively constant moisture value during time lapse gpr fig s1 suggesting that the bulk of the infiltration water did not reach the monitoring soil pit this supports the limited development of downslope lateral spf derived from geophysical images 4 3 fracture patterns control the routing of spf the breakthrough of lateral spf in the monitoring pit after controlled infiltration at site b is illustrated in fig s2 two hours after the end of the infiltration of 53 l water from the infiltration trench 1 0 m upslope of the monitoring pit no breakthrough of lateral spf was observed on the pit face thus the extent of the downslope lateral spf was likely less than 1 m long however 25 min after the 2nd infiltration from another infiltration trench located 0 4 m upslope of the monitoring pit the arrival of lateral spf appeared on the pit face indicated by the wetted areas in fig s2 the locations of lateral spf pathways were mainly concentrated on the lower left part of the pit face meaning that the lateral spf likely followed the cleavage patterns of the saprock which indicated by the white dashed lines in fig s2 has a greater slope gradient than the bedding planes i e the layering patterns of the stratigraphy of the saprock indicated by the black dashed lines in fig s2 the controlled infiltration experiment at site c suggests that the direction of the flow at the fractured shale surface is a component of both the slope gradient and bedding orientation fig 8 lateral spf along the bedding planes oriented ne sw is evident i e relatively perpendicular to the slope gradient the extent of the downslope lateral spf crossing bedding planes at the saprock surface can be up to 4 m long fig 8b because of the strong weathering process at the exposed saprock surface many of the fractures are clogged by fine particles and are less permeable water only infiltrates the saprock surface once it encounters a conducting fracture about 5 m downslope from the infiltration source some isolated wetted surfaces appeared suggesting that water exfiltrated from the fractures back to the surface and triggered the return flow as reported in jin et al 2010 some of the fractures in the saprock were formed by the repeated freeze thaw cycles which close at depth when these fractures are hydraulically connected to a perched water table the lower permeability with depth will generate exfiltration after the fractures are filled with water once the water enters the fracture system the lateral movement along the bedding orientation is more significant than along the slope length fig 8b 5 discussion 5 1 controlling factors of spf through unsaturated fractures three major factors that control the spatial pattern and generation of spf through fractured shale were identified including fracture patterns initial wetness conditions and rainfall characteristics vertical pf through the fractured bedrock and the downslope stormflow above the fresh bedrock have been described e g graham et al 2010 salve et al 2012 this study reveals the lateral displacement of flow in the direction of bedding plane fractures that is relatively perpendicular to the slope length due to the fracture patterns in the sshczo figs 7 and 8 consequently spf through the fractured shale appears somewhat unconstrained by the surface and bedrock topography noguchi et al 1999 the spatial distribution of fractures in the saprock provides a potential mechanism for generating locally elevated pressure heads in the overlying soil layer on steep hillslopes after rainfall anderson et al 1997 because water can exfiltrate from saprock after filling a vertical fracture fig 8b the interaction between flow in shallow soils and near surface fractured bedrock impacts soil saturation patterns soil pore pressures runoff production in hillslopes and possible landslides montgomery et al 1997 when the initial conditions are wet and rainfall intensity is relatively low lateral spf becomes the major infiltration type at the early stage of a rainfall event table 2 under wet conditions moisture can be stored in the fractured bedrock which has been validated in the sshczo by zhang et al 2014 and at other study sites e g salve et al 2012 a small amount of water input could drive water flow through the fracture system given the high hydraulic conductivity of the interconnected fracture system of the weathered bedrock frazier et al 2002 the velocity of pf through the fractures is likely higher than that through the soil layer thus the deepest moisture probe first captured the arrival of the rainwater than the two shallower probes table 2 controlled infiltration also showed that wetter initial conditions promote the formation of lateral spf as indicated by a shorter response time fig 4b lateral pf in the soil becomes the major infiltration type when the initial conditions are drier e g rainfall event no 6 a previous study in the sshczo suggested that the moisture is mostly stored in the soil layer at the dry condition in the planar hillslope than in the saprock zhang et al 2014 therefore more substantial water input is required to overcome the soil storage capacity and initiate spf through the fractured saprock the infiltration of rainwater might flow along the lateral roots distributed in the bw horizon forming lateral pf in the soil after big storms with high intensity and significant accumulation e g event no 8 the moisture probes show a sequential response from shallow to deep indicating vertical percolation of the rainwater throughout the soil layer into the saprock 5 2 subsurface hydrology in contrasting soil landform units revealed by geophysical imaging an earlier time lapse gpr investigation by guo et al 2014 in the sshczo revealed a complex lateral pf network in the deep soils of a concave hillslope after the infiltration of 106 l of water the lateral pf pathways could extend 2 m downslope from the infiltration trench the abundant lateral roots and a less permeable soil layer existing in the deep soil profile in the concave hillslope were considered the main contributors to downslope lateral pf however the infiltration experiments conducted in this study in the planar and convex hillslopes in the sshczo with shallow soils underlain by highly fractured shale bedrock suggested limited development of downslope lateral spf both at the soil saprock interface and within the saprock layer 0 5 m fig 7 a recent study visualized the pathways of lateral spf at site a using a dye tracer nyquist et al 2018 and found that the length of the downslope lateral spf pathway was limited to 0 4 m in the saprock the dye staining patterns provided compelling evidence of the limited extent of downslope lateral spf in the shallow fractured shale in the sshczo in addition to vertical percolation water moved along the bedding planes instead of flowing laterally downslope in the saprock figs 1d and 7 this signifies the considerable influence of the fracture characteristics on subsurface hydrological behaviors since the efficiency of geophysical techniques is dependent on local conditions it is important to integrate different geophysical tools to constrain hydrogeological interpretation in this study a gpr system with two antenna frequencies was adopted to enhance the identification of the pf pathways figs 5 and 6 a lower antenna frequency offers a deeper penetration depth but a lower spatial resolution whereas a higher frequency picks up finer structure details but penetrates shallower combining gpr data collected at a lower frequency and a higher frequency allows a high resolution data with deeper penetration nonetheless the effective detection range of both antenna frequencies used in this study 500 mhz and 800 mhz was less than 0 8 m in contrast in the deep soils in the concave hillslope the same 800 mhz gpr system could provide reliable information as deep as 1 5 m guo et al 2014 a combination of multiple geophysical methods will enhance the characterization of the form function relation in the field e g deiana et al 2008 donohue et al 2015 another potential improvement is to conduct geophysical investigations under active conditions e g after rainfall or irrigation because in subsurface environments with complex structures the overall heterogeneity would likely obscure the identification of flow relevant structures under static conditions angermann et al 2017 jackisch et al 2017 previous gpr work on the planar hillslope a few meters away from the gpr grid established in this study also suggested that the fracture patterns of the saprock became more distinct during the wet season zhang et al 2014 5 3 understanding of the role of spf in subsurface hydrology in the sshczo the following 2d hillslope scale model is proposed to describe the hydrological processes along the slope inclination in hillslopes covered by thin soil mantles with shallow fractured shale in the sshczo and similar areas fig 9 a as well as lateral pf from the planar and convex hillslopes to the concave hillslopes fig 9b after storms rainwater rapidly percolates through the soil layer via vertical pf pathways ① due to the permeability of the saprock only limited downslope flow occurs at the soil saprock interface ② whereas the bulk of the water enters the unsaturated fracture system and travels across the bedding planes ③ percolates via the vertical fractures ④ return flow occurs downslope when the fractures intersect the soil layer ⑤ also if a vertical fracture is connected to a water table and is filled with water water exfiltrates from the saprock back to the overlying soil inducing the return flow and or local soil saturation ⑥ see examples in fig 8b when the percolating water encounters the unweathered bedrock transient water tables might perch at local small depressions ⑦ which can trigger downslope flow above the bedrock surface ⑧ bedrock leakage through the faults recharges groundwater ⑨ and drives deep bedrock flow ⑩ it should be noted that the hydrological processes in the deeper zones i e ⑦ ⑨ are not confirmed in this study the limited penetrating depth of gpr energy used in this study cannot explore these processes in addition to the downslope movement of water in the saprock the shallow fractured shale directs rainwater from the planar and convex hillslopes to the adjacent concave hillslopes ⑫ this is because the bedding orientation is parallel to the topographic contour line in the sshczo figs 1b and 8b an earlier effort of integrating gpr and controlled infiltration experiment in the sshczo also demonstrated the occurrence of lateral spf from the planar hillslope to the concave hillslope doolittle et al 2012 fig 9b in addition to the vertical percolation through the soil and saprock ① and ④ lateral displacement of flow occurs in the soil ⑪ such as when water leaves the fracture system and enters the soil ⑤ in a tree throw which occurred at the transition zone between a planar area and a concave area 10 m away from site a abundant roots were observed between the bedding planes fig s3 these roots can act as pf pathways to channel stemflow into the fracture system johnson and lehmann 2006 and then drive water to converge in the concave hillslope larger amounts of infiltrated rainwater into the permeable weathered bedrock through the extensively developed deep root systems have been previously reported in becker and mcdonnell 1998 the significant lateral rainwater movement from the planar and convex hillslope into the concave hillslope implies a more sizable contributing area of the concave hillslope than that traditionally estimated from the surface topography the exclusion of pertinent flow processes in unsaturated fractured soil saprock environments can lead to inaccurate conceptualizations of stormflow behavior of hillslopes we then upscale the observations from the hillslope scale to the catchment scale to understand the role of spf in catchment hydrology of the sshczo including the 3d fill and spill model fig 10 in the planar and convex hillslopes the development of the downslope lateral flow in the soil and across the bedding planes in the saprock is rather restricted where vertical percolation into the permeable fractured shale is a potentially large component of the hillslope water balance because the bedding orientation is along the topographic contour lines in the sshczo water in the saprock can travel in the direction of bedding plane fractures and converge into the concave hillslopes fig 10a after water enters the concave hillslope with deep and structured soil an extensive flow network develops that directs rainwater downslope fig 10b guo et al 2014 this signifies the important impact of subsurface structures of different soil landform units on the subsurface hydrological behaviors even in the same catchment the original fill and spill model has been proposed to predict the lateral flow above the fresh bedrock with water filling local depressions and then overflowing downslope tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 fig 10c our results suggest the fill and spill behavior also happens when water fills the fractures and flows in the direction of bedding plane fractures fig 8b moreover water exfiltration from the saprock to the soil after filling a fracture indicates another type of fill and spill behavior in the vertical direction fig 8b in a fractured rock context positive pressures can extend downgradient from perched water tables creating temporarily saturated fractures that discharge to the soil therefore spf through the fractured shale demonstrates a 3d fill and spill process which can enhance the description and modeling of stormflow generation in steep hillslopes liu and lin 2015 evaluated pf occurrence across the entire sshczo and indicated that the concave hillslopes have a higher frequency of pf 26 than in the planar and convex hillslopes 18 fig 10d that is to say the concave hillslope has higher hydrologic connectivity than in the planar and convex hillslopes fig 10d this catchment scale pattern of pf distribution supports our conceptual model fig 10a that recognizes the concave hillslope as a critical route to conduct rainwater from the ridgetop to the valley floor the mechanisms responsible for pf through the shallow weathered bedrock are important not only in the further development of critical zone hydrology guo and lin 2016 but also for many practical purposes such as moisture storage in the fractured rock that is important for supporting vegetation growth contaminant transport streamwater chemistry groundwater recharge and hillslope stability anderson et al 1997 frazier et al 2002 tokunaga and wan 1997 6 conclusions time lapse gpr controlled infiltration and high frequency moisture monitoring in soil and saprock were combined to investigate different types of spf through the unsaturated fractured shale in the sshczo time lapse gpr and controlled infiltration in the planar hillslope with a thin soil mantle site a suggested limited development of downslope lateral spf this was confirmed by moisture monitoring at a downslope soil pit site a where only one out of fifteen probes responded to infiltration and an additional infiltration experiment in the convex hillslope with shallow saprock site b where the length of the lateral spf pathway was less than 1 m in addition to following the slope gradient lateral spf pathways derived from time lapse gpr at site a were along the bedding plane fractures this was validated by controlled infiltration in a convex hillslope site b and a nearby bare slope with exposed fractured shale site c rather than the topography of the ground surface and fresh bedrock surface the relic bedding exerted significant control on the routing of spf temporally high frequency moisture monitoring at the gpr grid site a during 24 days with ten rainfall events indicated that lateral spf frequently occurred and the wetter initial condition favored the generation of lateral spf through combining the results obtained from all of the study sites a 2d conceptual model fig 9 is proposed to describe the role of spf in hillslope hydrology which includes exfiltration from saprock to soil and lateral water movement from planar and convex hillslopes to concave hillslopes results of this study suggested that fracture characteristics contribute significantly to subsurface hydrology in steep soil mantled hillslopes with shallow weathered bedrock in addition a 3d fill and spill model fig 10 is proposed for the sshczo and similar areas that recognizes the importance of fractured saprock and concave hillslopes as important flow routes to direct lateral downslope movement of stormwater
