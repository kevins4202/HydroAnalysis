studied by taking 50 ml of chromium solution in conical tubes at ambient temperature the initial ph was varied from 3 to 5 with 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh under agitation all experiments were conducted in duplicate and the average values were used in calculations 2 6 adsorption data analysis to quantify the adsorption capacities of the ppy samples we analyzed the equilibrium adsorption of chromium using the langmuir adsorption model which is given by equation 1 choi et al 2011 1 s α β c 1 α c here s is the mass of solute sorbed per unit mass of adsorbent mg g c is the concentration of the solute in the solution at equilibrium with the mass of the solute sorbed onto the adsorbent mg l β is the maximum mass adsorbed under saturation conditions per unit mass of adsorbent mg g and α is an empirical constant in units of the inverse concentration c l mg 2 7 computational method we carried out first principles calculation based on density functional theory using gaussian 09 with the m06 2x exchange correlation functional and the cc pvtz basis set frisch et al 2009 zhao and truhlar 2008 to model the aqueous environment we added a solvent reaction field using the conductor like polarizable continuum model cpcm the solvent was set as water barone and cossi 1998 cossi et al 2003 a full natural bond orbital nbo analysis was also performed using the nbo 3 1 module glendening et al version 3 1 the adsorbent was modeled as five pentagonal rings containing pyrrolic n atoms and both ends were passivated with hydrogen atoms the optimized configurations were drawn using vesta momma and izumi 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption of chromate in aqueous solutions the four ppy adsorbents were subjected to the equilibrium batch adsorption test for chromium contaminated water with various initial concentrations of chromium the adsorption isotherms of chromium on the ppy samples are shown in fig 1 they are asymptotic nonlinear curves which could be well fitted with a langmuir adsorption isotherm the maximum adsorption capacities β of the samples increased with the pyrrole monomer content to 41 34 cb 50 84 ppy1 76 17 ppy2 165 33 ppy4 and 174 81 mg g ppy6 table 2 note that the adsorption capacity of ppy1 was only slightly different from that of cb which is attributed to the drastic decrease in the specific surface area of ppy1 relative to that of cb table s1 bet surface area fig s1 n2 adsorption desorption isotherm as the monomer content increases the decreasing rate becomes saturated strongly suggesting that the pores in the cb were filled by the pyrrole monomers in exchange of the newly introduced pyrrolic n sites which are possible adsorption sites as shown in section 3 3 the barely increased adsorption capacity of ppy1 indicates that the introduction of pyrrolic n sites was compensated by the aforementioned decrease in the specific surface area note that the further increase in monomer content caused a drastic increase in the adsorption capacity indicating that the generation of adsorption sites overcompensated the aforementioned decrease in the specific surface area and dominated the adsorption capacity the adsorption capacity of the optimized sample ppy6 was far superior to those of a wide variety of conventional adsorbents described in the literature table 1 bhatti et al 2017 padmavathy et al 2016 roque ruiz et al 2016 sakulthaew et al 2017 wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 we will investigate the intriguing mechanism behind such powerful chromate adsorption of ppy in section 3 3 it is well known that the ph varies with the chromate concentration in chromate waste solutions and in lab made chromate solutions as well in addition the ph affects the adsorption as shown herein the adsorption capacity of a ppy sample was obtained from the equilibrium batch test where the equilibrium adsorption at various chromate concentrations was evaluated and plotted against the concentration fig 1 from this plot the maximum adsorption capacity was obtained and used to calculate the adsorption capacity of the ppy sample equation 1 the same process was repeated for each ppy sample with different pyrrole monomer contents thus the effect of ph on a ppy sample is reflected in its equilibrium batch test profile fig 1 and it is important that this reflection be repeated in exactly the same way for each ppy sample in such a fixed environment in which the concentration dependent ph affects the adsorption we observed the effect of the pyrrole monomer content on the adsorption capacity one might regard such an approach as desirable in a practical sense as there was no point in evaluating the ph of the solution and buffering it for optimum adsorption for each ppy sample in the present experiment nevertheless we took an additional approach in which the chromate concentration was fixed while the ph of the ppy sample solution was varied by buffering to isolate the effect of ph on the adsorption capacity at a particular concentration see section 3 3 it is also important that the adsorption mechanism study section 3 3 was heavily based upon this observation in addition to the aforementioned one with the rather practical context 3 2 physical properties of ppy to understand the effect of the ppy monomer content on the adsorption capacity we observed the microstructure of the samples fig 2 shows the tem and eds mapping images of the ppy6 sample before chromate adsorption and fig 2 a indicates the cb ppy core shell structure of the particles the nitrogen distribution in the coating analyzed by eds nitrogen mapping was rather uniform as seen in fig 2 b d the eds mapping images of the other samples are given in fig s2 s4 the uniformity of the ppy coating did not change with the pyrrole monomer content only the coating thickness varied fig s5 polypyrrole thickness vs monomer equivalent fig s6 shows the dsc curve from which one can confirm the polymerization of the pyrrole from the glass transition temperature the dsc curve of the ppy6 sample shows a broad endothermic dip at 95 c which is in agreement with a previously reported value hur et al 2014 fig s7 shows the sem images of the ppy samples the increase in monomer content resulted in an increase in particle size albeit with little change in their shape fig 3 shows the wide scan xps spectra of the ppy samples before adsorption the intensity of the nitrogen related signals increased with the pyrrole to cb ratio fig 4 shows the n 1s xps spectra of the ppy samples before adsorption in which the peaks were deconvoluted into the different nitrogen components the corresponding nitrogen contents are summarized in table 3 these results are used to discuss the adsorption mechanism in section 3 3 the coating of polypyrrole on the ppy samples was also confirmed by the ft ir spectra fig s8 liang et al 2011a 2011b 3 3 mechanism of chromate adsorption on ppy the contents of the various types of nitrogen table 3 in the ppy samples before adsorption were plotted against the pyrrole monomer to carbon black ratio fig 5 and fig s9 which partly indicates that the dominant contribution to the chromate adsorption might come from pyrrolic n rather than from other types of nitrogen this is based on the following observations 1 the content profile of pyridinic n or n oxide do not conform to the maximum adsorption capacity β profile i e the pyridinic n or n oxide content decreased from ppy4 ppy6 and ppy2 ppy4 respectively in contrast to the monotonic increase of β shown in fig s9 while the pyrrolic n content profile monotonically increases in the entire range as seen in fig 5 2 although the graphitic n content profile conformed to the corresponding β profile fig s9 it was unlikely to contribute to the adsorption as its molecular structure does not involve dangling bonds in contrast to that of pyrrolic n which features a dangling bond when deprotonated as will be shown later 3 the pyrrolic n content was much greater than that of other types of n table 3 which also supports pyrrolic n as the favored candidate for adsorption sites we translated the mass content of the various types of nitrogen table 3 in the ppy6 sample after adsorption into the number of nitrogen atoms which we assumed to serve as adsorption sites the results are summarized in table s2 in addition the number of chromate molecules adsorbed on ppy6 was calculated from the measured adsorption capacity to be 9 04 1020 adsorption is assumed to occur exclusively on the surface sites of the ppy layer rather than on sites buried in the bulk the pyrrole coating on cb was a few nanometers thick in the ppy6 sample fig 2 and fig s5 which is orders of magnitude thicker than a monolayer therefore the blindly calculated number of adsorption sites of ppy6 table s2 should be greater than the number of adsorbed chromate molecules i e 9 04 1020 as shown in table s2 the only type of nitrogen that satisfies this requirement is pyrrolic n now that we have shown that the dominant adsorption site was pyrrolic nitrogen we proceed to clarify the possible adsorption reaction paths involving pyrrolic nitrogen fig 6 shows the n 1s xps spectrum of the ppy6 sample after chromate adsorption the cr 2p xps spectra are shown in fig 7 and compared with those of cb two new features are evident in these xps spectra 1 a signal pertaining to a possibly deprotonated pyrrolic cr iii n bond with a bond length of 2 0 å fig 6 see statement s1 further information for the peak identification the cr iii n signal is also present in the cr 2p xps spectra shown in fig 7 b 2 a cr vi signal is present in the spectra fig 7 such features indicate that cr iii and cr vi coexisted in the adsorption product the absence of a cr c peak in the ppy6 spectra in fig 7 b indicates that cr preferred n sites to c sites for chemical bonding with ppy the cr iii n pyrrolic deprotonated bond length is presently unavailable the literature indicated a bond length of 2 0 å for cr2 n and 1 6 å for cr n bonds in bulk crn thin films wu et al 2003 but the nature of the nitrogen atom in the bonds is obviously different from pyrrolic n in the present study we demonstrate that the bond length of cr iii n pyrrolic deprotonated is similar to that of cr n in cr2 n barker et al 1996 wang 2016 by first principles calculation such cr iii n bond formation in the presence of chromate was reminiscent of chromate adsorption on the dangling bonds of onion like carbon olc ko et al 2016 in the presence of a cr vi complex the hydroxyl group on the olc was deprotonated by the jor to yield cr iii which eventually formed a cr c bond ko et al 2016 in the present study we possibly have a similar situation the pyrrolic n might be deprotonated by the jor like reaction to yield cr iii which might eventually form the observed cr n bond to further clarify the aforementioned cr vi cr iii dual adsorption reaction picture with first principles calculation we considered two different adsorbents that contain pyrrolic n and deprotonated pyrrolic n respectively fig 8 a and b based on the xps analysis figs 6 and 7 we set two different types of cr ions the cr vi complex hcro4 and cr iii we carried out full geometry relaxation by placing the two adsorbates at their respective possible adsorption sites on the adsorbent the resulting optimized adsorption structures for cr vi and cr iii are shown in fig 8 c and d respectively as shown in fig 8 c one of the oxygen atoms in hcro4 was stabilized at a distance of 1 80 å from the hydrogen atom in the pyrrolic n which indicated the formation of a hydrogen bond on the other hand in the optimized cr iii structure fig 8 d cr iii formed a covalent bond with the deprotonated pyrrolic n and the resulting cr iii n bond length was 2 06 å which supported the coexisting cr iii adsorption theory proposed in the previous paragraph 3 4 effect of ph on the adsorption of chromate on ppy the ph of the solution might be an important factor in the possible competition between the two adsorption reactions leading to cr vi cr iii dual adsorption wang et al 2015 as the cr iii adsorption involved a reaction similar to the jor whose kinetics are well known to favor a lower ph roque ruiz et al 2016 moreover the ph dependent fractional deprotonation of nhx moieties in aqueous environments is well documented nolting et al 2007 fig 9 shows the n 1s and cr 2p xps spectra of the post adsorption ppy6 samples with three different initial ph values the observed behavior is graphically summarized in fig 10 data summarized in table s3 the adsorption capacity of cr iii indeed favored a lower ph fig 10 a which supports the proposed jor like reaction framework for cr iii adsorption the opposite trend in the cr vi adsorption capacity in fig 10 a was attributed to the additional reaction path proposed above fig 10 b shows the ph dependence of the n 1s core electron binding energy be of pyrrolic n and the full width at half maximum fwhm of the signal recall that the pyrrolic n signal was relevant to cr vi adsorption while the cr n signal was relevant to cr iii adsorption note the ph dependent line broadening and red shift in the be such spectral features could be understood in light of ottoson et al s excellent analysis of the origin of the ph dependent line broadening and be shift of the n 1s spectra of the nhx moiety in lysine with respect to the polarization screening of the solvation shell where hydrogen bonds prevailed between the nhx moiety and the water molecules ottosson et al 2011 the ph dependent red shift in the n 1s core electron be was attributed to electrostatic interference i e negative charging from the electrons of the oxygen atom of the water molecule acceptor hofmann 2012 van der heide 2011 which was h bonded to the nhx moiety donor ottosson et al 2011 in the final state of the n 1s core electron transition the ph dependent broadening of the signal was attributed to the variation in the polarization screening hence the variation in be shift from the water molecules of the solvation shell also in the final state of the n 1s core electronic transition ottosson et al 2011 we observed a similar ph dependence in the present study fig 10 b which involves the nhx moiety i e the pyrrolic n in the polypyrrole donor and the cr vi ion complex in which one oxygen atom acceptor was hydrogen bonded to the nhx moiety the ph dependent red shift in be was attributed to the corresponding intensification of the hydrogen bond induced negative charging of the pyrrolic n such reasoning was further supported by the hydrogen bond calculation by the same technique employed for the data in fig 8 of the higher density cr vi adsorption which might prevail in the higher ph condition fig s10 note the shortened hydrogen bond length relative to those in fig 8 c in the case of the higher density cr vi adsorption which was attributed to the interference from the neighboring cr vi ion complexes such shortened hydrogen bond lengths should result in a stronger negative charging interference from the oxygen atoms of the cr vi complex onto the pyrrolic n and hence in the red shift of the be of its core electron moreover the ph dependent line broadening might be explained in the same framework as the cr vi adsorption density increases with the ph their mutual separation should decrease while their mutual electrostatic interference should increase as this process should occur among the large number of cr vi complexes the interferences should be accordingly accompanied by statistical dispersion the observed ph dependent line broadening in fig 10 b strongly suggests that the strength of the dispersion also increased with the strength of the interference we leave the more detailed picture of the interference and the resulting broadening for a future study 4 conclusions chromate adsorption occurred from both cr iii and cr vi the chromate adsorption capacity increased with the pyrrole monomer content in the adsorbent and was well correlated with the pyrrolic nitrogen content in the adsorbent rather than with other types of nitrogen the optimized adsorption capacity 174 81 mg g in the equilibrium batch experiment and 211 10 mg g at ph 3 was far superior to those of conventional adsorbents we found that cr iii and cr vi adsorption followed different reaction paths cr iii adsorption occurred in two sequential steps 1 a jones oxidation reaction jor like reaction of cr vi with pyrrolic n that generates cr iii and 2 cr iii adsorption on the deprotonated pyrrolic n via cr iii n covalent bonding cr vi adsorption followed an alternative path hydrogen bonding on the deprotonation free pyrrolic n sites the ph dependent fractional deprotonation of the pyrrolic n sites by the jor like reaction in the presence of chromate played an important role in the adsorption the mechanism concerning the pyrrolic n

rpm the liquid phase was subsequently separated from the solution using a 0 45 μm ptfe syringe filter millipore usa 2 5 effect of initial ph the effect of the initial ph on the adsorption capacity was studied by taking 50 ml of chromium solution in conical tubes at ambient temperature the initial ph was varied from 3 to 5 with 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh under agitation all experiments were conducted in duplicate and the average values were used in calculations 2 6 adsorption data analysis to quantify the adsorption capacities of the ppy samples we analyzed the equilibrium adsorption of chromium using the langmuir adsorption model which is given by equation 1 choi et al 2011 1 s α β c 1 α c here s is the mass of solute sorbed per unit mass of adsorbent mg g c is the concentration of the solute in the solution at equilibrium with the mass of the solute sorbed onto the adsorbent mg l β is the maximum mass adsorbed under saturation conditions per unit mass of adsorbent mg g and α is an empirical constant in units of the inverse concentration c l mg 2 7 computational method we carried out first principles calculation based on density functional theory using gaussian 09 with the m06 2x exchange correlation functional and the cc pvtz basis set frisch et al 2009 zhao and truhlar 2008 to model the aqueous environment we added a solvent reaction field using the conductor like polarizable continuum model cpcm the solvent was set as water barone and cossi 1998 cossi et al 2003 a full natural bond orbital nbo analysis was also performed using the nbo 3 1 module glendening et al version 3 1 the adsorbent was modeled as five pentagonal rings containing pyrrolic n atoms and both ends were passivated with hydrogen atoms the optimized configurations were drawn using vesta momma and izumi 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption of chromate in aqueous solutions the four ppy adsorbents were subjected to the equilibrium batch adsorption test for chromium contaminated water with various initial concentrations of chromium the adsorption isotherms of chromium on the ppy samples are shown in fig 1 they are asymptotic nonlinear curves which could be well fitted with a langmuir adsorption isotherm the maximum adsorption capacities β of the samples increased with the pyrrole monomer content to 41 34 cb 50 84 ppy1 76 17 ppy2 165 33 ppy4 and 174 81 mg g ppy6 table 2 note that the adsorption capacity of ppy1 was only slightly different from that of cb which is attributed to the drastic decrease in the specific surface area of ppy1 relative to that of cb table s1 bet surface area fig s1 n2 adsorption desorption isotherm as the monomer content increases the decreasing rate becomes saturated strongly suggesting that the pores in the cb were filled by the pyrrole monomers in exchange of the newly introduced pyrrolic n sites which are possible adsorption sites as shown in section 3 3 the barely increased adsorption capacity of ppy1 indicates that the introduction of pyrrolic n sites was compensated by the aforementioned decrease in the specific surface area note that the further increase in monomer content caused a drastic increase in the adsorption capacity indicating that the generation of adsorption sites overcompensated the aforementioned decrease in the specific surface area and dominated the adsorption capacity the adsorption capacity of the optimized sample ppy6 was far superior to those of a wide variety of conventional adsorbents described in the literature table 1 bhatti et al 2017 padmavathy et al 2016 roque ruiz et al 2016 sakulthaew et al 2017 wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 we will investigate the intriguing mechanism behind such powerful chromate adsorption of ppy in section 3 3 it is well known that the ph varies with the chromate concentration in chromate waste solutions and in lab made chromate solutions as well in addition the ph affects the adsorption as shown herein the adsorption capacity of a ppy sample was obtained from the equilibrium batch test where the equilibrium adsorption at various chromate concentrations was evaluated and plotted against the concentration fig 1 from this plot the maximum adsorption capacity was obtained and used to calculate the adsorption capacity of the ppy sample equation 1 the same process was repeated for each ppy sample with different pyrrole monomer contents thus the effect of ph on a ppy sample is reflected in its equilibrium batch test profile fig 1 and it is important that this reflection be repeated in exactly the same way for each ppy sample in such a fixed environment in which the concentration dependent ph affects the adsorption we observed the effect of the pyrrole monomer content on the adsorption capacity one might regard such an approach as desirable in a practical sense as there was no point in evaluating the ph of the solution and buffering it for optimum adsorption for each ppy sample in the present experiment nevertheless we took an additional approach in which the chromate concentration was fixed while the ph of the ppy sample solution was varied by buffering to isolate the effect of ph on the adsorption capacity at a particular concentration see section 3 3 it is also important that the adsorption mechanism study section 3 3 was heavily based upon this observation in addition to the aforementioned one with the rather practical context 3 2 physical properties of ppy to understand the effect of the ppy monomer content on the adsorption capacity we observed the microstructure of the samples fig 2 shows the tem and eds mapping images of the ppy6 sample before chromate adsorption and fig 2 a indicates the cb ppy core shell structure of the particles the nitrogen distribution in the coating analyzed by eds nitrogen mapping was rather uniform as seen in fig 2 b d the eds mapping images of the other samples are given in fig s2 s4 the uniformity of the ppy coating did not change with the pyrrole monomer content only the coating thickness varied fig s5 polypyrrole thickness vs monomer equivalent fig s6 shows the dsc curve from which one can confirm the polymerization of the pyrrole from the glass transition temperature the dsc curve of the ppy6 sample shows a broad endothermic dip at 95 c which is in agreement with a previously reported value hur et al 2014 fig s7 shows the sem images of the ppy samples the increase in monomer content resulted in an increase in particle size albeit with little change in their shape fig 3 shows the wide scan xps spectra of the ppy samples before adsorption the intensity of the nitrogen related signals increased with the pyrrole to cb ratio fig 4 shows the n 1s xps spectra of the ppy samples before adsorption in which the peaks were deconvoluted into the different nitrogen components the corresponding nitrogen contents are summarized in table 3 these results are used to discuss the adsorption mechanism in section 3 3 the coating of polypyrrole on the ppy samples was also confirmed by the ft ir spectra fig s8 liang et al 2011a 2011b 3 3 mechanism of chromate adsorption on ppy the contents of the various types of nitrogen table 3 in the ppy samples before adsorption were plotted against the pyrrole monomer to carbon black ratio fig 5 and fig s9 which partly indicates that the dominant contribution to the chromate adsorption might come from pyrrolic n rather than from other types of nitrogen this is based on the following observations 1 the content profile of pyridinic n or n oxide do not conform to the maximum adsorption capacity β profile i e the pyridinic n or n oxide content decreased from ppy4 ppy6 and ppy2 ppy4 respectively in contrast to the monotonic increase of β shown in fig s9 while the pyrrolic n content profile monotonically increases in the entire range as seen in fig 5 2 although the graphitic n content profile conformed to the corresponding β profile fig s9 it was unlikely to contribute to the adsorption as its molecular structure does not involve dangling bonds in contrast to that of pyrrolic n which features a dangling bond when deprotonated as will be shown later 3 the pyrrolic n content was much greater than that of other types of n table 3 which also supports pyrrolic n as the favored candidate for adsorption sites we translated the mass content of the various types of nitrogen table 3 in the ppy6 sample after adsorption into the number of nitrogen atoms which we assumed to serve as adsorption sites the results are summarized in table s2 in addition the number of chromate molecules adsorbed on ppy6 was calculated from the measured adsorption capacity to be 9 04 1020 adsorption is assumed to occur exclusively on the surface sites of the ppy layer rather than on sites buried in the bulk the pyrrole coating on cb was a few nanometers thick in the ppy6 sample fig 2 and fig s5 which is orders of magnitude thicker than a monolayer therefore the blindly calculated number of adsorption sites of ppy6 table s2 should be greater than the number of adsorbed chromate molecules i e 9 04 1020 as shown in table s2 the only type of nitrogen that satisfies this requirement is pyrrolic n now that we have shown that the dominant adsorption site was pyrrolic nitrogen we proceed to clarify the possible adsorption reaction paths involving pyrrolic nitrogen fig 6 shows the n 1s xps spectrum of the ppy6 sample after chromate adsorption the cr 2p xps spectra are shown in fig 7 and compared with those of cb two new features are evident in these xps spectra 1 a signal pertaining to a possibly deprotonated pyrrolic cr iii n bond with a bond length of 2 0 å fig 6 see statement s1 further information for the peak identification the cr iii n signal is also present in the cr 2p xps spectra shown in fig 7 b 2 a cr vi signal is present in the spectra fig 7 such features indicate that cr iii and cr vi coexisted in the adsorption product the absence of a cr c peak in the ppy6 spectra in fig 7 b indicates that cr preferred n sites to c sites for chemical bonding with ppy the cr iii n pyrrolic deprotonated bond length is presently unavailable the literature indicated a bond length of 2 0 å for cr2 n and 1 6 å for cr n bonds in bulk crn thin films wu et al 2003 but the nature of the nitrogen atom in the bonds is obviously different from pyrrolic n in the present study we demonstrate that the bond length of cr iii n pyrrolic deprotonated is similar to that of cr n in cr2 n barker et al 1996 wang 2016 by first principles calculation such cr iii n bond formation in the presence of chromate was reminiscent of chromate adsorption on the dangling bonds of onion like carbon olc ko et al 2016 in the presence of a cr vi complex the hydroxyl group on the olc was deprotonated by the jor to yield cr iii which eventually formed a cr c bond ko et al 2016 in the present study we possibly have a similar situation the pyrrolic n might be deprotonated by the jor like reaction to yield cr iii which might eventually form the observed cr n bond to further clarify the aforementioned cr vi cr iii dual adsorption reaction picture with first principles calculation we considered two different adsorbents that contain pyrrolic n and deprotonated pyrrolic n respectively fig 8 a and b based on the xps analysis figs 6 and 7 we set two different types of cr ions the cr vi complex hcro4 and cr iii we carried out full geometry relaxation by placing the two adsorbates at their respective possible adsorption sites on the adsorbent the resulting optimized adsorption structures for cr vi and cr iii are shown in fig 8 c and d respectively as shown in fig 8 c one of the oxygen atoms in hcro4 was stabilized at a distance of 1 80 å from the hydrogen atom in the pyrrolic n which indicated the formation of a hydrogen bond on the other hand in the optimized cr iii structure fig 8 d cr iii formed a covalent bond with the deprotonated pyrrolic n and the resulting cr iii n bond length was 2 06 å which supported the coexisting cr iii adsorption theory proposed in the previous paragraph 3 4 effect of ph on the adsorption of chromate on ppy the ph of the solution might be an important factor in the possible competition between the two adsorption reactions leading to cr vi cr iii dual adsorption wang et al 2015 as the cr iii adsorption involved a reaction similar to the jor whose kinetics are well known to favor a lower ph roque ruiz et al 2016 moreover the ph dependent fractional deprotonation of nhx moieties in aqueous environments is well documented nolting et al 2007 fig 9 shows the n 1s and cr 2p xps spectra of the post adsorption ppy6 samples with three different initial ph values the observed behavior is graphically summarized in fig 10 data summarized in table s3 the adsorption capacity of cr iii indeed favored a lower ph fig 10 a which supports the proposed jor like reaction framework for cr iii adsorption the opposite trend in the cr vi adsorption capacity in fig 10 a was attributed to the additional reaction path proposed above fig 10 b shows the ph dependence of the n 1s core electron binding energy be of pyrrolic n and the full width at half maximum fwhm of the signal recall that the pyrrolic n signal was relevant to cr vi adsorption while the cr n signal was relevant to cr iii adsorption note the ph dependent line broadening and red shift in the be such spectral features could be understood in light of ottoson et al s excellent analysis of the origin of the ph dependent line broadening and be shift of the n 1s spectra of the nhx moiety in lysine with respect to the polarization screening of the solvation shell where hydrogen bonds prevailed between the nhx moiety and the water molecules ottosson et al 2011 the ph dependent red shift in the n 1s core electron be was attributed to electrostatic interference i e negative charging from the electrons of the oxygen atom of the water molecule acceptor hofmann 2012 van der heide 2011 which was h bonded to the nhx moiety donor ottosson et al 2011 in the final state of the n 1s core electron transition the ph dependent broadening of the signal was attributed to the variation in the polarization screening hence the variation in be shift from the water molecules of the solvation shell also in the final state of the n 1s core electronic transition ottosson et al 2011 we observed a similar ph dependence in the present study fig 10 b which involves the nhx moiety i e the pyrrolic n in the polypyrrole donor and the cr vi ion complex in which one oxygen atom acceptor was hydrogen bonded to the nhx moiety the ph dependent red shift in be was attributed to the corresponding intensification of the hydrogen bond induced negative charging of the pyrrolic n such reasoning was further supported by the hydrogen bond calculation by the same technique employed for the data in fig 8 of the higher density cr vi adsorption which might prevail in the higher ph condition fig s10 note the shortened hydrogen bond length relative to those in fig 8 c in the case of the higher density cr vi adsorption which was attributed to the interference from the neighboring cr vi ion complexes such shortened hydrogen bond lengths should result in a stronger negative charging interference from the oxygen atoms of the cr vi complex onto the pyrrolic n and hence in the red shift of the be of its core electron moreover the ph dependent line broadening might be explained in the same framework as the cr vi adsorption density increases with the ph their mutual separation should decrease while their mutual electrostatic interference should increase as this process should occur among the large number of cr vi complexes the interferences should be accordingly accompanied by statistical dispersion the observed ph dependent line broadening in fig 10 b strongly suggests that the strength of the dispersion also increased with the strength of the interference we leave the more detailed picture of the interference and the resulting broadening for a future study 4 conclusions chromate adsorption occurred from both cr iii and cr vi the chromate adsorption capacity increased with the pyrrole monomer content in the adsorbent and was well correlated with the pyrrolic nitrogen content in the adsorbent rather than with other types of nitrogen the optimized adsorption capacity 174 81 mg g in the equilibrium batch experiment and 211 10 mg g at ph 3 was far superior to those of conventional adsorbents we found that cr iii and cr vi adsorption followed different reaction paths cr iii adsorption occurred in two sequential steps 1 a jones oxidation reaction jor like reaction of cr vi with pyrrolic n that generates cr iii and 2 cr iii adsorption on the deprotonated pyrrolic n via cr iii n covalent bonding cr vi adsorption followed an alternative path hydrogen bonding on the deprotonation free pyrrolic n sites the ph dependent fractional deprotonation of the pyrrolic n sites by the jor like reaction in the presence of chromate played an important role in the adsorption the mechanism concerning the pyrrolic n might be applied not only to the polypyrrole but also to other nitrogen doped carbons or secondary amine functionalized polymers acknowledgements this work was supported by the institutional program

19311,as a typical advanced oxidation technology the fenton reaction has been employed for the disinfection owing to the strong oxidizability of hydroxyl radicals oh however the conventional fenton system always exhibits a low h2o2 decomposition efficiency leading to a low production yield of oh which makes the disinfection effect unsatisfactory herein we develop a molybdenum sulfide mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction for rapid and highly efficient inactivation of escherichia coli k 12 e coli and staphylococcus aureus s aureus as a co catalyst in the fe ii h2o2 fenton system mos2 can greatly facilitate the fe iii fe ii cycle reaction by the exposed mo4 active sites which significantly improves the h2o2 decomposition efficiency for the oh production as a result the mos2 co catalytic fenton system can reach up to 83 37 of inactivation rate of e coli just in 1 min and 100 of inactivation rate within 30 min which increased by 2 5 times than that of the conventional fenton reaction furthermore the oh as the primary reactive oxygen species ros in mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction was measured and verified by electron paramagnetic resonance epr and photoluminescence pl it is demonstrated an increased amount of oh generated from the decomposition of h2o2 in the presence of mos2 which is responsible for the rapid and efficient inactivation of e coli and s aureus this study provides a new perspective for rapid and highly efficient inactivation of bacteria in environmental remediation graphical abstract image 1 keywords fenton reaction co catalytic molybdenum sulfide bacterial inactivation 1 introduction nowadays with gradually increased water pollution the breeding of bacteria in water seriously threatens the quality of drinking water jia et al 2015 ma et

untreated surface water such as streams or lakes organization and unicef 2017 to solve the drinking water contamination water disinfection has attracted plenty of attentions since increasingly concerned about removal of pathogenic microorganisms roy et al 2017 tian et al 2014 the conventional methods to remove microorganisms are mainly based on disinfectants such as cl2 clo2 or o3 zhu et al 2014 el chakhtoura et al 2015 czekalski et al 2016 but caused secondary contamination due to the byproducts regli et al 2015 how et al 2016 instead various emerging technologies have been applied for the water disinfection such as electrochemical and photocatalysis technologies wen et al 2017 jia et al 2016 zeng et al 2017 amount of novel antibacterial agents such as noble metal based nanomaterials ag au cu fe2o3 agbr ertem et al 2017 loeb et al 2017 li et al 2017a ng et al 2016 semiconductor composites g c3n4 m bi2o4 ag2wo4 g c3n4 tio2 go xia et al 2017 li et al 2017b wang et al 2016 etc have been successfully applied for the disinfection despite a considerable amount of research effort has been carried out there are still two major factors that limit their applications in water disinfection on the one hand besides being relative expensive the toxicity and complicated synthesis process of these nanostructured agents still make it difficult to achieve large scale industrial applications anastasi et al 2013 mangayayam et al 2017 gupta et al 2017 for example although ag nanoparticles or ag based composites have an excellent bactericidal activity it is difficult to get practical application due to relative expensive and potential environmental hazard bondarenko et al 2013 younas et al 2014 on the other hand relatively long reaction time was required to completely inactivate bacteria doederer et al 2014 there is thereby an urgent need but it is still a significant challenge to develop a rapid efficient and economical technology for the water disinfection recently the advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely applied for wastewater purification due to its excellent oxidation and strong practicality oturan and aaron 2014 asghar et al 2015 especially the fenton reaction as a typical aops the hydroxyl radicals oh generated from the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 have a strong oxidation ability towards the organic pollution and bacteria in water zhang et al 2016 however the conventional fenton reaction still has a low decomposition efficiency of h2o2 owing to the low efficiency of fe iii fe ii cycle reaction hence it always needs a large amount of fe2 and h2o2 to generate the sufficient concentration of oh sekaran et al 2013 recently the emergence of co catalysts offers a new prospect for the further development of aops hu and long 2016 duan et al 2018 qin et al 2015 in our previous work xing et al 2018 we found that commercially available mos2 as an inorganic co catalyst in fenton reaction have achieved rapid and highly efficient removal of benzene pollutants from wastewater the mos2 could facilitate the reduction of fe3 to fe2 by the active sites of surface exposed mo4 which significantly improved the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 therefore we look forward to using mos2 as an efficient co catalyst in fenton reaction for the water disinfection herein we first report our efforts in developing a commercial mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction for rapid and efficient inactivation of escherichia coli k 12 e coli and staphylococcus aureus s aureus compared with conventional fenton reaction it was found that commercially available mos2 as an efficient co catalyst could significantly improve the conversion of fe3 fe2 which caused an increased amount of oh generated from the decomposition of h2o2 this study systematically explored the inactivation effect of bacteria in mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction system the effects of different factors including reagent concentration and solution ph on the efficiency of bacterial inactivation were investigated due to the excellent oxidation high efficiency low toxicity low cost and strong practicality the mos2 co catalytic fenton system is possible to be applied in the real wastewater disinfection 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o 99 0 molybdenum sulfide hydrogen peroxide isopropanol zinc sulfide tungsten sulfide copper sulfate nickel sulfate silver nitrate 1 10 phenanthroline peptone agar powder yeast extract sodium chloride 2 2 experimental procedure of disinfection e coli as the model gram negative bacteria was used to assess the activity of bacterial inactivation over different fenton systems the bacteria were cultured in luria bertani lb nutrient solution at 37 c for 24 h under shaking then washed with distilled water by the centrifugation at 3000 rpm afterwards the bacteria were re suspended into a sterilized aqueous solution and diluted to 1 106 colony forming units cfu ml the conditions of mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction for the disinfection are as follows 30 mg commercial mos2 was dispersed in 100 ml distilled water and ultrasound for 10 min and then 1 ml feso4 7h2o aqueous 2 mg ml was added into mixture solution after adjusting solution ph value between 3 5 and 3 7 1 ml diluted bacterial solution was added into the system under the magnetic stirring at room temperature subsequently 1 4 8 16 or 32 μl h2o2 30 was added into the above solution by the pipette to start the reaction respectively we used a stopwatch to precisely control the reaction time 1 min or 10 20 30 min here starts with adding h2o2 after reaction for 1 min or 10 20 30 min 0 1 ml of mixture solution was immediately taken and diluted with 0 9 ml sterilized water and then 0 1 ml diluted solution was taken and uniformly dispersed onto an agar plate the plate was put into an oven at 37 c for 24 h finally the number of living cells was determined by counting the bacterium colonies similarly the control experiments including e coli h2o2 feso4 or mos2 alone were also conducted respectively 2 3 effect of sacrificial agent on the disinfection to identify the oh as the dominant reactive oxide species ros accounting for the inactivation of bacteria isopropanol was used to capture the oh typically 0 5 mm isopropanol was added into the mixture solution of 100 ml h2o 120 mg mos2 and 2 mg feso4 7h2o after adjusting solution ph value between 3 5 and 3 7 1 ml diluted bacterial solution was added into the system under magnetic stirring at room temperature and then 32 μl h2o2 30 was added into the above solution by the pipette after reaction for 1 min 0 1 ml of mixture solution was immediately taken and diluted with 0 9 ml sterilized water and then 0 1 ml diluted solution was taken and uniformly dispersed onto an agar plate finally the number of living cells was determined by counting the bacterium colonies in addition superoxide radicals were also identified as ros by introducing argon into the mos2 co catalytic fenton system to remove oxygen the control experiments including isopropanol or argon alone were also conducted respectively 2 4 detection of oh the generation of oh can be measured by the detection of pl signal of hydroxyl benzoic which was formed by the capture of oh on the benzoic acid in detail 120 mg mos2 2 mg feso4 7h2o and 40 mg benzoic acid were mixed into 100 ml distilled water and then 32 μl h2o2 was added into the above solution to start reaction after reaction for 1 min the solution was filtered and measured by pl emission spectroscopy excitation wavelength 412 nm 2 5 detection of fe2 and fe3 to detect the relative concentrations of fe2 and fe3 in mos2 co catalytic fe2 h2o2 fenton reaction the uv vis spectroscopy was used to record the absorption value changes of fe2 and fe3 colored by 1 10 phenanthroline monohydrate and kscn respectively in detail 120 mg commercial mos2 dispersed into 100 ml distilled water and then 1 ml feso4 aqueous 2 mg ml was added into the mixture solution 32 μl h2o2 was added into the above solution to start reaction after reaction for 1 5 or 15min an analytical sample was taken from the system and immediately centrifuged finally 1 10 phenanthroline monohydrate 1 mg ml and kscn 1 mg ml was added into above filtrate and then detected by the uv vis spectroscopy 2 6 characterization the transmission election microscopy tem jeol jem 2100ex was used to characterize the morphologies of commercial mos2 the scanning electron microscopy sem jeol jsm 6360 lv was used to observe the morphologies of bacteria which were prepared before and after the reaction x ray diffraction xrd measurements of the samples were carried out with a rigaku ultima iv diffractometer cu kα radiation λ 0 15406 nm the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses were characterized by a perkin elmer phi 5000c esca system with al kα radiation raman measurements was carried out by

eclipse was performed at room temperature to characterize the intensity of hydroxyl radicals the x band erp spectra varian e 112 were performed at room temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction for the water disinfection as a typically aops the complex system of fenton reaction limits its practical application our previous work found that commercial mos2 could significantly promote the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 for the generation of oh in the fenton reaction which displays an efficient and rapid removal of benzene pollutants from wastewater xing et al 2018 therefore to investigate whether the mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction has the same performance for removal of pathogenic microorganisms systematic research was conducted to explore the effect of various reaction conditions on the inactivation performance of e coli including the amount of h2o2 feso4 mos2 and the ph value of the fenton reaction as shown in fig 1 a it was first studied the effect of h2o2 concentration on the inactivation of e coli while the amount of feso4 mos2 and the ph value were quantified obviously survival rate of e coli was decreased with the increase of h2o2 owing to the h2o2 itself has the function of sterilization which suggested that h2o2 had a significant effect on the inactivation of e coli this is consistent with the previous reports kim et al 2015 subsequently it was studied the effect of fe2 concentration on the inactivation rate of e coli as shown in fig 1b notably there was an optimal dosage of feso4 7h2o for the mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction towards the inactivation of e coli which was beneficial for the decomposition of h2o2 to generate more oh it is because that excessive fe2 would consume the oh while too low dosage of fe2 could not fully catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 after 2 mg feso4 7h2o and 32 μl h2o2 were chose as the optimum conditions it was investigated the co catalytic effect of mos2 in fenton reaction for the inactivation of e coli by varying the amount of mos2 between 30 mg and 120 mg as a result with the increase of the dosage of mos2 the inactivation rate of e coli in water had no obvious changes fig 1c indicated that excessive mos2 could not further improve the inactivation performance of e coli in the fenton reaction in mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction the exposed mo4 on the surface of mos2 plays the key role for the reduction of fe3 to fe2 meanwhile the re produced fe2 decompose the h2o2 to release oh radicals for the disinfection although the amount of mos2 is increasing the adding amount of h2o2 is limited fixed at 32 μl 30 mg of mos2 has been able to co catalyze the fenton reaction to completely decompose the h2o2 part of h2o2 was used to reduce the mo6 xing et al 2018 therefore increasing the amount of mos2 has little effect on the inactivation rate of e coli furthermore it was studied the effect of ph value on inactivation of e coli seen from fig 1d the mos2 assisted fenton reaction reached the highest performance at the condition of ph 3 63 according to the above results the optimal conditions of the mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction for the inactivation of e coli were fixed as follows 100 ml h2o solution containing 1 106 cfu e coli 2 mg feso4 7h2o 120 mg mos2 and 32 μl h2o2 under a ph value between 3 5 and 3 7 as shown in fig 2 a as a result the inactivation rate was 20 13 when only h2o2 32 μl was added it had a slight increase in inactivation rate of e coli with the continue addition of 2 mg feso4 7h2o which was attributed to the formation of oh generated from the fe2 h2o2 fenton reaction furthermore after a quick reaction time for 1 min the inactivation rate of e coli could reach up to 83 37 with the further introduction of 120 mg mos2 which increased by 2 5 times than that of the fe2 h2o2 reaction in order to clearly compare the antibacterial results of different reaction systems it was summarized the survival rate of e coli under different reaction conditions in table s1 as expected the co catalytic system of feso4 h2o2 mos2 shows the best disinfection result which is much better than the antibacterial results of h2o2 without fe or mos2 only the values of log n n colony forming units of fig 2a have been summarized in table s2 not surprisingly the feso4 h2o2 mos2 system exhibited the lowest log n value after 1 min reaction indicating the highest antibacterial efficiency of e coli in order to exclude that mos2 itself has a strong ability to inactivate bacteria it was also investigated the inactivation performance of e coli in the only presence of 120 mg of mos2 as shown in fig 2a there was only 14 13 of inactivation rate for 120 mg mos2 control experiment which suggested that mos2 had a little influence on the inactivation performance of bacteria liu et al 2016 furthermore the interaction between mos2 and h2o2 was explored by only introducing mos2 and h2o2 in the system which shows only 32 83 inactivation rate 0 9 nacl was employed as the solvent and diluent for the control experiment as shown in fig s1a the results showed a similar regular with that in sterilized water in our case the disinfection rate of mos2 co catalytic fenton system is very fast it takes only 30 min to achieve 100 inactivation rate of e coli fig 2b and s2 it has been demonstrated that in such a short period of time e coli are almost survival in sterilized water fig s1b obviously the mos2 co catalytic fenton system exhibits the highest bactericidal activity in all reference experiments which is higher than the sum of any two reference experiments to further improve the efficiency of disinfection it was prolonged the reaction time to 30 min and continued to add fenton reagent at 10 min and 20 min during the reaction it was found that the conventional fenton reaction could limitedly reduce the cell density log n 6 17 in fig 2b and the e coli still have a 45 4 survival rate fig s2 as expected the mos2 co catalytic fenton system could achieve 100 removal of e coli fig s2 and the remaining cell density is close to zero as shown in fig 2b in addition to e coli the staphylococcus aureus s aureus as the model of gram positive bacteria was used to further explore the applicability of the mos2 co catalytic fenton system in disinfection seen from fig s3 the mos2 co catalytic fenton system also had a similar regular for the inactivation of s aureus with the presence of mos2 it could achieve a 68 54 inactivation rate while the conventional fenton only showed a 25 51 inactivation rate considering the standard of water purification that no bacteria could be detected in treated water we have continued to add 2 mg feso4 and 32 μl h2o2 at 10 min and 20 min during the reaction the mos2 co catalytic fenton system could achieve 99 96 removal of s aureus fig s2a c and the remaining cell density has a significant decrease compared to that of the conventional fenton reaction all the results indeed demonstrated that the mos2 as a co catalyst could significantly improve the inactivation of bacteria in fenton system fig 3 shows the sterilization photos over different fenton systems there was only a little decrease in the number of survival colonies in the presence of only h2o2 fig 3a and b indicating the limitation of h2o2 for disinfection as a comparison the conventional fenton reaction composed by 2 mg feso4 7h2o and 32 μl h2o2 exhibits a little higher bactericidal activity than that of blank h2o2 fig 3c and d it is important to highlight that the inactivating effect could reached up to 83 37 under the co catalytic effect of mos2 fig 3e and f after 1 min of reaction the number of colonies fell sharply with the help of mos2 co catalytic effect the representative sem images of bacterial membrane revealed that breakage was occurred after disinfectant treatment by the mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction fig 3g and h before reaction the e coli cell has a complete cell structure fig 3g which shows a well rod shape with length of 2 5 μm after 1 min of fenton reaction the cell walls of e coli were destroyed obviously indicating an effective inactivation of e coli over the mos2 co catalytic system 3 2 efficient and recyclable bactericidal performance in order to demonstrate the rapid response capability of mos2 co catalytic fe2 h2o2 system it was tested the inactivation performance of e coli after prolonging the reaction time as shown in fig 4 a the survival rate dramatically reduced to 21 88 within 10 min suggesting the outstanding bactericidal ability it shows that the survival rate of e coli did not significantly decrease after the reaction was extended to 30 min 16 27 indicating that the h2o2 had been rapidly decomposed by the fe2 in the presence of mos2 in addition it also have been done a comparison between the previous reports and mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction on the water disinfection as shown table s3 compared with the reported fenton reaction the mos2 co catalytic fenton system has obvious advantages in bactericidal effect and reaction rate most of the reported fenton reactions showed a very low bactericidal efficiency 50 after a long reaction time 40 min but in our case the antibacterial rate of mos2 co catalytic system can reach 83 37 in 1 min even compared to other energy consumed disinfection systems such as photo fenton photocatalysis and electro catalysis the mos2 co catalytic fenton system still performs relatively fast bactericidal activity we have roughly calculated the cost and simply compared with several reports below the table s3 as a result it could be found that the cost of mos2 co catalytic fenton system has an advantage compared to other reported fenton reaction for the water purification it is worthwhile mentioning that the commercially available mos2 system costs less than the synthetic reaction systems in table s3 to further evaluate the stability performance of mos2 as co catalyst cycling test of bacterial inactivation was carried out during the mos2 co catalytic fe2 h2o2 reaction the physicochemical stability of mos2 is important for the practical applications the mos2 was recycled through centrifugation and dried in a vacuum oven before next reuse as shown in fig 4b the results showed a stable co catalytic performance in fe2 h2o2 reaction for the inactivation of e coli only slight deterioration was observed after six cycling test maybe due to the mass loss during the cycle test after six cycles the quantity of mos2 had a decreased but its crystalline structure remained unchanged the xrd patterns of commercial mos2 before and after cycles were shown in fig 4c obviously the intensity and position of the peaks remained unchanged after the cycling test indicating the structural stability of the mos2 in order to demonstrate the stability of mos2 in the co catalytic fenton reaction the plasma emission spectrometer was explored to detect the concentration of mo and s ions after 2 h reaction as a result the dissolution rates of mo and s ions were only 0 82 and 1 25 in table s4 respectively the limited s ions suggest that the sulfur is not continuously escaping from the mos2 surface and the pure mos2 exhibits a negligible antibacterial activity 10 in fig 2a indicating the escaping s has a negligible effect on the disinfection moreover the morphology of mos2 also remained changeless after the cycling test fig s4 it can be seen that the multilayered structure of mos2 was nearly unchanged even after six cycling test the raman spectra of mos2 also showed an unchanged position of peaks and no new peaks could be observed fig s5 all the above results indicate the great potential of mos2 co catalytic fe2 h2o2 reaction in practical water disinfection 3 3 mechanism investigation the conventional fenton reaction mainly includes two equations as followed 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 2 fe3 h2o2 fe2 h o2h in this process fe2 catalyzes the decomposition of h2o2 to generate the oh at first which has a high efficiency eq 1 but the eq 2 determines the overall efficiency of conventional fenton reaction due to its low reaction rate xing et al 2018a li et al 2016 the key to improve the efficiency of conventional fenton reaction is to facilitate the conversion of fe3 to fe2 which could significantly promote the decomposition of h2o2 for the generation of oh and the oh as the primary reactive oxygen species ros has a highly inactivation performance of bacteria in water villegas guzman et al 2017 huang et al 2017 therefore in order to demonstrate that mos2 could facilitate the conversion of fe3 to fe2 it was conducted some experiments to investigate the role of mos2 in mos2 assisted fe2 h2o2 for inactivation of e coli in the previous discovery the surface of mos2 could capture the protons in the hydrogen evolution reaction li et al 2017c voiry et al 2016 similarly the unsaturated s atoms firstly formed by dispersion of commercial mos2 in water would capture the protons to generate h2s on the surface of mos2 which was detected by uv vis measurements as shown in fig 5 a compared with the absorption curve of mos2 supernatant there was a new and broad absorption peak at approximately 297 nm in the uv range after adding agno3 into mos2 supernatant which was corresponded to the absorption wavelength of ag2s jarosz et al 2013 the generation of h2s indicated the formation of sulfur vacancies on the surface of mos2 which was further confirmed by erp measurements in fig 5b the epr spectra displayed obvious sulfur vacancies at a signal of g 2 0 after commercial mos2 being washed with water and dried in the vacuum at room temperature additionally the molar ratio of dissolved s to mo is much greater than 2 1 s mo 5 1 in table s4 further confirming that there is a large amount of mo4 left on the surface of mos2 as a result the exposed mo4 on the surface of mos2 would facilitate the conversion of fe3 to fe2 by the oxidation reduction reaction the equations can be listed as follows 3 mo4 fe3 mo6 fe2 4 mo6 h2o2 mo4 h2o o2 to confirm the oxidation reduction reaction between mo4 and fe3 it was detected the relative concentrations of fe2 and fe3 in mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction the uv vis spectroscopy was employed to record the absorption value changes of fe2 colored by 1 mg ml 1 10 phenanthroline monohydrate and fe3 colored by 1 mg ml kscn in reaction solution iqbal et al 2016 mondal et al 2007 as shown in fig 5c obviously higher concentration of fe2 was detected at the beginning of reaction after 1 min the relative concentration of fe2 significantly reduced along with the generation of fe3 indicating the rapid response efficiency between fe2 and h2o2 eq 1 subsequently the relative concentration of fe2 would gradually increase when the reaction time continued to 15 min owing to the oxidation reduction reaction between mo4 and fe3 eq 3 in addition the mos2 assisted fe2 h2o2 system exhibits much higher concentration of fe2 than that of the conventional fe2 h2o2 at the end of the reaction fig s6 indicating mos2 could facilitate the conversion of fe3 to fe2 it was further confirmed the oxidation reduction reaction between mo4 and fe3 by xps measurements the fig 5d shows the mo 3d xps spectrum of mos2 before and after inactivation experiment of e coli a slight red shift of mo 3d peaks was attributed to a decrease of electron cloud of mo 3d due to the oxidation of mo4 to mo6 the electron of mo4 would be captured by fe3 in reaction solution eq 3 which caused an increase on binding energy of mo 3d different with our previous work xing et al 2018 there is no obvious new peak appeared at 236 ev corresponding to mo6 indicating a rapid reduction process of mo6 to mo4 in the presence of h2o2 in solution eq 4 in our previous report on the mos2 co catalytic fenton for the remediation of organic pollutants xing et al 2018 0 07 mmol l h2o2 was used in the system but in this case 0 56 mmol l h2o2 was employed for the disinfection a relative high quantity of h2o2 would promote the reduction of mo6 to mo4 as a result the characteristic peak of mo6 in mo 3d xps spectrum is very weak and the reduction of fe3 by the mo4 would decrease the electron cloud density of mo4 which could make the mo4 xps peak shift to a high binding energy these results further confirm the presence of eq 3 and eq 4 in mos2 co catalytic fenton system for the inactivation of e coli according to the mentioned mechanism it suggests that mos2 could facilitate the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 to generate more oh in the fenton reaction besides h2o2 and mos2 the oh as the mainly ros has a highly inactivation performance of bacteria in this system in the previous discussion there was a relatively low inactivation rate of e coli in the only presence of h2o2 or mos2 it demonstrated that both h2o2 and mos2 could serve as oxidants to inactivate e coli which is consistent with the previous reported liu et al 2016 villegas guzman et al 2017 huang et al 2017 therefore the oh generated from the decomposition of h2o2 served as the powerful oxidants to inactivate e coli it was detected the signal of oh generated from the different reaction systems in the presence of 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo as shown in fig 6 a compared to the weak epr signals of the conventional fe2 h2o2 reaction the mos2 assisted fe2 h2o2 displayed the characteristic quartet signals of oh matuszak et al 1997 this result supported the efficient co catalytic activity of mos2 for the generation of oh from the decomposition of h2o2 subsequently it was quantitatively analyzed the amount of oh in the different reaction systems by photoluminescence pl spectrum as shown in fig 6b the mos2 assisted fe2 h2o2 exhibited a significantly enhanced pl signals of hydroxyl benzoic which was 3 5 times than that of the conventional fe2 h2o2 reaction to calculate the h2o2 decomposition efficiency in this mos2 fenton system it was conducted the experiment to measure the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 into hydroxyl radicals by heating 32 μl h2o2 with 40 mg benzoic acid for 120 min seen from figs s7 and 6b the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 in mos2 co catalytic fenton system was 61 5 527 34 857 5 100 which is much higher than the yield of 17 5 149 65 857 5 100 for the conventional fenton reaction in previous research isopropanol can serve as sacrificial agent to capture the oh xia et al 2015 it was demonstrated that the oh serving as the ros was quite critical for inactivation of e coli by the addition of scavenger in mos2 co catalytic system before conducting the experiment the concentration of isopropanol was optimized to ensure its scavenging effect it should be pointed out that the single isopropanol cannot cause any inactivation of e coli as shown in fig 6c with the addition of 0 5 mm isopropanol the inactivation rate of e coli was obviously prohibited compared to that of no scavenger addition in addition there was only 37 12 of inactivation rate for the mos2 co catalytic fe2 h2o2 in the presence of isopropanol experiment which is similar with the mos2 h2o2 disinfection activity 32 82 further confirmed that the oh serving as the ros was quite critical for the inactivation of e coli in the mos2 co catalytic system in order to eliminate the effect of superoxide on the disinfection the inactivation of e coli experiment was performed by introducing argon into the mos2 co catalytic fenton system to remove the oxygen fig 6c as a result the inactivation rate of e coli had a little inhibition which suggested that superoxide radicals as ros had a negligible role in the mos2 co catalytic fenton system for the disinfection hence it can be concluded that the mos2 could facilitate the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 to generate more oh in the fenton reaction and the generated oh is the primary ros accounting for the bacterial inactivation process it is important to highlight that other metal sulfates cuso4 niso4 or other metal sulfides ws2 zns2 also have an excellent ability to inactivation of e coli by the co catalytic decomposition of h2o2 as shown in fig s8 the inactivation rate is 59 77 of cuso4 60 35 of niso4 51 22 of zns and 86 03 of ws2 respectively therefore it was proposed the bactericidal mechanism of mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction as seen in fig 7 in this system the exposed active sites of mo4 on the surface of mos2 can facilitate the conversion of fe3 to fe2 which is critical for the improvement of decomposition efficiency of h2o2 in the fenton reaction for the inactivation of e coli mos2 can facilitate the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 to generate more oh in the fenton reaction and the generated oh is the primary ros accounting for the bacterial inactivation process as a result by adding mos2 in fenton reaction it can reach up to 83 37 for the inactivation of e coli within 1 min and 100 of inactivation rate within 30 min which is much higher than that of the conventional fenton reaction 4 conclusion in summary it has been developed an excellent co catalytic mos2 assisted fenton system which has achieved rapid and highly efficient inactivation of e coli the exposed mo4 species in mos2 can facilitate the conversion of fe3 to fe2 after the removal of unsaturated s atoms it is critical for the improvement of decomposition efficiency of h2o2 in mos2 assisted fe2 h2o2 for inactivation of e coli what s more it is also found that other metal sulfates cuso4 niso4 or other metal sulfides ws2 zns2 also have an excellent ability to inactivation of e coli we believe this study will provide a new perspective for rapid and highly efficient inactivation of bacteria in water

19311,as a typical advanced oxidation technology the fenton reaction has been employed for the disinfection owing to the strong oxidizability of hydroxyl radicals oh however the conventional fenton system always exhibits a low h2o2 decomposition efficiency leading to a low production yield of oh which makes the disinfection effect unsatisfactory herein we develop a molybdenum sulfide mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction for rapid and highly efficient inactivation of escherichia coli k 12 e coli and staphylococcus aureus s aureus as a co catalyst in the fe ii h2o2 fenton system mos2 can greatly facilitate the fe iii fe ii cycle reaction by the exposed mo4 active sites which significantly improves the h2o2 decomposition efficiency for the oh production as a result the mos2 co catalytic fenton system can reach up to 83 37 of inactivation rate of e coli just in 1 min and 100 of inactivation rate within 30 min which increased by 2 5 times than that of the conventional fenton reaction furthermore the oh as the primary reactive oxygen species ros in mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction was measured and verified by electron paramagnetic resonance epr and photoluminescence pl it is demonstrated an increased amount of oh generated from the decomposition of h2o2 in the presence of mos2 which is responsible for the rapid and efficient inactivation of e coli and s aureus this study provides a new perspective for rapid and highly efficient inactivation of bacteria in environmental remediation graphical abstract image 1 keywords fenton reaction co catalytic molybdenum sulfide bacterial inactivation 1 introduction nowadays with gradually increased water pollution the breeding of bacteria in water seriously threatens the quality of drinking water jia et al 2015 ma et al 2017 according to the report for drinking water by the world health organization who in 2017 there are 2 1 billion people lacking safe drinking water at home even 159 million people still drink untreated surface water such as streams or lakes organization and unicef 2017 to solve the drinking water contamination water disinfection has attracted plenty of attentions since increasingly concerned about removal of pathogenic microorganisms roy et al 2017 tian et al 2014 the conventional methods to remove microorganisms are mainly based on disinfectants such as cl2 clo2 or o3 zhu et al 2014 el chakhtoura et al 2015 czekalski et al 2016 but caused secondary contamination due to the byproducts regli et al 2015 how et al 2016 instead various emerging technologies have been applied for the water disinfection such as electrochemical and photocatalysis technologies wen et al 2017 jia et al 2016 zeng et al 2017 amount of novel antibacterial agents such as noble metal based nanomaterials ag au cu fe2o3 agbr ertem et al 2017 loeb et al 2017 li et al 2017a ng et al 2016 semiconductor composites g c3n4 m bi2o4 ag2wo4 g c3n4 tio2 go xia et al 2017 li et al 2017b wang et al 2016 etc have been successfully applied for the disinfection despite a considerable amount of research effort has been carried out there are still two major factors that limit their applications in water disinfection on the one hand besides being relative expensive the toxicity and complicated synthesis process of these nanostructured agents still make it difficult to achieve large scale industrial applications anastasi et al 2013 mangayayam et al 2017 gupta et al 2017 for example although ag nanoparticles or ag based composites have an excellent bactericidal activity it is difficult to get practical application due to relative expensive and potential environmental hazard bondarenko et al 2013 younas et al 2014 on the other hand relatively long reaction time was required to completely inactivate bacteria doederer et al 2014 there is thereby an urgent need but it is still a significant challenge to develop a rapid efficient and economical technology for the water disinfection recently the advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely applied for wastewater purification due to its excellent oxidation and strong practicality oturan and aaron 2014 asghar et al 2015 especially the fenton reaction as a typical aops the hydroxyl radicals oh generated from the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 have a strong oxidation ability towards the organic pollution and bacteria in water zhang et al 2016 however the conventional fenton reaction still has a low decomposition efficiency of h2o2 owing to the low efficiency of fe iii fe ii cycle reaction hence it always needs a large amount of fe2 and h2o2 to generate the sufficient concentration of oh sekaran et al 2013 recently the emergence of co catalysts offers a new prospect for the further development of aops hu and long 2016 duan et al 2018 qin et al 2015 in our previous work xing et al 2018 we found that commercially available mos2 as an inorganic co catalyst in fenton reaction have achieved rapid and highly efficient removal of benzene pollutants from wastewater the mos2 could facilitate the reduction of fe3 to fe2 by the active sites of surface exposed mo4 which significantly improved the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 therefore we look forward to using mos2 as an efficient co catalyst in fenton reaction for the water disinfection herein we first report our efforts in developing a commercial mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction for rapid and efficient inactivation of escherichia coli k 12 e coli and staphylococcus aureus s aureus compared with conventional fenton reaction it was found that commercially available mos2 as an efficient co catalyst could significantly improve the conversion of fe3 fe2 which caused an increased amount of oh generated from the decomposition of h2o2 this study systematically explored the inactivation effect of bacteria in mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction system the effects of different factors including reagent concentration and solution ph on the efficiency of bacterial inactivation were investigated due to the excellent oxidation high efficiency low toxicity low cost and strong practicality the mos2 co catalytic fenton system is possible to be applied in the real wastewater disinfection 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o 99 0 molybdenum sulfide hydrogen peroxide isopropanol zinc sulfide tungsten sulfide copper sulfate nickel sulfate silver nitrate 1 10 phenanthroline peptone agar powder yeast extract sodium chloride 2 2 experimental procedure of disinfection e coli as the model gram negative bacteria was used to assess the activity of bacterial inactivation over different fenton systems the bacteria were cultured in luria bertani lb nutrient solution at 37 c for 24 h under shaking then washed with distilled water by the centrifugation at 3000 rpm afterwards the bacteria were re suspended into a sterilized aqueous solution and diluted to 1 106 colony forming units cfu ml the conditions of mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction for the disinfection are as follows 30 mg commercial mos2 was dispersed in 100 ml distilled water and ultrasound for 10 min and then 1 ml feso4 7h2o aqueous 2 mg ml was added into mixture solution after adjusting solution ph value between 3 5 and 3 7 1 ml diluted bacterial solution was added into the system under the magnetic stirring at room temperature subsequently 1 4 8 16 or 32 μl h2o2 30 was added into the above solution by the pipette to start the reaction respectively we used a stopwatch to precisely control the reaction time 1 min or 10 20 30 min here starts with adding h2o2 after reaction for 1 min or 10 20 30 min 0 1 ml of mixture solution was immediately taken and diluted with 0 9 ml sterilized water and then 0 1 ml diluted solution was taken and uniformly dispersed onto an agar plate the plate was put into an oven at 37 c for 24 h finally the number of living cells was determined by counting the bacterium colonies similarly the control experiments including e coli h2o2 feso4 or mos2 alone were also conducted respectively 2 3 effect of sacrificial agent on the disinfection to identify the oh as the dominant reactive oxide species ros accounting for the inactivation of bacteria isopropanol was used to capture the oh typically 0 5 mm isopropanol was added into the mixture solution of 100 ml h2o 120 mg mos2 and 2 mg feso4 7h2o after adjusting solution ph value between 3 5 and 3 7 1 ml diluted bacterial solution was added into the system under magnetic stirring at room temperature and then 32 μl h2o2 30 was added into the above solution by the pipette after reaction for 1 min 0 1 ml of mixture solution was immediately taken and diluted with 0 9 ml sterilized water and then 0 1 ml diluted solution was taken and uniformly dispersed onto an agar plate finally the number of living cells was determined by counting the bacterium colonies in addition superoxide radicals were also identified as ros by introducing argon into the mos2 co catalytic fenton system to remove oxygen the control experiments including isopropanol or argon alone were also conducted respectively 2 4 detection of oh the generation of oh can be measured by the detection of pl signal of hydroxyl benzoic which was formed by the capture of oh on the benzoic acid in detail 120 mg mos2 2 mg feso4 7h2o and 40 mg benzoic acid were mixed into 100 ml distilled water and then 32 μl h2o2 was added into the above solution to start reaction after reaction for 1 min the solution was filtered and measured by pl emission spectroscopy excitation wavelength 412 nm 2 5 detection of fe2 and fe3 to detect the relative concentrations of fe2 and fe3 in mos2 co catalytic fe2 h2o2 fenton reaction the uv vis spectroscopy was used to record the absorption value changes of fe2 and fe3 colored by 1 10 phenanthroline monohydrate and kscn respectively in detail 120 mg commercial mos2 dispersed into 100 ml distilled water and then 1 ml feso4 aqueous 2 mg ml was added into the mixture solution 32 μl h2o2 was added into the above solution to start reaction after reaction for 1 5 or 15min an analytical sample was taken from the system and immediately centrifuged finally 1 10 phenanthroline monohydrate 1 mg ml and kscn 1 mg ml was added into above filtrate and then detected by the uv vis spectroscopy 2 6 characterization the transmission election microscopy tem jeol jem 2100ex was used to characterize the morphologies of commercial mos2 the scanning electron microscopy sem jeol jsm 6360 lv was used to observe the morphologies of bacteria which were prepared before and after the reaction x ray diffraction xrd measurements of the samples were carried out with a rigaku ultima iv diffractometer cu kα radiation λ 0 15406 nm the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses were characterized by a perkin elmer phi 5000c esca system with al kα radiation raman measurements was carried out by

eclipse was performed at room temperature to characterize the intensity of hydroxyl radicals the x band erp spectra varian e 112 were performed at room temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction for the water disinfection as a typically aops the complex system of fenton reaction limits its practical application our previous work found that commercial mos2 could significantly promote the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 for the generation of oh in the fenton reaction which displays an efficient and rapid removal of benzene pollutants from wastewater xing et al 2018 therefore to investigate whether the mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction has the same performance for removal of pathogenic microorganisms systematic research was conducted to explore the effect of various reaction conditions on the inactivation performance of e coli including the amount of h2o2 feso4 mos2 and the ph value of the fenton reaction as shown in fig 1 a it was first studied the effect of h2o2 concentration on the inactivation of e coli while the amount of feso4 mos2 and the ph value were quantified obviously survival rate of e coli was decreased with the increase of h2o2 owing to the h2o2 itself has the function of sterilization which suggested that h2o2 had a significant effect on the inactivation of e coli this is consistent with the previous reports kim et al 2015 subsequently it was studied the effect of fe2 concentration on the inactivation rate of e coli as shown in fig 1b notably there was an optimal dosage of feso4 7h2o for the mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction towards the inactivation of e coli which was beneficial for the decomposition of h2o2 to generate more oh it is because that excessive fe2 would consume the oh while too low dosage of fe2 could not fully catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 after 2 mg feso4 7h2o and 32 μl h2o2 were chose as the optimum conditions it was investigated the co catalytic effect of mos2 in fenton reaction for the inactivation of e coli by varying the amount of mos2 between 30 mg and 120 mg as a result with the increase of the dosage of mos2 the inactivation rate of e coli in water had no obvious changes fig 1c indicated that excessive mos2 could not further improve the inactivation performance of e coli in the fenton reaction in mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction the exposed mo4 on the surface of mos2 plays the key role for the reduction of fe3 to fe2 meanwhile the re produced fe2 decompose the h2o2 to release oh radicals for the disinfection although the amount of mos2 is increasing the adding amount of h2o2 is limited fixed at 32 μl 30 mg of mos2 has been able to co catalyze the fenton reaction to completely decompose the h2o2 part of h2o2 was used to reduce the mo6 xing et al 2018 therefore increasing the amount of mos2 has little effect on the inactivation rate of e coli furthermore it was studied the effect of ph value on inactivation of e coli seen from fig 1d the mos2 assisted fenton reaction reached the highest performance at the condition of ph 3 63 according to the above results the optimal conditions of the mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction for the inactivation of e coli were fixed as follows 100 ml h2o solution containing 1 106 cfu e coli 2 mg feso4 7h2o 120 mg mos2 and 32 μl h2o2 under a ph value between 3 5 and 3 7 as shown in fig 2 a as a result the inactivation rate was 20 13 when only h2o2 32 μl was added it had a slight increase in inactivation rate of e coli with the continue addition of 2 mg feso4 7h2o which was attributed to the formation of oh generated from the fe2 h2o2 fenton reaction furthermore after a quick reaction time for 1 min the inactivation rate of e coli could reach up to 83 37 with the further introduction of 120 mg mos2 which increased by 2 5 times than that of the fe2 h2o2 reaction in order to clearly compare the antibacterial results of different reaction systems it was summarized the survival rate of e coli under different reaction conditions in table s1 as expected the co catalytic system of feso4 h2o2 mos2 shows the best disinfection result which is much better than the antibacterial results of h2o2 without fe or mos2 only the values of log n n colony forming units of fig 2a have been summarized in table s2 not surprisingly the feso4 h2o2 mos2 system exhibited the lowest log n value after 1 min reaction indicating the highest antibacterial efficiency of e coli in order to exclude that mos2 itself has a strong ability to inactivate bacteria it was also investigated the inactivation performance of e coli in the only presence of 120 mg of mos2 as shown in fig 2a there was only 14 13 of inactivation rate for 120 mg mos2 control experiment which suggested that mos2 had a little influence on the inactivation performance of bacteria liu et al 2016 furthermore the interaction between mos2 and h2o2 was explored by only introducing mos2 and h2o2 in the system which shows only 32 83 inactivation rate 0 9 nacl was employed as the solvent and diluent for the control experiment as shown in fig s1a the results showed a similar regular with that in sterilized water in our case the disinfection rate of mos2 co catalytic fenton system is very fast it takes only 30 min to achieve 100 inactivation rate of e coli fig 2b and s2 it has been demonstrated that in such a short period of time e coli are almost survival in sterilized water fig s1b obviously the mos2 co catalytic fenton system exhibits the highest bactericidal activity in all reference experiments which is higher than the sum of any two reference experiments to further improve the efficiency of disinfection it was prolonged the reaction time to 30 min and continued to add fenton reagent at 10 min and 20 min during the reaction it was found that the conventional fenton reaction could limitedly reduce the cell density log n 6 17 in fig 2b and the e coli still have a 45 4 survival rate fig s2 as expected the mos2 co catalytic fenton system could achieve 100 removal of e coli fig s2 and the remaining cell density is close to zero as shown in fig 2b in addition to e coli the staphylococcus aureus s aureus as the model of gram positive bacteria was used to further explore the applicability of the mos2 co catalytic fenton system in disinfection seen from fig s3 the mos2 co catalytic fenton system also had a similar regular for the inactivation of s aureus with the presence of mos2 it could achieve a 68 54 inactivation rate while the conventional fenton only showed a 25 51 inactivation rate considering the standard of water purification that no bacteria could be detected in treated water we have continued to add 2 mg feso4 and 32 μl h2o2 at 10 min and 20 min during the reaction the mos2 co catalytic fenton system could achieve 99 96 removal of s aureus fig s2a c and the remaining cell density has a significant decrease compared to that of the conventional fenton reaction all the results indeed demonstrated that the mos2 as a co catalyst could significantly improve the inactivation of bacteria in fenton system fig 3 shows the sterilization photos over different fenton systems there was only a little decrease in the number of survival colonies in the presence of only h2o2 fig 3a and b indicating the limitation of h2o2 for disinfection as a comparison the conventional fenton reaction composed by 2 mg feso4 7h2o and 32 μl h2o2 exhibits a little higher bactericidal activity than that of blank h2o2 fig 3c and d it is important to highlight that the inactivating effect could reached up to 83 37 under the co catalytic effect of mos2 fig 3e and f after 1 min of reaction the number of colonies fell sharply with the help of mos2 co catalytic effect the representative sem images of bacterial membrane revealed that breakage was occurred after disinfectant treatment by the mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction fig 3g and h before reaction the e coli cell has a complete cell structure fig 3g which shows a well rod shape with length of 2 5 μm after 1 min of fenton reaction the cell walls of e coli were destroyed obviously indicating an effective inactivation of e coli over the mos2 co catalytic system 3 2 efficient and recyclable bactericidal performance in order to demonstrate the rapid response capability of mos2 co catalytic fe2 h2o2 system it was tested the inactivation performance of e coli after prolonging the reaction time as shown in fig 4 a the survival rate dramatically reduced to 21 88 within 10 min suggesting the outstanding bactericidal ability it shows that the survival rate of e coli did not significantly decrease after the reaction was extended to 30 min 16 27 indicating that the h2o2 had been rapidly decomposed by the fe2 in the presence of mos2 in addition it also have been done a comparison between the previous reports and mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction on the water disinfection as shown table s3 compared with the reported fenton reaction the mos2 co catalytic fenton system has obvious advantages in bactericidal effect and reaction rate most of the reported fenton reactions showed a very low bactericidal efficiency 50 after a long reaction time 40 min but in our case the antibacterial rate of mos2 co catalytic system can reach 83 37 in 1 min even compared to other energy consumed disinfection systems such as photo fenton photocatalysis and electro catalysis the mos2 co catalytic fenton system still performs relatively fast bactericidal activity we have roughly calculated the cost and simply compared with several reports below the table s3 as a result it could be found that the cost of mos2 co catalytic fenton system has an advantage compared to other reported fenton reaction for the water purification it is worthwhile mentioning that the commercially available mos2 system costs less than the synthetic reaction systems in table s3 to further evaluate the stability performance of mos2 as co catalyst cycling test of bacterial inactivation was carried out during the mos2 co catalytic fe2 h2o2 reaction the physicochemical stability of mos2 is important for the practical applications the mos2 was recycled through centrifugation and dried in a vacuum oven before next reuse as shown in fig 4b the results showed a stable co catalytic performance in fe2 h2o2 reaction for the inactivation of e coli only slight deterioration was observed after six cycling test maybe due to the mass loss during the cycle test after six cycles the quantity of mos2 had a decreased but its crystalline structure remained unchanged the xrd patterns of commercial mos2 before and after cycles were shown in fig 4c obviously the intensity and position of the peaks remained unchanged after the cycling test indicating the structural stability of the mos2 in order to demonstrate the stability of mos2 in the co catalytic fenton reaction the plasma emission spectrometer was explored to detect the concentration of mo and s ions after 2 h reaction as a result the dissolution rates of mo and s ions were only 0 82 and 1 25 in table s4 respectively the limited s ions suggest that the sulfur is not continuously escaping from the mos2 surface and the pure mos2 exhibits a negligible antibacterial activity 10 in fig 2a indicating the escaping s has a negligible effect on the disinfection moreover the morphology of mos2 also remained changeless after the cycling test fig s4 it can be seen that the multilayered structure of mos2 was nearly unchanged even after six cycling test the raman spectra of mos2 also showed an unchanged position of peaks and no new peaks could be observed fig s5 all the above results indicate the great potential of mos2 co catalytic fe2 h2o2 reaction in practical water disinfection 3 3 mechanism investigation the conventional fenton reaction mainly includes two equations as followed 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 2 fe3 h2o2 fe2 h o2h in this process fe2 catalyzes the decomposition of h2o2 to generate the oh at first which has a high efficiency eq 1 but the eq 2 determines the overall efficiency of conventional fenton reaction due to its low reaction rate xing et al 2018a li et al 2016 the key to improve the efficiency of conventional fenton reaction is to facilitate the conversion of fe3 to fe2 which could significantly promote the decomposition of h2o2 for the generation of oh and the oh as the primary reactive oxygen species ros has a highly inactivation performance of bacteria in water villegas guzman et al 2017 huang et al 2017 therefore in order to demonstrate that mos2 could facilitate the conversion of fe3 to fe2 it was conducted some experiments to investigate the role of mos2 in mos2 assisted fe2 h2o2 for inactivation of e coli in the previous discovery the surface of mos2 could capture the protons in the hydrogen evolution reaction li et al 2017c voiry et al 2016 similarly the unsaturated s atoms firstly formed by dispersion of commercial mos2 in water would capture the protons to generate h2s on the surface of mos2 which was detected by uv vis measurements as shown in fig 5 a compared with the absorption curve of mos2 supernatant there was a new and broad absorption peak at approximately 297 nm in the uv range after adding agno3 into mos2 supernatant which was corresponded to the absorption wavelength of ag2s jarosz et al 2013 the generation of h2s indicated the formation of sulfur vacancies on the surface of mos2 which was further confirmed by erp measurements in fig 5b the epr spectra displayed obvious sulfur vacancies at a signal of g 2 0 after commercial mos2 being washed with water and dried in the vacuum at room temperature additionally the molar ratio of dissolved s to mo is much greater than 2 1 s mo 5 1 in table s4 further confirming that there is a large amount of mo4 left on the surface of mos2 as a result the exposed mo4 on the surface of mos2 would facilitate the conversion of fe3 to fe2 by the oxidation reduction reaction the equations can be listed as follows 3 mo4 fe3 mo6 fe2 4 mo6 h2o2 mo4 h2o o2 to confirm the oxidation reduction reaction between mo4 and fe3 it was detected the relative concentrations of fe2 and fe3 in mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction the uv vis spectroscopy was employed to record the absorption value changes of fe2 colored by 1 mg ml 1 10 phenanthroline monohydrate and fe3 colored by 1 mg ml kscn in reaction solution iqbal et al 2016 mondal et al 2007 as shown in fig 5c obviously higher concentration of fe2 was detected at the beginning of reaction after 1 min the relative concentration of fe2 significantly reduced along with the generation of fe3 indicating the rapid response efficiency between fe2 and h2o2 eq 1 subsequently the relative concentration of fe2 would gradually increase when the reaction time continued to 15 min owing to the oxidation reduction reaction between mo4 and fe3 eq 3 in addition the mos2 assisted fe2 h2o2 system exhibits much higher concentration of fe2 than that of the conventional fe2 h2o2 at the end of the reaction fig s6 indicating mos2 could facilitate the conversion of fe3 to fe2 it was further confirmed the oxidation reduction reaction between mo4 and fe3 by xps measurements the fig 5d shows the mo 3d xps spectrum of mos2 before and after inactivation experiment of e coli a slight red shift of mo 3d peaks was attributed to a decrease of electron cloud of mo 3d due to the oxidation of mo4 to mo6 the electron of mo4 would be captured by fe3 in reaction solution eq 3 which caused an increase on binding energy of mo 3d different with our previous work xing et al 2018 there is no obvious new peak appeared at 236 ev corresponding to mo6 indicating a rapid reduction process of mo6 to mo4 in the presence of h2o2 in solution eq 4 in our previous report on the mos2 co catalytic fenton for the remediation of organic pollutants xing et al 2018 0 07 mmol l h2o2 was used in the system but in this case 0 56 mmol l h2o2 was employed for the disinfection a relative high quantity of h2o2 would promote the reduction of mo6 to mo4 as a result the characteristic peak of mo6 in mo 3d xps spectrum is very weak and the reduction of fe3 by the mo4 would decrease the electron cloud density of mo4 which could make the mo4 xps peak shift to a high binding energy these results further confirm the presence of eq 3 and eq 4 in mos2 co catalytic fenton system for the inactivation of e coli according to the mentioned mechanism it suggests that mos2 could facilitate the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 to generate more oh in the fenton reaction besides h2o2 and mos2 the oh as the mainly ros has a highly inactivation performance of bacteria in this system in the previous discussion there was a relatively low inactivation rate of e coli in the only presence of h2o2 or mos2 it demonstrated that both h2o2 and mos2 could serve as oxidants to inactivate e coli which is consistent with the previous reported liu et al 2016 villegas guzman et al 2017 huang et al 2017 therefore the oh generated from the decomposition of h2o2 served as the powerful oxidants to inactivate e coli it was detected the signal of oh generated from the different reaction systems in the presence of 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo as shown in fig 6 a compared to the weak epr signals of the conventional fe2 h2o2 reaction the mos2 assisted fe2 h2o2 displayed the characteristic quartet signals of oh matuszak et al 1997 this result supported the efficient co catalytic activity of mos2 for the generation of oh from the decomposition of h2o2 subsequently it was quantitatively analyzed the amount of oh in the different reaction systems by photoluminescence pl spectrum as shown in fig 6b the mos2 assisted fe2 h2o2 exhibited a significantly enhanced pl signals of hydroxyl benzoic which was 3 5 times than that of the conventional fe2 h2o2 reaction to calculate the h2o2 decomposition efficiency in this mos2 fenton system it was conducted the experiment to measure the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 into hydroxyl radicals by heating 32 μl h2o2 with 40 mg benzoic acid for 120 min seen from figs s7 and 6b the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 in mos2 co catalytic fenton system was 61 5 527 34 857 5 100 which is much higher than the yield of 17 5 149 65 857 5 100 for the conventional fenton reaction in previous research isopropanol can serve as sacrificial agent to capture the oh xia et al 2015 it was demonstrated that the oh serving as the ros was quite critical for inactivation of e coli by the addition of scavenger in mos2 co catalytic system before conducting the experiment the concentration of isopropanol was optimized to ensure its scavenging effect it should be pointed out that the single isopropanol cannot cause any inactivation of e coli as shown in fig 6c with the addition of 0 5 mm isopropanol the inactivation rate of e coli was obviously prohibited compared to that of no scavenger addition in addition there was only 37 12 of inactivation rate for the mos2 co catalytic fe2 h2o2 in the presence of isopropanol experiment which is similar with the mos2 h2o2 disinfection activity 32 82 further confirmed that the oh serving as the ros was quite critical for the inactivation of e coli in the mos2 co catalytic system in order to eliminate the effect of superoxide on the disinfection the inactivation of e coli experiment was performed by introducing argon into the mos2 co catalytic fenton system to remove the oxygen fig 6c as a result the inactivation rate of e coli had a little inhibition which suggested that superoxide radicals as ros had a negligible role in the mos2 co catalytic fenton system for the disinfection hence it can be concluded that the mos2 could facilitate the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 to generate more oh in the fenton reaction and the generated oh is the primary ros accounting for the bacterial inactivation process it is important to highlight that other metal sulfates cuso4 niso4 or other metal sulfides ws2 zns2 also have an excellent ability to inactivation of e coli by the co catalytic decomposition of h2o2 as shown in fig s8 the inactivation rate is 59 77 of cuso4 60 35 of niso4 51 22 of zns and 86 03 of ws2 respectively therefore it was proposed the bactericidal mechanism of mos2 co catalytic fenton reaction as seen in fig 7 in this system the exposed active sites of mo4 on the surface of mos2 can facilitate the conversion of fe3 to fe2 which is critical for the improvement of decomposition efficiency of h2o2 in the fenton reaction for the inactivation of e coli mos2 can facilitate the decomposition efficiency of h2o2 to generate more oh in the fenton reaction and the generated oh is the primary ros accounting for the bacterial inactivation process as a result by adding mos2 in fenton reaction it can reach up to 83 37 for the inactivation of e coli within 1 min and 100 of inactivation rate within 30 min which is much higher than that of the conventional fenton reaction 4 conclusion in summary it has been developed an excellent co catalytic mos2 assisted fenton system which has achieved rapid and highly efficient inactivation of e coli the exposed mo4 species in mos2 can facilitate the conversion of fe3 to fe2 after the removal of unsaturated s atoms it is critical for the improvement of decomposition efficiency of h2o2 in mos2 assisted fe2 h2o2 for inactivation of e coli what s more it is also found that other metal sulfates cuso4 niso4 or other metal sulfides ws2 zns2 also have an excellent ability to inactivation of e coli we believe this study will provide a new perspective for rapid and highly efficient inactivation of bacteria in water

19312,a staged impoundment scheme was adopted for the three gorges reservoir tgr to increase its maximal water level from 135 to 175 m between 2003 and 2010 however the variation in phosphorus distribution and its bioavailability in the water column and surface sediment during this period is still uncertain field surveys and historical monitoring data related to water column surface sediment total phosphorus tp and fractional contents and water bloom characteristics were used to identify the effects of staged impoundment on phosphorus distribution and water eutrophication in the tgr it is indicated that retention of particulate phosphorus pp bounded suspended sediment ss caused an average of 4 69 12 28 decline in water column tp between 2004 and 2010 compared with that measured between 1998 and 2003 phosphorus did not notably accumulate in the mainstream surface sediment when the impoundment water level increased from 135 to 175 m the mainstream surface sediment was relatively clean and the release of sediment bioavailable p bio p contributed to 0 013 of dissolved phosphorus dp concentrations in the water column when impoundment of the tgr was 175 m an increase in dissolved bio p in the water column and weak hydrodynamic conditions stimulated the outburst of water bloom in more tributaries when the impoundment water level increased from 135 to 175 m and the dominant algae gradually evolved from river dominated species to lake dominated species therefore it is necessary to limit the entry of dp from the upstream and tributaries into the tgr and manage tp loads in the tgr as a lake rather than as a river in the future keywords three gorges reservoir water column bioavailability eutrophication algal bloom 1 introduction the three gorges dam tgd located in the upper mainstream section of the changjiang river is the world s largest water conservancy and hydroelectric project fu et al 2010 the three gorges reservoir tgr spreads across the reach of the changjiang river between jiangjin of chongqing city and yichang of hubei province with a total water surface area of 1 08 103 km2 and a storage capacity of 39 3 billion cubic meters wang et al 2013 the tgr provides substantial benefits in flood control navigation water supply and power generation but unavoidably affects river environments and ecology during the pre tgr period mean mainstream water levels were no more than 80 m in depth cnemc 1998 2016 a staged impoundment scheme was adopted and implemented in 2003 2006 and 2010 by raising the storage level of the tgr to 135 156 and 175 m to investigate and mitigate the potential negative effects of this reservoir operation on the eco environment wang et al 2013 therefore since 2010 the tgr has been fully operational with the water level fluctuating between 145 m in the wet season from april to september and 175 m in the dry season from october to mid april the presence of the tgd considerably reduced the average flow velocity of the changjiang river from 3 to 5 m s to 0 09 2 43 m s cnemc 1998 2016 slow water flow in the tgr has facilitated the adsorption of dissolved pollutants on suspended sediments ss sedimentation of particle pollutants and also eutrophication of tributaries liu et al 2016 algal blooms have formed in approximately 10 of the tgr s associated tributaries and bays since 2003 zhang et al 2012a eutrophication remains as the most significant challenge in the post tgr period phosphorus was identified as the limiting nutrient responsible for eutrophication in the tgr han et al 2018 water trophic status and algae growth are closely related to the content of bioavailable phosphorus bio p in the water column which is mainly determined by the level of total phosphorus tp and its bioavailable fractions in the overlying water and surface sediment previous research indicates that tp concentrations of the mainstream water column tended to decrease during the post tgr period lou et al 2011 however the tp load in mainstream surface sediment of the tgr was insignificantly increased since 2003 pan et al 2018 therefore impoundment may have different effects on phosphorus storage and its bioavailability in the water column and surface sediment sediment is the important environmental media of phosphorus and plays a key role in regulating phosphorus distribution and its bioavailability wu et al 2016 impoundment of the tgr resulted in an accumulation of fine sediment particles cwrc 2000 2016 which are known to adsorb more dissolved phosphorus dp than coarse particles yao et al 2016 the enrichment of sediment organic matter om and fe al hydroxides in fine particles resulted in a high content of sediment tp and a high affinity of water column phosphorus tang et al 2014b therefore deposition of fine sediment particles may increase the bioavailability of dp in the water column and contribute to the source of phosphorus release from the mainstream bed sediment to the overlying water column when environmental conditions change tang et al 2015a b staged impoundment has directly impacted ss transportation and deposition however its effect on associated water column and surface sediment phosphorus load and its bioavailability remains unclear previous studies mostly focus on phosphorus distribution in the tgr and its water level fluctuating zone and tributaries during the post tgr period impoundment caused a decline in the water column tp concentrations even in the flood season due to the efficient retention of particulate phosphorus pp bounded ss lou et al 2011 accumulation of pp in the parts of surface sediment increased the potential risk of phosphorus releasing into the overlying water wang et al 2009 2015 han et al 2018 the sediment or soil in the water level fluctuating zone of the tgr exhibited a seasonal change between the sink and source for phosphorus and soil organic phosphorus org p and fe al oxides bound phosphorus fe alp were the major contributors to the released phosphorus zhang et al 2012b other researchers have investigated and evaluated sediment or soil phosphorus distribution status in tributaries such as the daning river xiangxi river and pengxi river wang et al 2009 luo et al 2015 huang et al 2017 so far most studies concentrated on the phosphorus distribution in the water column and surface sediment when the beginning of the impoundment the changes in distribution dynamics of tp and its fractions in the mainstream water column and surface sediment during the complete impoundment period have not been reported in this study water and surface sediment samples were collected from 13 sites located in the mainstream of the tgr and analyzed for phosphorus distribution and relationships were explored between sediment compositions and phosphorus distribution historical water column tp and sediment phosphorus data were also used to explore the effects of the staged increase in the impoundment water level on phosphorus distribution and its bioavailability the findings of this study provide relevant information for nutrient management in the tgr 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sample collection and measurement sample collection mainstream water samples were collected in triplicate between october 15 2010 and november 25 2010 at 13 sampling sites along the mainstream of the tgr fig 1 all sampling sites were located at representative sections selected according to the code for reservoir hydrologic and sediment surveys sl 339 2006 mwr 2006 the 13 sites wujiang wj ruxi rx

added to inhibit bacterial activity approximately 80 ml of the water sample was filtered at the point of collection through a 0 45 μm celluloseacetate filter and then stored at 4 c within a portable refrigerator the residual unfiltered 120 ml water was also stored at 4 c using the same procedure during the sampling period ph water temperature dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec and turbidity were measured using a portable ysi proplus meter usa flow velocity was determined at each sampling site by using a direct reading current meter global water phosphorus fraction analysis all water samples were immediately transported to the laboratory for total dissolved phosphorus tdp soluble reactive phosphorus srp and tp determination after 2 h of digestion with potassium persulfate in an autoclave tdp tp and srp without digestion were measured using the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method apha 1998 total particulate phosphorus pp in water means dp bound to water column particles which was assumed to be equivalent to the difference between the tp and tdp for water and following sediment sample analysis all the instruments had passed national measurement examination and reference materials and standard reagents were used for quality control during the post tgr period tp was measured according to the environmental quality standards for drinking water gb 3838 2002 mep 2002b and the phosphorus content of the supernatant was determined as tp loads after the static sedimentation of the water samples for 0 5 h whereas water and ss fully mixed samples without sedimentation were immediately measured to obtain tp concentrations before the impoundment 2 2 sediment sample collection and measurement sample collection between october 15 2010 and november 25 2010 approximately 1 0 kg of surface sediment samples 0 10 cm were collected using a grab sampler at the same sites as water samples fig 1 surface sediment samples were fully mixed and transported to the laboratory on the same day as collection within a portable refrigerator at 4 c zhang et al 2012c each sediment sample was divided into two parts one part was used to determine the particle size distribution and the other was air dried and sieved using 100 mm diameter mesh for analysis of sediment ph om mineral composition and phosphorus fractions physicochemical property determination ph and om content for all samples were determined according to the methods reported by tang et al 2014a sediment particle size distribution was determined using a horiba 950v2 laser diffraction particle size analyzer mineral compositions of the sediment samples were determined through powder x ray diffraction xrd analysis by using a d8 advance diffractometer bruker axs inc xrd patterns were recorded using ni filtered cu kα radiation step size 0 02 s operating voltage 40 kv scan range 2θ 5 65 phosphorus fraction analysis sequential extraction of phosphorus was undertaken to determine the phosphorus species twenty five milliliter of 1 mol l nh4cl was added to 500 mg of sediment dry weight equivalent and the suspension was shaken for 0 5 h after shaking the suspension was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was decanted this process was repeated with 0 5 mol l nh4f shaken for 1 h 0 1 mol l naoh shaken for 2 h and shaken for 2 h again after standing for 16 h 0 3 mol l na3c6h5o7 2h2o shaken for 0 5 h and then with 0 5 mol l h2so4 shaken for 1 h these fractions represented exchangeable phosphorus ex p phosphorus bound by al oxides alp phosphorus bound by fe oxides fe p occluded phosphorus op and calcium bound phosphorus cap respectively the tp content within the sediments was determined with the standards measurements and testing smt protocol and treating the sub sample at 720 c followed by 3 mol l h2so4 extraction ruban et al 2001 2 3 historical data collection and analysis historical monitoring data for water column tp were obtained from the yangtze river water resources protection bureau crwc literature related to phosphorus contents in surface sediments before and after impoundment were collected from wanfang data and sciencedirect samples had been collected between june and october for the tgr inflow usually carries more pp associated ss during the wet season than during the dry season tang et al 2015a b tang et al 2018 and tp loads in surface sediment were theoretically higher in the wet season than that in the dry season however insignificant difference in sediment tp contents was observed in one hydrological year cao et al 2011 moreover zhuo et al 2017a investigated the trends of tp loads in the mainstream and tributary surface sediment of the tgr between 2000 and 2015 and found that tp contents fluctuated during different flow periods but no regular difference in sediment tp contents ratio were detected between july and january therefore the impact of variability in sampling period on sediment tp loads was acceptable for historical data comparison three different pretreatment methods including acid digestion with h2so4 hclo4 and hno3 hfhclo4 cao et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 tan et al 2012 zhang 2013 pan et al 2016 wu et al 2016 zhuo et al 2017a were commonly used in the literature for determining sediment tp content in the tgr varied sediment om levels were mainly responsible for the variability in the digestion performance and inconsistency of tp results however sediment tp determination via acid digestion with different reagents gave uniformly small variances ostrofsky 2012 moreover there is no regular difference in the sediment component along the mainstream of the tgr pan et al 2018 therefore data collected from literature using different pretreatment procedures can be used to make a comparison with our tested values phosphorus fractions in the sediment before and after the impoundment of the tgr were also collected from the published literature in wanfang data and sciencedirect to evaluate the impacts of impoundment on sediment phosphorus bioavailability furthermore in order to identify the status of sediment phosphorus bioavailability in the changjiang river basin sediment bio p ex p fe alp measured in the tgr was compared with that in representative lakes and large reservoirs hydrology and sediment data of the tgr were collected from the changjiang sediment bulletin cwrc 2000 2016 and water quality and algal bloom data were obtained from the bulletin of ecological and environmental monitoring of the three gorges project in the yangtze river cnemc 1998 2016 average annual water column tp concentrations for the five nationally controlled mainstream sections zhuto cuntan qingyangxi shaiwangba and peishi related to the tgr between 1997 and 2010 were obtained from the changjiang water resource protection bureau which belongs to the cwrc all statistical tests were performed using spss software spss 2003 including multivariable correlation matrix calculations for the phosphorus fractions and sediment compositions 3 results and discussion 3 1 phosphorus distribution dynamics in the water column as shown in table 1 mainstream flow velocity along the tgr was reduced following impoundment a 90 higher reduction amplitude was obtained during the dry season and the measured flow velocity considerably decreased from approximately 0 56 m s in wj to nearly 0 05 m s in lm and mp the water column had a low ss content in the dry season and turbidity ranged from 3 01 to 8 79 ntu water in the tgr was alkaline in general and its ph value ranged from 7 98 to 8 20 the water ec exhibited a moderate declining trend along the mainstream section of the tgr decreasing from nearly 400 μs cm in the upper river reaches to 358 μs cm in mp table 1 the water column was aerobic and the do concentrations were generally higher than 7 0 mg l the presence of tgd considerably changed the hydrologic regime and led to a variation in the distribution of phosphorus as shown in table 1 tp dtp pp and srp exhibited a declining trend from the upper reach to the lower reach pp sedimentation accompanying the decline in flow velocity contributed to the reduction in the tp concentration the pp concentration gradually decreased from the 0 05 mg l in md to 0 009 mg l in mp pp retention reduced the pp tp ratio from 30 in wj to approximately 10 in mp consequently the tp concentration decreased from 0 133 mg l in wj to 0 087 mg l in mp table 1 sediment retention may have increased the availability of srp because the calculated srp pp ratio increased from 217 in wj to 800 in mp table 1 because of a low concentration of pp in the water column srp was the major component of tp and tdp the high srp tp ratio may have triggered algal blooms in the spring and autumn the distribution of tp concentration in the water column exhibited a u pattern during the dry season for all five controlled mainstream sections when the impoundment water level increased from 135 to 175 m fig 2 the lowest tp concentration in the water column was most notable between 2006 and 2008 fig 2 efficient sediment retention by the tgd greatly reduced the water column pp loads and contributed to the initial decline in mainstream tp following the first impoundment in 2003 tang et al 2018 in addition to impoundment of water input of dp by wastewater discharge from the tgr region and phosphorus release from sediments both tended to increase during the post tgr period zhuo et al 2017a consequently increasing dp entry compensates or even exceeds the reduction of pp and causes the u pattern distribution of mainstream tp as shown in fig 2 annual average tp concentrations during flood normal and dry seasons between 2004 and 2010 respectively were 4 69 9 91 and 12 28 lower than those correspondingly observed between 1997 and 2003 fig 3 impoundment resulting in the decline of the mainstream water column tp load can be explained based on two aspects 1 a change in the pretreatment procedures of tp determination for tgr water samples mainstream water column tp loads were linearly and positively related to ss concentrations in the tgr during the wet season wang and lv 2007 pp accounted for more than 50 of the tp tang et al 2018 and static sedimentation of 0 5 h may cause between 43 65 and 50 93 decline of water column tp li et al 2005 static sedimentation pretreatment obviously resulted in the reduction of measured water column tp and mainstream tp loads during the post tgr period actually increased if the pretreatment procedures of tp determination during the pre tgr period applied 2 retention of ss reduced the water column tp load a study indicated that more than 80 of phosphorus bounded to sediment particles if the ss concentration exceeded 500 mg l lou et al 2011 during the pre tgr period pp accounted for 50 85 of tp wang et al 2007 after the tgr entered into fully operational mode approximately 75 of the water column pp has been trapped during the flood season tang et al 2018 the presence of the tgd resulted in the efficient retention of ss the concentration of ss sharply decreased from more than 400 mg l between 1998 and 2002 to less than 100 mg l after 2004 in the taipingxi section and the sedimentation of ss mainly caused the decline of water column tp loads during the post tgr period lou et al 2011 moreover due to effective sediment traps at upstream reservoirs along with appropriate water and soil conservation measures pp loads input to the tgr during the wet season has been reduced more than 90 in 2017 when compared to that measured in 1990s tang et al 2018 which was comparable with a 84 5 reduction reported by zhou et al 2013 the presence of the tgd led to a slight reduction in tp concentrations but the availability of dp in the water column considerably increased due to the sedimentation of ss moreover the annual domestic wastewater discharge volume from the tgr region increased from less than 0 25 to approximately 0 80 billion tons per year from 1996 to 2014 and the annual average phosphorus fertilizer consumption increased 16 during the same period zhuo et al 2017b in china the discharge standard for phosphorus in municipal wastewater is higher than 1 0 mg l mep 2002a therefore domestic wastewater discharge results in 800 tons of dp input annually and contributes to 1 02 of the annual total water column phosphorus loads a calculation based on the annual average runoff of 451 billion m3 at yichang section which is located behind the tgd cwrc 2000 2016 3 2 phosphorus distribution dynamics in surface sediments sediment ph values om particle size and compositions are listed in table 2 sediment ph values ranged from 7 41 to 7 69 indicating a decreasing trend from upstream to downstream the enrichment of calcareous minerals may result in the weak alkalinity of sediment in the tgr pan et al 2016 om contents ranged from 7 79 to 55 63 mg kg with an average level of 39 95 mg kg table 2 the lowest value of om appeared in wj which can be explained by intensive mine exploitation in the wujiang basin stripping the surface litter and fertile topsoil zhuo et al 2014 and exposing the pure soil or mineral components that had little om chlorite illite quartz feldspar calcite dolomite amphibole and iron pyrite were the main sediment components in the tgr table 2 the average proportions of chlorite illite and quartz related to the total sediment mass were 28 23 and 25 respectively a difference in the status of water and soil loss in the drainage area of tributaries may cause irregular distribution of sediment compositions quartz proportions in mainstream sediments were between 61 4 and 72 4 during the pre tgr wang et al 2006 which was much higher than the 25 listed in table 2 impoundment led to a notable increase in chlorite and illite contents li et al 2012a and more weatherable minerals were observed with the decrease in sediment grain particle size measured median particle size d50 ranged from 3 84 to 23 65 μm with an average value of 7 50 μm higher sediment particle d50 values occurred in wj and ws which had similar mineral components high proportions of quartz and low proportions of illite table 2 according to the china soil partition method wang and kang 1991 clay 4 μm and fine sand 4 63 μm dominated sediment fractions in all the mainstream sediment samples the mean particle size of the surface sediment in the mainstream section of the tgr decreased from 0 011 to 0 009 mm between 2003 and 2010 compared with the values acquired in the 1990s crwc 2000 2010 taking the controlled cuntan section as an example the median sediment particle size tended to decline whereas the volume of sediment deposited increased when the impoundment water level increased from 135 m in 2003 to 175 m in 2010 fig 4 increased fine particle deposition facilitated the enrichment of phosphorus in the sediment during the post tgr period sediment was usually regarded as the sink for phosphorus because internal release negligibly contributed to the total phosphorus loads in the water column wang et al 2015 moreover mainstream water column phosphorus concentrations fig 2 already greatly exceeded their threshold values of 0 02 mg l for eutrophication ji et al 2017 therefore annually increased in sediment deposition encourage the enrichment of sediment nutrients in the tgr but have limited impacts on trophic status of the tgr augmentation in the impoundment water level may favor the sedimentation of coarse particles and thus cause suspended sediment particles to be more fine and small moreover weak hydrodynamic conditions and slow water flow during the post tgr period supported the sedimentation and accumulation of fine particles in the mainstream compared with that in natural river channel conditions tang et al 2018 mainstream sediment tp content ranged from 570 06 to 837 92 mg kg with an average value of 744 88 mg kg fig 5 these ranges were comparable with that reported for besko reservoir in poland 533 832 mg kg piwińska et al 2018 cruzeta reservoir in brazil 711 982 mg kg cavalcante et al 2018 and shahid rajaie dam in iran 495 744 mg kg shakeri et al 2016 efficient ss trapping capacity caused much faster sediment deposition in the reservoir than in the lakes in the changjiang river basin yao et al 2006 and surface sediment in most of the reservoirs were freshly formed and mainly consisted of fine sand similar deposition conditions and sediment components probably resulted in the comparable tp loads between the tgr and other reservoirs elsewhere the bd sections received a total of 1 44 million tons of wastewater discharged from bd county in 2010 however only 49 5 of the treated effluent reached the discharge quality standard tp 1 0 mg l for municipal wastewater mep 2002a therefore excessive domestic wastewater discharge may have resulted in phosphorus contamination of the sediment and caused the high tp content occurring in bd moreover the calculated enrichment index of phosphorus for all sampling sites was larger than 1 0 when compared with the background value of 507 62 mg p kg for soil in the tgr region tang et al 2015a b which implicated that mainstream sediment of the tgr exhibited a certain degree of phosphorus pollution a slightly increasing trend was noted for the mainstream sediment tp content when the impoundment water level gradually increased from 135 to 175 m fig 6 however the increase in the impoundment water level did not lead to the obvious accumulation of tp in the mainstream sediment concluded by zhuo et al 2017a during the post tgr period sediment grain size distribution shifted to being smaller and more fine fig 4 which supported the adsorption and storage of phosphorus sediment phosphorus levels may remain elevated due to the continual sediment deposition nevertheless the deposited surface sediment layer formed in autumn might be partly destroyed and flushed downstream in the following year due to the tgr adopting an operation model of discharging muddy water in the wet season to prevent sediment deposition li et al 2015a a previous study indicated that scouring of deposited sediment in the tgr mostly occurred above the critical flow velocity of 1 1 m s li et al 2015b during the flood season most of the mainstream sections near the tgd had flows lower than 0 10 m s cwrc 2000 2016 therefore discharging muddy water may probably promote sediment migration in the upstream of the tgr but is unlikely to discharge bed sediment to the tgr s downstream moreover long time series sediment deposition as well as tp content data should be collected to investigate the actual effects of discharging muddy water on sediment tp storage dynamics 3 3 sediment phosphorus bioavailability in the present study ex p and alp contents ranged from 2 64 to 12 78 mg kg and from 15 22 mg kg to 52 23 mg kg respectively moreover ex p and alp exhibited a non significant increasing trend from upstream to downstream fig 5 the content of fep was lower than that of other sediment phosphorus fractions and its distribution was irregular with the maximal and minimal fep contents of 2 17 and 0 12 mg kg observed in md and bd respectively cap and op were invariably higher than other p fractions with the exception of dn cap was uniform and fell in the range of 431 15 592 76 mg kg fig 5 different phosphorus fractions in sediment have various bioavailabilities soluble ex p is the most immediately available phosphorus within sediment ribeiro et al 2008 the average ex p measured within the tgr sediment was 8 44 mg kg which was higher than 3 57 mg kg reported in the danjiangkou reservoir another large reservoir used as a drinking water source in china tang et al 2014a but considerably lower than many values reported for eutrophic lakes ribeiro et al 2008 fep or alp can be exchanged with oh and other inorganic phosphorus compounds and used for the evaluation of algal available phosphorus zhou et al 2001 fep and alp contents were generally higher in eutrophic and non calcareous environments with the highest proportion being 70 penn et al 1995 higher fe alp contents can usually be regarded as a result of anthropogenic inputs wu et al 2011 relatively low water column tp loads in the tgr table 1 indicated the light contamination of sediment and thus caused low fe alp to tp proportions compared with those reported in heavily polluted eutrophic lake sediments jin et al 2006 cap dominated the phosphorus fractions for the sediment in the tgr and was reported to be relatively stable especially in neutral and alkaline environments such as the tgr and was attributed to the permanent burial of phosphorus within sediment particles jin et al 2006 op represented the inertia phosphorus bound to hydrous iron oxides and phytoplankton ji et al 2009 our measured op content values of 227 19 387 35 mg kg for the tgr were higher than the reported range of 71 57 174 15 mg kg for the danjiangkou reservoir tang et al 2014a the level of op stored within the sediment directly reflects the amount of natural phosphorus inputs to the receiving water body zhang et al 2012b the tgr region belongs to the acid rain zone of the changjiang river basin lu et al 2013 and long term and frequent acid rainfall intensified the soil weathering and subsequent formation of op thus augmenting the sediment op contents moreover op proportions to tp in the soil obtained in the tgr region can reach higher than 50 an 2011 sediment bio p can be calculated as the sum of ex p fep and alp the average proportion of bio p to tp was 6 21 in this study which was higher than the approximate 5 obtained during the pre tgr period pan et al 2018 but lower than 11 54 50 18 observed for the eutrophic lakes of taihu chaohu and dianchi located in the changjiang rvier basin fig 7 relatively low sediment bio p content in the tgr can be explained as follows 1 the dominant fine sand compositions of the surface sediment table 1 have poor affinity to dp compared with clay or silt tang et al 2014a 2 limited water column tp loads 0 15 mg l hindered the efficient transfer and adsorption of dp to ss and thus impaired the enrichment of phosphorus into the pp and 3 discharging muddy water during the wet season was unfavorable for the continual accumulation of pp in the surface sediment of the tgr water and soil conservation and sediment trapped by upstream reservoirs may have further reduced the particle size and amount of sediment that entered into the tgr accompanied by the increase in the impoundment water level therefore a potential augmentation in sediment bio p contents and a decline in deposited sediment volume increased the uncertainty and complexity regarding the contribution of the sediment bio p to dp loads in the water column 3 4 impacts of phosphorus input on eutrophication sediment bio p contents are closely related to a particle s physicochemical properties as shown in table 3 bio p contents positively and significantly correlated with the contents of om and illite with calculated correlation coefficients of 0 69 and 0 68 respectively active metal elements i e amorphous forms in illite played a major role in combining phosphorus into the sediment wang et al 2009 reported that the phosphorus adsorption capacity for the tgr sediment was greatly augmented with the increase in the total contents of fe and al sediment bio p contents were negatively and significantly related to the median particle size which indicated that fine particles tended to store a higher amount of bio p similar findings also reported in a study han et al 2018 a total of 0 18 billion tons of ss was deposited annually in the tgr between 2003 and 2010 cwrc 2000 2016 therefore a calculated 7531 tons storage of bio p can be obtained as the product between average sediment bio p contents and annual total deposited sediment volume the internal release of phosphorus at the sediment water interface of the tgr has been studied and the release rate ranged from 0 15 to 2 55 mg m 2 a 1 niu et al 2013 wang et al 2015 the total length of mostly deposited mainstream river reaches was 227 km with an average width of nearly 1 km for the tgr in 2010 xu 2015 thus approximately 34 05 578 85 kg of phosphorus might be released into the water column every year corresponding to the 0 45 7 69 of the sediment stored bio p which was higher than the reported 0 007 0 124 in the fuling to zigui river reaches wu et al 2016 moreover the annual sediment released bio p in the tgr accounted for only 0 04 0 72 of the annual phosphorus input through domestic wastewater discharges from the tgr region compared with 0 100 0 122 mg l of tp loads in mainstream water fig 3 during the post tgr period it is concluded that phosphorus released from sediment may contribute to 0 0006 0 013 based on 451 billion m3 runoff measured at yichang section of the annual total water column phosphorus flux algal blooms have frequently occurred in the tgr and its tributaries since it was first impounded in 2003 zhang et al 2012c table 4 water quality in class iii of the gb 3838 2002 gradually dominated the mainstream of the tgr from 2003 to 2014 table 4 accompanied with the augmentation of the impoundment water level the number of algal bloom affected tributaries increased from five in 2003 to approximately 20 after 2009 and the sensitive period for algal bloom outbursts extended from february june in 2004 to march october after 2007 moreover the increase in the impoundment water level accelerated the evolution of the dominant algae species from river dominated diatom and dinoflagellates to lake dominated green algae cryptomonas cyanobacteria and microcystis aeruginosa table 4 augmentation in the impoundment water level promoted the development of water eutrophication phosphorus flux control is vital to prevent algal blooms in the tgr excessive nutrient input from upstream and tributaries resulted in water column phosphorus loads considerably exceeding the critical value of 0 02 mg l for algal blooms tang et al 2014b complete implementation of the river chief system may considerably reduce the nutrient input to the tgr and water quality for the upstream as well as all 38 tributaries should improve to class iii 0 2 mg l for tp when considering the non point source inputs and wastewater discharges cwrc 2000 2016 water column phosphorus may still overload algal blooms in the long term during the post tgr period a continual decline in sediment input may further reduce the partition capacity between the dp and pp and excellent water transparency and suitable temperatures may fuel the outburst of algal blooms in stagnant water bodies such as most of the tributaries river mouths and bays zhu et al 2013 ji et al 2017 as the tgr mostly exhibited lake features rather than river channels it is necessary to manage the water column phosphorus loads at its limited value of 0 05 mg l lake or reservoir rather than 0 20 mg l river according to the class iii requirements of the gb 3838 2002 mep 2002b 4 conclusions mainstream water column pp loads considerably reduced during the post tgr period due to decline in upstream ss input and ss retention by the tgd and the average water column tp loads during the flood normal and dry seasons between 2004 and 2010 were 4 69 9 91 and 12 28 lower respectively than those measured between 1997 and 2003 storing clear water in the dry season and discharging muddy water in the wet season of the tgr not only prevented sediment deposition but was also unfavorable for continual enrichment of phosphorus in the surface sediment a decline in water column pp and tp loads and decreased sediment particle size jointly led to insignificant accumulation of phosphorus in the mainstream surface sediment since the impoundment water level increased from 135 to 175 m mainstream surface sediment has a light phosphorus contamination with an average enrichment index of 1 46 for tp average bio p contents only accounted for a maximum of 7 of the sediment tp the annual release of bio p contributed to 0 013 of dp concentrations in the water column the increase in the impoundment water level continually weakened hydrodynamic conditions and positive relationships between the impoundment water level and numbers of algal bloom affected tributaries were observed the annual surface sediment bio p release and domestic wastewater discharge only contributed approximately 1 to the tp loads in the water column of the tgr the majority of the phosphorus input to the tgr was from upstream including its 38 tributaries for eutrophic control it is necessary to manage the tgr as a lake with tp limited loads of 0 05 mg l rather than 0 02 mg l for rivers according to the requirement of class iii of the gb 3838 2002

19312,a staged impoundment scheme was adopted for the three gorges reservoir tgr to increase its maximal water level from 135 to 175 m between 2003 and 2010 however the variation in phosphorus distribution and its bioavailability in the water column and surface sediment during this period is still uncertain field surveys and historical monitoring data related to water column surface sediment total phosphorus tp and fractional contents and water bloom characteristics were used to identify the effects of staged impoundment on phosphorus distribution and water eutrophication in the tgr it is indicated that retention of particulate phosphorus pp bounded suspended sediment ss caused an average of 4 69 12 28 decline in water column tp between 2004 and 2010 compared with that measured between 1998 and 2003 phosphorus did not notably accumulate in the mainstream surface sediment when the impoundment water level increased from 135 to 175 m the mainstream surface sediment was relatively clean and the release of sediment bioavailable p bio p contributed to 0 013 of dissolved phosphorus dp concentrations in the water column when impoundment of the tgr was 175 m an increase in dissolved bio p in the water column and weak hydrodynamic conditions stimulated the outburst of water bloom in more tributaries when the impoundment water level increased from 135 to 175 m and the dominant algae gradually evolved from river dominated species to lake dominated species therefore it is necessary to limit the entry of dp from the upstream and tributaries into the tgr and manage tp loads in the tgr as a lake rather than as a river in the future keywords three gorges reservoir water column bioavailability eutrophication algal bloom 1 introduction the three gorges dam tgd located in the upper mainstream section of the changjiang river is the world s largest water conservancy and hydroelectric project fu et al 2010 the three gorges reservoir tgr spreads across the reach of the changjiang river between jiangjin of chongqing city and yichang of hubei province with a total water surface area of 1 08 103 km2 and a storage capacity of 39 3 billion cubic meters wang et al 2013 the tgr provides substantial benefits in flood control navigation water supply and power generation but unavoidably affects river environments and ecology during the pre tgr period mean mainstream water levels were no more than 80 m in depth cnemc 1998 2016 a staged impoundment scheme was adopted and implemented in 2003 2006 and 2010 by raising the storage level of the tgr to 135 156 and 175 m to investigate and mitigate the potential negative effects of this reservoir operation on the eco environment wang et al 2013 therefore since 2010 the tgr has been fully operational with the water level fluctuating between 145 m in the wet season from april to september and 175 m in the dry season from october to mid april the presence of the tgd considerably reduced the average flow velocity of the changjiang river from 3 to 5 m s to 0 09 2 43 m s cnemc 1998 2016 slow water flow in the tgr has facilitated the adsorption of dissolved pollutants on suspended sediments ss sedimentation of particle pollutants and also eutrophication of tributaries liu et al 2016 algal blooms have formed in approximately 10 of the tgr s associated tributaries and bays since 2003 zhang et al 2012a eutrophication remains as the most significant challenge in the post tgr period phosphorus was identified as the limiting nutrient responsible for eutrophication in the tgr han et al 2018 water trophic status and algae growth are closely related to the content of bioavailable phosphorus bio p in the water column which is mainly determined by the level of total phosphorus tp and its bioavailable fractions in the overlying water and surface sediment previous research indicates that tp concentrations of the mainstream water column tended to decrease during the post tgr period lou et al 2011 however the tp load in mainstream surface sediment of the tgr was insignificantly increased since 2003 pan et al 2018 therefore impoundment may have different effects on phosphorus storage and its bioavailability in the water column and surface sediment sediment is the important environmental media of phosphorus and plays a key role in regulating phosphorus distribution and its bioavailability wu et al 2016 impoundment of the tgr resulted in an accumulation of fine sediment particles cwrc 2000 2016 which are known to adsorb more dissolved phosphorus dp than coarse particles yao et al 2016 the enrichment of sediment organic matter om and fe al hydroxides in fine particles resulted in a high content of sediment tp and a high affinity of water column phosphorus tang et al 2014b therefore deposition of fine sediment particles may increase the bioavailability of dp in the water column and contribute to the source of phosphorus release from the mainstream bed sediment to the overlying water column when environmental conditions change tang et al 2015a b staged impoundment has directly impacted ss transportation and deposition however its effect on associated water column and surface sediment phosphorus load and its bioavailability remains unclear previous studies mostly focus on phosphorus distribution in the tgr and its water level fluctuating zone and tributaries during the post tgr period impoundment caused a decline in the water column tp concentrations even in the flood season due to the efficient retention of particulate phosphorus pp bounded ss lou et al 2011 accumulation of pp in the parts of surface sediment increased the potential risk of phosphorus releasing into the overlying water wang et al 2009 2015 han et al 2018 the sediment or soil in the water level fluctuating zone of the tgr exhibited a seasonal change between the sink and source for phosphorus and soil organic phosphorus org p and fe al oxides bound phosphorus fe alp were the major contributors to the released phosphorus zhang et al 2012b other researchers have investigated and evaluated sediment or soil phosphorus distribution status in tributaries such as the daning river xiangxi river and pengxi river wang et al 2009 luo et al 2015 huang et al 2017 so far most studies concentrated on the phosphorus distribution in the water column and surface sediment when the beginning of the impoundment the changes in distribution dynamics of tp and its fractions in the mainstream water column and surface sediment during the complete impoundment period have not been reported in this study water and surface sediment samples were collected from 13 sites located in the mainstream of the tgr and analyzed for phosphorus distribution and relationships were explored between sediment compositions and phosphorus distribution historical water column tp and sediment phosphorus data were also used to explore the effects of the staged increase in the impoundment water level on phosphorus distribution and its bioavailability the findings of this study provide relevant information for nutrient management in the tgr 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sample collection and measurement sample collection mainstream water samples were collected in triplicate between october 15 2010 and november 25 2010 at 13 sampling sites along the mainstream of the tgr fig 1 all sampling sites were located at representative sections selected according to the code for reservoir hydrologic and sediment surveys sl 339 2006 mwr 2006 the 13 sites wujiang wj ruxi rx

added to inhibit bacterial activity approximately 80 ml of the water sample was filtered at the point of collection through a 0 45 μm celluloseacetate filter and then stored at 4 c within a portable refrigerator the residual unfiltered 120 ml water was also stored at 4 c using the same procedure during the sampling period ph water temperature dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec and turbidity were measured using a portable ysi proplus meter usa flow velocity was determined at each sampling site by using a direct reading current meter global water phosphorus fraction analysis all water samples were immediately transported to the laboratory for total dissolved phosphorus tdp soluble reactive phosphorus srp and tp determination after 2 h of digestion with potassium persulfate in an autoclave tdp tp and srp without digestion were measured using the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method apha 1998 total particulate phosphorus pp in water means dp bound to water column particles which was assumed to be equivalent to the difference between the tp and tdp for water and following sediment sample analysis all the instruments had passed national measurement examination and reference materials and standard reagents were used for quality control during the post tgr period tp was measured according to the environmental quality standards for drinking water gb 3838 2002 mep 2002b and the phosphorus content of the supernatant was determined as tp loads after the static sedimentation of the water samples for 0 5 h whereas water and ss fully mixed samples without sedimentation were immediately measured to obtain tp concentrations before the impoundment 2 2 sediment sample collection and measurement sample collection between october 15 2010 and november 25 2010 approximately 1 0 kg of surface sediment samples 0 10 cm were collected using a grab sampler at the same sites as water samples fig 1 surface sediment samples were fully mixed and transported to the laboratory on the same day as collection within a portable refrigerator at 4 c zhang et al 2012c each sediment sample was divided into two parts one part was used to determine the particle size distribution and the other was air dried and sieved using 100 mm diameter mesh for analysis of sediment ph om mineral composition and phosphorus fractions physicochemical property determination ph and om content for all samples were determined according to the methods reported by tang et al 2014a sediment particle size distribution was determined using a horiba 950v2 laser diffraction particle size

ni filtered cu kα radiation step size 0 02 s operating voltage 40 kv scan range 2θ 5 65 phosphorus fraction analysis sequential extraction of phosphorus was undertaken to determine the phosphorus species twenty five milliliter of 1 mol l nh4cl was added to 500 mg of sediment dry weight equivalent and the suspension was shaken for 0 5 h after shaking the suspension was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was decanted this process was repeated with 0 5 mol l nh4f shaken for 1 h 0 1 mol l naoh shaken for 2 h and shaken for 2 h again after standing for 16 h 0 3 mol l na3c6h5o7 2h2o shaken for 0 5 h and then with 0 5 mol l h2so4 shaken for 1 h these fractions represented exchangeable phosphorus ex p phosphorus bound by al oxides alp phosphorus bound by fe oxides fe p occluded phosphorus op and calcium bound phosphorus cap respectively the tp content within the sediments was determined with the standards measurements and testing smt protocol and treating the sub sample at 720 c followed by 3 mol l h2so4 extraction ruban et al 2001 2 3 historical data collection and analysis historical monitoring data for water column tp were obtained from the yangtze river water resources protection bureau crwc literature related to phosphorus contents in surface sediments before and after impoundment were collected from wanfang data and sciencedirect samples had been collected between june and october for the tgr inflow usually carries more pp associated ss during the wet season than during the dry season tang et al 2015a b tang et al 2018 and tp loads in surface sediment were theoretically higher in the wet season than that in the dry season however insignificant difference in sediment tp contents was observed in one hydrological year cao et al 2011 moreover zhuo et al 2017a investigated the trends of tp loads in the mainstream and tributary surface sediment of the tgr between 2000 and 2015 and found that tp contents fluctuated during different flow periods but no regular difference in sediment tp contents ratio were detected between july and january therefore the impact of variability in sampling period on sediment tp loads was acceptable for historical data comparison three different pretreatment methods including acid digestion with h2so4 hclo4 and hno3 hfhclo4 cao et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 tan et al 2012 zhang 2013 pan et al 2016 wu et al 2016 zhuo et al 2017a were commonly used in the literature for determining sediment tp content in the tgr varied sediment om levels were mainly responsible for the variability in the digestion performance and inconsistency of tp results however sediment tp determination via acid digestion with different reagents gave uniformly small variances ostrofsky 2012 moreover there is no regular difference in the sediment component along the mainstream of the tgr pan et al 2018 therefore data collected from literature using different pretreatment procedures can be used to make a comparison with our tested values phosphorus fractions in the sediment before and after the impoundment of the tgr were also collected from the published literature in wanfang data and sciencedirect to evaluate the impacts of impoundment on sediment phosphorus bioavailability furthermore in order to identify the status of sediment phosphorus bioavailability in the changjiang river basin sediment bio p ex p fe alp measured in the tgr was compared with that in representative lakes and large reservoirs hydrology and sediment data of the tgr were collected from the changjiang sediment bulletin cwrc 2000 2016 and water quality and algal bloom data were obtained from the bulletin of ecological and environmental monitoring of the three gorges project in the yangtze river cnemc 1998 2016 average annual water column tp concentrations for the five nationally controlled mainstream sections zhuto cuntan qingyangxi shaiwangba and peishi related to the tgr between 1997 and 2010 were obtained from the changjiang water resource protection bureau which belongs to the cwrc all statistical tests were performed using spss software spss 2003 including multivariable correlation matrix calculations for the phosphorus fractions and sediment compositions 3 results and discussion 3 1 phosphorus distribution dynamics in the water column as shown in table 1 mainstream flow velocity along the tgr was reduced following impoundment a 90 higher reduction amplitude was obtained during the dry season and the measured flow velocity considerably decreased from approximately 0 56 m s in wj to nearly 0 05 m s in lm and mp the water column had a low ss content in the dry season and turbidity ranged from 3 01 to 8 79 ntu water in the tgr was alkaline in general and its ph value ranged from 7 98 to 8 20 the water ec exhibited a moderate declining trend along the mainstream section of the tgr decreasing from nearly 400 μs cm in the upper river reaches to 358 μs cm in mp table 1 the water column was aerobic and the do concentrations were generally higher than 7 0 mg l the presence of tgd considerably changed the hydrologic regime and led to a variation in the distribution of phosphorus as shown in table 1 tp dtp pp and srp exhibited a declining trend from the upper reach to the lower reach pp sedimentation accompanying the decline in flow velocity contributed to the reduction in the tp concentration the pp concentration gradually decreased from the 0 05 mg l in md to 0 009 mg l in mp pp retention reduced the pp tp ratio from 30 in wj to approximately 10 in mp consequently the tp concentration decreased from 0 133 mg l in wj to 0 087 mg l in mp table 1 sediment retention may have increased the availability of srp because the calculated srp pp ratio increased from 217 in wj to 800 in mp table 1 because of a low concentration of pp in the water column srp was the major component of tp and tdp the high srp tp ratio may have triggered algal blooms in the spring and autumn the distribution of tp concentration in the water column exhibited a u pattern during the dry season for all five controlled mainstream sections when the impoundment water level increased from 135 to 175 m fig 2 the lowest tp concentration in the water column was most notable between 2006 and 2008 fig 2 efficient sediment retention by the tgd greatly reduced the water column pp loads and contributed to the initial decline in mainstream tp following the first impoundment in 2003 tang et al 2018 in addition to impoundment of water input of dp by wastewater discharge from the tgr region and phosphorus release from sediments both tended to increase during the post tgr period zhuo et al 2017a consequently increasing dp entry compensates or even exceeds the reduction of pp and causes the u pattern distribution of mainstream tp as shown in fig 2 annual average tp concentrations during flood normal and dry seasons between 2004 and 2010 respectively were 4 69 9 91 and 12 28 lower than those correspondingly observed between 1997 and 2003 fig 3 impoundment resulting in the decline of the mainstream water column tp load can be explained based on two aspects 1 a change in the pretreatment procedures of tp determination for tgr water samples mainstream water column tp loads were linearly and positively related to ss concentrations in the tgr during the wet season wang and lv 2007 pp accounted for more than 50 of the tp tang et al 2018 and static sedimentation of 0 5 h may cause between 43 65 and 50 93 decline of water column tp li et al 2005 static sedimentation pretreatment obviously resulted in the reduction of measured water column tp and mainstream tp loads during the post tgr period actually increased if the pretreatment procedures of tp determination during the pre tgr period applied 2 retention of ss reduced the water column tp load a study indicated that more than 80 of phosphorus bounded to sediment particles if the ss concentration exceeded 500 mg l lou et al 2011 during the pre tgr period pp accounted for 50 85 of tp wang et al 2007 after the tgr entered into fully operational mode approximately 75 of the water column pp has been trapped during the flood season tang et al 2018 the presence of the tgd resulted in the efficient retention of ss the concentration of ss sharply decreased from more than 400 mg l between 1998 and 2002 to less than 100 mg l after 2004 in the taipingxi section and the sedimentation of ss mainly caused the decline of water column tp loads during the post tgr period lou et al 2011 moreover due to effective sediment traps at upstream reservoirs along with appropriate water and soil conservation measures pp loads input to the tgr during the wet season has been reduced more than 90 in 2017 when compared to that measured in 1990s tang et al 2018 which was comparable with a 84 5 reduction reported by zhou et al 2013 the presence of the tgd led to a slight reduction in tp concentrations but the availability of dp in the water column considerably increased due to the sedimentation of ss moreover the annual domestic wastewater discharge volume from the tgr region increased from less than 0 25 to approximately 0 80 billion tons per year from 1996 to 2014 and the annual average phosphorus fertilizer consumption increased 16 during the same period zhuo et al 2017b in china the discharge standard for phosphorus in municipal wastewater is higher than 1 0 mg l mep 2002a therefore domestic wastewater discharge results in 800 tons of dp input annually and contributes to 1 02 of the annual total water column phosphorus loads a calculation based on the annual average runoff of 451 billion m3 at yichang section which is located behind the tgd cwrc 2000 2016 3 2 phosphorus distribution dynamics in surface sediments sediment ph values om particle size and compositions are listed in table 2 sediment ph values ranged from 7 41 to 7 69 indicating a decreasing trend from upstream to downstream the enrichment of calcareous minerals may result in the weak alkalinity of sediment in the tgr pan et al 2016 om contents ranged from 7 79 to 55 63 mg kg with an average level of 39 95 mg kg table 2 the lowest value of om appeared in wj which can be explained by intensive mine exploitation in the wujiang basin stripping the surface litter and fertile topsoil zhuo et al 2014 and exposing the pure soil or mineral components that had little om chlorite illite quartz feldspar calcite dolomite amphibole and iron pyrite were the main sediment components in the tgr table 2 the average proportions of chlorite illite and quartz related to the total sediment mass were 28 23 and 25 respectively a difference in the status of water and soil loss in the drainage area of tributaries may cause irregular distribution of sediment compositions quartz proportions in mainstream sediments were between 61 4 and 72 4 during the pre tgr wang et al 2006 which was much higher than the 25 listed in table 2 impoundment led to a notable increase in chlorite and illite contents li et al 2012a and more weatherable minerals were observed with the decrease in sediment grain particle size measured median particle size d50 ranged from 3 84 to 23 65 μm with an average value of 7 50 μm higher sediment particle d50 values occurred in wj and ws which had similar mineral components high proportions of quartz and low proportions of illite table 2 according to the china soil partition method wang and kang 1991 clay 4 μm and fine sand 4 63 μm dominated sediment fractions in all the mainstream sediment samples the mean particle size of the surface sediment in the mainstream section of the tgr decreased from 0 011 to 0 009 mm between 2003 and 2010 compared with the values acquired in the 1990s crwc 2000 2010 taking the controlled cuntan section as an example the median sediment particle size tended to decline whereas the volume of sediment deposited increased when the impoundment water level increased from 135 m in 2003 to 175 m in 2010 fig 4 increased fine particle deposition facilitated the enrichment of phosphorus in the sediment during the post tgr period sediment was usually regarded as the sink for phosphorus because internal release negligibly contributed to the total phosphorus loads in the water column wang et al 2015 moreover mainstream water column phosphorus concentrations fig 2 already greatly exceeded their threshold values of 0 02 mg l for eutrophication ji et al 2017 therefore annually increased in sediment deposition encourage the enrichment of sediment nutrients in the tgr but have limited impacts on trophic status of the tgr augmentation in the impoundment water level may favor the sedimentation of coarse particles and thus cause suspended sediment particles to be more fine and small moreover weak hydrodynamic conditions and slow water flow during the post tgr period supported the sedimentation and accumulation of fine particles in the mainstream compared with that in natural river channel conditions tang et al 2018 mainstream sediment tp content ranged from 570 06 to 837 92 mg kg with an average value of 744 88 mg kg fig 5 these ranges were comparable with that reported for besko reservoir in poland 533 832 mg kg piwińska et al 2018 cruzeta reservoir in brazil 711 982 mg kg cavalcante et al 2018 and shahid rajaie dam in iran 495 744 mg kg shakeri et al 2016 efficient ss trapping capacity caused much faster sediment deposition in the reservoir than in the lakes in the changjiang river basin yao et al 2006 and surface sediment in most of the reservoirs were freshly formed and mainly consisted of fine sand similar deposition conditions and sediment components probably resulted in the comparable tp loads between the tgr and other reservoirs elsewhere the bd sections received a total of 1 44 million tons of wastewater discharged from bd county in 2010 however only 49 5 of the treated effluent reached the discharge quality standard tp 1 0 mg l for municipal wastewater mep 2002a therefore excessive domestic wastewater discharge may have resulted in phosphorus contamination of the sediment and caused the high tp content occurring in bd moreover the calculated enrichment index of phosphorus for all sampling sites was larger than 1 0 when compared with the background value of 507 62 mg p kg for soil in the tgr region tang et al 2015a b which implicated that mainstream sediment of the tgr exhibited a certain degree of phosphorus pollution a slightly increasing trend was noted for the mainstream sediment tp content when the impoundment water level gradually increased from 135 to 175 m fig 6 however the increase in the impoundment water level did not lead to the obvious accumulation of tp in the mainstream sediment concluded by zhuo et al 2017a during the post tgr period sediment grain size distribution shifted to being smaller and more fine fig 4 which supported the adsorption and storage of phosphorus sediment phosphorus levels may remain elevated due to the continual sediment deposition nevertheless the deposited surface sediment layer formed in autumn might be partly destroyed and flushed downstream in the following year due to the tgr adopting an operation model of discharging muddy water in the wet season to prevent sediment deposition li et al 2015a a previous study indicated that scouring of deposited sediment in the tgr mostly occurred above the critical flow velocity of 1 1 m s li et al 2015b during the flood season most of the mainstream sections near the tgd had flows lower than 0 10 m s cwrc 2000 2016 therefore discharging muddy water may probably promote sediment migration in the upstream of the tgr but is unlikely to discharge bed sediment to the tgr s downstream moreover long time series sediment deposition as well as tp content data should be collected to investigate the actual effects of discharging muddy water on sediment tp storage dynamics 3 3 sediment phosphorus bioavailability in the present study ex p and alp contents ranged from 2 64 to 12 78 mg kg and from 15 22 mg kg to 52 23 mg kg respectively moreover ex p and alp exhibited a non significant increasing trend from upstream to downstream fig 5 the content of fep was lower than that of other sediment phosphorus fractions and its distribution was irregular with the maximal and minimal fep contents of 2 17 and 0 12 mg kg observed in md and bd respectively cap and op were invariably higher than other p fractions with the exception of dn cap was uniform and fell in the range of 431 15 592 76 mg kg fig 5 different phosphorus fractions in sediment have various bioavailabilities soluble ex p is the most immediately available phosphorus within sediment ribeiro et al 2008 the average ex p measured within the tgr sediment was 8 44 mg kg which was higher than 3 57 mg kg reported in the danjiangkou reservoir another large reservoir used as a drinking water source in china tang et al 2014a but considerably lower than many values reported for eutrophic lakes ribeiro et al 2008 fep or alp can be exchanged with oh and other inorganic phosphorus compounds and used for the evaluation of algal available phosphorus zhou et al 2001 fep and alp contents were generally higher in eutrophic and non calcareous environments with the highest proportion being 70 penn et al 1995 higher fe alp contents can usually be regarded as a result of anthropogenic inputs wu et al 2011 relatively low water column tp loads in the tgr table 1 indicated the light contamination of sediment and thus caused low fe alp to tp proportions compared with those reported in heavily polluted eutrophic lake sediments jin et al 2006 cap dominated the phosphorus fractions for the sediment in the tgr and was reported to be relatively stable especially in neutral and alkaline environments such as the tgr and was attributed to the permanent burial of phosphorus within sediment particles jin et al 2006 op represented the inertia phosphorus bound to hydrous iron oxides and phytoplankton ji et al 2009 our measured op content values of 227 19 387 35 mg kg for the tgr were higher than the reported range of 71 57 174 15 mg kg for the danjiangkou reservoir tang et al 2014a the level of op stored within the sediment directly reflects the amount of natural phosphorus inputs to the receiving water body zhang et al 2012b the tgr region belongs to the acid rain zone of the changjiang river basin lu et al 2013 and long term and frequent acid rainfall intensified the soil weathering and subsequent formation of op thus augmenting the sediment op contents moreover op proportions to tp in the soil obtained in the tgr region can reach higher than 50 an 2011 sediment bio p can be calculated as the sum of ex p fep and alp the average proportion of bio p to tp was 6 21 in this study which was higher than the approximate 5 obtained during the pre tgr period pan et al 2018 but lower than 11 54 50 18 observed for the eutrophic lakes of taihu chaohu and dianchi located in the changjiang rvier basin fig 7 relatively low sediment bio p content in the tgr can be explained as follows 1 the dominant fine sand compositions of the surface sediment table 1 have poor affinity to dp compared with clay or silt tang et al 2014a 2 limited water column tp loads 0 15 mg l hindered the efficient transfer and adsorption of dp to ss and thus impaired the enrichment of phosphorus into the pp and 3 discharging muddy water during the wet season was unfavorable for the continual accumulation of pp in the surface sediment of the tgr water and soil conservation and sediment trapped by upstream reservoirs may have further reduced the particle size and amount of sediment that entered into the tgr accompanied by the increase in the impoundment water level therefore a potential augmentation in sediment bio p contents and a decline in deposited sediment volume increased the uncertainty and complexity regarding the contribution of the sediment bio p to dp loads in the water column 3 4 impacts of phosphorus input on eutrophication sediment bio p contents are closely related to a particle s physicochemical properties as shown in table 3 bio p contents positively and significantly correlated with the contents of om and illite with calculated correlation coefficients of 0 69 and 0 68 respectively active metal elements i e amorphous forms in illite played a major role in combining phosphorus into the sediment wang et al 2009 reported that the phosphorus adsorption capacity for the tgr sediment was greatly augmented with the increase in the total contents of fe and al sediment bio p contents were negatively and significantly related to the median particle size which indicated that fine particles tended to store a higher amount of bio p similar findings also reported in a study han et al 2018 a total of 0 18 billion tons of ss was deposited annually in the tgr between 2003 and 2010 cwrc 2000 2016 therefore a calculated 7531 tons storage of bio p can be obtained as the product between average sediment bio p contents and annual total deposited sediment volume the internal release of phosphorus at the sediment water interface of the tgr has been studied and the release rate ranged from 0 15 to 2 55 mg m 2 a 1 niu et al 2013 wang et al 2015 the total length of mostly deposited mainstream river reaches was 227 km with an average width of nearly 1 km for the tgr in 2010 xu 2015 thus approximately 34 05 578 85 kg of phosphorus might be released into the water column every year corresponding to the 0 45 7 69 of the sediment stored bio p which was higher than the reported 0 007 0 124 in the fuling to zigui river reaches wu et al 2016 moreover the annual sediment released bio p in the tgr accounted for only 0 04 0 72 of the annual phosphorus input through domestic wastewater discharges from the tgr region compared with 0 100 0 122 mg l of tp loads in mainstream water fig 3 during the post tgr period it is concluded that phosphorus released from sediment may contribute to 0 0006 0 013 based on 451 billion m3 runoff measured at yichang section of the annual total water column phosphorus flux algal blooms have frequently occurred in the tgr and its tributaries since it was first impounded in 2003 zhang et al 2012c table 4 water quality in class iii of the gb 3838 2002 gradually dominated the mainstream of the tgr from 2003 to 2014 table 4 accompanied with the augmentation of the impoundment water level the number of algal bloom affected tributaries increased from five in 2003 to approximately 20 after 2009 and the sensitive period for algal bloom outbursts extended from february june in 2004 to march october after 2007 moreover the increase in the impoundment water level accelerated the evolution of the dominant algae species from river dominated diatom and dinoflagellates to lake dominated green algae cryptomonas cyanobacteria and microcystis aeruginosa table 4 augmentation in the impoundment water level promoted the development of water eutrophication phosphorus flux control is vital to prevent algal blooms in the tgr excessive nutrient input from upstream and tributaries resulted in water column phosphorus loads considerably exceeding the critical value of 0 02 mg l for algal blooms tang et al 2014b complete implementation of the river chief system may considerably reduce the nutrient input to the tgr and water quality for the upstream as well as all 38 tributaries should improve to class iii 0 2 mg l for tp when considering the non point source inputs and wastewater discharges cwrc 2000 2016 water column phosphorus may still overload algal blooms in the long term during the post tgr period a continual decline in sediment input may further reduce the partition capacity between the dp and pp and excellent water transparency and suitable temperatures may fuel the outburst of algal blooms in stagnant water bodies such as most of the tributaries river mouths and bays zhu et al 2013 ji et al 2017 as the tgr mostly exhibited lake features rather than river channels it is necessary to manage the water column phosphorus loads at its limited value of 0 05 mg l lake or reservoir rather than 0 20 mg l river according to the class iii requirements of the gb 3838 2002 mep 2002b 4 conclusions mainstream water column pp loads considerably reduced during the post tgr period due to decline in upstream ss input and ss retention by the tgd and the average water column tp loads during the flood normal and dry seasons between 2004 and 2010 were 4 69 9 91 and 12 28 lower respectively than those measured between 1997 and 2003 storing clear water in the dry season and discharging muddy water in the wet season of the tgr not only prevented sediment deposition but was also unfavorable for continual enrichment of phosphorus in the surface sediment a decline in water column pp and tp loads and decreased sediment particle size jointly led to insignificant accumulation of phosphorus in the mainstream surface sediment since the impoundment water level increased from 135 to 175 m mainstream surface sediment has a light phosphorus contamination with an average enrichment index of 1 46 for tp average bio p contents only accounted for a maximum of 7 of the sediment tp the annual release of bio p contributed to 0 013 of dp concentrations in the water column the increase in the impoundment water level continually weakened hydrodynamic conditions and positive relationships between the impoundment water level and numbers of algal bloom affected tributaries were observed the annual surface sediment bio p release and domestic wastewater discharge only contributed approximately 1 to the tp loads in the water column of the tgr the majority of the phosphorus input to the tgr was from upstream including its 38 tributaries for eutrophic control it is necessary to manage the tgr as a lake with tp limited loads of 0 05 mg l rather than 0 02 mg l for rivers according to the requirement of class iii of the gb 3838 2002

of all cecs with detection frequencies 25 fig 3 cluster analysis was performed on rank transformed data using hierarchical euclidian distance matrices in both the r mode clusters of chemicals and q mode clusters of samples based on site and season to produce heatmaps with cluster analyses dendrograms warnes et al 2016 hypothesis testing with hierarchical linear modeling hlm was completed to identify and explain spatiotemporal concentration detection patterns for individual detected cecs and an aggregate calculated variable rank sum among collected samples to conduct hlm across all detected cecs the rank sum of concentrations was calculated for each sample as the sum of its ranks for each of the 123 detected cecs a unique hlm was developed for each cec the rank sum and the number of detected cecs per sample independent variables included season site type site nested in site type and their interactions for individual cec models hlms were developed using the concentrations ranked by samples for that cec insignificant interactions were removed from hlms with a stepwise procedure when significant factors α 0 05 were identified the significance of all

25 25 and 71 of analytes from the respective pesticide pharmaceutical and wastewater indicator compound schedules table s4 usgs 2017 because these schedules included numerous diverse compounds the number of detected cecs may not reflect proportional presence of different cec classes or land use influences a median of 35 cecs was detected in individual samples min 18 max 54 table 3 detection frequencies were 50 and 90 for 31 and 8 cecs respectively median concentrations were 10 ng l and 100 ng l for 25 and 9 cecs respectively fig 2 tables 2 and s5 interquartile concentration ranges fig 2

effect for 14 cecs including pah and coal tar related compounds fungicides and bisphenol a 4 discussion 4 1 general patterns across seasons and sites the hydrologic and chemical results indicated several influential sources and mechanisms for example winter discharge was smaller than other sampled events discharges and represented the first major runoff of the year figure s1a this may have mobilized certain terrestrial winter accumulated cecs but also not resulted in major dilution effects or mobilized great numbers of cecs due to relatively limited overland flow and associated lack of hydrologic connectivity indeed winter had significantly fewer cecs detected than spring respective medians 35 39 table s5 but tied spring and early summer for greatest rank sum cec concentrations tables 3 s5 compared to late summer table 3 spring and early summer had greater numbers of cecs detected c a ab respectively winter was bc greater rank summed concentrations b a a winter was a but much less antecedent i e preceding weeks rainfall and discharge this highlights the potential influence of terrestrial accumulation and wash off during sampling spring and early summer versus pre sampling washoff and dilution late summer on stormwater occurrences and concentrations in terms of site type based cec groupings pipes typically demonstrated diverse cec profiles including cecs uncommon at iesfs the median number of detected cecs was ordered highest to lowest pipe a range 24 54 untreated a range 30 41 and treated b range 18 39 table 3 for rank sum of cec concentrations site types were similarly ordered pipe a untreated a and treated b table 3 this accords with the larger diverse catchments at pipe compared to iesf sites for example p1 p3 catchment areas were 1 3 orders of magnitude greater than i1 i3 catchments p2 p3 had notable industrial or institutional areas tables 1 s1 nine cecs had significantly greater concentrations at pipe versus untreated sites e g fungicides many pah coal tar related compounds fig 5 tables 2 s5 eight had greater concentrations at untreated versus pipe sites i e generally mixed source commercial consumer and lifestyle cecs such as deet methyl 1h benzotriazole menthol fig 5 table s5 generally the group with increased concentrations at pipe versus untreated sites are less degradable or residentially associated than those with increased concentrations at untreated versus pipe sites and vice versa table s3 for the latter e g greater untreated concentrations may be explained by smaller catchments greater residential proportions and shorter flow paths i e less dilution and degradation of these compounds compared to pipe sites table 1 within these overarching site type patterns some individual sites or samples demonstrated within event cec signatures and grouping y axis fig 3 more similar to other sites or site types than their own this likely indicates site specific factors e g watershed or stormwater infrastructure details that might impart chemical or hydrological heterogeneity within site types for example p3 has a larger less residential more impervious and intensely developed catchment than p1 p2 table 1 s1 the cec signature of the winter p3 sample was substantially different from winter p1 and p2 samples but similar to early and late summer p2 samples e g relatively smaller concentrations for various clusters representing pharmaceutical lifestyle z4 pahs sterols y2 and flame retardants x1 than winter p1 p2 samples in winter longer pathways to p3 may have reduced the influence of far upgradient residential areas while increased snowmelt runoff diluted occurrent residential or mixed source cecs compared to p1 p2 in addition spring and early summer i1u samples clustered with treated rather than other untreated samples this could be due to greater discharge imperviousness and less low intensity development at i1 than i2 i3 tables 1 s1 which would increase dilution reduce residential influences and thus limit e g spring pah y2b and early summer mixed use pesticide z1a concentrations finally some paired iesf treated untreated samples clustered together e g spring i3u i3t winter i1u i1t which could reflect their equivalent catchments or cec resistance to treatment the p1 catchment includes the i3 catchment their common watersheds sources pathways and stormwater infrastructure were highlighted by some parallel cec patterns in their samples for example p1 and i3u represented the maximum detections among all sites for many cecs e g atrazine azoxystrobin dimethenamid caffeine camphor cholesterol methocarbamol and triphenyl phosphate often during the same event e g tributyl phosphate metformin table s4 4 2 iesf patterns and performance for cecs iesfs significantly reduced concentrations of 17 cecs including 14 of 48 cecs 29 with detection frequencies 25 fig 5 tables 2 and s5 these included several 3 ring pahs derivatives e g benzo a pyrene fluoranthene p cresol fig 3 cluster y2b lifestyle and non prescription pharmaceuticals e g caffeine nicotine acetaminophen fig 3 cluster z4 commercial consumer cecs e g bisphenol a phenol and cholesterol median removal efficiencies for individual significantly removed cecs were 26 100 table s5 removal was high 89 100 for nicotine acetaminophen triphenyl phosphate cholesterol and several pah related compounds e g benzo a pyrene 9 10 anthraquinone moderately high for menthol 73 and caffeine 72 and modest for deet 36 and tributyl phosphate 26 many of the best removed compounds are hydrophobic e g pahs sterols bisphenol a fig 3 cluster y2 this 100 removal accords with well documented attenuation of particulates and often particulate bound e g hydrophobic contaminants by filtration bmps zhang et al 2014 many of the unremoved compounds are soluble e g herbicides benzotriazoles table s3 however the high removal 60 of several other polar hydrophilic compounds e g caffeine acetaminophen nicotine may be due to polar interactions with iesf iron oxides rather than simple filtration yamamoto et al 2009 iesf removal trends were evident for another 18 of 48 cecs with detection frequencies 25 e g camphor pentachlorophenol table s5 insignificance may stem from small between group variability statistical power issues infrequent detections or other more dominant effects e g seasonality for several cecs site specific median concentrations were not quantifiable because detection frequencies were 50 in these cases removal trends were observed if available paired

grouped cecs e g phenanthrene cluster y2b several hydrophobic cecs commonly detected in untreated samples were rarely detected in treated samples e g cholesterol bisphenol a phenol pahs cluster y2 which would indicate effective iesf removal although only detected in a few paired samples estimated removals were 50 for camphor carbazole and indole also 20 45 removal was estimated for several diverse frequently detected cecs e g methyl 1h benzotriazole tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate lidocaine and 2 4 d lastly trends of 10 30 removal were observed for some moderately hydrophobic pesticides e g azoxystrobin diuron log octanol water partition coefficient k ow 2 3 seven cecs showed significant p 0 05 seasonal site type interactions via hlm nonetheless only three of these had detection frequencies 15 triphenyl phosphate phenanthrene pyrene table s5 these interactions provided detail but did not obscure the observed main effects of season and site type e g that pahs were elevated in winter and spring and were removed by iesfs for phenanthrene e g figure s5b confirms the elevated winter and spring concentrations identified by hlm figure s5a demonstrates that treated samples had the lowest ranked concentrations among site types in all seasons though other site types ranks were equivalently low in early and late summer 50 detection frequency for all site types in summer interestingly all cecs with significant seasonal site type interactions by hlm have log k ow 3 5 table s3 indicating that seasonal tss dynamics may affect their removal although only analyzed at 3 sites 21 total samples tss concentrations showed obvious trends of being greatest in winter and spring events followed by early summer then late summer table s6 and were significantly removed by iesfs this pattern corresponds roughly with rank sum cec concentration patterns figure s5a and the general spatial and or seasonal patterns for several pahs flame retardants and other hydrophobic compounds e g bisphenol a carbazole phenanthrene pyrene figs 4 5 s5b d iesf influents performance and calculated removal efficiencies may be affected by characteristics of catchment design climate events matrices contaminants method detection limits and within or between event pollutant dynamics that may not be completely captured by grab or even high frequency sampling regimes mcintyre et al 2014 i1 and i2 are immediately downgradient of stormwater ponds with larger catchments than i3 which is smaller and directly conveyance fed table 1 thus i1 and i2 are influenced by additional drainage and pond associated fate partitioning hydrologic or biological processes this may partially explain variable cec patterns among untreated sites for example at i3u versus i1u and i2u greater catchment connectivity and lack of an upgradient settling pond may have contributed to more frequent detections of several hydrophobic commercial consumer cecs likewise more frequent detections of several mixed use pesticides at i1u and i2u may reflect their comparatively larger more diverse catchments nevertheless the various iesf sites showed roughly similar numbers of detected cecs in untreated samples and similar removal efficiencies for significantly attenuated cecs table s5 in this study we suggest that occasionally observed inconsistencies in removal efficiencies between iesfs are more likely due to differences in influent quality than iesf performance variability for example rank sum cec concentrations showed some convergence between treated and untreated sites in spring this may result from coincident high poorly attenuated herbicide concentrations figure s5a table s5 twelve pesticides degradates and metformin showed little to no iesf removal in contrast with most other frequently detected cecs table s5 for some degradates observed negative removal may indicate pesticide transformations within iesfs also median early summer phosphate concentrations 390 μg l were 2 3 times greater than other seasons table s6 these iesfs significantly attenuated phosphate 61 removal efficiency table s6 competition for iesf sorption sites may thus have increased in early summer explaining concurrently reduced total rank sum cec removal 4 3 stormwater three spatiotemporal cec profiles for grouped cecs similar seasonal or site type profiles may result from common sources application patterns and or fate and transport figs 3 5 tables s3 s5 three spatiotemporal profiles emerged from this dataset the first profile illustrated spatially broad seasonally dependent sources and transport evident for nearly all agricultural e g acetochlor and several mixed use or non agricultural e g dimethenamid triclopyr herbicides fig 3 clusters z2 z3 their median concentrations were typically 1 2 orders of magnitude greater in early summer and or spring clusters b c1 than winter a and late summer c2 with relatively homogenous within season detections across sites for agricultural herbicides without approved urban uses regional crop applications are nonetheless common as are seasonally dependent atmospheric deposition and instream urban concentrations capel et al 1998 stone et al 2014 which explains their consistent groupings in this study cluster z3 no herbicides had significant spatial variation suggesting homogenous between catchment sources e g broad within catchment uses atmospheric deposition and drift many mixed use or non agricultural pesticides showed heterogeneous within season spatial patterns suggesting important local use and runoff or wastewater transport likewise several mixed use pesticides showed iesf removal trends while most agricultural herbicides did not compared to agricultural herbicides several urban or mixed use herbicides insecticides and fungicides e g triclopyr diuron azoxystrobin respectively demonstrated more frequent winter or late summer detections and smaller between season concentration variations table s5 indeed within the overarching pesticide group z1 z3 fig 3 subclusters distinguished agricultural herbicides z3 from mixed use and non agricultural pesticides z1 z2 that have mixed indoor outdoor less seasonally dependent sources e g structural forestry veterinary turf and ornamental uses mda 2017a b a second seasonal profile included patterns typically ascribed to wastewater driven or hydrophobic cecs e g greater concentrations in winter smaller concentrations in spring and early summer suggesting conservative non runoff dependent and or low flow sources such as sediments or leaky sanitary sewers fairbairn et al 2016 the corresponding chemicals included flame retardants pahs 3 methyl 1h indole alkylphenols and derivatives and some fungicides and prescription pharmaceuticals figs 3 5 table s5 significant iesf removal was demonstrated for many commonly occurring cecs within this profile fig 5 for many e g benzo a pyrene high sediment affinities and persistence and moderate to high aqueous persistence table s3 may explain increased detections in winter or late summer and at larger catchment sites as sediments may provide persistent sources to the water column schwientek et al 2013 terrestrial fractions may persist and mobilize with snowmelt while sediment bound fractions in stormwater infrastructure may account for detections in both low flow winter and diluted washed off late summer conditions variable sources may explain some finer spatiotemporal differences for example phosphate ester flame retardants are hydrophobic persistent and are present at 1 30 w w in many common indoor outdoor products e g furniture electronics coatings automobile parts construction materials wei et al 2015 thus they have numerous wastewater terrestrial runoff and long and short range atmospheric associated sources and pathways wei et al 2015 their concentrations in snow are affected by proximity to roads with vehicular fluids and exhaust identified as important local sources marklund et al 2005 internal and external catchment loading may explain their frequent yet varied detections in this study möller et al 2012 similarly for pahs cluster y2b fig 3 mixed sources and conservative longitudinal transport in sediments schwientek et al 2013 may explain their relatively dominant profiles at p1 p3 versus i1u i3u pahs were present at p1 p3 in all seasons but with evidently greater strength in winter and spring which accords with winter accumulation and wash off of potentially pah contaminated sediments a third profile typified by increased detections and or concentrations in winter and spring or early summer and at untreated versus pipe sites was evident for chemicals including several sterols lifestyle commercial consumer and mixed use prescription non prescription pharmaceutical compounds clusters y2a z4 figs 3 4 tables 2 s5 this included frequently e g caffeine acetaminophen and tributyl phosphate and some infrequently detected compounds e g the veterinary medical drugs tramadol methocarbamol and bupropion this mixed seasonal and spatial profile suggests mixed wastewater runoff and or atmospheric sources that collectively load through a variety of conditions buerge et al 2006 parajulee et al 2017 pitt et al 2013 sauvé et al 2012 compared with p1 p3 catchments i1 i3 catchments are smaller with more residential less diverse land uses this would result in relatively greater influences of litter pet waste vehicular structural turf and road runoff sources and pathways on cec prevalence green et al 2014 parajulee et al 2017 wei et al 2015 the smaller i1 i3 catchments would moderate the influences of atmospheric cec deposition sewer cross connections longitudinal transport dilution and other fate processes given the reduced areas travel times and therefore reduced exposure time or space for these processes together these catchment related influences would explain the somewhat fewer total cecs detected at untreated versus pipe sites but the greater frequencies or concentrations of many that were detected table s5 this holds especially for labile cecs subject to upgradient residential sources and nonconservative transport e g cotinine for example untreated i1u i3u sites had significantly greater concentrations than p1 p3 for several lifestyle cecs e g cotinine menthol and deet fig 5 while detected year round 97 detection frequency median deet concentrations were significantly greater in summer and untreated samples figs 4 5 table s5 deet mobilizes from skin and clothing during washing rainfall and swimming and is common in air and precipitation balducci et al 2012 ferrey et al 2018 many frequently detected cecs within this profile exhibited significant iesf removal although this was less complete for some hydrophilic e g cotinine or moderately hydrophobic e g deet cecs than for hydrophobic compounds described in the second profile e g pahs 4 4 stormwater sources of cecs cecs in stormwater may occur via many sources and pathways associated with their generation use transport storage or disposal ellis et al 2013 parajulee et al 2017 pitt et al 2013 sauvé et al 2012 in this study the most frequently detected cecs e g caffeine triphenyl phosphate are linked to multiple sources and pathways marklund et al 2005 sauvé et al 2012 wei et al 2015 while some compound based groupings observed in the current study were expected based on known sources and transport e g pahs agricultural herbicides others indicate less recognized but potentially important cec sources to stormwater or influential seasons and pathways for certain cecs in fig 3 the clustering z4 of tributyl phosphate a widely used flame retardant and solvent in plastics dyes and adhesives with lifestyle pharmaceutical and commercial consumer cecs based on high spring and early summer concentrations as opposed to the other flame retardants x2 in late summer and winter suggests important atmospheric automotive or other exterior sources wei et al 2015 the strong presence of the lifestyle pharmaceutical commercial consumer cluster z4 in most seasons suggests combined runoff and wastewater sources to stormwater this is sensible given that many such compounds are used or disposed of indoors and outdoors e g nicotine caffeine lidocaine menthol litter e g cigarettes packaging contributes significant loads of lifestyle and commercial consumer cecs such as nicotine menthol and triethyl citrate to runoff and receiving waters green et al 2014 globally many of an estimated 16 billion cigarettes consumed daily become litter in berlin 2 7 cigarette butts m2 mean in public spaces maximum 1400 resulted in 0 62 mg l nicotine in simulated runoff a predicted no effect concentration 2 4 μg l was exceeded by just one cigarette butt m3 water green et al 2014 most pharmaceuticals detected in the current study have veterinary and human applications suggesting transport via excretion and or improper disposal benzotriazoles present in windshield washer fluid anti corrosives antifreeze and aircraft deicers and pahs present in e g automotive exhaust coal tar tires are common in urban environments due to vehicle usage sealcoats and fossil fuel combustion leaching or surface deposition with subsequent downgradient transport via stormwater runoff is likely lefevre et al 2011 parajulee et al 2017 many cecs have been detected in precipitation e g prescription non prescription pharmaceuticals lifestyle compounds illicit drugs flame retardants and benzotriazoles ferrey et al 2018 wei et al 2015 which may thus represent a significant cec source to stormwater pesticides are used in industrial municipal structural agricultural veterinary residential and other settings mda 2017b the separation of pesticides into distinct groups based on uses e g mixed use z2b agricultural z3 indicates that different pest management activities are important contributors of pesticide loads to urban stormwater together these trends suggest that pollution prevention activities for pesticides in urban runoff or wastewater may be effective for urban pesticides while stormwater treatment bmps may be necessary to reduce agricultural herbicides with atmospheric sources 4 5 comparisons to related stormwater and surface water studies when unchecked the diversity of urban associated products and activities results in stormwater transport of large mixtures of cecs to receiving waters this study represents grab samples collected from four runoff events over a single year however and additional work is required to comprehensively illustrate typical cec concentrations across various runoff events conditions land uses etc nonetheless similar results were observed for common cecs in a few previous stormwater studies ellis et al 2013 page et al 2014 pitt et al 2013 sauvé et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 for example pahs nicotine and benzotriazoles were measured at median concentrations of 100s 1000s ng l in street settings wicke et al 2016 time weighted benzotriazole concentrations were much greater in a heavily urbanized toronto creek 500 1000 ng l than a nearby agricultural creek generally 100 ng l with vehicular emissions posited as a major source parajulee et al 2017 agricultural herbicides pahs deet and flame retardants detected herein were reported in australian stormwater infrastructure page et al 2014 in montreal stormwater infrastructure sewage contamination may explain the much greater caffeine concentrations med 1 μg l max 52 μg l sauvé et al 2012 than were measured herein med 210 ng l max 1700 ng l while most u s sanitary and storm sewers are no longer directly connected leakage is common and these systems are often in close subsurface proximity indeed recent studies reported sewage contamination of storm sewers in dry and wet weather sauer et al 2011 sercu et al 2011 this may explain detections of some cecs unlikely sourced from terrestrial reservoirs in the current study for a variety of cecs stormwater concentrations reported herein were comparable to previous minnesota surface waters reports however our median stormwater concentrations were greater than reported in urban suburban minnesota surface waters for cecs such as deet nicotine acetochlor and bisphenol a bradley et al 2017 fairbairn et al 2016 ferrey et al 2011 mda 2017a in fact stormwater concentrations of acetaminophen deet caffeine metformin and others were equivalent to wwtp effluent concentrations bradley et al 2017 fairbairn et al 2016 ferrey et al 2011 our detection frequencies of certain urban use pesticides exceeded some values reported for urban or agricultural surface waters mda 2017a reported concentrations of many cecs are variable however with greater concentrations reported in other urban catchments bradley et al 2017 we measured several prescription pharmaceuticals and pesticides at lower concentrations than reported for minnesota surface waters bradley et al 2017 mda 2017a 4 6 comparisons to stormwater treatment studies of cecs in the tcma stormwater discharge volumes likely exceed those of wwtps annually and dwarf them during runoff events table s8 thus for cecs detected at similar concentrations in untreated stormwater and treated wastewater matrices e g bisphenol a acetaminophen 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole section 4 2 table s9 proportional stormwater and wastewater loading to surface water may occur yet while median acetaminophen and bisphenol a concentrations were greater in untreated stormwater 35 ng l 220 ng l respectively than the mississippi river 15 ng l 150 ng l respectively treated median concentrations were non detectable table s9 no prior stormwater cec studies exist for iesfs but some are available for other bmp types for example laboratory scale sand filtration removed triclosan but not bisphenol a or caffeine paredes et al 2016 in contrast our results show effective caffeine removal indicating the potential effectiveness of iesfs for polar cecs caffeine and acetaminophen reportedly engaged in polar non hydrophobic interactions with sorbents yamamoto et al 2009 suggesting that iesf sorption may be effecting their removal stormwater biofilters typically sand compost topsoil mixtures showed moderate to high attenuation of metals naphthalene and hydrophobic cecs some were almost completely removed e g 3 ring pahs lefevre et al 2011 spromberg et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 different atrazine biofiltration studies showed high 85 to negligible removal yang et al 2010 zhang

hydrophobic and moderate for fipronil i e less polar pharmaceuticals are often poorly removed anderson et al 2016 for cecs lacking bmp performance data i e most cecs wwtp performance may provide general insights despite different influents and processes e g wwtps typically involve settling filtration sorption biodegradation and disinfection wwtp removal efficiencies across several studies were 95 100 for acetaminophen 60 80 for deet and bpa 30 100 for 4 nonylphenol and caffeine and 25 for flame retardants and atrazine luo et al 2014 similarly in the current study median iesf removal was 100 for acetaminophen and several hydrophobic cecs e g pahs bisphenol a sterols high 70 90 for nicotine menthol and caffeine modest variable for deet and some flame retardants and negligible for many herbicides e g atrazine metolachlor 4 7 potential for cec mitigation by stormwater bmps iesfs to demonstrate and contextualize potential cec loads and mitigation in stormwater we developed a rough loading assessment for the mississippi river wwtps and stormwater in the tcma based on available discharge and cec data tables s8 s9 this estimate was completed by comparing total reported annual discharge for upstream downstream river locations tcma wwtps and estimating stormwater discharge by applying a rainfall runoff coefficient to normal annual precipitation data table s9 for cecs included in this study and previously reported for tcma wwtps and the mississippi river estimated loads equaled the product of annual estimated discharge and the median cec concentration for each matrix by this first estimate stormwater loads of several cecs e g 5 methyl 1 benzotriazole metformin during a typical 2 5 cm 24 h rainfall runoff event may easily exceed daily wwtp effluent loads and even rival or exceed typical non event mississippi river loads annually compared to wwtp effluent stormwater may contribute equivalent loads of mixed use flame retardant lifestyle and other commercial consumer cecs greater loads of some non prescription pharmaceuticals and herbicides and actually comprise a significant fraction of total riverine loads table s9 while constrained by available cec data and several assumptions e g consistent iesf performance and cec concentrations estimated runoff and discharges green et al 2014 these estimates indicate promising riverine load reduction potential for a number of stormwater transported cecs that were effectively removed by iesfs in this study e g tributyl phosphate acetaminophen 2 4 d and cotinine table s9 4 8 research and management implications approximately 4 of the usa area but 80 of its population is within regulated storm sewer boundaries municipal stormwater treatment requirements typically apply only to new and redeveloped impervious surfaces this reduces treatment imperatives as most development preceded regulations while precise estimates are rare 30 of urban stormwater runoff is likely treated green et al 2014 mainly by settling or filtration more comprehensive stormwater treatment is needed to prevent contamination of stormwater and receiving waters the cec profiles identified herein confirm that stormwater sources require consideration additional research may elucidate sources and pathways of cecs to stormwater effects of untreated and treated stormwater on receiving waters and management and prevention opportunities stormwater bmps including iesfs may protect aquatic life and water quality although little bioeffect based stormwater bmp research has been completed drastically increased mortality and other effects in fish exposed to untreated highway runoff were basically non existent after stormwater biofiltration treatment mcintyre et al 2014 spromberg et al 2015 a companion study to the current work however of d magna and p promelas exposed to the same replicated stormwater samples revealed little correlation between iesf treatment and improved outcomes westerhoff et al 2018 although results for two test species do not necessarily represent overall biotic health of receiving waters and there may be confounders e g iesf phosphorus removal could suppress daphnia growth elser et al 2001 while being an overall water quality benefit additional research to understand the chemical and ecotoxicological implications of bmps will be valuable laboratory and field studies designed to describe and optimize performance of next generation bmps e g iesf for pollutants including cecs and in context with multiple environmental matrices and services will improve the benefits of stormwater regulation and management in meeting environmental and public needs 5 conclusions knowledge of cec sources and transport to surface waters has expanded in recent years urban runoff is a large fraction of urban water budgets yet the current research represents the first robust field study of stormwater transport and treatment of a broad cec suite among 384 studied cecs 123 32 were detected in tcma stormwater similar frequencies are likely elsewhere for many cecs e g caffeine herbicides stormwater seasonality was similar to surface water reports suggesting that stormwater influences downgradient surface water cec profiles several cecs demonstrated stormwater concentrations equivalent to treated wastewater concentrations indicating that stormwater loading may exceed wwtp loading and dominate riverine loads for some compounds further studies should confirm and elaborate upon loading seasonal and treatment patterns as stormwater is evidently a major cec source nevertheless iesfs significantly removed concentrations of many 29 frequently detected cecs including hydrophobic e g pahs flame retardants and some polar hydrophilic compounds e g caffeine nicotine several frequently detected herbicides and others e g 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole were not removed however future research to understand the prevalence of cecs in stormwater the chemical and ecotoxicological performance

performance data gaps and variability persist due to complex influences of climate catchments pollutant loading and the diverse evolving and decentralized nature of bmps tang et al 2013 as with all water treatment stormwater bmps that rely on settling and filtration are generally more effective for particulate than dissolved contaminants while relevant dissolved contaminants bmps exist pitt et

conventional sand filters with approximately 5 iron filings w w are increasingly implemented to remove particulate and dissolved phosphorus from stormwater primarily by filtration and sorption respectively dissolved phosphorus removal in iesfs exceeded 80 in laboratory scale studies erickson and gulliver 2010 limited field studies indicated reduced or variable performance however which may result from iesf clogging fouling cementing sorbate competition or other loss of iron binding capacity erickson and gulliver 2010 additionally there is minimal iesf performance data for non nutrient contaminants especially contaminants of emerging concern cecs many of the more than 80 000 organic chemicals manufactured globally have recently recognized or suspected environmental occurrences and

most of which are unregulated numerous studies and reviews have established that many cecs occur in waters worldwide often at toxicologically relevant concentrations bradley et al 2017 conley et al 2017 furthermore many cecs are virtually ubiquitous occurring in unexpected environments including remote protected parks and other surface waters with little to no direct anthropogenic disturbance björklund et al 2011 bradley et al 2017 parajulee et al 2017 pitt et al 2013 weissinger et al 2018 although fate models exist cec diversity and environmental complexities often result in unexpected or incompletely characterized behavior conley et al 2017 to date studies characterizing cec sources to surface water primarily focused on municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps croplands and less so on other sources including urban runoff many diverse cecs have been detected in urban streams without identified sanitary wastewater influences corresponding cec loads during runoff events rival those from wwtps buerge et al 2006 fairbairn et al 2016 vogel and moore 2016 accordingly stormwater is likely a major cec source to surface waters sengupta et al 2014 unfortunately direct stormwater studies

replicate samples and field and laboratory blanks are provided in table s2 among field blanks only dichlorvos was detected below its reporting limit as dichlorvos was not detected in any stormwater samples no censoring was required thirty eight of 43 surrogate compounds had median recoveries between 80 120 four caffeine d9 decafluorobiphenyl fluoranthene d10 and fluoxetine d6 had median

aminobenzimidazole was not for cecs with mean rpds 30 among replicates or with matrix recoveries outside 50 150 reported concentrations should be interpreted with caution nevertheless as concentration patterns were analyzed with nonparametric statistical methods the uncorrected concentrations are reported and no additional censoring was completed 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted in r v3 4 1 vienna australia and spss v22 ibm armonk ny laboratory derived concentrations were rank transformed with non detects ranked smallest cluster analysis and heatmapping was used to identify and illustrate patterns within and across detected cecs multivariate analysis of cec results by season and site type was completed with nonparametric two way cluster analysis and heat mapping of all cecs with detection frequencies 25 fig 3 cluster analysis was performed on rank transformed data using hierarchical euclidian distance matrices in both the r mode clusters of chemicals and q mode clusters of samples based on site and season to produce heatmaps with cluster analyses dendrograms warnes et al 2016 hypothesis testing with hierarchical linear modeling hlm was completed to identify and explain spatiotemporal concentration detection patterns for individual detected cecs and an aggregate calculated variable rank sum among collected samples to conduct hlm across all detected cecs the rank sum of concentrations was calculated for each sample as the sum of its ranks for each of the 123 detected cecs a unique hlm was developed for each cec the rank sum and the number of detected cecs per sample independent variables included season site type site nested in site type and their interactions for individual cec models hlms were developed using the concentrations ranked by samples for that cec insignificant interactions were removed from hlms with a stepwise procedure when significant factors α 0 05 were identified the significance of all

of paired samples 3 results 3 1 overall cec detections in stormwater samples 123 32 of 384 unique cec analytes were detected in environmental sample s fig 2 and s4 tables 2 and s4 usgs 2017 including 25 25 and 71 of analytes from the respective pesticide pharmaceutical and wastewater indicator compound schedules table s4 usgs 2017 because these schedules included numerous diverse compounds the number of detected cecs may not reflect proportional presence of different cec classes or land use influences a median of 35 cecs was detected in individual samples min 18 max 54 table 3 detection frequencies were 50 and 90 for 31 and 8 cecs respectively median concentrations were 10 ng l and 100 ng l for 25 and 9 cecs respectively fig 2 tables 2 and s5 interquartile concentration ranges fig 2 of some frequently detected cecs were relatively narrow e g caffeine methyl 1h benzotriazole while others spanned orders of magnitude e g tris butoxyethyl phosphate acetochlor for the former this may

hlm indicated significant concentration seasonality for 53 individual cecs including 38 of 48 cecs with detection frequency 25 i e herbicides degradates insecticides fungicides lifestyle pharmaceuticals and commercial consumer compounds fig 4 tables 2 and s5 site type significantly affected the concentrations of 30 detected cecs including 18 of 48 compounds with detection frequency 25 fig 5 tables 2 and s5 compared to season site type affected more pah related lifestyle pharmaceutical and mixed use commercial consumer cecs but fewer pesticides site type was the only significant effect for 14 cecs including pah and coal tar related compounds fungicides and bisphenol a 4 discussion 4 1 general patterns across seasons and sites the hydrologic and chemical results indicated several influential sources and mechanisms for example winter discharge was smaller than other sampled events discharges and represented the first major runoff of the year figure s1a this may have mobilized certain terrestrial winter accumulated cecs but also not resulted in major dilution effects or mobilized great numbers of cecs due to relatively limited overland flow and associated lack of hydrologic connectivity indeed winter had significantly fewer cecs detected than spring respective medians 35 39 table s5 but tied spring and early summer for greatest rank sum cec concentrations tables 3 s5 compared to late summer table 3 spring and early summer had greater numbers of cecs detected c a ab respectively winter was bc greater rank summed concentrations b a a winter was a but much less antecedent i e preceding weeks rainfall and discharge this highlights the potential influence of terrestrial accumulation and wash off during sampling spring and early summer versus pre sampling washoff and dilution late summer on stormwater occurrences and concentrations in terms of site type based cec groupings pipes typically demonstrated diverse cec profiles including cecs uncommon at iesfs the median number of detected cecs was ordered highest to lowest pipe a range 24 54 untreated a range 30 41 and treated b range 18 39 table 3 for rank sum of cec concentrations site types were similarly ordered pipe a untreated a and treated b table 3 this accords with the larger diverse catchments at pipe compared to iesf sites for example p1 p3 catchment areas were 1 3 orders of magnitude greater than i1 i3 catchments p2 p3 had notable industrial or institutional areas tables 1 s1 nine cecs had significantly greater concentrations at pipe versus untreated sites e g fungicides many pah coal tar related compounds fig 5 tables 2 s5 eight had greater concentrations at untreated versus pipe sites i e generally mixed source commercial consumer and lifestyle cecs such as deet methyl 1h benzotriazole menthol fig 5 table s5 generally the group with increased concentrations at pipe versus untreated sites are less degradable or residentially associated than those with increased concentrations at untreated versus pipe sites and vice versa table s3 for the latter e g greater untreated concentrations may be explained by smaller catchments greater residential proportions and shorter flow paths i e less dilution and degradation of these compounds compared to pipe sites table 1 within these overarching site type patterns some individual sites or samples demonstrated within event cec signatures and grouping y axis fig 3 more similar to other sites or site types than their own this likely indicates site specific factors e g watershed or stormwater infrastructure details that might impart chemical or hydrological heterogeneity within site types for example p3 has a larger less residential more impervious and intensely developed catchment than p1 p2 table 1 s1 the cec signature of the winter p3 sample was substantially different from winter p1 and p2 samples but similar to early and late summer p2 samples e g relatively smaller concentrations for various clusters representing pharmaceutical lifestyle z4 pahs sterols y2 and flame retardants x1 than winter p1 p2 samples in winter longer pathways to p3 may have reduced the influence of far upgradient residential areas while increased snowmelt runoff diluted occurrent residential or mixed source cecs compared to p1 p2 in addition spring and early summer i1u samples clustered with treated rather than other untreated samples this could be due to greater discharge imperviousness and less low intensity development at i1 than i2 i3 tables 1 s1 which would increase dilution reduce residential influences and thus limit e g spring pah y2b and early summer mixed use pesticide z1a concentrations finally some paired iesf treated untreated samples clustered together e g spring i3u i3t winter i1u i1t which could reflect their equivalent catchments or cec resistance to treatment the p1 catchment includes the i3 catchment their common watersheds sources pathways and stormwater infrastructure were highlighted by some parallel cec patterns in their samples for example p1 and i3u represented the maximum detections among all sites for many cecs e g atrazine azoxystrobin dimethenamid caffeine camphor cholesterol methocarbamol and triphenyl phosphate often during the same event e g tributyl phosphate metformin table s4 4 2 iesf patterns and performance for cecs iesfs significantly reduced concentrations of 17 cecs including 14 of 48 cecs 29 with detection frequencies 25 fig 5 tables 2 and s5 these included several 3 ring pahs derivatives e g benzo a pyrene fluoranthene p cresol fig 3 cluster y2b lifestyle and non prescription pharmaceuticals e g caffeine nicotine acetaminophen fig 3 cluster z4 commercial consumer cecs e g bisphenol a phenol and cholesterol median removal efficiencies for individual significantly removed cecs were 26 100 table s5 removal was high 89 100 for nicotine acetaminophen triphenyl phosphate cholesterol and several pah related compounds e g benzo a pyrene 9 10 anthraquinone moderately high for menthol 73 and caffeine 72 and modest for deet 36 and tributyl phosphate 26 many of the best removed compounds are hydrophobic e g pahs sterols bisphenol a fig 3 cluster y2 this 100 removal accords with well documented attenuation of particulates and often particulate bound e g hydrophobic contaminants by filtration bmps zhang et al 2014 many of the unremoved compounds are soluble e g herbicides benzotriazoles table s3 however the high removal 60 of several other polar hydrophilic compounds e g caffeine acetaminophen nicotine may be due to polar interactions with iesf iron oxides rather than simple filtration yamamoto et al 2009 iesf removal trends were evident for another 18 of 48 cecs with detection frequencies 25 e g camphor pentachlorophenol table s5 insignificance may stem from small between group variability statistical power issues infrequent detections or other more dominant effects e g seasonality for several cecs site specific median concentrations were not quantifiable because detection frequencies were 50 in these cases removal trends were observed if available paired

grouped cecs e g phenanthrene cluster y2b several hydrophobic cecs commonly detected in untreated samples were rarely detected in treated samples e g cholesterol bisphenol a phenol pahs cluster y2 which would indicate effective iesf removal although only detected in a few paired samples estimated removals were 50 for camphor carbazole and indole also 20 45 removal was estimated for several diverse frequently detected cecs e g methyl 1h benzotriazole tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate lidocaine and 2 4 d lastly trends of 10 30 removal were observed for some moderately hydrophobic pesticides e g azoxystrobin diuron log octanol water partition coefficient k ow 2 3 seven cecs showed significant p 0 05 seasonal site type interactions via hlm nonetheless only three of these had detection frequencies 15 triphenyl phosphate phenanthrene pyrene table s5 these interactions provided detail but did not obscure the observed main effects of season and site type e g that pahs were elevated in winter and spring and were removed by iesfs for phenanthrene e g figure s5b confirms the elevated winter and spring concentrations identified by hlm figure s5a demonstrates that treated samples had the lowest ranked concentrations among site types in all seasons though other site types ranks were equivalently low in early and late summer 50 detection frequency for all site types in summer interestingly all cecs with significant seasonal site type interactions by hlm have log k ow 3 5 table s3 indicating that seasonal tss dynamics may affect their removal although only analyzed at 3 sites 21 total samples tss concentrations showed obvious trends of being greatest in winter and spring events followed by early summer then late summer table s6 and were significantly removed by iesfs this pattern corresponds roughly with rank sum cec concentration patterns figure s5a and the general spatial and or seasonal patterns for several pahs flame retardants and other hydrophobic compounds e g bisphenol a carbazole phenanthrene pyrene figs 4 5 s5b d iesf influents performance and calculated removal efficiencies may be affected by characteristics of catchment design climate events matrices contaminants method detection limits and within or between event pollutant dynamics that may not be completely captured by grab or even high frequency sampling regimes mcintyre et al 2014 i1 and i2 are immediately downgradient of stormwater ponds with larger catchments than i3 which is smaller and directly conveyance fed table 1 thus i1 and i2 are influenced by additional drainage and pond associated fate partitioning hydrologic or biological processes this may partially explain variable cec patterns among untreated sites for example at i3u versus i1u and i2u greater catchment connectivity and lack of an upgradient settling pond may have contributed to more frequent detections of several hydrophobic commercial consumer cecs likewise more frequent detections of several mixed use pesticides at i1u and i2u may reflect their comparatively larger more diverse catchments nevertheless the various iesf sites showed roughly similar numbers of detected cecs in untreated samples and similar removal efficiencies for significantly attenuated cecs table s5 in this study we suggest that occasionally observed inconsistencies in removal efficiencies between iesfs are more likely due to differences in influent quality than iesf performance variability for example rank sum cec concentrations showed some convergence between treated and untreated sites in spring this may result from coincident high poorly attenuated herbicide concentrations figure s5a table s5 twelve pesticides degradates and metformin showed little to no iesf removal in contrast with most other frequently detected cecs table s5 for some degradates observed negative removal may indicate pesticide transformations within iesfs also median early summer phosphate concentrations 390 μg l were 2 3 times greater than other seasons table s6 these iesfs significantly attenuated phosphate 61 removal efficiency table s6 competition for iesf sorption sites may thus have increased in early summer explaining concurrently reduced total rank sum cec removal 4 3 stormwater three spatiotemporal cec profiles for grouped cecs similar seasonal or site type profiles may result from common sources application patterns and or fate and transport figs 3 5 tables s3 s5 three spatiotemporal profiles emerged from this dataset the first profile illustrated spatially broad seasonally dependent sources and transport evident for nearly all agricultural e g acetochlor and several mixed use or non agricultural e g dimethenamid triclopyr herbicides fig 3 clusters z2 z3 their median concentrations were typically 1 2 orders of magnitude greater in early summer and or spring clusters b c1 than winter a and late summer c2 with relatively homogenous within season detections across sites for agricultural herbicides without approved urban uses regional crop applications are nonetheless common as are seasonally dependent atmospheric deposition and instream urban concentrations capel et al 1998 stone et al 2014 which explains their consistent groupings in this study cluster z3 no herbicides had significant spatial variation suggesting homogenous between catchment sources e g broad within catchment uses atmospheric deposition and drift many mixed use or non agricultural pesticides showed heterogeneous within season spatial patterns suggesting important local use and runoff or wastewater

seasonally dependent sources e g structural forestry veterinary turf and ornamental uses mda 2017a b a second seasonal profile included patterns typically ascribed to wastewater driven or hydrophobic cecs e g greater concentrations in winter smaller concentrations in spring and early summer suggesting conservative non runoff dependent and or low flow sources such as sediments or leaky sanitary sewers fairbairn et al 2016 the corresponding chemicals included flame retardants pahs 3 methyl 1h indole alkylphenols and derivatives and some fungicides and prescription pharmaceuticals figs 3 5 table s5 significant iesf removal was demonstrated for many commonly occurring cecs within this profile fig 5 for many e g benzo a pyrene high sediment affinities and persistence and moderate to high aqueous persistence table s3 may explain increased detections in winter or late summer and at larger catchment sites as sediments may provide persistent sources to the water column schwientek et al 2013 terrestrial fractions may persist and mobilize with snowmelt while sediment bound fractions in stormwater infrastructure may account for detections in both low flow winter and diluted washed off late summer conditions variable sources may explain some finer spatiotemporal differences for example phosphate ester flame retardants are hydrophobic persistent and are present at 1 30 w w in many common indoor outdoor products e g furniture electronics coatings automobile parts construction materials wei et al 2015 thus they have numerous wastewater terrestrial runoff and long and short range atmospheric associated sources and pathways wei et al 2015 their concentrations in snow are affected by proximity to roads with vehicular fluids and exhaust identified as important local sources marklund et al 2005 internal and external catchment loading may explain their frequent yet varied detections in this study möller et al 2012 similarly for pahs cluster y2b fig 3 mixed sources and conservative longitudinal transport in sediments schwientek et al 2013 may explain their relatively dominant profiles at p1 p3 versus i1u i3u pahs were present at p1 p3 in all seasons but with evidently greater strength in winter and spring which accords with winter accumulation and wash off of potentially pah contaminated sediments a third profile typified by increased detections and or concentrations in winter and spring or early summer and at untreated versus pipe sites was evident for chemicals including several sterols lifestyle commercial consumer and mixed use prescription non prescription pharmaceutical compounds clusters y2a z4 figs 3 4 tables 2 s5 this included frequently e g caffeine acetaminophen and tributyl phosphate and some infrequently detected compounds e g the veterinary medical drugs tramadol methocarbamol and bupropion this mixed seasonal and spatial profile suggests mixed wastewater runoff and or atmospheric sources that collectively load through a variety of conditions buerge et al 2006 parajulee et al 2017 pitt et al 2013 sauvé et al 2012 compared with p1 p3 catchments i1 i3 catchments are smaller with more residential less diverse land uses this would result in relatively greater influences of litter pet waste vehicular structural turf and road runoff sources and pathways on cec prevalence green et al 2014 parajulee et al 2017 wei et al 2015 the smaller i1 i3 catchments would moderate the influences of atmospheric cec deposition sewer cross connections longitudinal transport dilution and other fate processes given the reduced areas travel times and therefore reduced exposure time or space for these processes together these catchment related influences would explain the somewhat fewer total cecs detected at untreated versus pipe sites but the greater frequencies or concentrations of many that were detected table s5 this holds especially for labile cecs subject to upgradient residential sources and nonconservative transport e

current study were expected based on known sources and transport e g pahs agricultural herbicides others indicate less recognized but potentially important cec sources to stormwater or influential seasons and pathways for certain cecs in fig 3 the clustering z4 of tributyl phosphate a widely used flame retardant and solvent in plastics dyes and adhesives with lifestyle pharmaceutical and commercial consumer cecs based on high spring and early summer concentrations as opposed to the other flame retardants x2 in late summer and winter suggests important atmospheric automotive or other exterior sources wei et al 2015 the strong presence of the lifestyle pharmaceutical commercial consumer cluster z4 in most seasons suggests combined runoff and wastewater sources to stormwater this is sensible given that many such compounds are used or disposed of indoors and outdoors e g nicotine caffeine lidocaine menthol litter e g cigarettes packaging contributes significant loads of lifestyle

benzotriazoles present in windshield washer fluid anti corrosives antifreeze and aircraft deicers and pahs present in e g automotive exhaust coal tar tires are common in urban environments due to vehicle usage sealcoats and fossil fuel combustion leaching or surface deposition with subsequent downgradient transport via stormwater runoff is likely lefevre et al 2011 parajulee et al 2017 many

pesticides into distinct groups based on uses e g mixed use z2b agricultural z3 indicates that different pest management activities are important contributors of pesticide loads to urban stormwater together these trends suggest that pollution prevention activities for pesticides in urban runoff or wastewater may be effective for urban pesticides while stormwater treatment bmps may be necessary to reduce agricultural herbicides with atmospheric sources 4 5 comparisons to related stormwater and surface water studies when unchecked the diversity of urban associated products and activities results in stormwater transport of large mixtures of cecs to receiving waters this study represents grab samples collected from four runoff events over a single year however and additional work is required to comprehensively illustrate typical cec concentrations across various runoff events conditions land uses etc nonetheless similar results were observed for common cecs in a few previous stormwater studies ellis et al 2013 page et al 2014 pitt et al 2013 sauvé et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 for example pahs nicotine and benzotriazoles were measured at median concentrations of 100s 1000s ng l in street settings wicke et al 2016 time weighted benzotriazole concentrations were much greater in a heavily urbanized toronto creek 500 1000 ng l than a nearby agricultural creek generally 100 ng l with vehicular emissions posited as a major source parajulee et al 2017 agricultural herbicides pahs deet and flame retardants detected herein were reported in australian stormwater infrastructure page et al 2014 in montreal stormwater infrastructure sewage contamination may explain the much greater caffeine concentrations med 1 μg l max 52 μg l sauvé et al 2012 than were measured herein med 210 ng l max 1700 ng l while most u s sanitary and storm sewers are no longer directly connected leakage is common and these systems are often in close subsurface proximity indeed recent studies reported sewage contamination of storm sewers in dry and wet weather sauer et al 2011 sercu et al 2011 this may explain detections of some cecs unlikely sourced from terrestrial reservoirs in the current study for a variety of cecs stormwater concentrations reported herein were comparable to previous minnesota surface waters reports however our median stormwater concentrations were greater than reported in urban suburban minnesota surface waters for cecs such as deet nicotine acetochlor and bisphenol a bradley et al 2017 fairbairn et al 2016 ferrey et al 2011 mda 2017a in fact stormwater concentrations of acetaminophen deet caffeine metformin and others were equivalent to wwtp effluent concentrations bradley et al 2017 fairbairn et al 2016 ferrey et al 2011 our detection frequencies of certain urban use pesticides exceeded some values reported for urban or agricultural surface waters mda 2017a reported concentrations of many cecs are variable however with greater concentrations reported in other urban catchments bradley et al 2017 we measured several prescription pharmaceuticals and pesticides at lower concentrations than reported for minnesota surface waters bradley et al 2017 mda 2017a 4 6 comparisons to stormwater treatment studies of cecs in the tcma stormwater discharge volumes likely exceed those of wwtps annually and dwarf them during runoff events table s8 thus for cecs detected at similar concentrations in untreated stormwater and treated wastewater matrices e g bisphenol a acetaminophen 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole section 4 2 table s9 proportional stormwater and wastewater loading to surface water may occur yet while median acetaminophen and bisphenol a concentrations were greater in untreated stormwater 35 ng

available for other bmp types for example laboratory scale sand filtration removed triclosan but not bisphenol a or caffeine paredes et al 2016 in contrast our results show effective caffeine removal indicating the potential effectiveness of iesfs for polar cecs caffeine and acetaminophen reportedly engaged in polar non hydrophobic interactions with sorbents yamamoto et al 2009 suggesting that iesf sorption may be effecting their removal stormwater biofilters typically sand compost topsoil mixtures showed moderate to high attenuation of metals naphthalene and hydrophobic cecs some were almost completely removed e g 3 ring pahs lefevre et al 2011 spromberg et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 different atrazine biofiltration studies showed high 85 to negligible removal yang et al 2010 zhang

hydrophobic and moderate for fipronil i e less polar pharmaceuticals are often poorly removed anderson et al 2016 for cecs lacking bmp performance data i e most cecs wwtp performance may provide

many herbicides e g atrazine metolachlor 4 7 potential for cec mitigation by stormwater bmps iesfs to demonstrate and contextualize potential cec loads and mitigation in stormwater we developed a rough loading assessment for the mississippi river wwtps and stormwater in the tcma based on available discharge and cec data tables s8 s9 this estimate was completed by comparing total reported annual discharge for upstream downstream river locations tcma wwtps and estimating stormwater discharge by applying a rainfall runoff coefficient to normal annual precipitation data table s9 for cecs included in this study and previously reported for tcma wwtps and the mississippi river estimated loads equaled the product of annual estimated discharge and the median cec concentration for each matrix by this first estimate stormwater loads of several cecs e g 5 methyl 1 benzotriazole metformin during a typical 2 5 cm 24 h rainfall runoff event may easily exceed daily wwtp effluent loads and even rival or exceed typical non event mississippi river loads annually compared to wwtp effluent stormwater may contribute equivalent loads of mixed use flame retardant lifestyle and other commercial consumer cecs greater loads of some non prescription pharmaceuticals and herbicides and actually comprise a significant fraction of total riverine loads table s9 while constrained by available cec data and several assumptions e g consistent iesf performance and cec concentrations estimated runoff and discharges green et al 2014 these estimates indicate promising riverine load reduction

implications approximately 4 of the usa area but 80 of its population is within regulated storm sewer boundaries municipal stormwater treatment requirements typically apply only to new and redeveloped impervious surfaces this reduces treatment imperatives as most development preceded regulations while precise estimates are rare 30 of urban stormwater runoff is likely treated green et al 2014 mainly by settling or filtration more comprehensive stormwater treatment is needed to prevent contamination of stormwater and receiving waters the cec profiles identified herein confirm that stormwater sources require consideration additional research may elucidate sources and pathways of cecs to stormwater effects of untreated and treated stormwater on receiving waters and management and prevention opportunities stormwater bmps including iesfs may protect aquatic life and water quality although little bioeffect based stormwater bmp research has been completed drastically increased mortality and other effects in fish exposed to untreated highway runoff were basically non existent after stormwater biofiltration treatment mcintyre et al 2014 spromberg et al 2015 a companion study to the current work however of d magna and p promelas exposed to the same replicated stormwater samples revealed little correlation between iesf treatment and improved outcomes westerhoff et al 2018 although results for two test species do not necessarily represent overall biotic health of receiving waters and there may be confounders e g iesf phosphorus removal could suppress daphnia growth elser et al 2001 while being an overall water quality benefit additional research to understand the chemical and ecotoxicological implications of bmps will be valuable laboratory and field studies designed to describe and optimize performance of next generation bmps e g iesf for pollutants including cecs and in context with multiple environmental matrices and services will improve the benefits of stormwater regulation and management in meeting environmental and public needs 5 conclusions knowledge of cec sources and transport to surface waters has expanded in recent years urban runoff is a large fraction of urban water budgets yet the current research represents the first robust field study of stormwater transport and treatment of a broad cec suite among 384 studied cecs 123 32 were detected in tcma stormwater similar frequencies are likely elsewhere for many cecs e g caffeine herbicides stormwater seasonality was similar to surface water reports suggesting that stormwater influences downgradient surface water cec profiles several cecs demonstrated stormwater concentrations equivalent to treated wastewater concentrations indicating that stormwater loading may exceed wwtp loading and dominate riverine loads for some compounds further studies should confirm and elaborate upon loading seasonal and treatment patterns as stormwater is evidently a major cec source nevertheless iesfs significantly removed concentrations of many 29 frequently detected cecs including hydrophobic e g pahs flame retardants and some polar hydrophilic compounds e g caffeine nicotine several frequently detected herbicides and others e g 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole were not removed however future research to understand the prevalence of cecs in stormwater the chemical and ecotoxicological performance

19314,biofilm formation in membrane systems negatively impacts the filtration system performances this study evaluated how biofilm compression driven by permeate flow increases the hydraulic resistance and leads to reduction in permeate flux we analysed the effect of biofilm compression on hydraulic resistance and permeate flux through computational models supported by experimental data biofilms with homogeneous surface structure were subjected to step wise changes in flux and transmembrane pressure during compression and relaxation tests biofilm thickness under applied forces was measured non invasively in situ using optical coherence tomography oct a numerical model of poroelasticity which couples water flow through the biofilm with biofilm mechanics was developed to correlate the structural deformation with biofilm hydraulics permeability and resistance the computational model enabled extracting mechanical and hydrological parameters corresponding to the experimental data homogeneous biofilms under elevated compression forces experienced a significant reduction in thickness while only a slight increase in resistance was observed this shows that hydraulic resistance of homogeneous biofilms was affected more by permeability decrease due to pore closure than by a decrease in thickness both viscoelastic and elastoplastic models could describe well the permanent biofilm deformation however for biofilms under study a simpler elastic model could also be used due to the small irreversible deformations the elastic moduli fitting the measured data were in agreement with other reported values for biofilm under compression biofilm stiffening under larger flow driven compression forces was observed and described numerically by correlating inversely the elastic modulus with biofilm porosity the importance of this newly developed method lies in estimation of accurate biofilm mechanical parameters to be used in numerical models for both membrane filtration system and biofouling cleaning strategies such model can ultimately be used to identify optimal operating conditions for membrane system subjected to biofouling keywords biofilm compression hydraulic resistance fluid structural model elastic modulus poroelasticity 1 introduction in the recent decades membrane processes have become established technologies in drinking water and wastewater treatment production of stable water quantity and quality are now usual characteristics for membrane systems however due to the non sterile conditions microorganisms are present in water and formation of biofilms is inevitable leading to biofouling vrouwenvelder et al 1998 reduction of water production li and elimelech 2004 and life time reduction of membrane modules martin et al 2014 biofilms developed on membranes have a negative impact on both cross flow i e increased axial pressure drop vrouwenvelder et al 2009 and on permeate flow i e reduced water flux lee et al 2010 the additional hydraulic resistance induced by biofilms dreszer et al 2013 reduces permeate flux in microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf martin et al 2014 in reverse osmosis ro and forward osmosis fo where the hydraulic resistance of membrane is dominant biofilms decrease the flux mainly by enhancing the concentration polarization thus decreasing the net pressure by causing extra osmotic pressure herzberg and elimelech 2007 radu et al 2010 the hydraulic resistance in turn depends on the biofilm thickness and permeability on the other hand biofilm permeability depends on biofilm porosity and tortuosity it has been reported that water permeation through biofilms can cause a structural re arrangement increasing biofilm density casey 2007 decreasing the porosity and eventually increasing the hydraulic resistance derlon et al 2016 dreszer et al 2013 valladares linares et al 2015 the extent of biofilm compression will be the result of a balance between forces generated by the permeate flow i e pore pressure and permeate drag and structural forces opposing biofilm deformation i e elastic viscous at the same time the biofilm compression caused by permeation would lead to an elevated mechanical strength with biofilms more difficult to be removed during the cleaning other studies also observed biofilm hardening behaviour under elevated stress laspidou 2007 paramonova et al 2009 compression of organic fouling layers developed on fo and ro by permeate drag force membranes has been reported xie et al 2015 therefore it appears important to relate the biofilm hydraulic resistance both with the applied hydrodynamic conditions and with the biofilm mechanical behaviour a better understanding of the link between the hydrodynamic conditions the biofilm mechanical properties and its resulting hydraulic resistance is required to properly define operating strategies for membrane processes an optimal operation of membrane systems should aim at maximizing permeate flux while minimizing compression of the biofilms recently the biofilm compression in gravity driven membrane filtration gdm has been recorded with optical coherence tomography oct desmond et al 2018 during dead end ultrafiltration the biofilm experiences only compression forces several studies correlated biofilm mechanical behaviour and properties e g young modulus bulk modulus relaxation time etc to the different flow conditions shear forces i e flow parallel to biofilm surface caused by axial flow blauert et al 2015 compression forces i e permeate flow perpendicular to biofilm and membrane surfaces derlon et al 2016 and simultaneous compression and shear valladares linares et al 2015 however there is still no theoretical description of biofilm deformation under compression forces caused by water permeation to improve our understanding of biofilm compression and its effect on hydraulic resistance in membrane filtration processes we formulated a numerical model coupling the permeate flow with the biofilm mechanics the numerical model was used to explain experimental observations of changing biofilm thickness and hydraulic resistance under compression and relaxation generated by different applied fluxes and transmembrane pressure in a dead end ultrafiltration system model simulations were also used to extract mechanical and hydrological parameters corresponding to the experimental data finally we evaluated the effect of different mechanical and structural properties of biofilms on the hydraulic response of biofilms to applied permeate flux 2 experimental set up 2 1 biofilm growth and compression setup biofilms were grown for 20 days under constant transmembrane pressure tmp of 0 06 bar in membrane fouling simulators mfs according to desmond et al 2018 feed waters with different compositions i e river water and synthetic water with phosphorous limitation were used for the cultivation of the biofilms on membrane surfaces the compression relaxation experiments were performed by step wise increase decrease of the permeate flux l m2 h fig 1 a or tmp bar fig 1b to defined values tmp controlled experiments have been carried out by monitoring pressure at the feed and permeate side while permeate flux was controlled using permeate mass measurements and pid control 2 2 compression set up and membrane preparation biofilms which were developed for 20 days under constant tmp of 0 06 bar in six mfs in a gravity driven membrane were subjected to a compression relaxation scheme in an automated filtration system as descried in details by desmond et al 2018 the automated filtration system was fed with feed waters reflective of the biofilm growth conditions the filtration system mainly consisted of a gear pump a transparent mfs in which biofilms were already developed measurement scales and pid control system ultrafiltration membranes up150 microdyn nadir wiesbaden germany with molecular weight cut off mwco 150 kda and the equivalent pore size of 30 40 nm were used in mfs units membrane coupons were cut and rinsed with 40 ethanol prior to use in mfs 2 3 hydraulic parameters the biofilm hydraulic resistance r bio 1 m was calculated as the difference between the total hydraulic resistance r tot and membrane resistance r mem the total filtration resistance is a function of transmembrane pressure

measured with nanopure water prior to fouling the permeate flux in l m2 h was calculated from mass measurements of permeate collection as follows 2 j δ m ρ w a δ t with δm the mass of collected permeate kg ρ w the water density kg l a the membrane active area m2 and δt the permeate collection time h 2 4 biofilm morphology quantification the morphological response of the membrane biofilms to increasing and decreasing compressive force was measured by means of optical coherence tomography oct model 930 nm spectral domain thorlabs gmbh dachau germany with a central light source wavelength of 930 nm and refractive index of 1 33 desmond et al 2018 quantification of average biofilm thickness and surface roughness were conducted using a customized matlab routine mathworks natick us 3 model description a mathematical model was developed to evaluate the effects of biofilm deformation compression and relaxation on the biofilm hydraulic resistance under step wise flux or tmp in dead end ultrafiltration the model couples fluid flow in the biofilm considered as porous medium with the structural mechanics of biofilm the liquid pressure in biofilm pores affects the effective stress in the biofilm and leads to deformation while the structural deformation changes the permeability and consequently the pore pressure 3 1 model geometry the biofilms investigated in this study presented mostly a uniform thickness this implies the main property gradients e g pressure stress porosity permeability would develop only in the permeate flow direction i e perpendicular to the membrane and biofilm surface the y direction a one dimensional model would therefore be sufficient to describe both water flow and biofilm mechanics uniaxial strain for biofilm mechanics would be consistent with the assumption that no deformation strain occurs in the lateral directions x and z however in order to conveniently use the computational resources already build in comsol multiphysics we used a two dimensional model geometry a rectangular domain was created with the biofilm thickness expanding in the y direction taking l 0 as initial thickness the domain was made very short 5 μm in the x direction parallel with the membrane when applying symmetry boundary conditions on the lateral boundaries this is equivalent with a one dimensional geometry finally the biofilm depth in the neglected third dimension z was considered large enough to apply the two dimensional plane strain simplification therefore we describe here the model equations in the used two dimensional setup while the equivalent one dimensional reduction is presented in the supplementary information the model considered homogeneous biofilm properties in the whole rectangular domain 3 2 fluid flow the biofilm was assumed a porous medium where darcy s law equation 3 and continuity equation 4 were applied to compute fluid i e water velocity and pressure helmig et al 2013 pintelon et al 2012 3 u k φ μ p 4 φ t u 0 with the local water velocity vector u pressure p water viscosity μ biofilm permeability k and biofilm porosity φ biofilm porosity and permeability had to be correlated to the biofilm deformation in order to represent the effect of structural deformation on the hydraulic resistance and flux suppose that the average biofilm porosity scales with biofilm thickness φ t φ 0 l t l 0 and that compression mainly affects the pores in the permeation direction i e the quasi 1 d assumption with these assumptions the average biofilm porosity at each moment of time can be calculated from eq 5 5 φ t φ 0 l 0 0 l t ε y t d y l 0 where φ 0 and l 0 are the initial biofilm porosity and thickness respectively i e under zero stress conditions the total biofilm deformation at a certain time δl results from integrating the local strain ε y t over the whole biofilm thickness l furthermore the biofilm permeability was calculated from the power law relation between porosity and permeability as equation 6 proposed by millington and quirk 1960 6 k a φ n with a biofilm permeability coefficient a and permeability exponent n in case of the applied step wise permeate flux the velocity u 0 u y was imposed on the biofilm base at y 0 where u y is the applied velocity permeate flux taking several values a constant pressure p p top 1 bar was set on the biofilm liquid interface in case of the applied step wise tmp the biofilm liquid interface was subjected to different pressure values to reach the defined tmp on the biofilm base the flux was set to values calculated from j t m p μ r b i o r m e m as also in martin et al 2014 no flow conditions were set on the lateral boundaries in all cases 3 3 solid mechanics the reversible response of the biofilm under compression and relaxation experiments implies an elastic behaviour korstgens et al 2001 paramonova et al 2009 stoodley et al 1999 while the irreversible deformation may be caused by viscous galy et al 2012 peterson et al 2015 safari et al 2015 towler et al 2003 or plastic korstgens et al 2001 components the time dependent response to an applied stress is often described by a viscous term therefore based on the experimental observations we attribute three mechanical behaviours to the biofilm structural response to normal compression and relaxation elastic viscoelastic and elastoplastic 3 3 1 elastic model we present here the equations in the general tensor form while the possible one dimensional reduction to uniaxial strain is given in supplementary information the biofilm structural mechanics is governed by quasi static balance of momentum of a linear elastic material equation 7 7 σ 0 with σ the effective stress tensor in the biofilm lubliner and papadopoulos 2013 richards 2000 the constitutive equation 8 relates the stress to elastic forces determined by the stiffness tensor c i e hooke s law here function of elastic modulus e and poisson s ratio ν but also to internal forces caused by the fluid pressure p coussy 2004 8 σ α i p c e ν ε in the following it was assumed a biot willis proportionality coefficient α 1 the strain tensor ε can be expressed from the relative biofilm deformation δ with respect to the initial biofilm structure as in equation 9 9 ε 1 2 δ δ t the values of biofilm mechanical properties i e e and ν are highly variable as a result of different biofilm composition i e polymers cells etc and various types of applied stress i e compression tensile shear cense et al 2006 galy et al 2012 klapper et al 2002 peterson et al 2015 towler et al 2003 therefore these values need to be estimated directly based on the experimental data obtained in this study the model parameters are presented in table 1 in case of the applied step wise permeate flux a constant pressure p top was applied on the top boundary while the biofilm base was fixed i e zero deformation when a step wise increase decrease tmp was applied the biofilm liquid interface was subjected to variable pressure p top while the biofilm base was also fixed on the lateral boundaries the deformation was considered parallel to the applied stress i e symmetry conditions these boundary conditions were applied for all three mechanical models i e elastic elastoplastic and viscoelastic 3 3 2 elastoplastic model the permanent plastic deformation occurs when the biofilm is subjected to a stress higher than a threshold value called yield stress the plastic strain ε p must be subtracted from the total strain when used in the constitutive equation 10 leading to 10 σ α i p c e ν ε ε p the constitutive description of plastic behaviour included the yield condition f p 0 in which the plastic flow begins when von mises stress σ m reaches the initial yield stress σ ys0 öchsner 2016 11 f p σ m σ y s 0 we considered here only the case of ideal plasticity constant σ ys0 no hardening rule which described sufficiently well the experimental data the increment of plastic strain d ε p was calculated using the associated flow rule eq 12 bland 1957 kelly 2008 12 d ε p d λ f p σ m which reduces to d ε p d λ for ideal plasticity with a consistency parameter λ that satisfies the condition f p 0 3 3 3 viscoelastic model mechanical behaviour of biological tissues and especially biofilms is often described by a viscoelastic model cense et al 2006 galy et al 2012 klapper et al 2002 peterson et al 2015 towler et al 2003 the viscoelastic behaviour is mainly distinguished by a time dependent deformation under a constant stress in linear viscoelastic materials the deviatoric stress c ε depends on strain history in this study we used the single branch generalized maxwell model peterson et al 2015 which consists of a spring and dashpot in series the viscous term in parallel with the main branch spring the elastic term the main branch stiffness is e while the maxwell branch is characterized by shear modulus g v the spring and relaxation time τv the dashpot the total stress is thus augmented by viscoelastic stress σ v 13 σ α i p c e ν ε σ v the viscoelastic stress is calculated in terms of strains in spring ε and strain in dashpot γ v 14 σ v 2 g v ε γ v with the time dependent dashpot strain calculated from the differential equation 15 τ v d γ v d t γ v 0 3 4 model solution the two dimensional hydro mechanical model was solved in comsol multiphysics v5 2 comsol inc burlington ma the fluid flow in porous media was coupled with plane strain structural mechanics fig 2 moving mesh accounted for the biofilm deformation a time dependent solver was applied on a mapped finite element mesh a mesh size of 10 μm ensures the mesh convergence the parameter fitting was implemented by minimizing the error between experimental and model results using a matlab optimization function through the livelink for matlab 4 results and discussion the biofilm hydraulic resistance depends on biofilm average thickness depending on local thickness and surface roughness and permeability compression will decrease the biofilm thickness decreasing resistance but also decrease the biofilm porosity and permeability increasing resistance an increase in biofilm hydraulic resistance decreases in turn the permeate flux 4 1 deformation of p limiting biofilm under controlled permeate flux the p limiting biofilm in this study had a smooth surface structure with very low relative roughness which could be related to the nutrient limited growth conditions the river water biofilm selected for this study had also an smooth surface table 2 shows the relative biofilm roughness growth condition and extracellular polymeric substance concentration eps and fig 3 presents cross section images of the studied p limiting and river water biofilms the smooth surface biofilm provides a more uniform structural deformation distribution than a biofilm with rough surface hence the homogeneous surface of the biofilms under study provides a valid ground for the plain strain and quasi one dimensional model assumptions the measured average thickness of the p limiting biofilm under step wise flux change over time is presented in fig 4 the biofilm thickness changed immediately after each applied step change in flux and remained constant during each time interval of 30 min during the relaxation phase the biofilm almost recovers its thickness attained during compression at the same fluxes this demonstrates the strong elastic component of the biofilm mechanical behaviour however a small irreversible biofilm deformation of 20 μm is visible during flux change from 10 to 15 l m2 h relaxation phase the permanent biofilm deformation can be explained by a plastic behaviour an elastoplastic model was therefore applied to explain the experiments on the other hand the permanent deformation can also be explained by a viscous behaviour however the fact that the thickness reached the stationary value almost immediately after the change in flux indicates that the viscous relaxation time τv is smaller than the data acquisition time 3 min thus both elastoplastic and viscoelastic models are capable to explain observed results the elastic model represents the data reasonably well and it requires the least number of parameters the determined value of elastic modulus was 317 pa with the square root of the averaged sum of squares of errors srsse 13 2 μm when using the elastoplastic model a better fit was obtained srsse 10 6 μm with e 320 pa and σ ys0 1900 pa the viscoelastic model also fitted well the data srsse 11 3 μm with e 339 pa g v 1008 pa and τv 17 s therefore in membrane biofilm studies in which a long term response of biofilm is considered both viscoelastic and elastoplastic behaviours can equally explain the biofilm response to applied fluxes however a simpler elastic model could also describe the observation with only one adjustable parameter instead of two or three fig 5 a demonstrated that thickness reduction of p limiting biofilm in each identical flux interval is decreased during compression phase 180 80 and 60 μm this behaviour indicates a biofilm stiffening phenomenon strength hardening paramonova et al 2009 rmaile et al 2013 during compression the biofilm compression can be attributed to the permeate drag force which is induced by the liquid flow driven by a pore pressure drop across the biofilm fig 5a also shows the initial biofilm thickness l 0 450 μm under the growth conditions at permeate flux around 5 lmh the hydraulic resistance of p limiting biofilm increases with an increase in permeate flux fig 5b the biofilm resistance only slightly increased from 1 5 1012 to 1 9 1012 m 1 during the flux increase from 10 to 20 lmh this relatively minor rise in hydraulic resistance while the biofilm underwent significant structural deformation indicates that the decrease in permeability had a greater effect on hydraulic resistance than the biofilm thickness reduction consequently all the proposed mechanical models were able to describe the effect of flux on the biofilm resistance fig 5b the permeability change under compression can be attributed to biofilm structural re arrangement and void closure leading to biofilm porosity decrease porosity variation was calculated by eq 5 and permeability function of porosity was computed by eq 6 the exponent n in eq 6 tunes the slope of the resistance vs flux curve with higher n leading to steeper resistance rise see sensitivity analysis section the actual porosity change as calculated is represented in fig 6 the porosity decreased by 50 in the compression phase while it could be recovered to nearly its initial value in the relaxation phase fig 6 4 2 deformation of river water biofilm under controlled transmembrane pressure the river water biofilm grown in this study consisted of a mixture of extracellular polymeric substance and cells as well as particulate matter originating from the influent the river water biofilm grown in this study included particulate matter originating from the influent in addition to the typical biofilm composition mixture of eps and cells biofilms grown under different conditions and influent compositions have different eps concentration and composition desmond et al 2018 table 2 shows the measured eps concentration of both p limiting and river water biofilms eps concentration was higher for the p limiting biofilm 676 mg c m2 compared to the river biofilm with an eps concentration of 541 mg c m2 the river water biofilm was grown under 60 mbar tmp in a dead end uf and it has been subjected to the relaxation compression scheme presented here fig 1b a cross section image of river water biofilm structure is illustrated in fig 3b similar to the p limiting biofilm the river water biofilm expresses a reversible structural response and recoverable deformation during the step wise unload load cycle which can be well described by an elastic model fig 7 as the applied tmp increased from 0 06 bar to 0 5 bar the biofilm thickness decreases from 100 to 40 μm fig 8 a the same strain hardening mechanism in which biofilm stiffness increases as biofilm deforms can be noted here i e less relative deformation as the tmp increases the fully reversible biofilm deformation measured in this case implies a fully elastic behaviour however due to the nonlinear relationship between stress and deformation the elastic modulus should increase with a decrease in biofilm porosity therefore we proposed an effective young modulus e e f f e φ m the fitted biofilm hardening coefficient m was 0 88 and the e 196 pa in this way the effective young modulus i e biofilm stiffness increases from 300 pa φ 0 6 to 700 pa φ 0 25 when tmp increases from 0 06 to 0 5 bar respectively fig 9 fig 8b also shows that the river water biofilm hydraulic resistance increases from 1 2 1012 to 1 5 1012 m 1 during tmp change from 0 06 to 0 5 bar similar to p limiting biofilm a decrease in biofilm porosity due to structural deformation causes a slight increase in hydraulic resistance both homogeneous biofilms in this study presented a reversible and recoverable deformation under applied stress caused either by controlling the flux or the tmp the deformation in thickness leads to a change hydraulic resistance due to porosity variation 4 3 sensitivity analysis biofilm thickness and hydraulic resistance are the main structural and hydrological properties determined experimentally in this study to evaluate how mechanical and permeability properties of the biofilm could influence the biofilm thickness and hydraulic resistance parametric sensitivity simulations were performed with changes in the young modulus e and hardening coefficient m for the elastic model shear modulus g v and relaxation time τ v for the viscoelastic model initial yield stress σ ys0 for the plastic behaviour and permeability coefficient a and exponent n for the hydraulic model fig 10 mechanical parameters biofilms with a higher value of the elastic modulus e have greater stiffness and therefore should undergo smaller structural deformation at a given load i e imposed flux or tmp increasing e from 300 to 500 pa resulted a significant increase in biofilm thickness from 150 to 250 μm at applied flux of 20 lmh fig 10a the biofilm hydraulic resistance only slightly decreased for the similar change in elastic modulus from 1 45 1012 to 1 35 1012 m 1 the effects of biofilm hardening coefficient m on biofilm thickness and resistance are shown in fig 10d for a river water biofilm case increasing the biofilm hardening coefficient from 0 4 to 1 2 would result in larger biofilm stiffness during the compression phase and a calculated biofilm thickness reduction from 50 to 100 μm respectively however a change in hardening coefficient had only a minor effect on hydraulic resistance as shown in fig 10d a variation in the other biofilm mechanical properties i e shear modulus g v and relaxation time τ v for the viscoelastic model or the initial yield stress σ ys0 for the plastic behaviour in the range often reported for biofilms had only minor influences on the computed biofilm thickness and resistance figure s1 hydraulic parameters biofilm hydraulic parameters i e permeability coefficient a and exponent n in the permeability dependence on the biofilm porosity eq 6 greatly affected biofilm thickness and resistance during step wise flux change increasing the permeability exponent n from 1 to 1 5 leads to decrease in the biofilm thickness from 350 to 200 μm at 10 lmh permeate flux for the p limiting biofilm case fig 10b practically the larger the permeability exponent n the steeper the slope of resistance elevation becomes during permeate flux increase as expected the change in biofilm permeability coefficient a lead to an important thickness and resistance variation fig 10c for example increasing permeability coefficient from 1 10 16 to 1 10 15 m2 resulted in a biofilm thickness of 280 to 40 μm at permeate flux equal to10 lmh 4 4 discussion observed relation between biofilm deformation and hydraulic resistance it is well experimentally proven that biofilm compression increases the hydraulic resistance and consequently reduces the water permeation through the membrane derlon et al 2016 desmond et al 2018 dreszer et al 2013 2014 valladares linares et al 2015 the reversibility in biofilm compression during permeation at changing fluxes or tmps is related to biofilm composition and morphology valladares linares et al 2015 ex situ measurements of biofilm deformation do not provide adequate information on structure dynamics and its effects on biofilm hydraulic resistance as these only occur in permeation conditions thus applications of microscopy and image processing techniques particularly oct but also confocal laser microscopy for in situ biofilm deformation measurements have attracted attention recently blauert et al 2015 fortunato et al 2017 in situ biofilm deformation was measured without permeation under shear forces only blauert et al 2015 or under both permeation and shear force in microfiltration mf to evaluate the effect of biofilm compression on the hydraulic resistance dreszer et al 2013 dreszer et al 2014 measured biofilm compression and relaxation under step wise flux change in uf and they observed that biofilm hydraulic resistance significantly increased at elevated permeate fluxes later valladares linares et al 2015 observed biofilm deformation and correlated biofilm thickness under step wise flux changes in mf to biofilm hydraulic resistance they observed a clear time dependent biofilm deformation under permeate flux and interpreted this as a viscoelastic mechanical behaviour recently desmond et al 2018 measured biofilm thickness using oct in dead end ultrafiltration under a step wise change in permeate flux and tmp the biofilm in their study was exposed only to compression forces and the effect of shear force could be neglected due to dead end conditions in the membrane filtration process biofilm mechanical model in the present study we observe reversible compression for both biofilms figs 4 and 7 which could be explained by a simple elastic model however for the p limiting biofilm some small permanent deformation was recorded which could be interpreted both as viscoelastic and as elastoplastic behaviour a viscoelastic biofilm is recognized by the time dependency of deformation under constant load peterson et al 2015 however data from figs 4 and 7 demonstrate that the biofilm thickness remained constant under constant applied stress still one should note that in our membrane biofouling study the data acquisition time interval minutes was much larger than the biofilm relaxation time seconds derived from the experiments by valladares linares et al 2015 thus the permanent biofilm deformation could still be described by a viscoelastic model while remaining in agreement with a plastic characteristic too all these lead to the conclusion that the observed mechanical behaviour of the biofilm not only depends on biofilm composition and morphology but also on the type of applied stress e g shear by flow over the biofilm compression by permeation flow etc and on the time scale of observations biofilm hydraulics hydraulic resistance of biofilms depends on the biofilm structure e g thickness surface roughness and porosity and permeability characteristics figs 5b and 8b demonstrate that biofilm compression is accompanied by a small increase in biofilm hydraulic resistance under elevated flux or tmp assuming that the biofilm permeability does not vary due to compression the biofilm hydraulic resistance should decrease as a result of its thickness reduction the slight increase in hydraulic resistance clearly indicates that the effect of permeability reduction due to pore closure determines biofilm hydraulic resistance instead of biofilm shrinkage i e shortening the permeation distance the proposed models thus imply that the biofilm compression mainly occurs by pore shrinkage and that the pores are partially restored during the relaxation phase dreszer et al 2013 and valladares linares et al 2015 reported much stronger increase in hydraulic resistance under elevated fluxes than results of this study presented such deviation could be explained by the differences in biofilm morphology among these investigations heterogeneous biofilms i e fluffy filamentous mushroom like etc in these studies would collapse under applied stress leading to macro pore closure or channel blocking ultimately resulting in a significant rise of hydraulic resistance moreover biofilm structure collapse would lead to irreversible biofilm compression since the biofilms in our study had only a low surface roughness demonstrating reversible and recoverable deformation under compression accompanied by a slight increase observed in the hydraulic resistance therefore for a biofilm with homogeneous surface i e planar flat smooth etc the compression could mainly affect the structural deformation not the hydrological properties i e hydraulic resistance biofilm porosity the calculated porosity changed significantly during the compression and relaxation cycles mostly between 0 75 and 0 25 figs 6 and 9b in order to better estimate the model parameters mechanical and hydraulic the biofilm porosity would have to be determined independently during the permeation experiments measurements of biofilm porosity were reported by blauert et al 2015 who estimated a change in 5 10 porosity during their shear flow tests but such measurements would also be needed under permeation conditions however it should be noted that biofilm porosity measurement is really challenging for multiple reasons first the biofilm fragile structure can be damaged in ex situ techniques second the pore distinction in in situ techniques using image processing can be ambiguous i e grey scale thresholding non repetitive image brightness contrast interpretation of grey scale image pore distinction criteria etc finally the porosity observed by visual microscopic imaging techniques i e apparent voids in the biofilm structure may not be directly correlated with the hydraulic porosity thus back calculation of biofilm porosity using structural and hydrological properties i e thickness and hydraulic resistance might lead to more reliable porosity values biofilm structural hardening biofilm thickness during compression relaxation phases depends on biofilm composition i e cells polymers mineral inclusions all with different mechanical properties biofilm morphology i e surface roughness and porosity and applied load magnitude and direction i e shear or normal forces several studies show how biofilm mechanical properties depend on biofilm composition and morphology dreszer et al 2013 peterson et al 2015 stoodley et al 1999 laspidou et al 2014 demonstrates with a numerical model that the biofilm mechanical properties change during compression and tension tests they also showed that biofilm mechanical properties can vary with the biofilm structure all these observations and theories support the definition of effective mechanical properties which integrate biofilm material properties intrinsic young modulus but probably also viscoelastic or elastoplastic parameters with biofilm hydrological and structural properties i e porosity the step wise flux change experiments showed that biofilm stiffness increases at greater permeation fluxes leading to smaller thickness reduction during compression biofilms in this study showed a strain hardening behaviour that can be represented quantitatively by the hardening coefficient m biofilm with higher values of hardening coefficient become stiffer under applied load fig 9a and consequently smaller deformation occurs under elevated fluxes fig 10d the strain hardening behaviour of biofilms was already reported by paramonova et al 2009 for dental biofilms similarly described before for rubber like materials this tendency could be explained by the fact that at mild compression forces the biofilm pores take up the stress and gradually close while at higher loads the polymers and cells harder biofilm constituents would oppose the applied load in this respect valladares linares et al 2015 demonstrated that eps concentration in the biofilm is a dominant factor in determining mechanical properties and biofilm thickness variation we proposed here a simple power law correlation of the elasticity modulus with the porosity e e f f e φ m however in the literature there are several other alternatives such as the ryshkewitch duckworth equation ryshkewitch 1953 proposed for porous sintered materials e e f f e exp m φ or the phani niyogi equation phani and niyogi 1987 using another power law formulation e e f f e 1 φ φ c r i t m which implies the existence of a critical porosity at which the young modulus becomes zero blauert 2017 mechanical properties values of young elastic modulus reported in literature vary in a wide range between 10 and 6000 pa korstgens et al 2001 mohle et al 2007 peterson et al 2015 stoodley et al 1999 based on biofilm type and applied mechanical tests for example stoodley et al 1999 reported elastic moduli between 17 and 240 pa for biofilms exposed to different shear levels while paramonova et al 2009 reported similar values of 20 200 pa for dental biofilms also under variable shear blauert et al 2015 reported a shear modulus of around 30 pa for biofilm under shear stress using oct and deformation angles which corresponds to e 80 pa when poisson ratio is 0 4 however under uniaxial compression much higher values were reported e 6500 pa korstgens et al 2001 in this study we found elastic moduli e of 320 pa for p limiting biofilm and 200 pa for river water biofilm well in the range reported in literature the variation of measured young modulus can be attributed to different biofilm composition different mechanical tests compression tensile shear and also different measurements techniques rheometer image processing etc one should note that mechanical properties in this work were calculated for biofilms under compression forces for which aravas and laspidou 2008 demonstrated that larger values should be obtained compared to shear tests moreover viscoelastic properties fitting data from this study were shear modulus g v 1000 pa and biofilm relaxation time τ v 17 s the biofilm relaxation times often reported in literature are in the order magnitude of seconds in line with the value reported here towler et al 2003 valladares linares et al 2015 moreover biofilm shear modulus g v 1000 pa is well in the range of the value reported for maxwell shear modulus for two type of biofilm by jones et al 2011 permeability properties although biofilm structure response to applied forces is greatly influenced by the elastic modulus its impact on hydraulic resistance did not appear considerable in our study this again can be explained by the fact that in homogeneous biofilms the hydraulic resistance is mainly governed by porosity change by pore closure and not by thickness decrease on the other hand sensitivity analysis simulations showed that the biofilm permeability coefficient a and permeability exponent n determine the biofilm hydraulic resistance fig 10b and c increasing values of a and n would result in higher permeability and therefore higher stress exerted on the biofilm leading to a considerable structural deformation as well as permeability change the correlation proposed here between biofilm permeability and porosity can be applied for biofilms with high surface roughness but with a higher value of exponent coefficient n future research to increase accuracy of experimental results and model validation more number of tmp steps need to be evaluated in the current study tmp steps selection were facing three main problems 1 make sure that compression would occur in the smaller range of tmp 2 lower tmp steps would result a very small change in the collected permeate mass used in the calculation of biofilm resistance and consequently the changes in hydraulic resistances for different tmp steps would be negligible and results would become doubtable 3 another issue for smaller tmp steps was that reaching a stable tmp value in a small step was difficult with the existing pid control system therefore the proposed approach in the study of biofilm compressibility should be evaluated for a wider tmp range and more tmp steps knowledge of biofilm mechanics is essential to optimize physical cleaning strategies such as shear cleaning hilal et al 2005 air bubble cleaning wibisono et al 2014 air water jet cleaning fabbri et al 2016 safari et al 2015 non invasive methodologies to obtain biofilm mechanical properties should be developed for this aim oct data coupled with a fluid structure numerical model can provide an opportunity to estimate biofilm mechanical properties in a non destructive way the present work focused on uniaxial biofilm compression driven by flow a fully coupled fluid structural model for heterogeneous surface biofilm also needs to be developed in order to use the two or three dimensional datasets obtainable by oct in this way the spatial variation of mechanical properties within heterogeneous biofilms could be estimated for such a goal experimental determination of local deformations in the biofilm is needed for example by using embedded particles galy et al 2012 or other particle tracking methods development of more complex material models to simulate deformation non linearity may be required coupling biofilm mechanics with flow would also need the development of reliable experimental techniques to measure biofilm hydraulic porosity 5 conclusions a poroelastic computational model which couples water permeation through the biofilm with the biofilm mechanics was developed to correlate the structural deformation with biofilm hydraulic resistance mechanical and hydraulic biofilm properties were estimated based on the data obtained in compression relaxation cycles with a fully coupled fluid structural model the hydraulic resistance of the smooth surface biofilms e g grown in p limiting conditions under compression was affected more by permeability decrease due to pore closure than by a decrease in thickness in membrane biofilm compression studies with sampling time step larger than the biofilm relaxation time both viscoelastic and elastoplastic models could describe the permanent biofilm deformation for biofilms under study due to the small irreversible deformation a simpler elastic model could also be used the elastic moduli fitting the measured data were in agreement with other reported values for biofilm under compression biofilm stiffening under larger flow driven compression forces was observed and described numerically by

19314,biofilm formation in membrane systems negatively impacts the filtration system performances this study evaluated how biofilm compression driven by permeate flow increases the hydraulic resistance and leads to reduction in permeate flux we analysed the effect of biofilm compression on hydraulic resistance and permeate flux through computational models supported by experimental data biofilms with homogeneous surface structure were subjected to step wise changes in flux and transmembrane pressure during compression and relaxation tests biofilm thickness under applied forces was measured non invasively in situ using optical coherence tomography oct a numerical model of poroelasticity which couples water flow through the biofilm with biofilm mechanics was developed to correlate the structural deformation with biofilm hydraulics permeability and resistance the computational model enabled extracting mechanical and hydrological parameters corresponding to the experimental data homogeneous biofilms under elevated compression forces experienced a significant reduction in thickness while only a slight increase in resistance was observed this shows that hydraulic resistance of homogeneous biofilms was affected more by permeability decrease due to pore closure than by a decrease in thickness both viscoelastic and elastoplastic models could describe well the permanent biofilm deformation however for biofilms under study a simpler elastic model could also be used due to the small irreversible deformations the elastic moduli fitting the measured data were in agreement with other reported values for biofilm under compression biofilm stiffening under larger flow driven compression forces was observed and described numerically by correlating inversely the elastic modulus with biofilm porosity the importance of this newly developed method lies in estimation of accurate biofilm mechanical parameters to be used in numerical models for both membrane filtration system and biofouling cleaning strategies such model can ultimately be used to identify optimal operating conditions for membrane system subjected to biofouling keywords biofilm compression hydraulic resistance fluid structural model elastic modulus poroelasticity 1 introduction in the recent decades membrane processes have become established technologies in drinking water and wastewater treatment production of stable water quantity and quality are now usual characteristics for membrane systems however due to the non sterile conditions microorganisms are present in water and formation of biofilms is inevitable leading to biofouling vrouwenvelder et al 1998 reduction of water production li and elimelech 2004 and life time reduction of membrane modules martin et al 2014 biofilms developed on membranes have a negative impact on both cross flow i e increased axial pressure drop vrouwenvelder et al 2009 and on permeate flow i e reduced water flux lee et al 2010 the additional hydraulic resistance induced by biofilms dreszer et al 2013 reduces permeate flux in microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf martin et al 2014 in reverse osmosis ro and forward osmosis fo where the hydraulic resistance of membrane is dominant biofilms decrease the flux mainly by enhancing the concentration polarization thus decreasing the net pressure by causing extra osmotic pressure herzberg and elimelech 2007 radu et al 2010 the hydraulic resistance in turn depends on the biofilm thickness and permeability on the other hand biofilm permeability depends on biofilm porosity and tortuosity it has been reported that water permeation through biofilms can cause a structural re arrangement increasing biofilm density casey 2007 decreasing the porosity and eventually increasing the hydraulic resistance derlon et al 2016 dreszer et al 2013 valladares linares et al 2015 the extent of biofilm compression will be the result of a balance between forces generated by the permeate flow i e pore pressure and permeate drag and structural forces opposing biofilm deformation i e elastic viscous at the same time the biofilm compression caused by permeation would lead to an elevated mechanical strength with biofilms more difficult to be removed during the cleaning other studies also observed biofilm hardening behaviour under elevated stress laspidou 2007 paramonova et al 2009 compression of organic fouling layers developed on fo and ro by permeate drag force membranes has been reported xie et al 2015 therefore it appears important to relate the biofilm hydraulic resistance both with the applied hydrodynamic conditions and with the biofilm mechanical behaviour a better understanding of the link between the hydrodynamic conditions the biofilm mechanical properties and its resulting hydraulic resistance is required to properly define operating strategies for membrane processes an optimal operation of membrane systems should aim at maximizing permeate flux while minimizing compression of the biofilms recently the biofilm compression in gravity driven membrane filtration gdm has been recorded with optical coherence tomography oct desmond et al 2018 during dead end ultrafiltration the biofilm experiences only compression forces several studies correlated biofilm mechanical behaviour and properties e g young modulus bulk modulus relaxation time etc to the different flow conditions shear forces i e flow parallel to biofilm surface caused by axial flow blauert et al 2015 compression forces i e permeate flow perpendicular to biofilm and membrane surfaces derlon et al 2016 and simultaneous compression and shear valladares linares et al 2015 however there is still no theoretical description of biofilm deformation under compression forces caused by water permeation to improve our understanding of biofilm compression and its effect on hydraulic resistance in membrane filtration processes we formulated a numerical model coupling the permeate flow with the biofilm mechanics the numerical model was used to explain experimental observations of changing biofilm thickness and hydraulic resistance under compression and relaxation generated by different applied fluxes and transmembrane pressure in a dead end ultrafiltration system model simulations were also used to extract mechanical and hydrological parameters corresponding to the experimental data finally we evaluated the effect of different mechanical and structural properties of biofilms on the hydraulic response of biofilms to applied permeate flux 2 experimental set up 2 1 biofilm growth and compression setup biofilms were grown for 20 days under constant transmembrane pressure tmp of 0 06 bar in membrane fouling simulators mfs according to desmond et al 2018 feed waters with different compositions i e river water and synthetic water with phosphorous limitation were used for the cultivation of the biofilms on membrane surfaces the compression relaxation experiments were performed by step wise increase decrease of the permeate flux l m2 h fig 1 a or tmp bar fig 1b to defined values tmp controlled experiments have been carried out by monitoring pressure at the feed and permeate side while permeate flux was controlled using permeate mass measurements and pid control 2 2 compression set up and membrane preparation biofilms which were developed for 20 days under constant tmp of 0 06 bar in six mfs in a gravity driven membrane were subjected to a compression relaxation scheme in an automated filtration system as descried in details by desmond et al 2018 the automated filtration system was fed with feed waters reflective of the biofilm growth conditions the filtration system mainly consisted of a gear pump a transparent mfs in which biofilms were already developed measurement scales and pid control system ultrafiltration membranes up150 microdyn nadir wiesbaden germany with molecular weight cut off mwco 150 kda and the equivalent pore size of 30 40 nm were used in mfs units membrane coupons were cut and rinsed with 40 ethanol prior to use in mfs 2 3 hydraulic parameters the biofilm hydraulic

permeate kg ρ w the water density kg l a the membrane active area m2 and δt the permeate collection time h 2 4 biofilm morphology quantification the morphological response of the membrane biofilms to increasing and decreasing compressive force was measured by means of optical coherence tomography oct model 930 nm spectral domain thorlabs gmbh dachau germany with a central light source wavelength of 930 nm and refractive index of 1 33 desmond et al 2018 quantification of average biofilm thickness and surface roughness were conducted using a customized matlab routine mathworks natick us 3 model description a mathematical model was developed to evaluate the effects of biofilm deformation compression and relaxation on the biofilm hydraulic resistance under step wise flux or tmp in dead end ultrafiltration the model couples fluid flow in the biofilm considered as porous medium with the structural mechanics of biofilm the liquid pressure in biofilm pores affects the effective stress in the biofilm and leads to deformation while the structural deformation changes the permeability and consequently the pore pressure 3 1 model geometry the biofilms investigated in this study presented mostly a uniform thickness this implies the main property gradients e g pressure stress porosity permeability would develop only in the permeate flow direction i e perpendicular to the membrane and biofilm surface the y direction a one dimensional model would therefore be sufficient to describe both water flow and biofilm mechanics uniaxial strain for biofilm mechanics would be consistent with the assumption that no deformation strain occurs in the lateral directions x and z however in order to conveniently use the computational resources already build in comsol multiphysics we used a two dimensional model geometry a rectangular domain was created with the biofilm thickness expanding in the y direction taking l 0 as initial thickness the domain was made very short 5 μm in the x direction parallel with the membrane when applying symmetry boundary conditions on the lateral boundaries this is equivalent with a one dimensional geometry finally the biofilm depth in the neglected third dimension z was considered large enough to apply the two dimensional plane strain simplification therefore we describe here the model equations in the used two dimensional setup while the equivalent one dimensional reduction is presented in the supplementary information the model considered homogeneous biofilm properties in the whole rectangular domain 3 2 fluid flow the biofilm was assumed a porous medium where darcy s law equation 3 and continuity equation 4 were applied to compute fluid i e water velocity and pressure helmig et al 2013 pintelon et al 2012 3 u k φ μ p 4 φ t u 0 with the local water velocity vector u pressure p water viscosity μ biofilm permeability k and biofilm porosity φ biofilm porosity and permeability had to be correlated to the biofilm deformation in order to represent the effect of structural deformation on the hydraulic resistance and flux suppose that the average biofilm porosity scales with biofilm thickness φ t φ 0 l t l 0 and that compression mainly affects the pores in the permeation direction i e the quasi 1 d assumption with these assumptions the average biofilm porosity at each moment of time can be calculated from eq 5 5 φ t φ 0 l 0 0 l t ε y t d y l 0 where φ 0 and l 0 are the initial biofilm porosity and thickness respectively i e under zero stress conditions the total biofilm deformation at a certain time δl results from integrating the local strain ε y t over the whole biofilm thickness l furthermore the biofilm permeability was calculated from the power law relation between porosity and permeability as equation 6 proposed by millington and quirk 1960 6 k a φ n with a biofilm permeability coefficient a and permeability exponent n in case of the applied step wise permeate flux the velocity u 0 u y was imposed on the biofilm base at y 0 where u y is the applied velocity permeate flux taking several values a constant pressure p p top 1 bar was set on the biofilm liquid interface in case of the applied step wise tmp the biofilm liquid interface was subjected to different pressure values to reach the defined tmp on the biofilm base the flux was set to values calculated from j t m p μ r b i o r m e m as also in martin et al 2014 no flow conditions were set on the lateral boundaries in all cases 3 3 solid mechanics the reversible response of the biofilm under compression and relaxation experiments implies an elastic behaviour korstgens et al 2001 paramonova et al 2009 stoodley et al 1999 while the irreversible deformation may be caused by viscous galy et al 2012 peterson et al 2015 safari et al 2015 towler et al 2003 or plastic korstgens et al 2001 components the time dependent response to an applied stress is often described by a viscous term therefore based on the experimental observations we attribute three mechanical behaviours to the biofilm structural response to normal compression and relaxation elastic viscoelastic and elastoplastic 3 3 1 elastic model we present here the equations in the general tensor form while the possible one dimensional reduction to uniaxial strain is given in supplementary information the biofilm structural mechanics is governed by quasi static balance of momentum of a linear elastic material equation 7 7 σ 0 with σ the effective stress tensor in the biofilm lubliner and papadopoulos 2013 richards 2000 the constitutive equation 8 relates the stress to elastic forces determined by the stiffness tensor c i e hooke s law here function of elastic modulus e and poisson s ratio ν but also to internal forces caused by the fluid pressure p coussy 2004 8 σ α i p c e ν ε in the following it was assumed a biot willis proportionality coefficient α 1 the strain tensor ε can be expressed from the relative biofilm deformation δ with respect to the initial biofilm structure as in equation 9 9 ε 1 2 δ δ t the values of biofilm mechanical properties i e e and ν are highly variable as a result of different biofilm composition i e polymers cells etc and various types of applied stress i e compression tensile shear cense et al 2006 galy et al 2012 klapper et al 2002 peterson et al 2015 towler et al 2003 therefore these values need to be estimated directly based on the experimental data obtained in this study the model parameters are presented in table 1 in case of the applied step wise permeate flux a constant pressure p top was applied on the top boundary while the biofilm base was fixed i e zero deformation when a step wise increase decrease tmp was applied the biofilm liquid interface was subjected to variable pressure p top while the biofilm base was also fixed on the lateral boundaries the deformation was considered parallel to the applied stress i e symmetry conditions these boundary conditions were applied for all three mechanical models i e elastic elastoplastic and viscoelastic 3 3 2 elastoplastic model the permanent plastic deformation occurs when the biofilm is subjected to a stress higher than a threshold value called yield stress the plastic strain ε p must be subtracted from the total strain when used in the constitutive equation 10 leading to 10 σ α i p c e ν ε ε p the constitutive description of plastic

mechanical behaviour of biological tissues and especially biofilms is often described by a viscoelastic model cense et al 2006 galy et al 2012 klapper et al 2002 peterson et al 2015 towler et al 2003 the viscoelastic behaviour is mainly distinguished by a time dependent deformation under a constant stress in linear viscoelastic materials the deviatoric stress c ε depends on strain history in this study we used the single branch generalized maxwell model peterson et al 2015 which consists of a spring and dashpot in series the viscous term in parallel with the main branch spring the elastic term the main branch stiffness is e while the maxwell branch is characterized by shear modulus g v the spring and relaxation time τv the dashpot the total stress is thus augmented by viscoelastic stress σ

differential equation 15 τ v d γ v d t γ v 0 3 4 model solution the two dimensional hydro mechanical model was solved in comsol multiphysics v5 2 comsol inc burlington ma the fluid flow in porous media was coupled with plane strain structural mechanics fig 2 moving mesh accounted for the biofilm deformation a time dependent solver was applied on a mapped finite element mesh a mesh size of 10 μm ensures the mesh convergence the parameter fitting was implemented by minimizing the error between experimental and model results using a matlab optimization function through the livelink for matlab 4 results and discussion the biofilm hydraulic resistance depends on biofilm average thickness depending on local thickness and surface roughness and permeability compression will decrease the biofilm thickness decreasing resistance but also decrease the biofilm porosity and permeability increasing resistance an increase in biofilm hydraulic resistance decreases in turn the permeate flux 4 1 deformation of p limiting biofilm under controlled permeate flux the p limiting biofilm in this study had a smooth surface structure with very low relative roughness which could be related to the nutrient limited growth conditions the river water biofilm selected for this study had also an smooth surface table 2 shows the relative biofilm roughness growth condition and extracellular polymeric substance concentration eps and fig 3 presents cross section images of the studied p limiting and river water biofilms the smooth surface biofilm provides a more uniform structural deformation distribution than a biofilm with rough surface hence the homogeneous surface of the biofilms under study provides a valid ground for the plain strain and quasi one dimensional model assumptions the measured average thickness of the p limiting biofilm under step wise flux change over time is presented in fig 4 the biofilm thickness changed immediately after each applied step change in flux and remained constant during each time interval of 30 min during the relaxation phase the biofilm almost recovers its thickness attained during compression at the same fluxes this demonstrates the strong elastic component of the biofilm mechanical behaviour however a small irreversible biofilm deformation of 20 μm is visible during flux change from 10 to 15 l m2 h relaxation phase the permanent biofilm deformation can be explained by a plastic behaviour an elastoplastic model was therefore applied to explain the experiments on the other hand the permanent deformation can also be explained by a viscous behaviour however the fact that the thickness reached the stationary value almost immediately after the change in flux indicates that the viscous relaxation time τv is smaller than the data acquisition time 3 min thus both elastoplastic and viscoelastic models are capable to explain observed results the elastic model represents the data reasonably well and it requires the least number of parameters the determined value of elastic modulus was 317 pa with the square root of the averaged sum of squares of errors srsse 13 2 μm when using the elastoplastic model a better fit was obtained srsse 10 6 μm with e 320 pa and σ ys0 1900 pa the viscoelastic model also fitted well the data srsse 11 3 μm with e 339 pa g v 1008 pa and τv 17 s therefore in membrane biofilm studies in which a long term response of biofilm is considered both viscoelastic and elastoplastic behaviours can equally explain the biofilm response to applied fluxes however a simpler elastic model could also describe the observation with only one adjustable parameter instead of two or three fig 5 a demonstrated that thickness reduction of p limiting biofilm in each identical flux interval is decreased during compression phase 180 80 and 60 μm this behaviour indicates a biofilm stiffening phenomenon strength hardening paramonova et al 2009 rmaile et al 2013 during compression the biofilm compression can be attributed to the permeate drag force which is induced by the liquid flow driven by a pore pressure drop across the biofilm fig 5a also shows the initial biofilm thickness l 0 450 μm under the growth conditions at permeate flux around 5 lmh the hydraulic resistance of p limiting biofilm increases with an increase in permeate flux fig 5b the biofilm resistance only slightly increased from 1 5 1012 to 1 9 1012 m 1 during the flux increase from 10 to 20 lmh this relatively minor rise in hydraulic resistance while the biofilm underwent significant structural deformation indicates that the decrease in permeability had a greater effect on hydraulic resistance than the biofilm thickness reduction consequently all the proposed mechanical models were able to describe the effect of flux on the biofilm resistance fig 5b the permeability change under compression can be attributed to biofilm structural re arrangement and void closure leading to biofilm porosity decrease porosity variation was calculated by eq 5 and permeability function of porosity was computed by eq 6 the exponent n in eq 6 tunes the slope of the resistance vs flux curve with higher n leading to steeper resistance rise see sensitivity analysis section the actual porosity change as calculated is represented in fig 6 the porosity decreased by 50 in the compression phase while it could be recovered to nearly its initial value in the relaxation phase fig 6 4 2 deformation of river water biofilm under controlled transmembrane pressure the river water biofilm grown in this study consisted of a mixture of extracellular polymeric substance and cells as well as particulate matter originating from the influent the river water biofilm grown in this study included particulate matter originating from the influent in addition to the typical biofilm composition mixture of eps and cells biofilms grown under different conditions and influent compositions have different eps concentration and composition desmond et al 2018 table 2 shows the measured eps concentration of both p limiting and river water biofilms eps concentration was higher for the p limiting biofilm 676 mg c m2 compared to the river biofilm with an eps concentration of 541 mg c m2 the river water biofilm was grown under 60 mbar tmp in a dead end uf and it has been subjected to the relaxation compression scheme presented here fig 1b a cross section image of river water biofilm structure is illustrated in fig 3b similar to the p limiting biofilm the river water biofilm expresses a reversible structural response and recoverable deformation during the step wise unload load cycle which can be well described by an elastic model fig 7 as the applied tmp increased from 0 06 bar to 0 5 bar the biofilm thickness decreases from 100 to 40 μm fig 8 a the same strain hardening mechanism in which biofilm stiffness increases as biofilm deforms can be noted here i e less relative deformation as the tmp increases the fully reversible biofilm deformation measured in this case implies a fully elastic behaviour however due to the nonlinear relationship between stress and deformation the elastic modulus should increase with a decrease in biofilm porosity therefore we proposed an effective young modulus e e f f e φ m the fitted biofilm hardening coefficient m was 0 88 and the e 196 pa in this way the effective young modulus i e biofilm stiffness increases from 300 pa φ 0 6 to 700 pa φ 0 25 when tmp increases from 0 06 to 0 5 bar respectively fig 9 fig 8b also shows that the river water biofilm hydraulic resistance increases from 1 2 1012 to 1 5 1012 m 1 during tmp change from 0 06 to 0 5 bar similar to p limiting biofilm a decrease in biofilm porosity due to structural deformation causes a slight increase in hydraulic resistance both homogeneous biofilms in this study presented a reversible and recoverable deformation under applied stress caused either by controlling the flux or the tmp the deformation in thickness leads to a change hydraulic resistance due to porosity variation 4 3 sensitivity analysis biofilm thickness and hydraulic resistance are the main structural and hydrological properties determined experimentally in this study to evaluate how mechanical and permeability properties of the biofilm could influence the biofilm thickness and hydraulic resistance parametric sensitivity simulations were performed with changes in the young modulus e and hardening coefficient m for the elastic model shear modulus g v and relaxation time τ v for the viscoelastic model initial yield stress σ ys0 for the plastic behaviour and permeability coefficient a and exponent n for the hydraulic model fig 10 mechanical parameters biofilms with a higher value of the elastic modulus e have greater stiffness and therefore should undergo smaller structural deformation at a given load i e imposed flux or tmp increasing e from 300 to 500 pa resulted a significant increase in biofilm thickness from 150 to 250 μm at applied flux of 20 lmh fig 10a the biofilm hydraulic resistance only slightly decreased for the similar change in elastic modulus from 1 45 1012 to 1 35 1012 m 1 the effects of biofilm hardening coefficient m on biofilm thickness and resistance are shown in fig 10d for a river water biofilm case increasing the biofilm hardening coefficient from 0 4 to 1 2 would result in larger biofilm stiffness during the compression phase and a calculated biofilm thickness reduction from 50 to 100 μm respectively however a change in hardening coefficient had only a minor effect on hydraulic resistance as shown in fig 10d a variation in the other biofilm mechanical properties i e shear modulus g v and relaxation time τ v for the viscoelastic model or the initial yield stress σ ys0 for the plastic behaviour in the range often reported for biofilms had only minor influences on the computed biofilm thickness and resistance figure s1 hydraulic parameters biofilm hydraulic parameters i e permeability coefficient a and exponent n in the permeability dependence on the biofilm porosity eq 6 greatly affected biofilm thickness and resistance during step wise flux change increasing the permeability exponent n from 1 to 1 5 leads to decrease in the biofilm thickness from 350 to 200 μm at 10 lmh permeate flux for the p limiting biofilm case fig 10b practically the larger the permeability exponent n the steeper the slope of resistance elevation becomes during permeate flux increase as expected the change in biofilm permeability coefficient a lead to an important thickness and resistance variation fig 10c for example increasing permeability coefficient from 1 10 16 to 1 10 15 m2 resulted in a biofilm thickness of 280 to 40 μm at permeate flux equal to10 lmh 4 4 discussion observed relation between biofilm deformation and hydraulic resistance it is well experimentally proven that biofilm compression increases the hydraulic resistance and consequently reduces the water permeation through the membrane derlon et al 2016 desmond et al 2018 dreszer et al 2013 2014 valladares linares et al 2015 the reversibility in biofilm compression during permeation at changing fluxes or tmps is related to biofilm composition and morphology valladares linares et al 2015 ex situ measurements of biofilm deformation do not provide adequate information on structure dynamics and its effects on biofilm hydraulic resistance as these only occur in permeation conditions thus applications of microscopy and image processing techniques particularly oct but also confocal laser microscopy for in situ biofilm deformation measurements have attracted attention recently blauert et al 2015 fortunato et al 2017 in situ biofilm deformation was measured without permeation under shear forces only blauert et al 2015 or under both permeation and shear force in microfiltration mf to evaluate the effect of biofilm compression on the hydraulic resistance dreszer et al 2013 dreszer et al 2014 measured biofilm compression and relaxation under step wise flux change in uf and they observed that biofilm hydraulic resistance significantly increased at elevated permeate fluxes later valladares linares et al 2015 observed biofilm deformation and correlated biofilm thickness under step wise flux changes in mf to biofilm hydraulic resistance they observed a clear time dependent biofilm deformation under permeate flux and interpreted this as a viscoelastic mechanical behaviour recently desmond et al 2018 measured biofilm thickness using oct in dead end ultrafiltration under a step wise change in permeate flux and tmp the biofilm in their study was exposed only to compression forces and the effect of shear force could be neglected due to dead end conditions in the membrane filtration process biofilm mechanical model in the present study we observe reversible compression for both biofilms figs 4 and 7 which could be explained by a simple elastic model however for the p limiting biofilm some small permanent deformation was recorded which could be interpreted both as viscoelastic and as elastoplastic behaviour a viscoelastic biofilm is recognized by the time dependency of deformation under constant load peterson et al 2015 however data from figs 4 and 7 demonstrate that the biofilm thickness remained constant under constant applied stress still one should note that in our membrane biofouling study the data acquisition time interval minutes was much larger than the biofilm relaxation time seconds derived from the experiments by valladares linares et al 2015 thus the permanent biofilm deformation could still be described by a viscoelastic model while remaining in agreement with a plastic characteristic too all these lead to the conclusion that the observed mechanical behaviour of the biofilm not only depends on biofilm composition and morphology but also on the type of applied stress e g shear by flow over the biofilm compression by permeation flow etc and on the time scale of observations biofilm hydraulics hydraulic resistance of biofilms depends on the biofilm structure e g thickness surface roughness and porosity and permeability characteristics figs 5b and 8b demonstrate that biofilm compression is accompanied by a small increase in biofilm hydraulic resistance under elevated flux or tmp assuming that the biofilm permeability does not vary due to compression the biofilm hydraulic resistance should decrease as a result of its thickness reduction the slight increase in hydraulic resistance clearly indicates that the effect of permeability reduction due to pore closure determines biofilm hydraulic resistance instead of biofilm shrinkage i e shortening the permeation distance the proposed models thus imply that the biofilm compression mainly occurs by pore shrinkage and that the pores are partially restored during the relaxation phase dreszer et al 2013 and valladares linares et al 2015 reported much stronger increase in hydraulic resistance under elevated fluxes than results of this study presented such deviation could be explained by the differences in biofilm morphology among these investigations heterogeneous biofilms i e fluffy filamentous mushroom like etc in these studies would collapse under applied stress leading to macro pore closure or channel blocking ultimately resulting in a significant rise of hydraulic resistance moreover biofilm structure collapse would lead to irreversible biofilm compression since the biofilms in our study had only a low surface roughness demonstrating reversible and recoverable deformation under compression accompanied by a slight increase observed in the hydraulic resistance therefore for a biofilm with homogeneous surface i e planar flat smooth etc the compression could mainly affect the structural deformation not the hydrological properties i e hydraulic resistance biofilm porosity the calculated porosity changed significantly during the compression and relaxation cycles mostly between 0 75 and 0 25 figs 6 and 9b in order to better estimate the model parameters mechanical and hydraulic the biofilm porosity would have to be determined independently during the permeation experiments measurements of biofilm porosity were reported by blauert et al 2015 who estimated a change in 5 10 porosity during their shear flow tests but such measurements would also be needed under permeation conditions however it should be noted that biofilm porosity measurement is really challenging for multiple reasons first the biofilm fragile structure can be damaged in ex situ techniques second the pore distinction in in situ techniques using image processing can be ambiguous i e grey scale thresholding non repetitive image brightness contrast interpretation of grey scale image pore distinction criteria etc finally the porosity observed by visual microscopic imaging techniques i e apparent voids in the biofilm structure may not be directly correlated with the hydraulic porosity thus back calculation of biofilm porosity using structural and hydrological properties i e thickness and hydraulic resistance might lead to more reliable porosity values biofilm structural hardening biofilm thickness during compression relaxation phases depends on biofilm composition i e cells polymers mineral inclusions all with different mechanical properties biofilm morphology i e surface roughness and porosity and applied load magnitude and direction i e shear or normal forces several studies show how biofilm mechanical properties depend on biofilm composition and morphology dreszer et al 2013 peterson et al 2015 stoodley et al 1999 laspidou et al 2014 demonstrates with a numerical model that the biofilm mechanical properties change during compression and tension tests they also showed that biofilm mechanical properties can vary with the biofilm structure all these observations and theories support the definition of effective mechanical properties which integrate biofilm material properties intrinsic young modulus but probably also viscoelastic or elastoplastic parameters with biofilm hydrological and structural properties i e porosity the step wise flux change experiments showed that biofilm stiffness increases at greater permeation fluxes leading to smaller thickness reduction during compression biofilms in this study showed a strain hardening behaviour that can be represented quantitatively by the hardening coefficient m biofilm with higher values of hardening coefficient become stiffer under applied load fig 9a and consequently smaller deformation occurs under elevated fluxes fig 10d the strain hardening behaviour of biofilms was already reported by paramonova et al 2009 for dental biofilms similarly described before for rubber like materials this tendency could be explained by the fact that at mild compression forces the biofilm pores take up the stress and gradually close while at higher loads the polymers and cells harder biofilm constituents would oppose the applied load in this respect valladares linares et al 2015 demonstrated that eps concentration in the biofilm is a dominant factor in determining mechanical properties and biofilm thickness variation we proposed here a simple power law correlation of the elasticity modulus with the porosity e e f f e φ m however in the literature there are several other alternatives such as the ryshkewitch duckworth equation ryshkewitch 1953 proposed for porous sintered materials e e f f e exp m φ or the phani niyogi equation phani and niyogi 1987 using another power law formulation e e f f e 1 φ φ c r i t m which implies the existence of a critical porosity at which the young modulus becomes zero blauert 2017 mechanical properties values of young elastic modulus reported in literature vary in a wide range between 10 and 6000 pa korstgens et al 2001 mohle et al 2007 peterson et al 2015 stoodley et al 1999 based on biofilm type and applied mechanical tests for example stoodley et al 1999 reported elastic moduli between 17 and 240 pa for biofilms exposed to different shear levels while paramonova et al 2009 reported similar values of 20 200 pa for dental biofilms also under variable shear blauert et al 2015 reported a shear modulus of around 30 pa for biofilm under shear stress using oct and deformation angles which corresponds to e 80 pa when poisson ratio is 0 4 however under uniaxial compression much higher values were reported e 6500 pa korstgens et al 2001 in this study we found elastic moduli e of 320 pa for p limiting biofilm and 200 pa for river water biofilm well in the range reported in literature the variation of measured young modulus can be attributed to different biofilm composition different mechanical tests compression tensile shear and also different measurements techniques rheometer image processing etc one should note that mechanical properties in this work were calculated for biofilms under compression forces for which aravas and laspidou 2008 demonstrated that larger values should be obtained compared to shear tests moreover viscoelastic properties fitting data from this study were shear modulus g v 1000 pa and biofilm relaxation time τ v 17 s the biofilm relaxation times often reported in literature are in the order magnitude of seconds in line with the value reported here towler et al 2003 valladares linares et al 2015 moreover biofilm shear modulus g v 1000 pa is well in the range of the value reported for maxwell shear modulus for two type of biofilm by jones et al 2011 permeability properties although biofilm structure response to applied forces is greatly influenced by the elastic modulus its impact on hydraulic resistance did not appear considerable in our study this again can be explained by the fact that in homogeneous biofilms the hydraulic resistance is mainly governed by porosity change by pore closure and not by thickness decrease on the other hand sensitivity analysis simulations showed that the biofilm permeability coefficient a and permeability exponent n determine the biofilm hydraulic resistance fig 10b and c increasing values of a and n would result in higher permeability and therefore higher stress exerted on the biofilm leading to a considerable structural deformation as well as permeability change the correlation proposed here between biofilm permeability and porosity can be applied for biofilms with high surface roughness but with a higher value of exponent coefficient n future research to increase accuracy of experimental results and model validation more number of tmp steps need to be evaluated in the current study tmp steps selection were facing three main problems 1 make sure that compression would occur in the smaller range of tmp 2 lower tmp steps would result a very small change in the collected permeate mass used in the calculation of biofilm resistance and consequently the changes in hydraulic resistances for different tmp steps would be negligible and results would become doubtable 3 another issue for smaller tmp steps was that reaching a stable tmp value in a small step was difficult with the existing pid control system therefore the proposed approach in the study of biofilm compressibility should be evaluated for a wider tmp range and more tmp steps knowledge of biofilm mechanics is essential to optimize physical cleaning strategies such as shear cleaning hilal et al 2005 air bubble cleaning wibisono et al 2014 air water jet cleaning fabbri et al 2016 safari et al 2015 non invasive methodologies to obtain biofilm mechanical properties should be developed for this aim oct data coupled with a fluid structure numerical model can provide an opportunity to estimate biofilm mechanical properties in a non destructive way the present work focused on uniaxial biofilm compression driven by flow a fully coupled fluid structural model for heterogeneous surface biofilm also needs to be developed in order to use the two or three dimensional datasets obtainable by oct in this way the spatial variation of mechanical properties within heterogeneous biofilms could be estimated for such a goal experimental determination of local deformations in the biofilm is needed for example by using embedded particles galy et al 2012 or other particle tracking methods development of more complex material models to simulate deformation non linearity may be required coupling biofilm mechanics with flow would also need the development of reliable experimental techniques to measure biofilm hydraulic porosity 5 conclusions a poroelastic computational model which couples water permeation through the biofilm with the biofilm mechanics was developed to correlate the structural deformation with biofilm hydraulic resistance mechanical and hydraulic biofilm properties were estimated based on the data obtained in compression relaxation cycles with a fully coupled fluid structural model the hydraulic resistance of the smooth surface biofilms e g grown in p limiting conditions under compression was affected more by permeability decrease due to pore closure than by a decrease in thickness in membrane biofilm compression studies with sampling time step larger than the biofilm relaxation time both viscoelastic and elastoplastic models could describe the permanent biofilm deformation for biofilms under study due to the small irreversible deformation a simpler elastic model could also be used the elastic moduli fitting the measured data were in agreement with other reported values for biofilm under compression biofilm stiffening under larger flow driven compression forces was observed and described numerically by
