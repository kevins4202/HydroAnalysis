2275,the spatial and temporal evolutionary mechanisms of volatile components at plate boundaries and their potential as earthquake precursors are not well understood based on observations of he co2 from 19 hot spring gases in the lancang river fault zone yunnan province the results show that the volatiles mainly come from the crust the combined he isotope he co2 relationships and δ13c co2 values of the hot spring volatiles indicate that it is a mixture of mantle and crustal fluids these are related to the radiogenic he production caused by crustal u and th elements with 5 mantle derived he whereas c is mainly from the metamorphic decarbonization of tethyan marine carbonate rocks based on the he co2 isotopic relationship crustal volatiles flux with a significant proportion were determined within a non volcanic area which was estimated to be 9 132 mol a 1 and co2 degassing was estimated to be 2 120 109 mol a 1 these results are comparable to those of some volcanic areas and large seismically active fault zones such as the san andreas fault zone the compressional stress field of the rigid crust near the study area leads to the low permeability of large faults and co2 degassing from the hydrothermal system resulting in chemical precipitation that further blocks the shallow crust conduits and deduced overpressure below the hydrothermal reservoir which may be the cause of the presence of earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 7 in the lancang river fault zone the results are significant for elements cycling of converging plate boundaries and earthquake hazards monitoring keywords he co2 systematics volatiles flux large fault zone tibetan plateau geothermal system 1 introduction fluids play essential active and passive roles in earthquake circulation smeraglia et al 2016 earthquakes alter the physical and chemical processes of fluids by changing the permeability of the fault zone which in turn affects the transfer of mass and energy around the fault zone wang and manga 2015 wang et al 2019 the fluid is sensitive to stress strain in the fault zone and can trace pre earthquake seismogenesis and post earthquake processes fracture permeability increases when an earthquake occurs providing conduits for the release of deep fluids fischer et al 2017 wang and pang 2022 in the geothermal zone chemical precipitation blocks fractures due to the cooling degassing and secondary processes of geothermal fluids and the formation of overpressure fluid as the release of fluids is prevented liu et al 2022 calcite precipitation may also identify artifacts of increased mantle volatiles from hot spring gases barry et al 2020 many studies have been conducted on hydrological changes caused by earthquakes in fault zones including the release of water fluctuations in water level changes in water temperature water chemistry and gas composition zhou et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 chen et al 2018 tian et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a wang et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 however most fluid chemical changes related to earthquakes are focused on the discovery of earthquake precursors and there is little research on the time space consistency between seismic activity and gas release mantle derived volatiles co2 and he are sensitive to tectonic activity at plate boundaries and within continents mantle volatiles are often observed in locations with recently active volcanoes troll et al 2013 hotovec ellis et al 2018 melnik et al 2020 in addition significant mantle derived volatiles can be observed in the extension areas although there is no evidence of volcanic activity on the surface burnard et al 2012 aydın et al 2015 this is related to partial melt degassing caused by extension or mantle degassing induced by deep faults through the crust the composition and isotopic characteristics of he co2 systematics can indicate the permeability of deep faults and are closely related to fault activity and seismic risk fischer et al 2017 sánchez reyes et al 2021 seismicity can also change the physical and chemical properties of crustal fluids and the concentrations he co2 rn etc and stable isotope ratios 3he 4he δ13c co2 of many hot spring gases often change significantly before and after earthquakes du et al 2006 chiodini et al 2011 umeda et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 wang et al 2020 the higher the δ13c co2 and 3he 4he values of the hot spring gas the higher is the frequency of earthquakes li et al 2022b therefore the source evolutionary process and flux characteristics of the volatiles play an essential role in the evaluation of seismicity the spatial variation characteristics of the volcanic and hydrothermal gas geochemical indices 3he 4he δ13c co2 and co2 3he indicate that the source and release of volatiles such as he and co2 under convergent plates differ among various tectonic units in the direction of plate subduction barry et al 2019 hiett et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c in most cases of plate convergence e g subduction zones a significant feature of the source and degassing of volatiles is the participation of mantle derived components along the plate subduction direction resulting in spatial differences in mantle degassing fourré et al 2011 barry et al 2020 the collision of the indo european continental plates created a special subduction zone in northern burma zhang et al 2021c many geological and geophysical studies have shown that the yunnan burma block is the active region of the mantle wedge which is an ideal place to study volatile flux within the crust under the background of active orogenesis at present there are some studies on the volatile characteristics in this research area such as the sources of he and co2 wang et al 2020 the effects of earthquakes on he and co2 characteristics zhou et al 2020 the large cross section of mantle degassing zhang et al 2022b and the relationship between degassing and deep faults zhang et al 2021b from the outset research has mainly focused on the cause and evolution mechanism of hot spring gases the volatile flux and related seismic activities have not been investigated in this study the gas chemical and isotopic characteristics of 19 hot springs in the lancang river fault zone lrfz were analyzed from 2015 to 2020 the mechanism of the chemical processes in the evolution of he and co2 from hot spring gases as well as the effect of the plate convergence zone on the release of volatiles is discussed the results strengthen the chemical and mechanical processes in the assessment of the volatile flux at the plate convergence boundary and monitoring of earthquake precursors 2 geological environment of the study area 2 1 geological background the study area is located in southwest yunnan southeast of the collision zone between the indian and eurasian plates fig 1 a it belongs to the yunnan burma block which is a northern extension of the burma thailand and malaysia microcontinents it is connected to the sichuan yunnan diamond block in the east and is adjacent to the eastern himalayan syntaxis in the northwest liu et al 2015 this region experienced strong tectonic activity in china because of the double action of the eastern subduction of the indian plate and the lateral extrusion of the qinghai tibet plateau a large horizontal strike slip tectonic pattern was formed with the red river and sagaing faults as the main controlling boundaries and a series of ne and nw trending reactive or new fault zones li et al 2022a several ne trending faults are distributed in the area from north to south including the nantinghe menglian jinghong mengxing and nam ma faults fig 1b liu et al 2015 these faults tend to be n or nw with an inclination of 60 80 showing obvious compression torsion properties the characteristics of the stratigraphy of the study area are complex the proterozoic metamorphic basement protolith is a set of terrigenous sedimentary and continental basalts granitic and tonic diorite gneiss commonly known as the gaoligongshan group fig 1c from the late cambrian stable terrigenous clastic and carbonate rocks dominated whereas shallow marine carbonate platform deposits dominated in the late paleozoic the existing stratigraphic paleontological data characteristic sedimentary construction paleo water temperature and paleomagnetism support that the tengchong and baoshan microcontinents were part of the gondwana block in the late paleozoic the 19 hot springs are located in the gengga lrfz which is a branch of the lrfz with a length of approximately 800 km in yunnan province the average heat flow value is 75 mw m2 jiang et al 2019 fig 2 indicating abnormal heat source characteristics the overall direction of the lrfz is nnw to almost ns and the central direction varies greatly forming an obvious large bend northwest of yunxian county the lrfz is the main fault that controls the geological development of western yunnan liu et al 2015 2 2 seismic activity of the study area tectonic activity in southwest yunnan is quite frequent as it is one of the areas with the most intense seismic activity in mainland china in yunnan province most seismic activities have been concentrated in the fault zone of the block boundary fig 2 two major earthquakes have occurred in the study area over the past 30 years wang et al 2015 in 1995 there was an earthquake of magnitude 7 3 on the china burma border southwest of menglian and a magnitude 7 0 earthquake in lijiang in 1996 there have been no recent earthquakes larger than 7 0 near the study area there were three possible near field earthquakes related to volatiles fig 1b one of which was the cangyuan earthquake which occurred on march 1 2015 the ms5 5 earthquake occurred with a focal depth of 11 km the other two earthquakes were the myanmar earthquake ms 5 0 on april 18 2017 at a depth of 10 km and the mojiang earthquake ms 5 9 on september 10 2018 at a depth of 11 km 3 sampling and methods 3 1 free gas and hot spring sampling the sampling sites were mainly distributed within 300 km controlled by the nantinghe menglian and lrfz and the gas of some hot springs was sampled repeatedly the sampling time was within one month of an earthquake occurring in the vicinity of the study area within several hundred kilometers and the interval lasted from june 2015 to september 2020 the free gas from the hot springs was collected using the water draining method with low he diffusivity glass containers hilton et al 2002 sano and fischer 2013 following the procedures of zhang et al 2021c a high temperature resistant funnel inverted at the spring mouth delivered the bubbling gas to a submerged glass bottle filled with hot spring water when the water in the glass bottle was displaced by approximately 2 3 the mouth of the bottle was sealed using a silica gel stopper after sampling the bottle was sealed upside down in a wide mouthed bottle filled with hot spring water more than 53 free gas samples were collected with backup samples at the same point for each sample to facilitate repeated measurements the hot spring water from the four locations mb mm fl mg was collected in 250 ml polyethylene bottles after filtration with a 0 45 μm filter for alkalinity cation and anion analyses samples for cation and anion measurements were rinsed three times with the hot spring and water samples for cation measurements were acidified with hno3 the temperature c total dissolved solids tds and ph of each sample site was measured using a portable multiparameter analyzer hq40d hach 3 2 fluid geochemistry analysis the gas samples were tested at the lanzhou oil and gas resources center of the chinese academy of sciences the relative standard deviation of the gas composition was 5 as determined using an mat 271 mass spectrometer δ13c co2 values were determined using a gas chromatograph agilent 6890 stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific delta plus xp equipped with an online sample preprocessor the c isotope ratio was expressed using traditional delta numeration with a measurement error of 0 2 per milliliter compared to the south carolina piddy muscovite pdb the 3he 4he and 4he 20ne ratios were analyzed using a noblesse noble gas mass spectrometer nu instruments uk following the methods of hilton et al 2002 the 4he 20ne results were used to correct for atmospheric he and assumed 20ne 0 32 in air or 0 26 in air saturated groundwater asw porcelli and ballentine 2002 the he isotope results 3he 4he r were expressed as rc ra relative to air ra where ra 1 38 10 6 and atmospheric he was corrected air from gaolan hill south of lanzhou was used to calibrate the instrument these gas samples were measured within one month after the field sampling was completed the concentrations of major cations na k ca2 and mg2 and trace elements were measured using icp aes icap6000 thermo fisher scientific and icp ms 7500c agilent respectively major anions cl so4 2 f were measured using ion chromatography dionex ics600 thermo fisher scientific alkalinity was measured using a digital titrator with phenolphthalein and methyl orange as indicators 3 3 data collection and calculation to determine the relationship between these geochemical anomalies and large earthquakes near the study area we downloaded all seismic data from the china earthquake administration website https news ceic ac cn during the monitoring period within a radius of 200 km from the study area in the near field area longitude 99 3 100 71 latitude 21 52 23 61 there were 110 earthquakes of which 30 were greater than magnitude 4 and only 20 occurred during the monitoring period during the upward migration of he from the mantle it is diluted by 4he generated in the crust thus forming a concentration gradient of 3he 4he this vertical gradient is controlled by the upwelling velocity of the mantle fluid and radioactive origin within the fault zone for the study area located in the southern segment of the lrfz the crust thickness hc should be taken as 21 km mantle helium hef m 2 5 10 9 cm3 stp g 1 h2o zhang et al 2022b and the mantle fluid velocity can be calculated using the following formula kennedy et al 1997 1 q h c ρ s p 4 h e ρ f h e f m r s r c r m r s where ps 2 7 g cm3 pf 1 0 g cm3 and rs rc and rm represent the he ratio of the sample crust 0 02 ra and mantle 8 ra respectively p 4he represents the production rate of radioactive he in the crust u 3 ppm th 10 5 ppm the he flux in this area can be estimated using the upwelling he velocity and the total 3he flux can be calculated using the following formula kulongoski et al 2013 2 q 3 h e q ρ f 4 h e f s u r f a c e r sample where pf 1 0 g cm3 is the density of the hot spring and 4he f surface is the concentration of 4he in the hot spring which can be calculated based on hef m 4 results 4 1 gas components nitrogen was the non reactive gas with the highest concentration among all the samples in the study area and only a few samples had relatively high co2 and low nitrogen concentrations according to the main gas components co2 and n2 table 1 hot springs can be divided into two types as is commonly determined using hot spring gas from the tibetan plateau zhou et al 2017 wang et al 2020 in the first category there were three hot springs with co2 as the main component the average co2 concentration was approximately 59 9 vol volume concentration ranging from 50 25 to 68 95 vol in the second category there were 16 hot springs in which n2 was the main component the concentration of n2 in the hot spring gas ranged from 63 17 to 97 69 vol with an average value of 86 3 vol the concentration of he in hot spring gases was approximately 27 2881 ppm the concentration range of h2 was 0 8 2676 ppm and that of ch4 was 0 12 15 76 vol according to the temporal records of several hot springs table 1 the variations in mg and fl were relatively small whereas the changes in mb and mm were visible among which the change in co2 was the most significant fig 3 4 2 helium isotopes after atmospheric correction the data were used for subsequent analyses and calculations the 3he 4he values of the samples ranged from 0 014 to 0 27 ra with 10 samples greater than 0 1 ra and others 0 1 ra the 4he 20ne ratio was 1 5 520 which is much higher than the atmospheric ratio 4he 20ne 0 318 ozima and podosek 2002 in the majority of samples n 37 the ratio of 4he 20ne was several to a hundred times higher than the atmospheric ratio and the rc ra values air corrected 3he 4he values of all samples were greater than zero 4 3 carbon isotope results the δ13c co2 values of the western yunnan gas samples varied from 25 3 to 8 3 and the δ13c ch4 values ranged from 72 to 11 55 vs vpdb table 1 the δ13c co2 and δ13c ch4 values in n2 bearing hot springs varied from 25 3 to 8 5 vs pdb and from 72 to 11 55 vs pdb respectively alternately the results for co2 bearing hot springs were quite uniform with δ13c co2 values ranging from 11 6 to 8 3 vs pdb and approximately 42 for δ13c ch4 4 4 co2 3he ratios the co2 3he values of the western yunnan hot spring gas samples varied over a wide range of 1 16 107 to 1 29 1011 with a variability of five orders of magnitude most samples were greater than mid ocean ridge basalts morb mantle 2 0 109 hilton et al 2002 as well as the global average arc values 1 2 1010 sano and marty 1995 and continental fluids 1011 o nions and oxburgh 1988 the wide variability is related to the decoupling of he co2 systematics with most samples characterized by metamorphic co2 and crustal he which will be discussed later 4 5 water geochemistry the ion concentrations in the hot springs are listed in table 2 the hydrochemistry of the hot springs was mainly hco3 na the tds value ranged from 449 mg l to 1066 mg l and the ph of the four hot springs was slightly alkaline the highest tds value mm of the hot springs is marked by a high ph and co2 3he higher tds and ph values might be related to excess co2 relative to 3he in the hot spring gas as well as the release of crustal co2 the saturation index si of the hot spring water was calculated using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 which can determine the equilibrium state of an aqueous solution of calcite the si values ranged from 3 95 to 1 69 only negative values for the mm hot spring indicating that the calcite is unsaturated and could be dissolved however it should be noted that calcite dissolution is inversely related to temperature hot springs mm with low ca indicate that geothermal water exists at a certain depth for a long time and then ascending migration cooling creates an unsaturated solution in calcite not receiving a ca supply 5 discussion 5 1 variation characteristics of gas composition the gas compositions in western yunnan varied spatially and were relatively dispersed hot spring mm changes in co2 concentration might be due to the difference in the solubility of co2 and n2 in different seasons with a very low gas water ratio 0 0001 with spring flow rate 30 l s tong et al 2000 while analogous to the u mostku hot spring bräuer et al 2014 ar is considered the main atmospheric source of volcanic and geothermal gas components giggenbach 1996 therefore the n2 ar ratio should not be less than that of air 83 or asw 45 fischer et al 1998 samples with ratios lower than 45 were considered to have been subjected to relatively severe air contamination the relationship between n2 he and ar can be used to quantify the contributions of the different sources as shown in fig 3a giggenbach 1996 gases from the mantle have low n2 concentrations and n2 he 200 generally acceptable he ar and n2 ar ratios in the upper mantle are of the order of 1 burnard et al 1997 and 80 marty and zimmermann 1999 respectively the gases associated with volcanic arcs have higher n2 concentrations and n2 he greater than 1000 mainly because of the addition of deposited nitrogen during subduction fischer et al 1998 hilton et al 2002 the n2 ar ratio of the sample ranged from 25 to 182 6 as shown in fig 3 the samples in this study mainly came from regions subjected to different degrees of mixture between mantle derived and air or air saturated groundwater which is consistent with the mixture characteristics observed by zhang et al 2021c in the red river fault zone northeast of the study area moreover the absence of a correlation between the relative gas abundance and he isotope ratios indicates that it was not a simple mixture of mantle derived fluids and air or asw source gas fig 3b hiett et al 2021 the higher n2 than co2 content in many hot spring gas samples could be attributed to calcite precipitation with selective dissolution of co2 and n2 with different solubilities fig 3c zhang et al 2022b considering the change in the δ13c co2 value and co2 he relationship calcite precipitation during co2 degassing may be the dominant reason for the higher n2 content 5 2 he and co2 characteristics 5 2 1 he characteristics and inventory natural fluids from areas with tectonic activity are generally interpreted as originating from three different sources the mantle crust and air kipfer et al 2002 the source of he in geothermal gas is acknowledged to originate from degasification of the mantle and α decay of radioactive elements u and th in the crust dissolved water is transported underground because of the replenishment of atmospheric sources ballentine and burnard 2002 in continental environments due to intense radiogenic 4he formation in the crust ballentine and burnard 2002 the 3he 4he ratio is generally 0 02 0 05 ra with measurable but relatively small mantle he 3he 4he 20ne ratios are 1000 for the crust and mantle and 0 318 for air graham 2002 most samples in the study area had air corrected ratios rc ra less than that of typical crustal values only eight of the hot springs had rc ra 0 05 suggesting that the dominant crustal he had a slight presence of mantle derived he according to fig 4 our samples fell between crustal values 0 1 ra and mantle derived values 8 1 ra for morb and 6 1 2 1 ra for the sub continental lithospheric mantle sclm graham 2002 day et al 2015 based on the spatial distribution of the sample sites these hot springs mb mb7 mka ml etc fig 1b with detectable mantle derived he are close to the nw strike faults indicating that these faults have profound volatile flux a three component mixed model was used to estimate the various he contributions for each sample sano and wakita 1985 and the results are presented in table s1 supplementary materials the contribution of mantle he to several hot spring gases mb ml my yr and mka was larger ranging from 1 1 to 2 2 while that of other mantle derived he was lower 1 most of the n2 bearing hot springs except for mb ml my and yr had lower mantle derived he content 1 whereas those of co2 bearing hot springs were greater than 1 according to fig 4 the mantle derived he was 5 in both n2 and co2 bearing hot spring gases based on the long term records of several hot spring gases mb fl mg and mm the contribution of he did not change significantly before and after the earthquake however only the ratio of co2 3he of hot spring mm changed significantly fig 5 indicating that the degassing of magma was not the main cause of gas change and the effect of secondary processes and change in permeability might be possible causes of gas concentration change furthermore the atmospheric he sources of mm fl and mg increased significantly before and after the earthquake which also indicates that the earthquake may have led to changes in the permeability of underground rock strata and thus promoted the flow of groundwater 5 2 2 co2 characteristics and inventory the co2 content in the mantle volatiles was 104 times that of he he and co2 are released from the deep crust however they are not strictly coupled at every stage of fluid migration dunai and porcelli 2002 gilfillan et al 2008 given that some he originated from the mantle previous section it can be expected that co2 has a similar source however the resolution of the sources and proportions of endogenous co2 crust carbonated sclm and asthenosphere components is complicated by fluid mixing under and within aquifers and uncertainties in the endmember characteristics sano and marty 1995 the relationship between δ13c co2 and co2 he in gases can be used to identify the sources of co2 sano and marty 1995 barry et al 2020 δ13c co2 values for all samples between marine carbonates 0 2 and metamorphic sediments 30 10 tardani et al 2016 indicate the mixing of the two we inferred that most of the deep co2 gas is of crustal origin marine carbonate rocks and or metamorphic sediments however the lithospheric mantle often creates heterogeneous records caused by metasomatic events within continental environments with a co2 3he ratio of 7 109 which can lead to c enrichment relative to morb 1 5 2 109 marty et al 2020 asian sclm isotopes are also thought to be heavier than morb isotopes zhang et al 2021c δ13c co2 of morb from 8 to 4 bräuer et al 2016 therefore it can be assumed that co2 3he of the sclm endmembers is 2 7 109 and δ13c co2 is 4 these hot spring samples showed some characteristics of co2 enrichment and their co2 3he values displayed a high of 1012 and a low of 106 which differed from those of the mantle endmembers the high co2 3he ratios 1012 1014 that usually explain most co2 rich crustal terrestrial gases are produced by decarbonization reactions that produce co2 rich 3he free gases fig 6 sano and marty 1995 evans et al 2008 therefore it can be speculated that co2 dominated gases are mixtures of co2 rich crustal gases of which 5 20 are mantle derived c the hypothetical mixing curve between the co2 rich samples along the sclm endmembers and a group of endmembers with the same radiogenic rc ra values with different co2 3he ratios decreased based on the classification of deep source co2 emissions i e magma transition and background levels a ternary hybrid model based on he co2 systematics proposed by sano and marty 1995 was used to calculate the proportions of the mantle carbonate rock car and metamorphic sediment org in the total c inventory the calculation formula is as follows 3 13 c 12 c obs f m 13 c 12 c m f l 13 c 12 c l f s 13 c 12 c s 4 1 12 c 3 h e obs f m 12 c 3 h e m f l 12 c 3 h e l f s 12 c 3 h e s 5 f m f l f s 1 where the subscripts obs m l and s represent the observed values of the sample mantle car and org terminal members respectively the reference values for the mantle car and org terminal members were consistent with those previously defined in sano and marty 1995 which are δ13c 6 5 2 5 and co2 3he 2 109 for morb type mantle δ13c 0 2 and co2 3he 1013 for car and δ13c 30 10 and co2 3he 1013 for org terminal members fig 7 in this selected model the morb type c source was taken as an endmember of the calculation model considering that data from fluid inclusions near the study area reveal the possible existence of mantle derived he sources however for the background he source the sclm type magma is considered to be a mantle c endmember of the model δ13c 3 5 co2 3he 7 109 bräuer et al 2016 this is because background samples are likely related to the degasification of sclm source fluid during active faults such as those observed in non volcanic areas without an asthenospheric source magma the source of co2 in the study area varied significantly from 1 5 to 55 1 table s1 especially in the n2 bearing hot spring gases only fl and yr contained mantle dominated co2 while the co2 bearing and most of the n2 bearing hot spring gases were crustal dominated indicating the crustal origin of volatiles and or the inapposite calculation scenario with high n2 samples according to the long term records of several hot spring gases mb fl mg and mm although the four hot springs showed some fluctuations in the co2 3he ratio in different years they were all within the range of crustal c the results showed that the mantle c content of the magmatic level samples ranged from 2 to 10 the crustal c content car and org endmember combinations ranged from 90 to 98 and sclm contributed 74 to the c inventory regardless of the source of mantle c morb vs sclm table s1 the contribution of carbonate rocks to total c was generally greater than that of organic sediments with an l s ratio greater than 1 16 samples in 28 it is worth noting that the results of the c three end model were inconsistent with the constraints of the he three end model for example the contribution of mantle he to the magma source sample was approximately 1 whereas that of mantle c to the same sample was 18 these results indicate that the gas sample may have undergone a secondary process of the he co2 system in the hydrothermal system leading to the decoupling of the co2 and he endmembers 5 3 he co2 system characteristics and control mechanism 5 3 1 degassing effect both the ratio co2 3he and δ13c of co2 can be altered by hydrothermal degassing to elucidate the degassing of yunnan hot spring gases the trends of co2 3he at high and low values were considered the plot of log co2 3he vs he concentration fig 8 a of the hot spring gas samples shows a broadly negative correlation r2 0 602 between the co2 3he ratio and he concentration he enters the gas phase more easily than co2 because of its lower solubility in aqueous solution in the process of phase separation of the geothermal fluid the co2 3he ratio increased and the he concentration decreased simultaneously however this synergistic change was observed in the strong correlation between the two there was no direct relationship between the gas and water separation in the yunnan gas samples however calcite precipitation was likely to change the co2 3he values the presence of travertine near the hot springs in the study area suggests that this may be the case the correlation plot of co2 3he vs co2 fig 8b has an appreciable positive correlation suggesting that co2 degassing followed by calcite precipitation may be the mechanism underlying the variation in gas co2 3he values however whether this is the sole mechanism will be analyzed in detail later according to previous studies zhang et al 2021b magma degassing had a significant influence on co2 3he and δ13c in the tengchong volcanic area which is not far from the study area as the transition level of volatile emissions from magma and deep crust was observed assuming a morb type mantle starting point co2 3he 2 109 δ13c 6 the minimum possible co2 3he ratio of the batch distillation closed degassing residual melt was 8 5 108 starting value divided by 2 35 which is the fractionation factor between he and co2 hilton et al 1998 in this case when the δ13c fractionation factor was 4 the δ13c value was 10 javoy et al 1978 in addition if the rayleigh fractionation mode open degassing is suitable 99 of co2 is lost to the gas phase with a co2 3he ratio of 1 4 108 and a δ13c value of 24 4 this was calculated using the following equation 6 c o 2 3 h e res c o 2 3 h e ini f α 1 α α 2 35 7 δ 13 c res δ 13 c ini 1000 α 1 ln f α 1 004 where f is the fraction of residual co2 in the magma and α is the fractionation factor of the corresponding equation the results showed that neither batch nor rayleigh fractionation from the morb mantle source could control the change in the co2 3he ratio and the low δ13c value of the samples in the study area similarly several samples from the simao block had low co2 3he values but did not seem to be related to magma degassing for gas samples from the vicinity of quaternary volcanic activity volatilization was largely influenced by degasification from magma cheng et al 2019 however it is difficult to consider deep magmatic degassing as the main controlling factor for the characteristics of the he co2 system in the hydrothermal system because of dilution of the volatiles in the crust the intra crustal hydrothermal and tectonic processes that the volatile system undergoes are likely to be the dominant factors 5 3 2 earthquake effects a long term record of gases is useful for discussing the relationship between fluid and earthquake interactions in terms of earthquake magnitude fig 5 strong earthquakes were mainly concentrated before 2017 and subsequent earthquakes did not exceed a magnitude of 6 this was mainly due to the 2012 myanmar magnitude 7 4 earthquake near the study area which gradually restored the area to a relatively calm state as a tracer of seismic activity the he ratio rc ra is sensitive to the seismic activity of a fault zone aydın et al 2015 the time series correlation between near field earthquakes epicenter distance 200 km of four hot springs and volatiles such as the he ratio rc ra and co2 3he fig 9 shows that there is no systematic correlation between seismic events and geochemical anomalies before 2019 while the earthquakes that occurred in may 2019 ms 4 9 and june 2020 ms 3 8 within 80 km might be responsible for the significant changes in rc ra and co2 3he the earthquake events before 2019 were either small or slightly larger in magnitude and were far from the study area more than 200 km the magnitude of an earthquake is positively correlated to its distance some sensitive volatiles can be detected over a range of more than 1000 km during large earthquakes wang et al 2004 woith et al 2013 however according to our geochemical statistics other processes affect the characteristics of volatiles from the analysis of seismic events and volatile anomalies it is not supported that earthquakes were the main factor causing volatile changes before 2019 in the study area we agree that near field earthquakes have some effect on the hydrothermal gas composition however our low sampling time frequency did not provide strong proof of the effect of the earthquake on volatile changes and it is necessary to improve the sampling frequency of volatiles in future work 5 3 3 fault controls it is important to determine the source of volatiles and identify the transport pathways and processes of volatiles the he isotope characteristics showed that a large proportion of he was of radioactive origin klemperer et al 2022 in general the enrichment of radioactive elements was mostly concentrated in the upper crust 10 km whereas some elements u and th were highly enriched in the study area zhang et al 2022a it is reasonable to assume that neotectonics are the main volatile channels concurrently the topography of the study area is quite variable and meteoric water could migrate to deeper locations within the crust along the faults which may exceed 5 km diamond et al 2018 these geothermal systems provide good channels for the release of radiogenic he gannibal et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b the mantle derived he in the mb spring located at tectonic endpoints was significantly higher than that in the other springs which is clear evidence that the structure is a he release channel especially mantle he the study area is located at the front of the indo european collision convergence and the inserted indian plate provides a structure for deep mantle gas release from seismic data it was established that the crustal thickness in this area is approximately 30 km therefore the lower he isotope ratio 0 05 ra is probably caused by the deep fluid passing through the thicker crust and then being mixed with the radiogenic he in the crust thus displaying lower mantle derived he characteristics 5 aydın et al 2015 mb is in a fault zone a deep fault that may have connected the lower crust and provided conditions for the release of he from the mantle it is worth noting that the permeability structure of the fault zone is quite different and may change on both the temporal and spatial scales in general the fracture around the fault core is more permeable and thus may show higher 3he 4he values than the fault core itself however this is usually only true for short distances a few hundred meters barry et al 2020 relatively low 3he 4he values 0 2 ra were previously shown near the fault core of the san andreas fault whereas higher values of up to 0 9 ra and 2 ra were observed at approximately 100 and 1400 m from the fault core respectively kulongoski et al 2013 these fracture zones in the study area are subject to the tension action of the extruded block forming tensor torsional active fractures in the northeast and northwest directions that control the release of volatile components another tectonic factor that affects gas volatility is the stress field from the analysis of our data results the 3he 4he ratio was more characteristic of mantle volatility than δ13c because noble gases are not as prone to gas rock chemical processes as co2 he gas is transferred from deep to the surface especially in areas without volcanic activity and the permeability of fractures plays a very important role previous studies of large fracture he releases in the basin and range province in the usa found that extensional and high stress areas were intensely volatile releases banerjee et al 2011 this also implies that regional stress field conditions in fracture zones in non volcanic areas can control the release of volatiles by collating the global strain rate model v2 1 near the study area kreemer et al 2014 the average strain rate of the stress system involved in the fracture zone could be calculated and we plotted the regional stress field contours map for the study area fig 10 a the high strain rates were mainly concentrated near the boundary faults such as the red river and sagaing fault zones and were consistent with the strike of the fault zones these results were consistent with the ground deformation characteristics observed in the interior of the plate and the strain accumulation in the plate boundary fault zone and showed the decisive role of tectonic stress in determining the strain rate field thus the spatial relationship between the he flux fig 10b and the regional strain rates indicates that the compressional stress field controls the permeability of the fault zone which further affects the volatile flux 5 3 4 hydrothermal secondary process in hydrothermal systems phase separation changes the co2 3he and δ13c values because of the different solubilities of co2 and he in water ellis and golding 1963 the residual water samples exhibited higher co2 3he and δ13c values the gas phase is generally considered to be enriched with 3he relative to water because light isotopes are preferentially allocated to the gas phase during phase separation however this was not the case suggesting that the fluid may represent a primitive mantle feature that was later mixed with crustal source he one process that reduces co2 3he and δ13c fractionation is calcite precipitation which is deduced from the co2 loss that occurs during the mixing or cooling of geothermal fluids gilfillan et al 2009 ray et al 2009 to evaluate the effect of this mineralization process on the co2 he system we considered the fractionation process of calcite precipitation first the reaction of co2 with mantle sources or mixtures in shallow groundwater systems forms stable dissolved inorganic carbon dic and co2 reservoirs the temperature controlled co2 hco3 caco3 fractionation factor α mainly acts between 25 and 150 c the initial input of δ13c co2 was assumed to be identical in alkaline water mantle source or mixture source co2 interacts with the hydrothermal system to form dic including dissolved co2 and free co2 which are in isotopic equilibrium co2 gas in equilibrium with dic is based on rayleigh fractionation the iterative fitting data for the open system fractionation rayleigh fractionation curves holloway and blank 1994 were calculated as follows 8 δ 13 c o 2 f δ 13 c o 2 i 1000 f α c o 2 c a l c i t e 1 1000 where i and ƒ are the initial and residual δ13c of the total dissolved co2 total dissolved inorganic carbon in the spring water f is the residual fraction of co2 and αco2 calcite is the fractionation factor of co2 and calcite at a given temperature the fractionation factors of co2 and calcite can be calculated as follows hedenquist and lowenstern 1994 9 1000 ln α c o 2 c a l c i t e 8 91 10 8 t 3 8 557 10 6 t 2 1 881 10 4 t 1 8 27 where t is the temperature in kelvin in this model assuming a starting value of 2 109 co2 consumption was calculated relative to 3he the model assumed a δ13c co2 starting value of 4 the residual δ13c co2 and co2 3he in the system decreased with calcite formation as the original co2 content decreased the model predicted that more than 99 of the original c could be lost from the samples with the highest fractionation fig 7 resulting in extremely low co2 3he and δ13c co2 values the gas dissolves in the deep fluid and then interacts with the country rock during cooling and or mixing with native fluids deep in the hydrothermal system enriching the fluid with na ca2 mg2 and hco3 co3 2 ions mcling and johnson 2002 co2 rich fluids and gases react with these ions to precipitate carbonate minerals and co2 is retained as calcite resulting in a lower co2 3he ratio in the gas and a higher negative δ13c value in addition hydrogeochemical simulation of the four hot springs using phreeqc showed that the chemical components were essentially supersaturated for calcite at the sampling temperature indicating the potential to form calcite precipitation table 2 moreover the presence of travertine around the hot springs in the study area also provides support however this process is highly temperature dependent the depth range of the calcite precipitation can be calculated using c isotope fractionation based on a constant geothermal gradient to identify the contribution of c from different sources δ13c co2 and co2 3he diagrams of the gas sample were drawn fig 7 dashed lines represent the expected fractionation trends of the calcite precipitation model at various temperatures 25 50 100 150 192 and 250 c barry et al 2020 most n2 bearing samples were distributed in the regions predicted by the calcite precipitation model indicating that calcite precipitation occurred during the migration of hot springs the fractionation trend associated with calcite precipitation at 25 192 c can be predicted by assuming the mantle starting point of the fluid it is important to note that 25 50 c is the approximate average surface temperature for the fluid and gas performance as shown in fig 7 the current calcite precipitation trend is concentrated in the range of 50 150 c assuming that the geothermal gradient in this area is 3 c 100 m yuan et al 2006 these precipitation processes occurred at a shallow location of 5 km within the crust 5 4 evolution and flux of volatiles 5 4 1 evolution process of he co2 systematics this analysis can be used to construct an evolution model for the volatiles of he c systematics at the plate convergence boundary fig 11 owing to the indo eurasian collision the insertion of the indian plate caused mantle convection mantle wedge in the study area resulting in small amounts of volatiles from the mantle he 3 co2 15 along some deep and large faults rising into the mid upper crust where it was mixed with radiogenic he within the shallower crust and co2 from the pyrolysis of carbonatite decarbonization and metamorphic sediments mixed volatiles continued to rise into the hydrothermal system to a depth of more than 5 km there was decoupling in the evolution of the he co2 system as a noble gas he barely reacts with the surrounding rock and its migration continues along fractures and fissures to be drained into the atmosphere by the hot springs dong et al 2017 co2 gas dissolved in the water formed dic and as the temperature and pressure continued to decrease during the rise of hot water decarbonization occurred leading to the precipitation of up to 90 of c δ13c co2 converted into calcite fixed in some faults along the way while only a portion of the deep source c was released into the atmosphere such precipitation changes the permeability and volatile flux of the fracture system and may subsequently alter the mechanical properties of country rock 5 4 2 volatile flux and its implications based on the 3he 4he ratio value corrected by our sample the flow rate of mantle volatiles in the study area was calculated as 0 1 5 7 mm y table s2 in supplementary materials which is consistent with the result obtained by zhang et al 2022b near the research area fig 10 this is much lower than that of the alpine fault zone at 420 2600 mm y menzies et al 2016 lower than that of the san andreas fault 4 140 mm y kulongoski et al 2013 and the north anatolian fault 130 190 mm y 1 de leeuw et al 2010 and slightly lower than that of the karakoram fault 12 19 mm y 1 klemperer et al 2013 the most likely reason is that there is no quaternary volcanic activity in the vicinity of the study area and there are fewer mantle volatiles in addition considering that the lrfz is 500 km long and 20 km wide the total 3he flux in the study area is 2 30 105 cm3 stp a 1 9 132 mol a 1 the he flux results over several years are relatively consistent indicating no significant tectonic activity in comparison with other fault zones this result was slightly greater than the he fluxes in the san andreas fault with 5 8 mol 3he a 1 kulongoski et al 2013 and comparable with that in arc volcanos about 70 mol 3he a 1 allard 1992 considering that mantle co2 3he is 2 109 mantle co2 flux can be calculated and the calculation results were 2 120 109 mol a 1 as listed in table s2 considering the reduction in co2 flux caused by calcite precipitation 90 the total co2 flux in the crust and mantle of the lrfz could reach 2 120 1010 mol a 1 by comparison the total non volcanic flux in central italy was 1011 mol co2 a 1 rogie et al 2000 that in the colorado plateau was about 1 4 109 mol co2 a 1 crossey et al 2009 and the total flux estimated for the volcanic arc was 1 6 1012 mol co2 a 1 jaffe et al 2004 the deep source decarbonization of active faults in the plate boundaries was of the same order of magnitude as that in volcanic areas the permeability length scale and geometric parameters of faults are external mechanisms that affect deep source decarbonization the study area was located in the southern segment of the lancang river fault geophysical observations in this area showed that there was no shallow magmatic activity yu et al 2020 indicating that these deep source volatiles were mainly from the mantle and that the converging plate boundary controlled by these deep faults was a potential area for decarbonization during subduction collision volatile fluids are released from the crust of the upper mantle and descending plates and then migrate through the overlying crust deep faults and volcanic activity however c emissions may be masked by deep mantle c sources the decarbonization of subducted plates and hydrothermal secondary processes in some forearc hydrothermal systems up to 90 of c is deposited as calcite slowing the cycle of mantle volatiles barry et al 2019 in this case the directly observed degassing at the surface does not necessarily represent the actual amount of carbon emission at the convergence boundary calcite precipitation was controlled by the cooling and or mixing of hydrothermal processes on the other hand the co2 emission results in this study were also affected by calcite precipitation however considering that the error in the calculation process of co2 release and the existence of some parameters are appropriately maximized we believe that the co2 release calculation in this research is a relatively appropriate result 5 5 implications for regional seismic activity fluid activity can induce earthquakes we evaluated the seismic hazards in the study area based on the chemical and isotopic characteristics of the hot spring gases based on the thermal structural characteristics of the lithosphere the temperature of the lower crust in this area may be 700 900 c li et al 2021 which is lower than the melting temperature 1200 c of dry rock but higher than that of wet granite at 650 c lebedev and khitarov 1964 therefore the thermal state of the crust indicates the existence of partial melt in this region according to the results of high precision magnetotellurics the study area is located on the west side of the lrfz where partial melt occurs at a depth of 30 km and the shallowest melt reaches a depth of 10 km on the east side of the fault li et al 2022a this is also the reason for the difference in the volatile flux between this study and the red river fault zone zhang et al 2021b geothermal energy and earthquakes are different forms of energy released from the earth the geothermal field can affect the mechanical properties of rocks and the non uniform thermal structure can increase the thermal stress which promotes the accumulation of stress and induces rock fractures in the middle and upper crust the southeast of the qinghai tibet plateau is characterized by large scale clockwise rotation wang et al 2014 the xianshuihe xiaojiang and nujiang lancang river fault zones are the main boundary faults these two boundary belts are overlaid by two belts of highly conductive material in the lower crust and upper mantle bai et al 2010 indicating that the high strain belt observed at the surface extends to the upper mantle the decoupling between the lower crust and the middle and upper crust in this region may be caused by the existence of thermal material flow in the lower crust in this region bai et al 2010 based on observations from the global navigation satellite system gnss it was found that sinistral shear continued to extend through the red river fault zone to the broader western yunnan with a movement rate of 5 mm yr the deformation belt crosses the menglian and mengxing faults and extends approximately 200 km southwest wang and shen 2020 owing to the simultaneous rotation and translation motion the ne trending faults on the southwest side of the red river fault zone such as the longling and wanding faults have a stretching movement of 5 mm yr wang and shen 2020 the nne extrusion dominates southwest yunnan with a strain rate of 10 nanostrain yr wang et al 2021 the wanding east longling ruili east nantinghe lancang river and xiaojiang faults extend across the red river fault to the menglian and mengxing fault regions with high shear strain rates of up to 50 nanostrains yr wang et al 2021 the strain rate in the study area is approximately 10 nanostrains yr but the strain rate varies greatly in space fig 4 in wang and shen 2020 indicating that the heterogeneity of crustal strength is relatively obvious and it is a dangerous area for large earthquakes m greater than 7 there have been many cases in which fluid processes induced earthquakes in fault zones miller et al 2004 di luccio et al 2018 liu et al 2022 the seismogenic effects of deep source flows into fault zones may reduce the mechanical strength of rocks and friction within the fault zone thus becoming triggering factors for earthquakes fluids with high co2 concentrations have also been shown to induce large earthquakes such as those in central italy and the himalayas chiodini et al 2020 du et al 2021 a significant proportion of co2 in the study area was derived from metamorphic decarbonization of the middle and upper crust these deep fluids are prone to be trapped and overpressurized at depths of 5 10 km in the crust miller et al 2004 smeraglia et al 2016 which is consistent with the mechanical properties of the fault and the physicochemical conditions under co2 degassing lead to precipitation the seismic depth in the study area is concentrated at 5 15 km with a bimodal pattern fig 12 which is below the geothermal fluid circulation depth of the fault zone 4 8 km table 1 giggenbach et al 1991 guo et al 2017 but also above the low velocity high conductor layer within the area depth of the top boundary 30 km li et al 2022a based on the teleseismic effect triggered by large earthquakes many large faults in the study area are in the critical stress state of seismogenesis lei et al 2011 therefore the explosion release of the energy generated by fluid overpressure is sufficient to cause earthquakes of a certain magnitude wang et al 2020 the study area is located at the collision front of the indo eurasian continent with concentrated tectonic stress and frequent seismic disasters based on an analysis of the characteristics and fluxes of hot spring gas in western yunnan the results show that the deep source co2 fluxes in this region have a certain magnitude this study supports the mechanism of the overpressure formation of deep fluid upwelling and the secondary chemical process that triggers an earthquake in addition the stress field caused by the nonuniform thermal structure and crustal deformation characteristics near the lrfz may provide conditions for large earthquakes therefore based on the characteristics of volatiles in the lrfz it can be inferred that a rigid crust with concentrated stress is the physical basis for the occurrence of large earthquakes and that the overpressure fluid sealed by precipitated minerals is a critical process for inducing large earthquakes on the other hand observation and combined analysis of geofluid chemistry and isotope data water and gas geochemistry as well as crustal deformation and movement processes in the future will be more helpful for earthquake precursor warnings 6 conclusion in this study the he co2 systematics of 19 hot spring gases in the lrfz were studied he in hot spring gas is mainly radiogenic in the crust mixed with very little mantle degassed he and migrates upward along the deep faults the largest proportion of mantle derived he was 5 from the he isotope relationship it can be inferred that mantle he originates from a low velocity region of approximately 30 km which is the crust mantle boundary the relationship of the δ13c co2 value indicated that the c source from the mantle was moderate 15 whereas the main c sources were the pyrolysis of marine carbonate rocks and decarbonization of metamorphic sediments in the crust the changing δ13c co2 and co2 3he values indicate that these different c source calcite precipitates occurred in the upper crust approximately 5 km leading to the decoupling of the volatile he co2 systematics the chemical processes of the hydrothermal system and tectonic stress field of the regional fault zone control the permeability of the fault conduits in the study area which further restricts the occurrence of low volatile flux overpressure due to mineral precipitation and stress fields in the rigid crust may lead to high seismic risk in this area these results provide a window for characterizing fluid evolution and new

2275,the spatial and temporal evolutionary mechanisms of volatile components at plate boundaries and their potential as earthquake precursors are not well understood based on observations of he co2 from 19 hot spring gases in the lancang river fault zone yunnan province the results show that the volatiles mainly come from the crust the combined he isotope he co2 relationships and δ13c co2 values of the hot spring volatiles indicate that it is a mixture of mantle and crustal fluids these are related to the radiogenic he production caused by crustal u and th elements with 5 mantle derived he whereas c is mainly from the metamorphic decarbonization of tethyan marine carbonate rocks based on the he co2 isotopic relationship crustal volatiles flux with a significant proportion were determined within a non volcanic area which was estimated to be 9 132 mol a 1 and co2 degassing was estimated to be 2 120 109 mol a 1 these results are comparable to those of some volcanic areas and large seismically active fault zones such as the san andreas fault zone the compressional stress field of the rigid crust near the study area leads to the low permeability of large faults and co2 degassing from the hydrothermal system resulting in chemical precipitation that further blocks the shallow crust conduits and deduced overpressure below the hydrothermal reservoir which may be the cause of the presence of earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 7 in the lancang river fault zone the results are significant for elements cycling of converging plate boundaries and earthquake hazards monitoring keywords he co2 systematics volatiles flux large fault zone tibetan plateau geothermal system 1 introduction fluids play essential active and passive roles in earthquake circulation smeraglia et al 2016 earthquakes alter the physical and chemical processes of fluids by changing the permeability of the fault zone which in turn affects the transfer of mass and energy around the fault zone wang and manga 2015 wang et al 2019 the fluid is sensitive to stress strain in the fault zone and can trace pre earthquake seismogenesis and post earthquake processes fracture permeability increases when an earthquake occurs providing conduits for the release of deep fluids fischer et al 2017 wang and pang 2022 in the geothermal zone chemical precipitation blocks fractures due to the cooling degassing and secondary processes of geothermal fluids and the formation of overpressure fluid as the release of fluids is prevented liu et al 2022 calcite precipitation may also identify artifacts of increased mantle volatiles from hot spring gases barry et al 2020 many studies have been conducted on hydrological changes caused by earthquakes in fault zones including the release of water fluctuations in water level changes in water temperature water chemistry and gas composition zhou et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 chen et al 2018 tian et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a wang et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 however most fluid chemical changes related to earthquakes are focused on the discovery of earthquake precursors and there is little research on the time space consistency between seismic activity and gas release mantle derived volatiles co2 and he are sensitive to tectonic activity at plate boundaries and within continents mantle volatiles are often observed in locations with recently active volcanoes troll et al 2013 hotovec ellis et al 2018 melnik et al 2020 in addition significant mantle derived volatiles can be observed in the extension areas although there is no evidence of volcanic activity on the surface burnard et al 2012 aydın et al 2015 this is related to partial melt degassing caused by extension or mantle degassing induced by deep faults through the crust the composition and isotopic characteristics of he co2 systematics can indicate the permeability of deep faults and are closely related to fault activity and seismic risk fischer et al 2017 sánchez reyes et al 2021 seismicity can also change the physical and chemical properties of crustal fluids and the concentrations he co2 rn etc and stable isotope ratios 3he 4he δ13c co2 of many hot spring gases often change significantly before and after earthquakes du et al 2006 chiodini et al 2011 umeda et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 wang et al 2020 the higher the δ13c co2 and 3he 4he values of the hot spring gas the higher is the frequency of earthquakes li et al 2022b therefore the source evolutionary process and flux characteristics of the volatiles play an essential role in the evaluation of seismicity the spatial variation characteristics of the volcanic and hydrothermal gas geochemical indices 3he 4he δ13c co2 and co2 3he indicate that the source and release of volatiles such as he and co2 under convergent plates differ among various tectonic units in the direction of plate subduction barry et al 2019 hiett et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c in most cases of plate convergence e g subduction zones a significant feature of the source and degassing of volatiles is the participation of mantle derived components along the plate subduction direction resulting in spatial differences in mantle degassing fourré et al 2011 barry et al 2020 the collision of the indo european continental plates created a special subduction zone in northern burma zhang et al 2021c many geological and geophysical studies have shown that the yunnan burma block is the active region of the mantle wedge which is an ideal place to study volatile flux within the crust under the background of active orogenesis at present there are some studies on the volatile characteristics in this research area such as the sources of he and co2 wang et al 2020 the effects of earthquakes on he and co2 characteristics zhou et al 2020 the large cross section of mantle degassing zhang et al 2022b and the relationship between degassing and deep faults zhang et al 2021b from the outset research has mainly focused on the cause and evolution mechanism of hot spring gases the volatile flux and related seismic activities have not been investigated in this study the gas chemical and isotopic characteristics of 19 hot springs in the lancang river fault zone lrfz were analyzed from 2015 to 2020 the mechanism of the chemical processes in the evolution of he and co2 from hot spring gases as well as the effect of the plate convergence zone on the release of volatiles is discussed the results strengthen the chemical and mechanical processes in the assessment of the volatile flux at the plate convergence boundary and monitoring of earthquake precursors 2 geological environment of the study area 2 1 geological background the study area is located in southwest yunnan southeast of the collision zone between the indian and eurasian plates fig 1 a it belongs to the yunnan burma block which is a northern extension of the burma thailand and malaysia microcontinents it is connected to the sichuan yunnan diamond block in the east and is adjacent to the eastern himalayan syntaxis in the northwest liu et al 2015 this region experienced strong tectonic activity in china because of the double action of the eastern subduction of the indian plate and the lateral extrusion of the qinghai tibet plateau a large horizontal strike slip tectonic pattern was formed with the red river and sagaing faults as the main controlling boundaries and a series of ne and nw trending reactive or new fault zones li et al 2022a several ne trending faults are distributed in the area from north to south including the nantinghe menglian jinghong mengxing and nam ma faults fig 1b liu et al 2015 these faults tend to be n or nw with an inclination of 60 80 showing obvious compression torsion properties the characteristics of the stratigraphy of the study area are complex the proterozoic metamorphic basement protolith is a set of terrigenous sedimentary and continental basalts granitic and tonic diorite gneiss commonly known as the gaoligongshan group fig 1c from the late cambrian stable terrigenous clastic and carbonate rocks dominated whereas shallow marine carbonate platform deposits dominated in the late paleozoic the existing stratigraphic paleontological data characteristic sedimentary construction paleo water temperature and paleomagnetism support that the tengchong and baoshan microcontinents were part of the gondwana block in the late paleozoic the 19 hot springs are located in the gengga lrfz which is a branch of the lrfz with a length of approximately 800 km in yunnan province the average heat flow value is 75 mw m2 jiang et al 2019 fig 2 indicating abnormal heat source characteristics the overall direction of the lrfz is nnw to almost ns and the central direction varies greatly forming an obvious large bend northwest of yunxian county the lrfz is the main fault that controls the geological development of western yunnan liu et al 2015 2 2 seismic activity of the study area tectonic activity in southwest yunnan is quite frequent as it is one of the areas with the most intense seismic activity in mainland china in yunnan province most seismic activities have been concentrated in the fault zone of the block boundary fig 2 two major earthquakes have occurred in the study area over the past 30 years wang et al 2015 in 1995 there was an earthquake of magnitude 7 3 on the china burma border southwest of menglian and a magnitude 7 0 earthquake in lijiang in 1996 there have been no recent earthquakes larger than 7 0 near the study area there were three possible near field earthquakes related to volatiles fig 1b one of which was the cangyuan earthquake which occurred on march 1 2015 the ms5 5 earthquake occurred with a focal depth of 11 km the other two earthquakes were the myanmar earthquake ms 5 0 on april 18 2017 at a depth of 10 km and the mojiang earthquake ms 5 9 on september 10 2018 at a depth of 11 km 3 sampling and methods 3 1 free gas and hot spring sampling the sampling sites were mainly distributed within 300 km controlled by the nantinghe menglian and lrfz and the gas of some hot springs was sampled repeatedly the sampling time was within one month of an earthquake occurring in the vicinity of the study area within several hundred kilometers and the interval lasted from june 2015 to september 2020 the free gas from the hot springs was collected using the water draining method with low he diffusivity glass containers hilton et al 2002 sano and fischer 2013 following the procedures of zhang et al 2021c a high temperature resistant funnel inverted at the spring mouth delivered the bubbling gas to a submerged glass bottle filled with hot spring water when the water in the glass bottle was displaced by approximately 2 3 the mouth of the bottle was sealed using a silica gel stopper after sampling the bottle was sealed upside down in a wide mouthed bottle filled with hot spring water more than 53 free gas samples were collected with backup samples at the same point for each sample to facilitate repeated measurements the hot spring water from the four locations mb mm fl mg was collected in 250 ml polyethylene bottles after filtration with a 0 45 μm filter for alkalinity cation and anion analyses samples for cation and anion measurements were rinsed three times with the hot spring and water samples for cation measurements were acidified with hno3 the temperature c total dissolved solids tds and ph of each sample site was measured using a portable multiparameter analyzer hq40d hach 3 2 fluid geochemistry analysis the gas samples were tested at the lanzhou oil and gas resources center of the chinese academy of sciences the relative standard deviation of the gas composition was 5 as determined using an mat 271 mass spectrometer δ13c co2 values were determined using a gas chromatograph agilent 6890 stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific delta plus xp equipped with an online sample preprocessor the c isotope ratio was expressed using traditional delta numeration with a measurement error of 0 2 per milliliter compared to the south carolina piddy muscovite pdb the 3he 4he and 4he 20ne ratios were analyzed using a noblesse noble gas mass spectrometer nu instruments uk following the methods of hilton et al 2002 the 4he 20ne results were used to correct for atmospheric he and assumed 20ne 0 32 in air or 0 26 in air saturated groundwater asw porcelli and ballentine 2002 the he isotope results 3he 4he r were expressed as rc ra relative to air ra where ra 1 38 10 6 and atmospheric he was corrected air from gaolan hill south of lanzhou was used to calibrate the instrument these gas samples were measured within one month after the field sampling was completed the concentrations of major cations na k ca2 and mg2 and trace elements were measured using icp aes icap6000 thermo fisher scientific and icp ms 7500c agilent respectively major anions cl so4 2 f were measured using ion chromatography dionex ics600 thermo fisher scientific alkalinity was measured using a digital titrator with phenolphthalein and methyl orange as indicators 3 3 data collection and calculation to determine the relationship between these geochemical anomalies and large earthquakes near the study area we downloaded all seismic data from the china earthquake administration website https news ceic ac cn during the monitoring period within a radius of 200 km from the study area in the near field area longitude 99 3 100 71 latitude 21 52 23 61 there were 110 earthquakes of which 30 were greater than magnitude 4 and only 20 occurred during the monitoring period during the upward migration of he from the mantle it is diluted by 4he generated in the crust thus forming a concentration gradient of 3he 4he this vertical gradient is controlled by the upwelling velocity of the mantle fluid and radioactive origin within the fault zone for the study area located in the southern segment of the lrfz the crust thickness hc should be taken as 21 km mantle helium hef m 2 5 10 9 cm3 stp g 1 h2o zhang et al 2022b and the mantle fluid velocity can be calculated using the following formula kennedy et al 1997 1 q h c ρ s p 4 h e ρ f h e f m r s r c r m r s where ps 2 7 g cm3 pf 1 0 g cm3 and rs rc and rm represent the he ratio of the sample crust 0 02 ra and mantle 8 ra respectively p 4he represents the production rate of radioactive he in the crust u 3 ppm th 10 5 ppm the he flux in this area can be estimated using the upwelling he velocity and the total 3he flux can be calculated using the following formula kulongoski et al 2013 2 q 3 h e q ρ f 4 h e f s u r f a c e r sample where pf 1 0 g cm3 is the density of the hot spring and 4he f surface is the concentration of 4he in the hot spring which can be calculated based on hef m 4 results 4 1 gas components nitrogen was the non reactive gas with the highest concentration among all the samples in the study area and only a few samples had relatively high co2 and low nitrogen concentrations according to the main gas components co2 and n2 table 1 hot springs can be divided into two types as is commonly determined using hot spring gas from the tibetan plateau zhou et al 2017 wang et al 2020 in the first category there were three hot springs with co2 as the main component the average co2 concentration was approximately 59 9 vol volume concentration ranging from 50 25 to 68 95 vol in the second category there were 16 hot springs in which n2 was the main component the concentration of n2 in the hot spring gas ranged from 63 17 to 97 69 vol with an average value of 86 3 vol the concentration of he in hot spring gases was approximately 27 2881 ppm the concentration range of h2 was 0 8 2676 ppm and that of ch4 was 0 12 15 76 vol according to the temporal records of several hot springs table 1 the variations in mg and fl were relatively small whereas the changes in mb and mm were visible among which the change in co2 was the most significant fig 3 4 2 helium isotopes after atmospheric correction the data were used for subsequent analyses and calculations the 3he 4he values of the samples ranged from 0 014 to 0 27 ra with 10 samples greater than 0 1 ra and others 0 1 ra the 4he 20ne ratio was 1 5 520 which is much higher than the atmospheric ratio 4he 20ne 0 318 ozima and podosek 2002 in the majority of samples n 37 the ratio of 4he 20ne was several to a hundred times higher than the atmospheric ratio and the rc ra values air corrected 3he 4he values of all samples were greater than zero 4 3 carbon isotope results the δ13c co2 values of the western yunnan gas samples varied from 25 3 to 8 3 and the δ13c ch4 values ranged from 72 to 11 55 vs vpdb table 1 the δ13c co2 and δ13c ch4 values in n2 bearing hot springs varied from 25 3 to 8 5 vs pdb and from 72 to 11 55 vs pdb respectively alternately the results for co2 bearing hot springs were quite uniform with δ13c co2 values ranging from 11 6 to 8 3 vs pdb and approximately 42 for δ13c ch4 4 4 co2 3he ratios the co2 3he values of the western yunnan hot spring gas samples varied over a wide range of 1 16 107 to 1 29 1011 with a variability of five orders of magnitude most samples were greater than mid ocean ridge basalts morb mantle 2 0 109 hilton et al 2002 as well as the global average arc values 1 2 1010 sano and marty 1995 and continental fluids 1011 o nions and oxburgh 1988 the wide variability is related to the decoupling of he co2 systematics with most samples characterized by metamorphic co2 and crustal he which will be discussed later 4 5 water geochemistry the ion concentrations in the hot springs are listed in table 2 the hydrochemistry of the hot springs was mainly hco3 na the tds value ranged from 449 mg l to 1066 mg l and the ph of the four hot springs was slightly alkaline the highest tds value mm of the hot springs is marked by a high ph and co2 3he higher tds and ph values might be related to excess co2 relative to 3he in the hot spring gas as well as the release of crustal co2 the saturation index si of the hot spring water was calculated using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 which can determine the equilibrium state of an aqueous solution of calcite the si values ranged from 3 95 to 1 69 only negative values for the mm hot spring indicating that the calcite is unsaturated and could be dissolved however it should be noted that calcite dissolution is inversely related to temperature hot springs mm with low ca indicate that geothermal water exists at a certain depth for a long time and then ascending migration cooling creates an unsaturated solution in calcite not receiving a ca supply 5 discussion 5 1 variation characteristics of gas composition the gas compositions in western yunnan varied spatially and were relatively dispersed hot spring mm changes in co2 concentration might be due to the difference in the solubility of co2 and n2 in different seasons with a very low gas water ratio 0 0001 with spring flow rate 30 l s tong et al 2000 while analogous to the u mostku hot spring bräuer et al 2014 ar is considered the main atmospheric source of volcanic and geothermal gas components giggenbach 1996 therefore the n2 ar ratio should not be less than that of air 83 or asw 45 fischer et al 1998 samples with ratios lower than 45 were considered to have been subjected to relatively severe air contamination the relationship between n2 he and ar can be used to quantify the contributions of the different sources as shown in fig 3a giggenbach 1996 gases from the mantle have low n2 concentrations and n2 he 200 generally acceptable he ar and n2 ar ratios in the upper mantle are of the order of 1 burnard et al 1997 and 80 marty and zimmermann 1999 respectively the gases associated with volcanic arcs have higher n2 concentrations and n2 he greater than 1000 mainly because of the addition of deposited nitrogen during subduction fischer et al 1998 hilton et al 2002 the n2 ar ratio of the sample ranged from 25 to 182 6 as shown in fig 3 the samples in this study mainly came from regions subjected to different degrees of mixture between mantle derived and air or air saturated groundwater which is consistent with the mixture characteristics observed by zhang et al 2021c in the red river fault zone northeast of the study area moreover the absence of a correlation between the relative gas abundance and he isotope ratios indicates that it was not a simple mixture of mantle derived fluids and air or asw source gas fig 3b hiett et al 2021 the higher n2 than co2 content in many hot spring gas samples could be attributed to calcite precipitation with selective dissolution of co2 and n2 with different solubilities fig 3c zhang et al 2022b considering the change in the δ13c co2 value and co2 he relationship calcite precipitation during co2 degassing may be the dominant reason for the higher n2 content 5 2 he and co2 characteristics 5 2 1 he characteristics and inventory natural fluids from areas with tectonic activity are generally interpreted as originating from three different sources the mantle crust and air kipfer et al 2002 the source of he in geothermal gas is acknowledged to originate from degasification of the mantle and α decay of radioactive elements u and th in the crust dissolved water is transported underground because of the replenishment of atmospheric sources ballentine and burnard 2002 in continental environments due to intense radiogenic 4he formation in the crust ballentine and burnard 2002 the 3he 4he ratio is generally 0 02 0 05 ra with measurable but relatively small mantle he 3he 4he 20ne ratios are 1000 for the crust and mantle and 0 318 for air graham 2002 most samples in the study area had air corrected ratios rc ra less than that of typical crustal values only eight of the hot springs had rc ra 0 05 suggesting that the dominant crustal he had a slight presence of mantle derived he according to fig 4 our samples fell between crustal values 0 1 ra and mantle derived values 8 1 ra for morb and 6 1 2 1 ra for the sub continental lithospheric mantle sclm graham 2002 day et al 2015 based on the spatial distribution of the sample sites these hot springs mb mb7 mka ml etc fig 1b with detectable mantle derived he are close to the nw strike faults indicating that these faults have profound volatile flux a three component mixed model was used to estimate the various he contributions for each sample sano and wakita 1985 and the results are presented in table s1 supplementary materials the contribution of mantle he to several hot spring gases mb ml my yr and mka was larger ranging from 1 1 to 2 2 while that of other mantle derived he was lower 1 most of the n2 bearing hot springs except for mb ml my and yr had lower mantle derived he content 1 whereas those of co2 bearing hot springs were greater than 1 according to fig 4 the mantle derived he was 5 in both n2 and co2 bearing hot spring gases based on the long term records of several hot spring gases mb fl mg and mm the contribution of he did not change significantly before and after the earthquake however only the ratio of co2 3he of hot spring mm changed significantly fig 5 indicating that the degassing of magma was not the main cause of gas change and the effect of secondary processes and change in permeability might be possible causes of gas concentration change furthermore the atmospheric he sources of mm fl and mg increased significantly before and after the earthquake which also indicates that the earthquake may have led to changes in the permeability of underground rock strata and thus promoted the flow of groundwater 5 2 2 co2 characteristics and inventory the co2 content in the mantle volatiles was 104 times that of he he and co2 are released from the deep crust however they are not strictly coupled at every stage of fluid migration dunai and porcelli 2002 gilfillan et al 2008 given that some he originated from the mantle previous section it can be expected that co2 has a similar source however the resolution of the sources and proportions of endogenous co2 crust carbonated sclm and asthenosphere components is complicated by fluid mixing under and within aquifers and uncertainties in the endmember characteristics sano and marty 1995 the relationship between δ13c co2 and co2 he in gases can be used to identify the sources of co2 sano and marty 1995 barry et al 2020 δ13c co2 values for all samples between marine carbonates 0 2 and metamorphic sediments 30 10 tardani et al 2016 indicate the mixing of the two we inferred that most of the deep co2 gas is of crustal origin marine carbonate rocks and or metamorphic sediments however the lithospheric mantle often creates heterogeneous records caused by metasomatic events within continental environments with a co2 3he ratio of 7 109 which can lead to c enrichment relative to morb 1 5 2 109 marty et al 2020 asian sclm isotopes are also thought to be heavier than morb isotopes zhang et al 2021c δ13c co2 of morb from 8 to 4 bräuer et al 2016 therefore it can be assumed that co2 3he of the sclm endmembers is 2 7 109 and δ13c co2 is 4 these hot spring samples showed some characteristics of co2 enrichment and their co2 3he values displayed a high of 1012 and a low of 106 which differed from those of the mantle endmembers the high co2 3he ratios 1012 1014 that usually explain most co2 rich crustal terrestrial gases are produced by decarbonization reactions that produce co2 rich 3he free gases fig 6 sano and marty 1995 evans et al 2008 therefore it can be speculated that co2 dominated gases are mixtures of co2 rich crustal gases of which 5 20 are mantle derived c the hypothetical mixing curve between the co2 rich samples along the sclm endmembers and a group of endmembers with the same radiogenic rc ra values with different co2 3he ratios decreased based on the classification of deep source co2 emissions i e magma transition and background levels a ternary hybrid model based on he co2 systematics proposed by sano and marty 1995 was used to calculate the proportions of the mantle carbonate rock car and metamorphic sediment org in the total c inventory the calculation formula is as follows 3 13 c 12 c obs f m 13 c 12 c m f l 13 c 12 c l f s 13 c 12 c s 4 1 12 c 3 h e obs f m 12 c 3 h e m f l 12 c 3 h e l f s 12 c 3 h e s 5 f m f l f s 1 where the subscripts obs m l and s represent the observed values of the sample mantle car and org terminal members respectively the reference values for the mantle car and org terminal members were consistent with those previously defined in sano and marty 1995 which are δ13c 6 5 2 5 and co2 3he 2 109 for morb type mantle δ13c 0 2 and co2 3he 1013 for car and δ13c 30 10 and co2 3he 1013 for org terminal members fig 7 in this selected model the morb type c source was taken as an endmember of the calculation model considering that data from fluid inclusions near the study area reveal the possible existence of mantle derived he sources however for the background he source the sclm type magma is considered to be a mantle c endmember of the model δ13c 3 5 co2 3he 7 109 bräuer et al 2016 this is because background samples are likely related to the degasification of sclm source fluid during active faults such as those observed in non volcanic areas without an asthenospheric source magma the source of co2 in the study area varied significantly from 1 5 to 55 1 table s1 especially in the n2 bearing hot spring gases only fl and yr contained mantle dominated co2 while the co2 bearing and most of the n2 bearing hot spring gases were crustal dominated indicating the crustal origin of volatiles and or the inapposite calculation scenario with high n2 samples according to the long term records of several hot spring gases mb fl mg and mm although the four hot springs showed some fluctuations in the co2 3he ratio in different years they were all within the range of crustal c the results showed that the mantle c content of the magmatic level samples ranged from 2 to 10 the crustal c content car and org endmember combinations ranged from 90 to 98 and sclm contributed 74 to the c inventory regardless of the source of mantle c morb vs sclm table s1 the contribution of carbonate rocks to total c was generally greater than that of organic sediments with an l s ratio greater than 1 16 samples in 28 it is worth noting that the results of the c three end model were inconsistent with the constraints of the he three end model for example the contribution of mantle he to the magma source sample was approximately 1 whereas that of mantle c to the same sample was 18 these results indicate that the gas sample may have undergone a secondary process of the he co2 system in the hydrothermal system leading to the decoupling of the co2 and he endmembers 5 3 he co2 system characteristics and control mechanism 5 3 1 degassing effect both the ratio co2 3he and δ13c of co2 can be altered by hydrothermal degassing to elucidate the degassing of yunnan hot spring gases the trends of co2 3he at high and low values were considered the plot of log co2 3he vs he concentration fig 8 a of the hot spring gas samples shows a broadly negative correlation r2 0 602 between the co2 3he ratio and he concentration he enters the gas phase more easily than co2 because of its lower solubility in aqueous solution in the process of phase separation of the geothermal fluid the co2 3he ratio increased and the he concentration decreased simultaneously however this synergistic change was observed in the strong correlation between the two there was no direct relationship between the gas and water separation in the yunnan gas samples however calcite precipitation was likely to change the co2 3he values the presence of travertine near the hot springs in the study area suggests that this may be the case the correlation plot of co2 3he vs co2 fig 8b has an appreciable positive correlation suggesting that co2 degassing followed by calcite precipitation may be the mechanism underlying the variation in gas co2 3he values however whether this is the sole mechanism will be analyzed in detail later according to previous studies zhang et al 2021b magma degassing had a significant influence on co2 3he and δ13c in the tengchong volcanic area which is not far from the study area as the transition level of volatile emissions from magma and deep crust was observed assuming a morb type mantle starting point co2 3he 2 109 δ13c 6 the minimum possible co2 3he ratio of the batch distillation closed degassing residual melt was 8 5 108 starting value divided by 2 35 which is the fractionation factor between he and co2 hilton et al 1998 in this case when the δ13c fractionation factor was 4 the δ13c value was 10 javoy et al 1978 in addition if the rayleigh fractionation mode open degassing is suitable 99 of co2 is lost to the gas phase with a co2 3he ratio of 1 4 108 and a δ13c value of 24 4 this was calculated using the following equation 6 c o 2 3 h e res c o 2 3 h e ini f α 1 α α 2 35 7 δ 13 c res δ 13 c ini 1000 α 1 ln f α 1 004 where f is the fraction of residual co2 in the magma and α is the fractionation factor of the corresponding equation the results showed that neither batch nor rayleigh fractionation from the morb mantle source could control the change in the co2 3he ratio and the low δ13c value of the samples in the study area similarly several samples from the simao block had low co2 3he values but did not seem to be related to magma degassing for gas samples from the vicinity of quaternary volcanic activity volatilization was largely influenced by degasification from magma cheng et al 2019 however it is difficult to consider deep magmatic degassing as the main controlling factor for the characteristics of the he co2 system in the hydrothermal system because of dilution of the volatiles in the crust the intra crustal hydrothermal and tectonic processes that the volatile system undergoes are likely to be the dominant factors 5 3 2 earthquake effects a long term record of gases is useful for discussing the relationship between fluid and earthquake interactions in terms of earthquake magnitude fig 5 strong earthquakes were mainly concentrated before 2017 and subsequent earthquakes did not exceed a magnitude of 6 this was mainly due to the 2012 myanmar magnitude 7 4 earthquake near the study area which gradually restored the area to a relatively calm state as a tracer of seismic activity the he ratio rc ra is sensitive to the seismic activity of a fault zone aydın et al 2015 the time series correlation between near field earthquakes epicenter distance 200 km of four hot springs and volatiles such as the he ratio rc ra and co2 3he fig 9 shows that there is no systematic correlation between seismic events and geochemical anomalies before 2019 while the earthquakes that occurred in may 2019 ms 4 9 and june 2020 ms 3 8 within 80 km might be responsible for the significant changes in rc ra and co2 3he the earthquake events before 2019 were either small or slightly larger in magnitude and were far from the study area more than 200 km the magnitude of an earthquake is positively correlated to its distance some sensitive volatiles can be detected over a range of more than 1000 km during large earthquakes wang et al 2004 woith et al 2013 however according to our geochemical statistics other processes affect the characteristics of volatiles from the analysis of seismic events and volatile anomalies it is not supported that earthquakes were the main factor causing volatile changes before 2019 in the study area we agree that near field earthquakes have some effect on the hydrothermal gas composition however our low sampling time frequency did not provide strong proof of the effect of the earthquake on volatile changes and it is necessary to improve the sampling frequency of volatiles in future work 5 3 3 fault controls it is important to determine the source of volatiles and identify the transport pathways and processes of volatiles the he isotope characteristics showed that a large proportion of he was of radioactive origin klemperer et al 2022 in general the enrichment of radioactive elements was mostly concentrated in the upper crust 10 km whereas some elements u and th were highly enriched in the study area zhang et al 2022a it is reasonable to assume that neotectonics are the main volatile channels concurrently the topography of the study area is quite variable and meteoric water could migrate to deeper locations within the crust along the faults which may exceed 5 km diamond et al 2018 these geothermal systems provide good channels for the release of radiogenic he gannibal et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b the mantle derived he in the mb spring located at tectonic endpoints was significantly higher than that in the other springs which is clear evidence that the structure is a he release channel especially mantle he the study area is located at the front of the indo european collision convergence and the inserted indian plate provides a structure for deep mantle gas release from seismic data it was established that the crustal thickness in this area is approximately 30 km therefore the lower he isotope ratio 0 05 ra is probably caused by the deep fluid passing through the thicker crust and then being mixed with the radiogenic he in the crust thus displaying lower mantle derived he characteristics 5 aydın et al 2015 mb is in a fault zone a deep fault that may have connected the lower crust and provided conditions for the release of he from the mantle it is worth noting that the permeability structure of the fault zone is quite different and may change on both the temporal and spatial scales in general the fracture around the fault core is more permeable and thus may show higher 3he 4he values than the fault core itself however this is usually only true for short distances a few hundred meters barry et al 2020 relatively low 3he 4he values 0 2 ra were previously shown near the fault core of the san andreas fault whereas higher values of up to 0 9 ra and 2 ra were observed at approximately 100 and 1400 m from the fault core respectively kulongoski et al 2013 these fracture zones in the study area are subject to the tension action of the extruded block forming tensor torsional active fractures in the northeast and northwest directions that control the release of volatile components another tectonic factor that affects gas volatility is the stress field from the analysis of our data results the 3he 4he ratio was more characteristic of mantle volatility than δ13c because noble gases are not as prone to gas rock chemical processes as co2 he gas is transferred from deep to the surface especially in areas without volcanic activity and the permeability of fractures plays a very important role previous studies of large fracture he releases in the basin and range province in the usa found that extensional and high stress areas were intensely volatile releases banerjee et al 2011 this also implies that regional stress field conditions in fracture zones in non volcanic areas can control the release of volatiles by collating the global strain rate model v2 1 near the study area kreemer et al 2014 the average strain rate of the stress system involved in the fracture zone could be calculated and we plotted the regional stress field contours map for the study area fig 10 a the high strain rates were mainly concentrated near the boundary faults such as the red river and sagaing fault zones and were consistent with the strike of the fault zones these results were consistent with the ground deformation characteristics observed in the interior of the plate and the strain accumulation in the plate boundary fault zone and showed the decisive role of tectonic stress in determining the strain rate field thus the spatial relationship between the he flux fig 10b and the regional strain rates indicates that the compressional stress field controls the permeability of the fault zone which further affects the volatile flux 5 3 4 hydrothermal secondary process in hydrothermal systems phase separation changes the co2 3he and δ13c values because of the different solubilities of co2 and he in water ellis and golding 1963 the residual water samples exhibited higher co2 3he and δ13c values the gas phase is generally considered to be enriched with 3he relative to water because light isotopes are preferentially allocated to the gas phase during phase separation however this was not the case suggesting that the fluid may represent a primitive mantle feature that was later mixed with crustal source he one process that reduces co2 3he and δ13c fractionation is calcite precipitation which is deduced from the co2 loss that occurs during the mixing or cooling of geothermal fluids gilfillan et al 2009 ray et al 2009 to evaluate the effect of this mineralization process on the co2 he system we considered the fractionation process of calcite precipitation first the reaction of co2 with mantle sources or mixtures in shallow groundwater systems forms stable dissolved inorganic carbon dic and co2 reservoirs the temperature controlled co2 hco3 caco3 fractionation factor α mainly acts between 25 and 150 c the initial input of δ13c co2 was assumed to be identical in alkaline water mantle source or mixture source co2 interacts with the hydrothermal system to form dic including dissolved co2 and free co2 which are in isotopic equilibrium co2 gas in equilibrium with dic is based on rayleigh fractionation the iterative fitting data for the open system fractionation rayleigh fractionation curves holloway and blank 1994 were calculated as follows 8 δ 13 c o 2 f δ 13 c o 2 i 1000 f α c o 2 c a l c i t e 1 1000 where i and ƒ are the initial and residual δ13c of the total dissolved co2 total dissolved inorganic carbon in the spring water f is the residual fraction of co2 and αco2 calcite is the fractionation factor of co2 and calcite at a given temperature the fractionation factors of co2 and calcite can be calculated as follows hedenquist and lowenstern 1994 9 1000 ln α c o 2 c a l c i t e 8 91 10 8 t 3 8 557 10 6 t 2 1 881 10 4 t 1 8 27 where t is the temperature in kelvin in this model assuming a starting value of 2 109 co2 consumption was calculated relative to 3he the model assumed a δ13c co2 starting value of 4 the residual δ13c co2 and co2 3he in the system decreased with calcite formation as the original co2 content decreased the model predicted that more than 99 of the original c could be lost from the samples with the highest fractionation fig 7 resulting in extremely low co2 3he and δ13c co2 values the gas dissolves in the deep fluid and then interacts with the country rock during cooling and or mixing with native fluids deep in the hydrothermal system enriching the fluid with na ca2 mg2 and hco3 co3 2 ions mcling and johnson 2002 co2 rich fluids and gases react with these ions to precipitate carbonate minerals and co2 is retained as calcite resulting in a lower co2 3he ratio in the gas and a higher negative δ13c value in addition hydrogeochemical simulation of the four hot springs using phreeqc showed that the chemical components were essentially supersaturated for calcite at the sampling temperature indicating the potential to form calcite precipitation table 2 moreover the presence of travertine around the hot springs in the study area also provides support however this process is highly temperature dependent the depth range of the calcite precipitation can be calculated using c isotope fractionation based on a constant geothermal gradient to identify the contribution of c from different sources δ13c co2 and co2 3he diagrams of the gas sample were drawn fig 7 dashed lines represent the expected fractionation trends of the calcite precipitation model at various temperatures 25 50 100 150 192 and 250 c barry et al 2020 most n2 bearing samples were distributed in the regions predicted by the calcite precipitation model indicating that calcite precipitation occurred during the migration of hot springs the fractionation trend associated with calcite precipitation at 25 192 c can be predicted by assuming the mantle starting point of the fluid it is important to note that 25 50 c is the approximate average surface temperature for the fluid and gas performance as shown in fig 7 the current calcite precipitation trend is concentrated in the range of 50 150 c assuming that the geothermal gradient in this area is 3 c 100 m yuan et al 2006 these precipitation processes occurred at a shallow location of 5 km within the crust 5 4 evolution and flux of volatiles 5 4 1 evolution process of he co2 systematics this analysis can be used to construct an evolution model for the volatiles of he c systematics at the plate convergence boundary fig 11 owing to the indo eurasian collision the insertion of the indian plate caused mantle convection mantle wedge in the study area resulting in small amounts of volatiles from the mantle he 3 co2 15 along some deep and large faults rising into the mid upper crust where it was mixed with radiogenic he within the shallower crust and co2 from the pyrolysis of carbonatite decarbonization and metamorphic sediments mixed volatiles continued to rise into the hydrothermal system to a depth of more than 5 km there was decoupling in the evolution of the he co2 system as a noble gas he barely reacts with the surrounding rock and its migration continues along fractures and fissures to be drained into the atmosphere by the hot springs dong et al 2017 co2 gas dissolved in the water formed dic and as the temperature and pressure continued to decrease during the rise of hot water decarbonization occurred leading to the precipitation of up to 90 of c δ13c co2 converted into calcite fixed in some faults along the way while only a portion of the deep source c was released into the atmosphere such precipitation changes the permeability and volatile flux of the fracture system and may subsequently alter the mechanical properties of country rock 5 4 2 volatile flux and its implications based on the 3he 4he ratio value corrected by our sample the flow rate of mantle volatiles in the study area was calculated as 0 1 5 7 mm y table s2 in supplementary materials which is consistent with the result obtained by zhang et al 2022b near the research area fig 10 this is much lower than that of the alpine fault zone at 420 2600 mm y menzies et al 2016 lower than that of the san andreas fault 4 140 mm y kulongoski et al 2013 and the north anatolian fault 130 190 mm y 1 de leeuw et al 2010 and slightly lower than that of the karakoram fault 12 19 mm y 1 klemperer et al 2013 the most likely reason is that there is no quaternary volcanic activity in the vicinity of the study area and there are fewer mantle volatiles in addition considering that the lrfz is 500 km long and 20 km wide the total 3he flux in the study area is 2 30 105 cm3 stp a 1 9 132 mol a 1 the he flux results over several years are relatively consistent indicating no significant tectonic activity in comparison with other fault zones this result was slightly greater than the he fluxes in the san andreas fault with 5 8 mol 3he a 1 kulongoski et al 2013 and comparable with that in arc volcanos about 70 mol 3he a 1 allard 1992 considering that mantle co2 3he is 2 109 mantle co2 flux can be calculated and the calculation results were 2 120 109 mol a 1 as listed in table s2 considering the reduction in co2 flux caused by calcite precipitation 90 the total co2 flux in the crust and mantle of the lrfz could reach 2 120 1010 mol a 1 by comparison the total non volcanic flux in central italy was 1011 mol co2 a 1 rogie et al 2000 that in the colorado plateau was about 1 4 109 mol co2 a 1 crossey et al 2009 and the total flux estimated for the volcanic arc was 1 6 1012 mol co2 a 1 jaffe et al 2004 the deep source decarbonization of active faults in the plate boundaries was of the same order of magnitude as that in volcanic areas the permeability length scale and geometric parameters of faults are external mechanisms that affect deep source decarbonization the study area was located in the southern segment of the lancang river fault geophysical observations in this area showed that there was no shallow magmatic activity yu et al 2020 indicating that these deep source volatiles were mainly from the mantle and that the converging plate boundary controlled by these deep faults was a potential area for decarbonization during subduction collision volatile fluids are released from the crust of the upper mantle and descending plates and then migrate through the overlying crust deep faults and volcanic activity however c emissions may be masked by deep mantle c sources the decarbonization of subducted plates and hydrothermal secondary processes in some forearc hydrothermal systems up to 90 of c is deposited as calcite slowing the cycle of mantle volatiles barry et al 2019 in this case the directly observed degassing at the surface does not necessarily represent the actual amount of carbon emission at the convergence boundary calcite precipitation was controlled by the cooling and or mixing of hydrothermal processes on the other hand the co2 emission results in this study were also affected by calcite precipitation however considering that the error in the calculation process of co2 release and the existence of some parameters are appropriately maximized we believe that the co2 release calculation in this research is a relatively appropriate result 5 5 implications for regional seismic activity fluid activity can induce earthquakes we evaluated the seismic hazards in the study area based on the chemical and isotopic characteristics of the hot spring gases based on the thermal structural characteristics of the lithosphere the temperature of the lower crust in this area may be 700 900 c li et al 2021 which is lower than the melting temperature 1200 c of dry rock but higher than that of wet granite at 650 c lebedev and khitarov 1964 therefore the thermal state of the crust indicates the existence of partial melt in this region according to the results of high precision magnetotellurics the study area is located on the west side of the lrfz where partial melt occurs at a depth of 30 km and the shallowest melt reaches a depth of 10 km on the east side of the fault li et al 2022a this is also the reason for the difference in the volatile flux between this study and the red river fault zone zhang et al 2021b geothermal energy and earthquakes are different forms of energy released from the earth the geothermal field can affect the mechanical properties of rocks and the non uniform thermal structure can increase the thermal stress which promotes the accumulation of stress and induces rock fractures in the middle and upper crust the southeast of the qinghai tibet plateau is characterized by large scale clockwise rotation wang et al 2014 the xianshuihe xiaojiang and nujiang lancang river fault zones are the main boundary faults these two boundary belts are overlaid by two belts of highly conductive material in the lower crust and upper mantle bai et al 2010 indicating that the high strain belt observed at the surface extends to the upper mantle the decoupling between the lower crust and the middle and upper crust in this region may be caused by the existence of thermal material flow in the lower crust in this region bai et al 2010 based on observations from the global navigation satellite system gnss it was found that sinistral shear continued to extend through the red river fault zone to the broader western yunnan with a movement rate of 5 mm yr the deformation belt crosses the menglian and mengxing faults and extends approximately 200 km southwest wang and shen 2020 owing to the simultaneous rotation and translation motion the ne trending faults on the southwest side of the red river fault zone such as the longling and wanding faults have a stretching movement of 5 mm yr wang and shen 2020 the nne extrusion dominates southwest yunnan with a strain rate of 10 nanostrain yr wang et al 2021 the wanding east longling ruili east nantinghe lancang river and xiaojiang faults extend across the red river fault to the menglian and mengxing fault regions with high shear strain rates of up to 50 nanostrains yr wang et al 2021 the strain rate in the study area is approximately 10 nanostrains yr but the strain rate varies greatly in space fig 4 in wang and shen 2020 indicating that the heterogeneity of crustal strength is relatively obvious and it is a dangerous area for large earthquakes m greater than 7 there have been many cases in which fluid processes induced earthquakes in fault zones miller et al 2004 di luccio et al 2018 liu et al 2022 the seismogenic effects of deep source flows into fault zones may reduce the mechanical strength of rocks and friction within the fault zone thus becoming triggering factors for earthquakes fluids with high co2 concentrations have also been shown to induce large earthquakes such as those in central italy and the himalayas chiodini et al 2020 du et al 2021 a significant proportion of co2 in the study area was derived from metamorphic decarbonization of the middle and upper crust these deep fluids are prone to be trapped and overpressurized at depths of 5 10 km in the crust miller et al 2004 smeraglia et al 2016 which is consistent with the mechanical properties of the fault and the physicochemical conditions under co2 degassing lead to precipitation the seismic depth in the study area is concentrated at 5 15 km with a bimodal pattern fig 12 which is below the geothermal fluid circulation depth of the fault zone 4 8 km table 1 giggenbach et al 1991 guo et al 2017 but also above the low velocity high conductor layer within the area depth of the top boundary 30 km li et al 2022a based on the teleseismic effect triggered by large earthquakes many large faults in the study area are in the critical stress state of seismogenesis lei et al 2011 therefore the explosion release of the energy generated by fluid overpressure is sufficient to cause earthquakes of a certain magnitude wang et al 2020 the study area is located at the collision front of the indo eurasian continent with concentrated tectonic stress and frequent seismic disasters based on an analysis of the characteristics and fluxes of hot spring gas in western yunnan the results show that the deep source co2 fluxes in this region have a certain magnitude this study supports the mechanism of the overpressure formation of deep fluid upwelling and the secondary chemical process that triggers an earthquake in addition the stress field caused by the nonuniform thermal structure and crustal deformation characteristics near the lrfz may provide conditions for large earthquakes therefore based on the characteristics of volatiles in the lrfz it can be inferred that a rigid crust with concentrated stress is the physical basis for the occurrence of large earthquakes and that the overpressure fluid sealed by precipitated minerals is a critical process for inducing large earthquakes on the other hand observation and combined analysis of geofluid chemistry and isotope data water and gas geochemistry as well as crustal deformation and movement processes in the future will be more helpful for earthquake precursor warnings 6 conclusion in this study the he co2 systematics of 19 hot spring gases in the lrfz were studied he in hot spring gas is mainly radiogenic in the crust mixed with very little mantle degassed he and migrates upward along the deep faults the largest proportion of mantle derived he was 5 from the he isotope relationship it can be inferred that mantle he originates from a low velocity region of approximately 30 km which is the crust mantle boundary the relationship of the δ13c co2 value indicated that the c source from the mantle was moderate 15 whereas the main c sources were the pyrolysis of marine carbonate rocks and decarbonization of metamorphic sediments in the crust the changing δ13c co2 and co2 3he values indicate that these different c source calcite precipitates occurred in the upper crust approximately 5 km leading to the decoupling of the volatile he co2 systematics the chemical processes of the hydrothermal system and tectonic stress field of the regional fault zone control the permeability of the fault conduits in the study area which further restricts the occurrence of low volatile flux overpressure due to mineral precipitation and stress fields in the rigid crust may lead to high seismic risk in this area these results provide a window for characterizing fluid evolution and new

2276,crevasse splays generate subtle local relief and contribute to fluvial basin sedimentary filling but controls on splay development along dryland rivers remain poorly understood owing to limited field laboratory and numerical modelling studies based on previously acquired field data and new remote sensing observations of splay morphology and sedimentology e g slope width length grain size and flooding characteristics e g discharge water depth and extent near the terminus of the non vegetated ephemeral río colorado on the southeastern margin of salar de uyuni bolivia we undertake process based modelling using delft3d to isolate the role of hydrological controls on crevasse splay morphodynamics holding the potential sediment supply constant we focus on the role of discharge outflow from trunk channel to crevasse channel during rising stage floodplain water levels and backflow reflux to the trunk channel during falling stage using nine different model runs each with 10 simulated flood cycles we show that the processes associated with these hydrological controls result in various outcomes from short crevasse splay channels that may bifurcate and develop depositional bars to longer splays with one primary channel that mainly transfers sediment across the floodplain results reveal that increases in flood discharge lead to more rapid splay sedimentation and stabilization of a single crevasse channel increases in floodplain water level lead to shorter but wider splays and facilitate the formation of multiple stable crevasse channels high floodplain water levels probably restrict splay length owing to deceleration of outflow as floodplain water is encountered but separate crevasse channels may form downstream as backflow breaches the trunk channel levee during falling stage these findings support and extend previous observations from the río colorado and other dryland rivers worldwide future modelling studies that consider a wider range of hydrological sedimentological and floodplain topographic conditions will help develop more comprehensive numerical models of splay development a combination of insights from field laboratory experimentation remote

splay discharge dryland river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction along river systems floods that start to exceed bankfull spread beyond the confines of the channel leading to overbank flow and the initiation of various channel floodplain interactions rapidly changing flood hydraulic conditions are associated with shifting erosional and depositional patterns thereby influencing local topographic relief and down valley and cross valley water and sediment transfer e g mertes et al 1996 walling and he 1998 pizzuto et al 2008 lewin et al 2017 along some rivers overbank flow can trigger levee breaching and initiate crevasse channel formation on proximal floodplain areas miall 1996 bridge 2003 once formed crevasse channels can increase flow and sediment diversion from the trunk channel sometimes termed the main or parent channel commonly leading to splay erosion and deposition on more medial and distal floodplain areas over time continued development and local coalescence of splays can help build alluvial ridges and may also prime river reaches for avulsion smith and perez arlucea 1994 bristow et al 1999 tooth 2005 buehler et al 2011 li et al 2014 ultimately leading to more widespread lateral redistribution of water and sediment over longer timescales therefore splays and avulsions can be a key influence on the filling and sedimentary architecture of fluvial basins miall 1996 bridge 2003 slingerland and smith 2004 using field laboratory and conceptual and numerical modelling approaches crevasse splays and their association with channel floodplain processes such as avulsion have been widely studied particularly along present day humid region perennial river systems e g slingerland and smith 1998 stouthamer 2001 aslan et al 2005 hajek and wolinsky 2012 kleinhans et al 2013 hajek and edmonds 2014 shen et al 2015 millard et al 2017 nienhuis et al 2018 rahman et al 2022 this body of research has enabled many key controls on splay development to be identified including those relating to discharge water surface and land surface gradients floodplain vegetation and drainage conditions and sediment supply cohesion and consolidation over the last few decades improved understanding of the interactions among these controls has provided the basis for the use of splays as a deliberate management tool for instance creating artificial diversions that mimic splays and thereby help to control basinward water and sediment fluxes e g florsheim and mount 2002 yuill et al 2016 nienhuis et al 2018 by contrast with the research on humid region river systems far less is known about crevasse splays along present day dryland river systems some of the aforementioned studies have generated insights about splay development that may be applicable to dryland systems for instance the broad controls preconditioning factors and formative processes of splay development e g levee breaching crevasse channel formation and flow and sediment diversion may be similar between humid region and dryland rivers tooth 2005 li et al 2014 li and bristow 2015 rahman et al 2022 nonetheless it remains unclear the extent to which different flooding characteristics along many dryland rivers particularly the typically more rapid rise and fall of flood stage and the long periods of little or no flow along ephemeral or intermittent rivers influence the spatial patterns rates and timescales of splay development reid and frostick 2011 tooth and nanson 2011 tooth 2013 rare descriptions of dryland river

for unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs and pre silurian rock records li et al 2014 2015 2020b ielpi 2018 ielpi and lapôtre 2019a van toorenenburg et al 2016 2018 donselaar et al 2022 a prime example of a non vegetated fine grained ephemeral river with abundant splays is the lower río colorado bolivia fig 1 the lower part of the river system is an example of a distributive fluvial system dfs sensu weissmann et al 2010 and consists of the active trunk channel numerous partially active and abandoned channels and a topographically complex floodplain li et al 2019 channel planforms range from straight to sinuous partly depending on the time elapsed since initial formation with channels tending to become more sinuous over time li et al 2019 donselaar et al 2022 the trunk channel terminates on the southeastern margin of salar de uyuni the world s largest salt lake fig 1a c the absence of vegetation along the channels and on the floodplain is due to the characteristically dry and saline environment fig 1c f previous studies have provided valuable insights into the processes patterns and rates of splay development donselaar et al 2013 2022 li and bristow 2015 van toorenenburg et al 2018 but many uncertainties remain especially regarding the relative importance of hydrological variations such as discharge rates of stage rise and fall and overbank flooding depth and extent the river is ungauged and during floods the study area is largely inaccessible so direct flow and sediment transport measurements cannot be made nonetheless hydraulic reconstructions using a combination of field measurements remote sensing image analysis and numerical modelling can still generate key data on channel and overbank flood characteristics e g li et al 2018 2020c further valuable insights into the controls on splay morphodynamics along the lower río colorado can be provided by a process based modelling approach in this paper we outline the study area and summarise previous work on the splays of the lower río colorado in order to isolate the key hydrological controls thereafter our aims are to 1 use delft3d to investigate the relative importance of these hydrological controls specifically discharge floodplain drainage conditions and backflow in the initiation and development of crevasse splays along the río colorado 2 compare the controls patterns processes and rates of splay development along the río colorado with splay formation along other dryland rivers 3 evaluate the modelling results in relation to those derived from other splay modelling studies and 4 consider how numerical modelling approaches can be developed to provide further insight into crevasse splay and associated channel floodplain morphodynamics along dryland rivers more generally 2 study area and previous work on the splays of the lower río colorado over the last decade a combination of field data high resolution satellite imagery and conceptual and numerical modelling has been used to document the flood hydrology and channel floodplain morphodynamics approaching the terminus of the río colorado and assess the sedimentological implications e g donselaar et al 2013 2022 li et al 2014 2018 2019 2020a b sandén 2016 van toorenenburg et al 2018 similar to the lower reaches of many other ephemeral dryland rivers there is a significant downstream decrease in the cross sectional area of the river from 80 m2 to 5 m2 and its associated sediment transport capacity donselaar et al 2013 2022 these changes lead to widespread overbank flow during floods which typically occur approximately once annually but with flood clusters being closely related to la niña like conditions li 2014 li et al 2020a c 2021 approaching the river terminus bed bank and floodplain sediment is dominantly fine grained d50 60 µm but there are no data on bedload or suspended sediment loads during floods owing to the absence of gauges and lack of real time monitoring and measurement li et al 2015 overbank flow commonly initiates levee breaching along the trunk channel and other partially active channels resulting in a downstream increase in the number of crevasse splays li and bristow 2015 formation of multiple crevasse splays with local relief up to 0 5 m fig 1d f commonly leads to lateral amalgamation and vertical stacking resulting in low accommodation space on the floodplain adjacent to the channels li et al 2014 li and bristow 2015 consequently during waning flood stages significant volumes of overbank floodwater can flow back towards the channels through some of the crevasse splay networks a process termed backflow or reflux e g van toorenenburg et al 2018 due to limited accessibility during peak floods field measurements of flood flow conditions are notoriously difficult and real time observations using remote sensing approaches are commonly limited by satellite visiting periods resolution and or cloud cover e g li et al 2018 nevertheless based on pre and post flood field observations of the lower río colorado van toorenenburg et al 2018 distinguished three different splay types namely i splays subject to unidirectional basinward drainage ii splays facilitating bidirectional drainage and iii splays in a post active abandonment phase from these observations van toorenenburg et al 2018 proposed a generic life cycle for crevasse splays that spans multiple flooding events fig 2 initial splay development is controlled dominantly by outflow from the trunk channel which initiates crevasse channel erosion and associated deposition as the splay channels adjust towards an equilibrium profile graded to a local base level formed by their distal termini at this stage the bed elevation at the crevasse channel apex remains higher than the maximum flood ponding depth on the floodplain and there is no backflow reflux to the trunk channel fig 2 continued incision during subsequent floods along the crevasse channel however lowers the bed elevation at the crevasse apex to below the maximum flood depth on the floodplain coupled with more distal deposition these morphodynamic adjustments facilitate the return flow of water and sediment to the trunk channel during falling stage fig 2 temporarily this lowers or reverses the equilibrium profile with local base level now formed by the lower elevation trunk channel thalweg as a consequence headward erosion the backstepping erosion of van toorenenburg et al 2018 commonly occurs throughout the splay channel network and the increased sediment supply can promote the formation of reflux lobes at the junction with the trunk channel cf fig 1f this lowering or reversal of crevasse channel gradient ultimately leads to lower velocity outflows from the trunk channel during floods which may then lead to backfilling and abandonment of the crevasse splay fig 2 the field observations of van toorenenburg et al 2018 draw particular attention to the key controls on splay development in this setting including i the relative channel and floodplain gradients ii the relative elevations of the trunk channel bed crevasse channel bed and floodplain and iii the relative floodwater depths in the trunk channel and on the floodplain while their conceptual model provides numerous useful insights into splay development the dynamic interplay between these factors under various flooding scenarios remains to be explored more comprehensively using numerical modelling approaches significantly however van toorenenburg et al s 2018 observations highlight the limitations of previously published modelling experiments for investigating the relative role of these controls in splay development in the río colorado setting two contrasting examples illustrate this point slingerland and smith s 1998 physically based conceptual model of the development of an initial crevasse channel highlighted the importance of the amount of suspended sediment delivered to the crevasse channel relative to its transport capacity but did not consider the conditions leading to the initial crevasse formation or the role of bedload variations in outflow or backflow millard et al s 2017 numerical model aimed to isolate how sediment supply and floodplain drainage conditions influence splay growth but their model setup represented a flat floodplain condition that was designed explicitly to promote deposition and limit channelisation and sediment remobilisation that may arise from flow over a sloped floodplain in their model an initial crevasse and associated levees had a non erodible base and morphodynamically developed only through deposition while providing many useful insights therefore the limitations of these and other numerical models restrict direct application of the previously published modelling results to the río colorado setting in short the controls of crevasse splay development along the río colorado and potentially along other similarly low gradient non vegetated dryland rivers e g ielpi 2018 ielpi and lapôtre 2019a b are still not fully understood using delft3d a process based numerical model in this paper we test and extend van toorenenburg et al s 2018 field based observations by addressing the role of hydrological variations in crevasse splay formation specifically this study focuses on the relative importance of discharge outflow from trunk channel to crevasse channel during rising stage and backflow reflux to the trunk channel during falling stage in the early stages of crevasse splay formation the early stages of crevasse splay development have been reported to have a fundamental impact on later splay growth and therefore the subsequent architecture of splay deposits toonen et al 2016 similar to other splay modelling studies where simplifying assumptions have been made e g slingerland and smith 1998 millard et al 2017 nienhuis et al 2018 in order to isolate and evaluate the relative influence of these hydrological controls at this stage we do not address sediment supply variations 3 methods and model setup 3 1 numerical model we used the open source physics based model delft3d version 4 04 01 to conduct numerical experiments linking hydrodynamic sediment transport and morphological changes in the early stages of crevasse splay development delft3d solves the two dimensional depth averaged flow equations and computes sediment transport and bed level change lesser et al 2004 the reliability and accuracy of this model for both scientific research and engineering practice has been demonstrated in a wide spectrum of river estuarine and coastal systems e g mosselman 2004 edmonds and slingerland 2007 2008 schuurman et al 2013 hajek and edmonds 2014 yuill et al 2016 millard et al 2017 nienhuis et al 2018 david et al 2018 compared with other numerical models a particular advantage of delft3d is its simulation of sediment transport and morphodynamics with rigorous theoretical foundation mosselman 2004 edmonds and slingerland 2007 2008 schuurman et al 2013 the hydrodynamics in delft3d are based on conservation of momentum and mass assuming hydrostatic pressure the equations of fluid motion sediment transport and deposition are discretized on a 3d curvilinear finite difference grid and an alternating direction implicit scheme is used to solve the differential equations for detailed descriptions of the hydrodynamics and numerical scheme of delft3d see lesser et al 2004 3 2 model setup and input this study focuses on channel floodplain interactions during overbank flooding particularly during and after peak discharge accordingly we created a schematized model to investigate morphodynamics of a trunk channel and an adjacent right hand floodplain based on width and depth measurements of the río colorado approaching the river terminus donselaar et al 2013 the trunk channel was set at 300 m long 32 m wide and 2 m deep fig 3 measurements of 216 crevasse splays approaching the río colorado river terminus li and bristow 2015 reveal that the median values of splay length and width are 298 m and 112 m respectively based on these dimensions the levee and floodplain in the model domain was set at 300 m long 368 m wide fig 3 a 40 m wide levee initially without crevasse channels was set uniformly along the edge of the trunk channel with a cross valley slope of 0 5 while the rest of the domain was floodplain with a cross valley slope of 0 09 fig 3 a high resolution 2 m 2 m grid cell for observation of channel floodplain morphodynamics was set uniformly across the model domain differential gps field measurements reveal that cross valley gradient prominently exceeds downvalley basinward gradient i e along and parallel to the trunk channel in this low gradient system li et al 2015a 2019 2020c van toorenenburg et al 2018 owing to the low downvalley gradient table 1 and the short length 300 m of the modelled reach the downvalley elevation fall in the model domain is negligible and the model runs are dependent mainly on the levee floodplain cross valley and water surface gradients the model runs employ a straight channel with an initially flat channel bed to avoid topographic forcing and allow crevasse splays to form entirely as the result of the physical and constitutive relations schuurman et al 2013 on the modelling timescale flooding is driven by variations in river discharge initially water flows down the trunk channel then as stage rises erosion and outflow occurs through newly forming crevasse channels leading to floodplain inundation finally as stage falls reflux returns flow to the main channel accordingly we set two open boundaries for the trunk channel with upstream inflow and downstream outflow as well as open boundaries at either edge of the floodplain domain table 1 fig 3 the trunk channel inflow boundary is characterized by a constant frequency of peak flow and low flow i e a fixed flood return period as such water level at the outflow boundary is set for two conditions a low flow water level 6 m during the low discharge period and a peak flow water level 6 5 m for the peak discharge where the water levels are relative to the top elevation of the maximum initial sediment thickness in the model domain in the model domain fig 3 this peak flow water level equates to a channel water depth of 2 m and an overbank water depth of up to 0 5 m time series of high resolution satellite imagery has revealed that crevasse splays along the río colorado tend to develop in the austral summer when most rainfall and flooding occurs more than three decades of daily precipitation data 1985 2017 reveal that peak flooding occurs approximately once per year on average although there may be clusters of floods as driven by enso cycles li and bristow 2015 li et al 2019 2020a 2021 to fully capture the rise and fall of typical hydrographs in the river system a morphological factor morfac of 10 was set and ten flood cycles each with a simulation time of 52 h were employed the morphological factor reduces computational time by accelerating the morphological response to each hydrodynamic timestep by the value set lesser et al 2004 sediment input in the model was based on the analysis of the grain size distribution of 219 samples collected from the lower reaches of the río colorado samples were collected mainly from point bar deposits and crevasse splay and floodplain sediments and are mostly composed of fine sand silt and clay li et al 2015 based on the field data in the model we set a ratio of 2 3 3 for fine sand silt and clay table 2 the engelund hansen equation engelund and hansen 1967 was used to calculate sediment transport for non cohesive sediment as one of our study aims was to investigate the relative importance of hydrological controls in crevasse splay initiation and development for the upstream boundary a constant potential sediment supply was assigned to all simulations therefore model runs with a larger discharge were supplied with more sediment overall than model runs with smaller discharges morehead et al 2003 we simulated nine different model runs each of which has ten cycles of peak discharge and backflow table 3 fig 4 the model runs were designed to highlight the relative importance of hydrological controls on key erosional and depositional processes specifically discharge and the combined effect of floodplain water level and backflow to help differentiate the impact of overbank flow and backflow three phases were defined for each flood cycle fig 4 phase 1 is from the start of a new flood to the flood peak phase 2 is from the end of peak flow to the start of backflow and phase 3 is before the new flood cycle starts the discharge model runs m1 to m5 have a fixed floodplain water level of 6 5 m but different discharges of 50 60 70 80 and 90 m3 s respectively fig 4a the backflow model runs m6 m7 m2 m8 m9 have a fixed discharge of 60 m3 s but different floodplain water levels of 6 3 6 4 6 5 6 6 and 6 63 m respectively with its common discharge of 60 m3 s and floodplain water level of 6 5 m model run m2 is included in both the discharge and backflow model runs and so provides a reference model for comparison across the full suite of model runs with reference to the non crevassed levee elevation of 6 5 m model runs m6 6 3 m and m7 6 4 m have water levels lower than the levee model run m2 has a water level equal to the levee elevation and model runs m8 6 6 m and m9 6 63 m have water levels higher than the levee fig 4b for each model run a transition from no water to low confined flow of 10 m3 s was set initially to ensure model stability each flood cycle then starts from this low flow discharge fig 4 and subsequently linearly increases to peak discharge bankfull discharge 50 60 m3 s was estimated using bjerklie s 2007 model which has been successfully applied for discharge estimation along the río colorado and other ungauged dryland rivers larkin et al 2017 li et al 2019 2021 as discharge increases overbank flow initiates from upstream to downstream and water level increases on the floodplain as peak discharge is passed and stage in the trunk channel begins to fall backflow from the floodplain to the trunk channel potentially can start the termination of backflow events is followed by evaporation modelled using heat flux equations for details see page 227 in the delft3d flow user manual which removes water on the floodplain prior to the next flood fig 4 based on previous work in this study area li et al 2020c a manning roughness coefficient of 0 03 is used in the model 3 3 post processing channel floodplain morphodynamics sediment thickness and flow velocity and bed shear stress for each flood cycle were analyzed the sedimentary features near open boundaries e g upstream bars near the inflow boundary were not subjected to further analysis to avoid including unrealistic boundary effects three downvalley floodplain profiles were analyzed with the profiles taken parallel to and away from the trunk channel at distances of 200 m 250 m and 300 m key morphological elements including crevasse channels and depositional bars were identified along these profiles and their morphodynamics were recorded on the basis of topographic changes for crevasse channels the lowest topographic points on each profile were extracted i e bed level while for bars the highest topographic points on each profile were extracted i e bar tops high resolution satellite imagery dates 2010

results based on the hydrological sedimentological and geomorphological characteristics of the lower río colorado our delft3d generic simulations systematically varied the flood discharge and floodplain water levels as outlined below our results show that increases in discharge lead to more rapid splay sedimentation and stabilization of a single crevasse channel increases in floodplain water level result in short wider splays and facilitate the development of multiple stable crevasse channels 4 1 reference model run m2 the reference model run illustrates that ten flood cycles are sufficient to fully capture the early stage of crevasse splay development that result from overbank flooding and backflow processes fig 5 the crevasse splay complex ultimately includes two crevasse channels namely a primary splay channel psc and a secondary splay channel ssc and three depositional bars downstream bar middle bar and distal bar fig 5h at the start of the model run 1st flood overbank flooding occurs in the upstream reach of the trunk channel and is associated with pronounced levee breaching fig 5a adjacent to the breached levee two splay channels develop on the floodplain both of which lengthen narrow and deepen by erosion during the first few floods fig 5a d fig 6 the splay channel that is located perpendicular to the trunk channel develops more rapidly and eventually becomes the psc fig 5e f from the 7th flood onwards this channel stabilizes in width fig 5g j fig 6 a ssc develops during the first three flood cycles fig 5a c fig 6 but subsequently shallows and narrows as the middle bar and downstream bar grow in size albeit at a slower rate after the 6th flood fig 5d j fig 6 in later flood cycles a distal bar develops e g fig 5g i and eventually amalgamates with the middle bar fig 5j analysis of the simulated topography shows that the psc experiences erosion albeit with a decrease in depth from the proximal 1 25 m difference to distal 1 03 m difference region fig 6 fig 7 a c m2 red line with circles in the proximal profile 200 m for each flood cycle the psc bed experiences minor deposition around the flood peak but erosion exceeds this deposition during backflow phases leading to an overall erosive trend fig 6a fig 7a m2 red line with circles the elevation change over time in the proximal section 200 m is staggered with relatively pronounced depositional and erosional events during the different phases of the flooding cycle fig 7a while the medial profile 250 m and the distal profile 300 m show a smoother decrease in elevation over time fig 7b c the ssc is characterized by a fluctuating trend from overall deepening erosion to shallowing filling through the 10 flood cycles fig 6 fig 7d f m2 red line with circles during the 1st to the 6th flood cycles the net elevation of the ssc decreases in the proximal profile with pronounced erosion during backflow phases overriding any deposition occurring in the other phases of the flooding cycles fig 6 fig 7d from the 7th flood cycle onwards the elevation of the ssc shows a slight net increase with the erosion in the backflow phase no longer overriding the deposition experienced in the other phases fig 6 fig 7d the medial 250 m and distal 300 m profiles show similar trends with initial minor erosion followed by minor filling fig 6 fig 7e f the middle bar undergoes minor variations in elevation away from the trunk channel the proximal 200 m profile shows that erosion occurs in the backflow phase of the 1st flood cycle but thereafter deposition predominates until the bar elevation stabilises from the 7th flood cycle onwards fig 6 fig 7g red line with circles in the medial 250 m and distal 300 m profiles the middle bar experiences an increase in elevation during the first 4 or 5 flood cycles and thereafter stabilises fig 6 fig 7h i 4 2 discharge model runs m1 to m5 in comparison to m2 the other four discharge model runs have discharges that are either smaller m1 or larger m3 to m5 the results show that differences in peak discharge have a strong influence on the crevasse splay morphodynamics fig 7 fig 8 in simulations with smaller and larger peak discharges only a psc fully develops and there is either no evidence or only weak development of a ssc and middle bar fig 7 fig 8 for the lowest discharge model m1 levee breaching occurs but this only leads to limited development of a psc fig 8 during the backflow stage all water drains back to the trunk channel via the psc elevation analysis shows that in model run m1 the psc in the proximal 200 m profile is deeper than in model run m2 for the first eight floods fig 7a blue line with crosses but in the more medial 250 m and distal 300 m profiles is noticeably shallower fig 7b c for simulations with larger peak discharge m3 to m5 levee breaching tends to occur slightly farther downstream along the trunk channel and a psc becomes increasingly prominent leading to increasing sediment transfer to and across the full width of the floodplain fig 8 in m3 m4 and m5 the bed level of the psc decreases initially but approaches a stable elevation in the later flood cycles especially in the more proximal reaches fig 7a c in simulations with discharges larger m3 m5 than the reference model m2 a ssc develops in the initial flood cycles but then disappears fig 7d f fig 8 owing to the limited development of a ssc in models runs m1 and m3 to m5 a middle bar remains poorly defined in m3 and m4 deposition initially results in a vertically accreting middle bar and then greater stability after the 3rd flood cycle in the proximal and medial parts and greater stability after the 7th flood cycle in the more distal parts fig 7g i the ssc is eliminated when the middle bar accretes laterally to fill the ssc e g fig 8c and 8h 4 3 backflow model runs m2 m6 to m9 in comparison to m2 the four backflow model runs m6 m9 have floodplain water levels that are both lower than the levee m6 and m7 and higher than the levee m8 and m9 the model results show that these differences in floodplain water level have a pronounced influence on backflow processes and associated crevasse splay morphodynamics fig 9 fig 10 in models m6 and m7 the trunk channel levee is breached leading to development of a psc in similar fashion to that occurring during model run m2 especially in the proximal and medial parts where depths are similar fig 9a b fig 10 in m6 and m7 a minor ssc branches from the proximal part of the psc fig 10 but shallows through the flood cycles owing to infilling fig 9d f the areal extent of the psc and to some extent the ssc is large in model runs m6 and m7 in comparison with subsequent backflow model runs m8 and m9 where floodplain water levels are higher fig 10 in m8 two separate crevasse splay channels with similar widths develop one adjacent to the upstream part of the trunk channel the psc and one farther downstream the ssc in m9 the two splay channel widths are more dissimilar and the ssc is shorter fig 10 in both m8 and m9 the psc is shallower and shorter compared with the psc forming in model runs with lower floodplain water levels fig 9a c fig 10 in contrast to these other model runs the ssc in model runs m8 and m9 continues to deepen through the 10 flood cycles as a result of pronounced erosion fig 9d f ssc with erosion particularly pronounced in m9 close to the junction with the trunk channel fig 10 in these backflow models the areal extent and elevation of the middle bar varies fig 9g i fig 10 in large part owing to the different sizes and spacings of the psc and ssc the middle bar either initially increases in elevation through the first few flood cycles before stabilising e g m6 and m7 or tends to increase in elevation through the ten full flood cycles e g m8 and m9 ultimately reaching elevations higher than in other model runs in the proximal medial and distal profiles but with a steeper slope from the trunk channel towards the distal floodplain fig 9g i fig 10 5 interpretation our numerical modelling results provide scope for evaluating and extending previous inferences about splay development along the lower río colorado that have been derived from field and remote sensing data and modelling approaches e g donselaar et al 2013 2022 li and bristow 2015 van toorenenburg et al 2018 in particular our modelling results provide new quantified process based insights into the relative importance of discharge floodplain water levels and backflow for crevasse splay morphodynamics 5 1 the development and influence of crevasse channel bifurcations reference model m2 is the only model run where a well developed essentially stable crevasse channel bifurcation i e a psc with a smaller branching ssc develops through the flood cycles fig 8 other model runs with different discharges and or different floodplain water levels lead to the development of one dominant splay channel psc only m1 m3 to m7 or to two separate crevasse splay channels psc and separate ssc see m8 and m9 fig 8 fig 10 in model run m2 soon after the start of flooding along the trunk channel flow and sediment is diverted to the floodplain as a consequence of levee breaching in the upstream part of the reach fig 8 fig 11 relatively high flow velocities and resulting bed shear stresses through the levee breach in the upstream part of the reach fig 11a b promote development of a distinct crevasse channel with the eroded sediment initially being deposited near the crevasse apex during the peak of the first flood cycle flow velocities and maximum bed shear stresses are highest in the floodplain near the crevasse opening particularly along two main paths that trend obliquely basinward see arrows in fig 11b resulting in net erosion and sediment dispersal flow velocity and shear stress decrease downvalley and laterally across the floodplain fig 11a b which leads to widespread sediment deposition including on prominent bars adjacent to the crevasse fig 11c d the topographic relief created during the first flood peak phase 1 exerts a fundamental influence on the backflow phase 3 that occurs as the first flood peak wanes and during which much erosion occurs during waning flow discharge in the trunk channel decreases and water level drops but the floodplain water level remains relatively high owing to the enforced residual overbank flow consequently water drains back to the trunk channel fig 12 a c focusing on the two paths where flow velocities and maximum bed shear stresses were highest during the prior peak flood fig 11a b fig 12a c these two backflow paths are characterized by high flow velocities and maximum bed shear stresses which leads to further erosion and the lowering and deepening of the crevasse channels particularly close to the junction with the trunk channel fig 12d f fig 13 a by contrast flow velocities decrease at the junction with the trunk channel fig 12d with sediment deposition leading to the formation of a reflux lobe fig 13a the modelling results show that subsequent flood cycles outflow and backflow tend to accentuate the floodplain topography established during this first flood event with the psc gradually incorporating the offtake of the ssc as the crevasse splay complex develops fig 5 these simulated erosional and depositional dynamics in model run m2 correspond with previous field and remote sensing observations of some large splay complexes along the río colorado e g fig 1e f fig 13b e which show that erosion may initiate knickpoints at the junction between different order splay channels or at the junction between the crevasse channel and the trunk channel cf donselaar et al 2013 their fig 15e f van toorenenburg et al 2018 their fig 7c and fig 13 knickpoint migration in subsequent floods may result in knickpoint coalescence giving rise to extensive headward eroding channel networks similarly our model results showing the development of reflux lobes e g fig 1e f and fig 13b c e correspond with previous field and remote sensing observations donselaar et al 2013 their fig 15d e li and bristow 2015 their fig 17 van toorenenburg et al 2018 their fig 7a and fig 8 the modelling results also demonstrate how reflux lobes tend to form towards the end of each flood event but are eroded in the subsequent flood event and so do not persist as stable channel features cf van toorenenburg et al 2018 5 2 channel floodplain interactions during floods discharge models similar to model run m2 in the other discharge model runs m1 m3 to m5 the first flood phase 1 tends to establish the floodplain topography that fundamentally influences crevasse splay morphodynamics in the subsequent backflow phases 2 and 3 with this developing topography then influencing later flood cycles fig 14 even in the lowest discharge model run m1 50 m3 s the first flood cycle is sufficient to initiate overbank flow and also some limited levee breaching and crevasse channel erosion fig 14a as we used a 2d depth averaged flow equation in our delft3d simulations the typically vertically stratified sediment concentrations in river flows means that the upper water column remains relatively sediment free cf slingerland and smith 1998 meselhe et al 2012 and so only limited sediment is transferred to the floodplain fig 14a as discharge increases from m1 to m5 however increasing volumes of overbank flow are coupled with higher overbank flow velocities and shear stresses leading to increases in the lateral extent of levee breaching and crevasse channel erosion fig 14b c in addition increasing volumes of sediment are transferred to and across the floodplain leading to formation of depositional bars for instance the formation of an upstream bar middle bar and downstream bar in model runs m2 and m3 fig 5 fig 8 is a result of the rapid flow expansion that occurs in the transition from relatively confined flow in a crevasse to unconfined overbank flow cf edmonds and slingerland 2007 for larger peak discharges model runs m4 and m5 the psc deepens and captures an increasing proportion of the flow emanating from the trunk channel fig 8 consequently less overbank flow goes through the ssc fig 8 which leads to decreasing flow velocities and sediment deposition these processes lead to narrowing shallowing and eventual infilling of the ssc fig 8 this illustrates a more general point namely that as increasing amounts of sediment are transferred onto and across the floodplain in an increasingly dominant psc fig 8 many topographic lows on the more medial and distal parts of the floodplain tend to be filled locally blocking potential pathways for backflow to the trunk channel after the flood peak has passed fig 14 5 3 backflow processes and their impacts on crevasse morphodynamics similar to model run m2 see section 5 1 in the other backflow model runs m6 m7 m8 m9 the more rapidly decreasing water levels in the trunk channel after the passage of the flood peak create steep local water surface gradients inducing backflow from the floodplain towards the trunk channel this backflow tends to be routed through any pre existing splay channels commonly inducing erosion near the junction with the trunk channel and forming reflux lobes fig 12 fig 13 a key issue however is the extent to which floodplain inundation and backflow accelerate crevasse splay development in our study backflow model runs with floodplain water levels that are higher than the levee elevation i e m8 m9 induced return flow to the trunk channel along a greater length of the modelled reach some of which leads to development of crevasse channels i e the sscs that are separate from the area of levee breaching that occurred early in the model runs fig 10d e nevertheless our modelling results reveal that these high floodplain water levels do not necessarily mean high rates of crevasse channel development across the floodplain for example in m8 and m9 the more downstream crevasse channels i e the sscs that are initiated mainly by the higher volumes of backflow tend to develop at a similar rate compared to the upstream crevasse channels the pscs that are driven by a combination of outflow during peak floods and backflow during waning flow fig 10d e the similar development rates of these different crevasse channels despite different combinations of hydrological drivers possibly can be attributed to the interaction between outflow and backflow processes though the upstream crevasse channels psc receive substantial outflow from the trunk channel these flows may decelerate under conditions of high floodplain water levels with a corresponding reduction in erosion by the same token the higher floodplain water levels drive more active backflow processes resulting in widening and deepening of downstream crevasse channels sscs that initially do not receive substantial outflow from the trunk channel in fact our modelling results demonstrate that crevasse channels tend to extend faster across the floodplain when floodplain water levels are lower driven by strong outflow and proximal erosion sediment tends not to be deposited on levees but is delivered further onto the floodplain fig 10 m6 m7 similar to model run m2 in model runs m6 and m7 one crevasse channel becomes dominant and extends beyond the model domain fig 10 suggesting the potential for some crevasse channels to develop into avulsion pathways that ultimately lead to more profound lateral redistribution of water and sediment cf li et al 2019 6 discussion our results and interpretations both support and significantly extend previous inferences about splay development along the lower río colorado made by donselaar et al 2013 2022 li and bristow 2015 and van toorenenburg et al 2018 but also provide scope for comparison with the processes of splay formation along other dryland rivers in addition our findings provide insights into the limitations and potential of numerical modelling of splay development 6 1 comparisons to splay formation along other dryland rivers splays are common features of the lower reaches of ephemeral rivers in endorheic basins both where riparian vegetation is present e g tooth 1999a b 2000 2005 lang et al 2004 fisher et al 2008 millard et al 2017 and largely absent e g li et al 2014 ielpi 2018 ielpi and lapôtre 2019a from these settings however there are relatively few detailed data on the controls patterns processes and rates of splay development one exception is provided by tooth s 2005 field investigations of three ephemeral rivers in arid central australia where splays have developed on the outside of channel bends or on straight reaches despite well developed bankline vegetation principally eucalyptus spp splays on the lower sandover sandover bundey and woodforde rivers vary from small lobate or tongue shaped features 1 km long to larger elongate features up to 4 km long and are supplied with rare floodwater and sand and minor gravel through well defined breaches in the upper parts of the trunk channel banks or levees in these central australian channels splays initially develop when overbank flow initiates a bank levee breach and scours the floodplain surface typically in a direction perpendicular to the trunk channel subsequent overbank flows further deepen the initial breach increasing flow and bedload supply from the trunk channel which in some instances is routed through a primary splay channel on the proximal floodplain and a network of secondary splay channels and bars on the medial and distal floodplain some splays remain elevated above the trunk channel but others continue to deepen increasing the flow and bedload supply during floods some may also extend longitudinally gradually adopting a more elongate form and commonly re orienting to run subparallel to the trunk channel as a single channel once level with the trunk channel bed these latter types of splays are best termed distributary channels because they divert water and sediment even during low magnitude flood events tooth 2005 continued development of a distributary channel ultimately may lead to an avulsion with flow and sediment transport switching to the distributary and the former trunk channel being abandoned in these central australia rivers overbank floods in the lower reaches are infrequent once every 1 2 years or less so splays and distributary channels develop relatively slowly over many decades tooth 2005 despite differences in the degree of riparian vegetation sediment calibre and rates of development splay channels along the lower reaches of these central australian rivers clearly have many morphological similarities with the río colorado splays but what about the hydrological conditions under which these splays develop flood hydrological conditions in the remote central australian channels are not well known but the field evidence e g orientation of flattened grasses flood debris local bedforms suggests that prolonged high floodplain water levels and backflow after the passage of peak stage is not a major factor tooth 2005 this suggests that conditions similar to our discharge model runs m1 m5 fig 8 with their dominance of outflow are probably most prevalent along these rivers shorter commonly bifurcating lobate or tongue shaped splays may develop under conditions most similar to model runs m1 or early stage m2 or m3 and larger elongate splays with a dominant channel may develop under conditions most similar to model runs m3 to m5 fig 8 by contrast flood hydrological conditions along the topographically complex lower río colorado are highly spatially non uniform with the widespread distribution of active and abandoned fluvial landforms significantly influencing the patterns depths and durations of overbank flows li et al 2018 while some parts of the floodplain are relatively free draining prolonged high floodplain water levels overbank depths up to 0 5 m may be promoted in localised topographic depressions e g within palaeochannels and cutoffs or between the elevated topography created by palaeochannel belts or older crevasse splay complexes leading to strong backflow after peak stage has passed along the río colorado therefore shorter splays may develop under conditions that either involve limited outflow model runs m1 and early stage m2 or m3 or high floodplain water levels with pronounced backflow m8 m9 figs 8 and 10 longer splays with a dominant channel may develop under conditions involving a mix of strong outflow and moderately high floodplain water levels with moderate backflow later stage m2 and m3 m4 to m7 figs 8 and 10 6 2 evaluation in relation to other splay modelling studies our interpretations of the hydrological conditions under which crevasse splays develop along the río colorado and the central australian rivers is supported by previous splay modelling results most notably millard et al 2017 as part of an investigation into floodbasin hydrological and sediment supply controls on crevasse splay size millard et al 2017 used aerial photographs to remap and quantify the dimensions of splays along the lower sandover river first described by tooth 2005 along with comparable data from splays developed along the humid region columbia and saskatchewan rivers millard et al 2017 then conducted a targeted numerical modelling study using delft3d while their model setup has some noticeable differences from that adopted in our study see sections 2 and 3 broad comparisons can still be made most significantly millard et al 2017 concluded that splay size length area does not always scale directly with channel size or discharge and that hydrodynamic factors principally sediment size and floodplain drainage conditions play a significant role in determining whether or not large floodplain filling splays develop for example in rivers carrying sufficient volumes of coarse suspended sediment floodplain drainage conditions determine the shape and extent of splay deposition widespread splay deposits can form if floodplain conditions promote strong cross floodplain water surface slopes i e drained floodplains without significant ponding in some cases these conditions may also facilitate bedload transport across floodplains cf pizzuto et al 2008 by contrast when cross floodplain water surface gradients are far lower than downstream channel slopes i e ponded floodplains thick splay deposits may accumulate adjacent to the crevasse opening but sediment dispersal and widespread aggradation farther from the channel will be limited millard et al 2017 together these model results help to explain the field evidence from their study rivers saskatchewan river splays that develop under relatively free draining floodplain conditions tend to be fewer in number but larger and divert more sediment than the more numerous smaller columbia river splays that develop under more ponded floodplain conditions this is similar to the modelling results from our study which show clearly that high floodplain water levels ponding restrict the spatial extent length area of splays fig 10 probably owing to deceleration of outflow as slow moving or standing floodplain water is encountered interestingly millard et al 2017 interpreted the sandover river data as more similar to the saskatchewan data in terms of splay area and extent but as falling between the columbia and saskatchewan data in terms of splay occurrence and splay covered floodplain fraction while a lack of discharge data meant that millard et al 2017 explicitly excluded the sandover data from their more detailed analyses of discharge splay sediment volume overall their results would suggest that the sandover and by implication other similar central australian rivers experience flood hydrological conditions that are relatively free draining and do not involve widespread or prolonged ponding this corresponds with the earlier field observations and interpretations of tooth 2005 and the interpretations resulting from a comparison of the central australian splays with our río colorado modelling results section 6 1 6 3 further model developments similar to previous modelling approaches that have made simplifying assumptions in order to isolate some of the key factors influencing splay development e g slingerland and smith 1998 millard et al 2017 nienhuis et al 2018 our model setup was designed primarily to investigate the role of hydrological controls specifically the relative roles of discharge floodplain water levels and backflow in the development of splays along a simple channel floodplain reach of the lower río colorado as such while our results and interpretations provide valuable insights to support and extend previous field remote sensing and conceptual model inferences about splay development along the río colorado in particular but also dryland splays more generally many uncertainties remain similar to millard et al 2017 we draw attention to the need for further studies of coupled channel floodplain systems that explore more fully the morphodynamic feedbacks and sensitivities associated with different mixes of hydrological sediment supply and floodplain topographic conditions various lines of investigation can be suggested as priorities for future investigations of splay development along the lower río colorado and other dryland rivers first given the rapid rise of stage that is characteristic of floods in ephemeral rivers in particular more attention needs to be given to the potential importance of this transient part of the flood wave in initiating and promoting crevasse splay development cf millard et al 2017 particularly in channels where ramping of coarse grained e g sand minor gravel bedload up elevated bars is a key component of the sediment supply to splays see tooth 2005 second more attention could be focused on the role of varied sediment supply across a range of grain size conditions for instance the río colorado is relatively fine grained with sediment typically supplied annually to splays whereas in the central australian rivers sediment is coarser grained and supplied more infrequently to developing splay channels third on highly complex floodplains like the río colorado model setups could explore the role of prior rainfall and pre existing floodplain topography e g as created by palaeochannels cutoffs older splay complexes or erosion cells see li et al 2019 in influencing hydrological conditions particularly the critical balance between relatively free draining and more ponded conditions that have such a strong influence on splay channel morphodynamics figs 8 and 10 on the río colorado and other similar rivers there is also scope for making use of improved insights into the spatial and temporal variations in hydrological conditions within and between floods that are resulting from advances in the use of repeat very high resolution satellite images and improved processing techniques li et al 2018 finally while not a focus of this study further attention could also be directed to the relative importance of crevasse splay development in promoting avulsions on the río colorado and other dryland rivers previous splay modelling studies e g slingerland and smith 1998 hajek and edmonds 2014 millard et al 2017 have considered the relation between crevasse splay development and the progradational avulsion style see also slingerland and smith 2004 while beyond the scope of our study some of the model outputs e g figs 8 and 10 suggest that certain hydrological conditions are more favourable for the development of a dominant splay channel that over time could lead to diversion of increasing volumes of flow and sediment from the trunk channel and ultimately result in avulsion cf donselaar et al 2013 2022 van toorenenburg et al 2018 li et al 2018 2019 it is worth noting however that avulsions on the lower río colorado do not necessarily involve splay development similar to some other dryland rivers tooth et al 2007 2008 larkin et al 2017 incisional avulsions involving floodplain scour and incision e g through development of headcutting channels or coalescence of erosion cells and or reoccupational avulsions involving reworking of older palaeochannels may be of equal or greater significance in redistributing water and sediment li et al 2019 indeed on distributive fluvial systems like the lower río colorado where abundant palaeochannels cutoffs older splay complexes and erosion cells create highly complex floodplain topography splays that initially develop as a result of splay progradation are increasingly likely to encounter headcutting channels erosion cells or palaeochannels as they lengthen perhaps leading to a change over time in the dominant avulsion style 7 conclusions present knowledge of the geomorphology and sedimentology of dryland river floodplains is incomplete with the characteristics of overbank deposits such as splays typically being poorly documented in comparison with channel forms and deposits over recent years however field remote sensing and modelling studies of the non vegetated ephemeral río colorado have contributed significant information particularly because regular flooding drives cascades of pronounced widespread channel floodplain changes on far shorter timescales than is typical in many other dryland systems this study has shown how process based modelling using delft3d can provide additional insights into splay development complementing and significantly extending previous findings both on the lower río colorado but also along dryland rivers more generally our modelling results show that discharge floodplain water levels and backflow all exert significant influences on splay development and potential wider channel floodplain dynamics simulated results reveal that increases in discharge lead to more rapid splay sedimentation and stabilization of a single crevasse channel increases in floodplain water level result in shorter but wider splays high water levels restrict the spatial extent of splays probably owing to deceleration of outflow as slow moving or standing floodplain water is encountered but these conditions promote separate crevasse channel formation farther downstream as backflow breaches the trunk channel levee during falling stage a key objective in future research into dryland splays will be to couple additional field and remote sensing observations with modelling studies that incorporate a wider range of hydrological sediment supply and floodplain topographic conditions this will help to build more comprehensive models of splay development that can advance knowledge of the spatial and temporal controls patterns processes and rates of channel floodplain development in dryland

2276,crevasse splays generate subtle local relief and contribute to fluvial basin sedimentary filling but controls on splay development along dryland rivers remain poorly understood owing to limited

flooding characteristics e g discharge water depth and extent near the terminus of the non vegetated ephemeral río colorado on the southeastern margin of salar de uyuni bolivia we undertake process based modelling using delft3d to isolate the role of hydrological controls on crevasse splay morphodynamics holding the potential sediment supply constant we focus on the role of discharge outflow from trunk channel to crevasse channel during rising stage floodplain water levels and backflow reflux to the trunk channel during falling stage using nine different model runs each with 10 simulated flood cycles we show that the processes associated with these hydrological controls result in various outcomes from short crevasse splay channels that may bifurcate and develop depositional bars to longer splays with one primary channel that mainly transfers sediment across the floodplain results reveal that increases in flood discharge lead to more rapid splay sedimentation and stabilization of a single crevasse channel increases in floodplain water level lead to shorter but wider splays and facilitate the formation of multiple stable crevasse channels high floodplain water levels probably restrict splay length owing to deceleration of outflow as floodplain water is encountered but separate crevasse channels may form downstream as backflow breaches the trunk channel levee during falling

splay discharge dryland river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction along river systems floods that start to exceed bankfull spread beyond the confines of the channel leading to overbank flow and the initiation of various channel floodplain interactions rapidly changing flood hydraulic conditions are associated with shifting erosional and depositional patterns thereby influencing local topographic relief and down valley and cross valley water and sediment transfer e g mertes et al 1996 walling and he 1998 pizzuto et al 2008 lewin et al 2017 along some rivers overbank flow can trigger levee breaching and initiate crevasse channel formation on proximal floodplain areas miall 1996 bridge 2003 once formed crevasse channels can increase flow and sediment diversion from the trunk channel sometimes termed the main or parent channel commonly leading to splay erosion and deposition on more medial and distal floodplain areas over time continued development and local coalescence of splays can help build alluvial ridges and may also prime river reaches for avulsion smith and perez arlucea 1994 bristow et al 1999 tooth 2005 buehler et al 2011 li et al 2014 ultimately leading to more widespread lateral redistribution of water and sediment over longer timescales therefore splays and avulsions can be a key influence on the filling and sedimentary architecture of fluvial basins miall 1996 bridge 2003 slingerland and smith 2004 using field laboratory and conceptual and numerical modelling approaches crevasse splays and their association with channel floodplain processes such as avulsion have been widely studied particularly along present day humid region perennial river systems e g slingerland and smith 1998 stouthamer 2001 aslan et al 2005 hajek and wolinsky 2012 kleinhans et al 2013 hajek and edmonds 2014 shen et al 2015 millard et al 2017 nienhuis et al 2018 rahman et al 2022 this body of research has enabled many key controls on splay development to be identified including those relating to discharge water surface and land surface gradients floodplain vegetation and drainage conditions and sediment supply cohesion and consolidation over the last few decades improved understanding of the interactions among these controls has provided the basis for the use of splays as a deliberate management tool for instance creating artificial diversions that mimic splays and thereby help to control basinward water and sediment fluxes e g florsheim and mount 2002 yuill et al 2016 nienhuis et al 2018 by contrast with the research on humid region river systems far less is known about crevasse splays along present day dryland river systems some of the aforementioned studies have generated insights about splay development that may be applicable to dryland systems for instance the broad controls preconditioning factors and formative processes of splay development e g levee breaching crevasse channel formation and flow and sediment diversion may be similar between humid region and dryland rivers tooth 2005 li et al 2014 li and bristow 2015 rahman et al 2022 nonetheless it remains unclear the extent to which different flooding characteristics along many dryland rivers particularly the typically more rapid rise and fall of flood stage and the long periods of little or no flow along ephemeral or intermittent rivers influence the spatial patterns rates and timescales of splay development reid and frostick 2011 tooth and nanson 2011 tooth 2013 rare descriptions of dryland river

for unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs and pre silurian rock records li et al 2014 2015 2020b ielpi 2018 ielpi and lapôtre 2019a van toorenenburg et al 2016 2018 donselaar et al 2022 a prime example of a non vegetated fine grained ephemeral river with abundant splays is the lower río colorado bolivia fig 1 the lower part of the river system is an example of a distributive fluvial system dfs sensu weissmann et al 2010 and consists of the active trunk channel numerous partially active and abandoned channels and a topographically complex floodplain li et al 2019 channel planforms range from straight to sinuous partly depending on the time elapsed since initial formation with channels tending to become more sinuous over time li et al 2019 donselaar et al 2022 the trunk channel terminates on the southeastern margin of salar de uyuni the world s largest salt lake fig 1a c the absence of vegetation along the channels and on the floodplain is due to the characteristically dry and saline environment fig 1c f previous studies have provided valuable insights into the processes patterns and rates of splay development donselaar et al 2013 2022 li and bristow 2015 van toorenenburg et al 2018 but many uncertainties remain especially regarding the relative importance of hydrological variations such as discharge rates of stage rise and fall and overbank flooding depth and extent the river is ungauged and during floods the study area is largely inaccessible so direct flow and sediment transport measurements cannot be made nonetheless hydraulic reconstructions using a combination of field measurements remote sensing image analysis and numerical modelling can still generate key data on channel and overbank flood characteristics e g li et al 2018 2020c further valuable insights into the controls on splay morphodynamics along the lower río colorado can be provided by a process based modelling approach in this paper we outline the study area and summarise previous work on the splays of the lower río colorado in order to isolate the key hydrological controls thereafter our aims are to 1 use delft3d to investigate the relative importance of these hydrological controls specifically discharge floodplain drainage conditions and backflow in the initiation and development of crevasse splays along the río colorado 2 compare the controls patterns processes and rates of splay development along the río colorado with splay formation along other dryland rivers 3 evaluate the modelling results in relation to those derived from other splay modelling studies and 4 consider how numerical modelling approaches can be developed to provide further insight into crevasse splay and associated channel floodplain morphodynamics along dryland rivers more generally 2 study area and previous work on the splays of the lower río colorado over the last decade a combination of field data high resolution satellite imagery and conceptual and numerical modelling has been used to document the flood hydrology and channel floodplain morphodynamics approaching the terminus of the río colorado and assess the sedimentological implications e g donselaar et al 2013 2022 li et al 2014 2018 2019 2020a b sandén 2016 van toorenenburg et al 2018 similar to the lower reaches of many other ephemeral dryland rivers there is a significant downstream decrease in the cross sectional area of the river from 80 m2 to 5 m2 and its associated sediment transport capacity donselaar et al 2013 2022 these changes lead to widespread overbank flow during floods which typically occur approximately once annually but with flood clusters being closely related to la niña like conditions li 2014 li et al 2020a c 2021 approaching the river terminus bed bank and floodplain sediment is dominantly fine grained d50 60 µm but there are no data on bedload or suspended sediment loads during floods owing to the absence of gauges and lack of real time monitoring and measurement li et al 2015 overbank flow commonly initiates levee breaching along the trunk channel and other partially active channels resulting in a downstream increase in the number of crevasse splays li and bristow 2015 formation of multiple crevasse splays with local relief up to 0 5 m fig 1d f commonly leads to lateral amalgamation and vertical stacking resulting in low accommodation space on the floodplain adjacent to the channels li et al 2014 li and bristow 2015 consequently during waning flood stages significant volumes of overbank floodwater can flow back towards the channels through some of the crevasse splay networks a process termed backflow or reflux e g van toorenenburg et al 2018 due to limited accessibility during peak floods field measurements of flood flow conditions are notoriously difficult and real time observations using remote sensing approaches are commonly limited by satellite visiting periods resolution and or cloud cover e g li et al 2018 nevertheless based on pre and post flood field observations of the lower río colorado van toorenenburg et al 2018 distinguished three different splay types namely i splays subject to unidirectional basinward drainage ii splays facilitating bidirectional drainage and iii splays in a post active abandonment phase from these observations van toorenenburg et al 2018 proposed a generic life cycle for crevasse splays that spans multiple flooding events fig 2 initial splay development is controlled dominantly by outflow from the trunk channel which initiates crevasse channel erosion and associated deposition as the splay channels adjust towards an equilibrium profile graded to a local base level formed by their distal termini at this stage the bed elevation at the crevasse channel apex remains higher than the maximum flood ponding depth on the floodplain and there is no backflow reflux to the trunk channel fig 2 continued incision during subsequent floods along the crevasse channel however lowers the bed elevation at the crevasse apex to below the maximum flood depth on the floodplain coupled with more distal deposition these morphodynamic adjustments facilitate the return flow of water and sediment to the trunk channel during falling stage fig 2 temporarily this lowers or reverses the equilibrium profile with local base level now formed by the lower elevation trunk channel thalweg as a consequence headward erosion the backstepping erosion of van toorenenburg et al 2018 commonly occurs throughout the splay channel network and the increased sediment supply can promote the formation of reflux lobes at the junction with the trunk channel cf fig 1f this lowering or reversal of crevasse channel gradient ultimately leads to lower velocity outflows from the trunk channel during floods which may then lead to backfilling and abandonment of the crevasse splay fig 2 the field observations of van toorenenburg et al 2018 draw particular attention to the key controls on splay development in this setting including i the relative channel and floodplain gradients ii the relative elevations of the trunk channel bed crevasse channel bed and floodplain and iii the relative floodwater depths in the trunk channel and on the floodplain while their conceptual model provides numerous useful insights into splay development the dynamic interplay between these factors under various flooding scenarios remains to be explored more comprehensively using numerical modelling approaches significantly however van toorenenburg et al s 2018 observations highlight the limitations of previously published modelling experiments for investigating the relative role of these controls in splay development in the río colorado setting two contrasting examples illustrate this point slingerland and smith s 1998 physically based conceptual model of the development of an initial crevasse channel highlighted the importance of the amount of suspended sediment delivered to the crevasse channel relative to its transport capacity but did not consider the conditions leading to the initial crevasse formation or the role of bedload variations in outflow or backflow millard et al s 2017 numerical model aimed to isolate how sediment supply and floodplain drainage conditions influence splay growth but their model setup represented a flat floodplain condition that was designed explicitly to promote deposition and limit channelisation and sediment remobilisation that may arise from flow over a sloped floodplain in their model an initial crevasse and associated levees had a non erodible base and morphodynamically developed only through deposition while providing many useful insights therefore the limitations of these and other numerical models restrict direct application of the previously published modelling results to the río colorado setting in short the controls of crevasse splay development along the río colorado and potentially along other similarly low gradient non vegetated dryland rivers e g ielpi 2018 ielpi and lapôtre 2019a b are still not fully understood using delft3d a process based numerical model in this paper we test and extend van toorenenburg et al s 2018 field based observations by addressing the role of hydrological variations in crevasse splay formation specifically this study focuses on the relative importance of discharge outflow from trunk channel to crevasse channel during rising stage and backflow reflux to the trunk channel during falling stage in the early stages of crevasse splay formation the early stages of crevasse splay development have been reported to have a fundamental impact on later splay growth and therefore the subsequent architecture of splay deposits toonen et al 2016 similar to other splay modelling studies where simplifying assumptions have been made e g slingerland and smith 1998 millard et al 2017 nienhuis et al 2018 in order to isolate and evaluate the relative influence of these hydrological controls at this stage we do not address sediment supply variations 3 methods and model setup 3 1 numerical model we used the open source physics based model delft3d version 4 04 01 to conduct numerical experiments linking hydrodynamic sediment transport and morphological changes in the early stages of crevasse splay development delft3d solves the two dimensional depth averaged flow equations and computes sediment transport and bed level change lesser et al 2004 the reliability and accuracy of this model for both scientific research and engineering practice has been demonstrated in a wide spectrum of river estuarine and coastal systems e g mosselman 2004 edmonds and slingerland 2007 2008 schuurman et al 2013 hajek and edmonds 2014 yuill et al 2016 millard et al 2017 nienhuis et al 2018 david et al 2018 compared with other numerical models a particular advantage of delft3d is its simulation of sediment transport and morphodynamics with rigorous theoretical foundation mosselman 2004 edmonds and slingerland 2007 2008 schuurman et al 2013 the hydrodynamics in delft3d are based on conservation of momentum and mass assuming hydrostatic pressure the equations of fluid motion sediment transport and deposition are discretized on a 3d curvilinear finite difference grid and an alternating direction implicit scheme is used to solve the differential equations for detailed descriptions of the hydrodynamics and numerical scheme of delft3d see lesser et al 2004 3 2 model setup and input this study focuses on channel floodplain interactions during overbank flooding particularly during and after peak discharge accordingly we created a schematized model to investigate morphodynamics of a trunk channel and an adjacent right hand floodplain based on width and depth measurements of the río colorado approaching the river terminus donselaar et al 2013 the trunk channel was set at 300 m long 32 m wide and 2 m deep fig 3 measurements of 216 crevasse splays approaching the río colorado river terminus li and bristow 2015 reveal that the median values of splay length and width are 298 m and 112 m respectively based on these dimensions the levee and floodplain in the model domain was set at 300 m long 368 m wide fig 3 a 40 m wide levee initially without crevasse channels was set uniformly along the edge of the trunk channel with a cross valley slope of 0 5 while the rest of the domain was floodplain with a cross valley slope of 0 09 fig 3 a high resolution 2 m 2 m grid cell for observation of channel floodplain morphodynamics was set uniformly across the model domain differential gps field measurements reveal that cross valley gradient prominently exceeds downvalley basinward gradient i e along and parallel to the trunk channel in this low gradient system li et al 2015a 2019 2020c van toorenenburg et al 2018 owing to the low downvalley gradient table 1 and the short length 300 m of the modelled reach the downvalley elevation fall in the model domain is negligible and the model runs are dependent mainly on the levee floodplain cross valley and water surface gradients the model runs employ a straight channel with an initially flat channel bed to avoid topographic forcing and allow crevasse splays to form entirely as the result of the physical and constitutive relations schuurman et al 2013 on the modelling timescale flooding is driven by variations in river discharge initially water flows down the trunk channel then as stage rises erosion and outflow occurs through newly forming crevasse channels leading to floodplain inundation finally as stage falls reflux returns flow to the main channel accordingly we set two open boundaries for the trunk channel with upstream inflow and downstream outflow as well as open boundaries at either edge of the floodplain domain table 1 fig 3 the trunk channel inflow boundary is characterized by a constant frequency of peak flow and low flow i e a fixed flood return period as such water level at the outflow boundary is set for two conditions a low flow water level 6 m during the low discharge period and a peak flow water level 6 5 m for the peak discharge where the water levels are relative to the top elevation of the maximum initial sediment thickness in the model domain in the model domain fig 3 this peak flow water level equates to a channel water depth of 2 m and an overbank water depth of up to 0 5 m time series of high resolution satellite imagery has revealed that crevasse splays along the río colorado tend to develop in the austral summer when most rainfall and flooding occurs more than three decades of daily precipitation data 1985 2017 reveal that peak flooding occurs approximately once per year on average although there may be clusters of floods as driven by enso cycles li and bristow 2015 li et al 2019 2020a 2021 to fully capture the rise and fall of typical hydrographs in the river system a morphological factor morfac of 10 was set and ten flood cycles each with a simulation time of 52 h were employed the morphological factor reduces computational time by accelerating the morphological response to each hydrodynamic timestep by the value set lesser et al 2004 sediment input in the model was based on the analysis of the grain size distribution of 219 samples collected from the lower reaches of the río colorado samples were collected mainly from point bar deposits and crevasse splay and floodplain sediments and are mostly composed of fine sand silt and clay li et al 2015 based on the field data in the model we set a ratio of 2 3 3 for fine sand silt and clay table 2 the engelund hansen equation engelund and hansen 1967 was used to calculate sediment transport for non cohesive sediment as one of our study aims was to investigate the relative importance of hydrological controls in crevasse splay initiation and development for the upstream boundary a constant potential sediment supply was assigned to all simulations therefore model runs with a larger discharge were supplied with more sediment overall than model runs with smaller discharges morehead et al 2003 we simulated nine different model runs each of which has ten cycles of peak discharge and backflow table 3 fig 4 the model runs were designed to highlight the relative importance of hydrological controls on key erosional and depositional processes specifically discharge and the combined effect of floodplain water level and backflow to help differentiate the impact of overbank flow and backflow three phases were defined for each flood cycle fig 4 phase 1 is from the start of a new flood to the flood peak phase 2 is from the end of peak flow to the start of backflow and phase 3 is before the new flood cycle starts the discharge model runs m1 to m5 have a fixed floodplain water level of 6 5 m but different discharges of 50 60 70 80 and 90 m3 s respectively fig 4a the backflow model runs m6 m7 m2 m8 m9 have a fixed discharge of 60 m3 s but different floodplain water levels of 6 3 6 4 6 5 6 6 and 6 63 m respectively with its common discharge of 60 m3 s and floodplain water level of 6 5 m model run m2 is included in both the discharge and backflow model runs and so provides a reference model for comparison across the full suite of model runs with reference to the non crevassed levee elevation of 6 5 m model runs m6 6 3 m and m7 6 4 m have water levels lower than the levee model run m2 has a water level equal to the levee elevation and model runs m8 6 6 m and m9 6 63 m have water levels higher than the levee fig 4b for each model run a transition from no water to low confined flow of 10 m3 s was set initially to ensure model stability each flood cycle then starts from this low flow discharge fig 4 and subsequently linearly increases to peak discharge bankfull discharge 50 60 m3 s was estimated using bjerklie s 2007 model which has been successfully applied for discharge estimation along the río colorado and other ungauged dryland rivers larkin et al 2017 li et al 2019 2021 as discharge increases overbank flow initiates from upstream to downstream and water level increases on the floodplain as peak discharge is passed and stage in the trunk channel begins to fall backflow from the floodplain to the trunk channel potentially can start the termination of backflow events is followed by evaporation modelled using heat flux equations for details see page 227 in the delft3d flow user manual which removes water on the floodplain prior to the next flood fig 4 based on previous work in this study area li et al 2020c a manning roughness coefficient of 0 03 is used in the model 3 3 post processing channel floodplain morphodynamics sediment thickness and flow velocity and bed shear stress for each flood cycle were analyzed the sedimentary features near open boundaries e g upstream bars near the inflow boundary were not subjected to further analysis to avoid including unrealistic boundary effects three downvalley floodplain profiles were analyzed with the profiles taken parallel to and away from the trunk channel at distances of 200 m 250 m and 300 m key morphological elements including crevasse channels and depositional bars were identified along these profiles and their morphodynamics were recorded on the basis of topographic changes for crevasse channels the lowest topographic points on each profile were extracted i e bed level while for bars the highest topographic points on each profile were extracted i e bar tops high resolution satellite imagery dates 2010 2013 2016 2018 from google earth pro reveal crevasse splay morphodynamics along the río colorado over the last decade e g fig 1d f and were compared with the model outputs using visual inspection 4 results based on the hydrological sedimentological and geomorphological characteristics of the lower río colorado our delft3d generic simulations systematically varied the flood discharge and floodplain water levels as outlined below our results show that increases in discharge lead to more rapid splay sedimentation and stabilization of a single crevasse channel increases in floodplain water level result in short wider splays and facilitate the development of multiple stable crevasse channels 4 1 reference model run m2 the reference model run illustrates that ten flood cycles are sufficient to fully capture the early stage of crevasse splay development that result from overbank flooding and backflow processes fig 5 the crevasse splay complex ultimately includes two crevasse channels namely a primary splay channel psc and a secondary splay channel ssc and three depositional bars downstream bar middle bar and distal bar fig 5h at the start of the model run 1st flood overbank flooding occurs in the upstream reach of the trunk channel and is associated with pronounced levee breaching fig 5a adjacent to the breached levee two splay channels develop on the floodplain both of which lengthen narrow and deepen by erosion during the first few floods fig 5a d fig 6 the splay channel that is located perpendicular to the trunk channel develops more rapidly and eventually becomes the psc fig 5e f from the 7th flood onwards this channel stabilizes in width fig 5g j fig 6 a ssc develops during the first three flood cycles fig 5a c fig 6 but subsequently shallows and narrows as the middle bar and downstream bar grow in size albeit at a slower rate after the 6th flood fig 5d j fig 6 in later flood cycles a distal bar develops e g fig 5g i and eventually amalgamates with the middle bar fig 5j analysis of the simulated topography shows that the psc experiences erosion albeit with a decrease in depth from the proximal 1 25 m difference to distal 1 03 m difference region fig 6 fig 7 a c m2 red line with circles in the proximal profile 200 m for each flood cycle the psc bed experiences minor deposition around the flood peak but erosion exceeds this deposition during backflow phases leading to an overall erosive trend fig 6a fig 7a m2 red line with circles the elevation change over time in the proximal section 200 m is staggered with relatively pronounced depositional and erosional events during the different phases of the flooding cycle fig 7a while the medial profile 250 m and the distal profile 300 m show a smoother decrease in elevation over time fig 7b c the ssc is characterized by a fluctuating trend from overall deepening erosion to shallowing filling through the 10 flood cycles fig 6 fig 7d f m2 red line with circles during the 1st to the 6th flood cycles the net elevation of the ssc decreases in the proximal profile with pronounced erosion during backflow phases overriding any deposition occurring in the other phases of the flooding cycles fig 6 fig 7d from the 7th flood cycle onwards the elevation of the ssc shows a slight net increase with the erosion in the backflow phase no longer overriding the deposition experienced in the other phases fig 6 fig 7d the medial 250 m and distal 300 m profiles show similar trends with initial minor erosion followed by minor filling fig 6 fig 7e f the middle bar undergoes minor variations in elevation away from the trunk channel the proximal 200 m profile shows that erosion occurs in the backflow phase of the 1st flood cycle but thereafter deposition predominates until the bar elevation stabilises from the 7th flood cycle onwards fig 6 fig 7g red line with circles in the medial 250 m and distal 300 m profiles the middle bar experiences an increase in elevation during the first 4 or 5 flood cycles and thereafter stabilises fig 6 fig 7h i 4 2 discharge model runs m1 to m5 in comparison to m2 the other four discharge model runs have discharges that are either smaller m1 or larger m3 to m5 the results show that differences in peak discharge have a strong influence on the crevasse splay morphodynamics fig 7 fig 8 in simulations with smaller and larger peak discharges only a psc fully develops and there is either no evidence or only weak development of a ssc and middle bar fig 7 fig 8 for the lowest discharge model m1 levee breaching occurs but this only leads to limited development of a psc fig 8 during the backflow stage all water drains back to the trunk channel via the psc elevation analysis shows that in model run m1 the psc in the proximal 200 m profile is deeper than in model run m2 for the first eight floods fig 7a blue line with crosses but in the more medial 250 m and distal 300 m profiles is noticeably shallower fig 7b c for simulations with larger peak discharge m3 to m5 levee breaching tends to occur slightly farther downstream along the trunk channel and a psc becomes increasingly prominent leading to increasing sediment transfer to and across the full width of the floodplain fig 8 in m3 m4 and m5 the bed level of the psc decreases initially but approaches a stable elevation in the later flood cycles especially in the more proximal reaches fig 7a c in simulations with discharges larger m3 m5 than the reference model m2 a ssc develops in the initial flood cycles but then disappears fig 7d f fig 8 owing to the limited development of a ssc in models runs m1 and m3 to m5 a middle bar remains poorly defined in m3 and m4 deposition initially results in a vertically accreting middle bar and then greater stability after the 3rd flood cycle in the proximal and medial parts and greater stability after the 7th flood cycle in the more distal parts fig 7g i the ssc is eliminated when the middle bar accretes laterally to fill the ssc e g fig 8c and 8h 4 3 backflow model runs m2 m6 to m9 in comparison to m2 the four backflow model runs m6 m9 have floodplain water levels that are both lower than the levee m6 and m7 and higher than the levee m8 and m9 the model results show that these differences in floodplain water level have a pronounced influence on backflow processes and associated crevasse splay morphodynamics fig 9 fig 10 in models m6 and m7 the trunk channel levee is breached leading to development of a psc in similar fashion to that occurring during model run m2 especially in the proximal and medial parts where depths are similar fig 9a b fig 10 in m6 and m7 a minor ssc branches from the proximal part of the psc fig 10 but shallows through the flood cycles owing to infilling fig 9d f the areal extent of the psc and to some extent the ssc is large in model runs m6 and m7 in comparison with subsequent backflow model runs m8 and m9 where floodplain water levels are higher fig 10 in m8 two separate crevasse splay channels with similar widths develop one adjacent to the upstream part of the trunk channel the psc and one farther downstream the ssc in m9 the two splay channel widths are more dissimilar and the ssc is shorter fig 10 in both m8 and m9 the psc is shallower and shorter compared with the psc forming in model runs with lower floodplain water levels fig 9a c fig 10 in contrast to these other model runs the ssc in model runs m8 and m9 continues to deepen through the 10 flood cycles as a result of pronounced erosion fig 9d f ssc with erosion particularly pronounced in m9 close to the junction with the trunk channel fig 10 in these backflow models the areal extent and elevation of the middle bar varies fig 9g i fig 10 in large part owing to the different sizes and spacings of the psc and ssc the middle bar either initially increases in elevation through the first few flood cycles before stabilising e g m6 and m7 or tends to increase in elevation through the ten full flood cycles e g m8 and m9 ultimately reaching elevations higher than in other model runs in the proximal medial and distal profiles but with a steeper slope from the trunk channel towards the distal floodplain fig 9g i fig 10 5 interpretation our numerical modelling results provide scope for evaluating and extending previous inferences about splay development along the lower río colorado that have been derived from field and remote sensing data and modelling approaches e g donselaar et al 2013 2022 li and bristow 2015 van toorenenburg et al 2018 in particular our modelling results provide new quantified process based insights into the relative importance of discharge floodplain water levels and backflow for crevasse splay morphodynamics 5 1 the development and influence of crevasse channel bifurcations reference model m2 is the only model run where a well developed essentially stable crevasse channel bifurcation i e a psc with a smaller branching ssc develops through the flood cycles fig 8 other model runs with different discharges and or different floodplain water levels lead to the development of one dominant splay channel psc only m1 m3 to m7 or to two separate crevasse splay channels psc and separate ssc see m8 and m9 fig 8 fig 10 in model run m2 soon after the start of flooding along the trunk channel flow and sediment is diverted to the floodplain as a consequence of levee breaching in the upstream part of the reach fig 8 fig 11 relatively high flow velocities and resulting bed shear stresses through the levee breach in the upstream part of the reach fig 11a b promote development of a distinct crevasse channel with the eroded sediment initially being deposited near the crevasse apex during the peak of the first flood cycle flow velocities and maximum bed shear stresses are highest in the floodplain near the crevasse opening particularly along two main paths that trend obliquely basinward see arrows in fig 11b resulting in net erosion and sediment dispersal flow velocity and shear stress decrease downvalley and laterally across the floodplain fig 11a b which leads to widespread sediment deposition including on prominent bars adjacent to the crevasse fig 11c d the topographic relief created during the first flood peak phase 1 exerts a fundamental influence on the backflow phase 3 that occurs as the first flood peak wanes and during which much erosion occurs during waning flow discharge in the trunk channel decreases and water level drops but the floodplain water level remains relatively high owing to the enforced residual overbank flow consequently water drains back to the trunk channel fig 12 a c focusing on the two paths where flow velocities and maximum bed shear stresses were highest during the prior peak flood fig 11a b fig 12a c these two backflow paths are characterized by high flow velocities and maximum bed shear stresses which leads to further erosion and the lowering and deepening of the crevasse channels particularly close to the junction with the trunk channel fig 12d f fig 13 a by contrast flow velocities decrease at the junction with the trunk channel fig 12d with sediment deposition leading to the formation of a reflux lobe fig 13a the modelling results show that subsequent flood cycles outflow and backflow tend to accentuate the floodplain topography established during this first flood event with the psc gradually incorporating the offtake of the ssc as the crevasse splay complex develops fig 5 these simulated erosional and depositional dynamics in model run m2 correspond with previous field and remote sensing observations of some large splay complexes along the río colorado e g fig 1e f fig 13b e which show that erosion may initiate knickpoints at the junction between different order splay channels or at the junction between the crevasse channel and the trunk channel cf donselaar et al 2013 their fig 15e f van toorenenburg et al 2018 their fig 7c and fig 13 knickpoint migration in subsequent floods may result in knickpoint coalescence giving rise to extensive headward eroding channel networks similarly our model results showing the development of reflux lobes e g fig 1e f and fig 13b c e correspond with previous field and remote sensing observations donselaar et al 2013 their fig 15d e li and bristow 2015 their fig 17 van toorenenburg et al 2018 their fig 7a and fig 8 the modelling results also demonstrate how reflux lobes tend to form towards the end of each flood event but are eroded in the subsequent flood event and so do not persist as stable channel features cf van toorenenburg et al 2018 5 2 channel floodplain interactions during floods discharge models similar to model run m2 in the other discharge model runs m1 m3 to m5 the first flood phase 1 tends to establish the floodplain topography that fundamentally influences crevasse splay morphodynamics in the subsequent backflow phases 2 and 3 with this developing topography then influencing later flood cycles fig 14 even in the lowest discharge model run m1 50 m3 s the first flood cycle is sufficient to initiate overbank flow and also some limited levee breaching and crevasse channel erosion fig 14a as we used a 2d depth averaged flow equation in our delft3d simulations the typically vertically stratified sediment concentrations in river flows means that the upper water column remains relatively sediment free cf slingerland and smith 1998 meselhe et al 2012 and so only limited sediment is transferred to the floodplain fig 14a as discharge increases from m1 to m5 however increasing volumes of overbank flow are coupled with higher overbank flow velocities and shear stresses leading to increases in the lateral extent of levee breaching and crevasse channel erosion fig 14b c in addition increasing volumes of sediment are transferred to and across the floodplain leading to formation of depositional bars for instance the formation of an upstream bar middle bar and downstream bar in model runs m2 and m3 fig 5 fig 8 is a result of the rapid flow expansion that occurs in the transition from relatively confined flow in a crevasse to unconfined overbank flow cf edmonds and slingerland 2007 for larger peak discharges model runs m4 and m5 the psc deepens and captures an increasing proportion of the flow emanating from the trunk channel fig 8 consequently less overbank flow goes through the ssc fig 8 which leads to decreasing flow velocities and sediment deposition these processes lead to narrowing shallowing and eventual infilling of the ssc fig 8 this illustrates a more general point namely that as increasing amounts of sediment are transferred onto and across the floodplain in an increasingly dominant psc fig 8 many topographic lows on the more medial and distal parts of the floodplain tend to be filled locally blocking potential pathways for backflow to the trunk channel after the flood peak has passed fig 14 5 3 backflow processes and their impacts on crevasse morphodynamics similar to model run m2 see section 5 1 in the other backflow model runs m6 m7 m8 m9 the more rapidly decreasing water levels in the trunk channel after the passage of the flood peak create steep local water surface gradients inducing backflow from the floodplain towards the trunk channel this backflow tends to be routed through any pre existing splay channels commonly inducing erosion near the junction with the trunk channel and forming reflux lobes fig 12 fig 13 a key issue however is the extent to which floodplain inundation and backflow accelerate crevasse splay development in our study backflow model runs with floodplain water levels that are higher than the levee elevation i e m8 m9 induced return flow to the trunk channel along a greater length of the modelled reach some of which leads to development of crevasse channels i e the sscs that are separate from the area of levee breaching that occurred early in the model runs fig 10d e nevertheless our modelling results reveal that these high floodplain water levels do not necessarily mean high rates of crevasse channel development across the floodplain for example in m8 and m9 the more downstream crevasse channels i e the sscs that are initiated mainly by the higher volumes of backflow tend to develop at a similar rate compared to the upstream crevasse channels the pscs that are driven by a combination of outflow during peak floods and backflow during waning flow fig 10d e the similar development rates of these different crevasse channels despite different combinations of hydrological drivers possibly can be attributed to the interaction between outflow and backflow processes though the upstream crevasse channels psc receive substantial outflow from the trunk channel these flows may decelerate under conditions of high floodplain water levels with a corresponding reduction in erosion by the same token the higher floodplain water levels drive more active backflow processes resulting in widening and deepening of downstream crevasse channels sscs that initially do not receive substantial outflow from the trunk channel in fact our modelling results demonstrate that crevasse channels tend to extend faster across the floodplain when floodplain water levels are lower driven by strong outflow and proximal erosion sediment tends not to be deposited on levees but is delivered further onto the floodplain fig 10 m6 m7 similar to model run m2 in model runs m6 and m7 one crevasse channel becomes dominant and extends beyond the model domain fig 10 suggesting the potential for some crevasse channels to develop into avulsion pathways that ultimately lead to more profound lateral redistribution of water and sediment cf li et al 2019 6 discussion our results and interpretations both support and significantly extend previous inferences about splay development along the lower río colorado made by donselaar et al 2013 2022 li and bristow 2015 and van toorenenburg et al 2018 but also provide scope for comparison with the processes of splay formation along other dryland rivers in addition our findings provide insights into the limitations and potential of numerical modelling of splay development 6 1 comparisons to splay formation along other dryland rivers splays are common features of the lower reaches of ephemeral rivers in endorheic basins both where riparian vegetation is present e g tooth 1999a b 2000 2005 lang et al 2004 fisher et al 2008 millard et al 2017 and largely absent e g li et al 2014 ielpi 2018 ielpi and lapôtre 2019a from these settings however there are relatively few detailed data on the controls patterns processes and rates of splay development one exception is provided by tooth s 2005 field investigations of three ephemeral rivers in arid central australia where splays have developed on the outside of channel bends or on straight reaches despite well developed bankline vegetation principally eucalyptus spp splays on the lower sandover sandover bundey and woodforde rivers vary from small lobate or tongue shaped features 1 km long to larger elongate features up to 4 km long and are supplied with rare floodwater and sand and minor gravel through well defined breaches in the upper parts of the trunk channel banks or levees in these central australian channels splays initially develop when overbank flow initiates a bank levee breach and scours the floodplain surface typically in a direction perpendicular to the trunk channel subsequent overbank flows further deepen the initial breach increasing flow and bedload supply from the trunk channel which in some instances is routed through a primary splay channel on the proximal floodplain and a network of secondary splay channels and bars on the medial and distal floodplain some splays remain elevated above the trunk channel but others continue to deepen increasing the flow and bedload supply during floods some may also extend longitudinally gradually adopting a more elongate form and commonly re orienting to run subparallel to the trunk channel as a single channel once level with the trunk channel bed these latter types of splays are best termed distributary channels because they divert water and sediment even during low magnitude flood events tooth 2005 continued development of a distributary channel ultimately may lead to an avulsion with flow and sediment transport switching to the distributary and the former trunk channel being abandoned in these central australia rivers overbank floods in the lower reaches are infrequent once every 1 2 years or less so splays and distributary channels develop relatively slowly over many decades tooth 2005 despite differences in the degree of riparian vegetation sediment calibre and rates of development splay channels along the lower reaches of these central australian rivers clearly have many morphological similarities with the río colorado splays but what about the hydrological conditions under which these splays develop flood hydrological conditions in the remote central australian channels are not well known but the field evidence e g orientation of flattened grasses flood debris local bedforms suggests that prolonged high floodplain water levels and backflow after the passage of peak stage is not a major factor tooth 2005 this suggests that conditions similar to our discharge model runs m1 m5 fig 8 with their dominance of outflow are probably most prevalent along these rivers shorter commonly bifurcating lobate or tongue shaped splays may develop under conditions most similar to model runs m1 or early stage m2 or m3 and larger elongate splays with a dominant channel may develop under conditions most similar to model runs m3 to m5 fig 8 by contrast flood hydrological conditions along the topographically complex lower río colorado are highly spatially non uniform with the widespread distribution of active and abandoned fluvial landforms significantly influencing the patterns depths and durations of overbank flows li et al 2018 while some parts of the floodplain are relatively free draining prolonged high floodplain water levels overbank depths up to 0 5 m may be promoted in localised topographic depressions e g within palaeochannels and cutoffs or between the elevated topography created by palaeochannel belts or older crevasse splay complexes leading to strong backflow after peak stage has passed along the río colorado therefore shorter splays may develop under conditions that either involve limited outflow model runs m1 and early stage m2 or m3 or high floodplain water levels with pronounced backflow m8 m9 figs 8 and 10 longer splays with a dominant channel may develop under conditions involving a mix of strong outflow and moderately high floodplain water levels with moderate backflow later stage m2 and m3 m4 to m7 figs 8 and 10 6 2 evaluation in relation to other splay modelling studies our interpretations of the hydrological conditions under which crevasse splays develop along the río colorado and the central australian rivers is supported by previous splay modelling results most notably millard et al 2017 as part of an investigation into floodbasin hydrological and sediment supply controls on crevasse splay size millard et al 2017 used aerial photographs to remap and quantify the dimensions of splays along the lower sandover river first described by tooth 2005 along with comparable data from splays developed along the humid region columbia and saskatchewan rivers millard et al 2017 then conducted a targeted numerical modelling study using delft3d while their model setup has some noticeable differences from that adopted in our study see sections 2 and 3 broad comparisons can still be made most significantly millard et al 2017 concluded that splay size length area does not always scale directly with channel size or discharge and that hydrodynamic factors principally sediment size and floodplain drainage conditions play a significant role in determining whether or not large floodplain filling splays develop for example in rivers carrying sufficient volumes of coarse suspended sediment floodplain drainage conditions determine the shape and extent of splay deposition widespread splay deposits can form if floodplain conditions promote strong cross floodplain water surface slopes i e drained floodplains without significant ponding in some cases these conditions may also facilitate bedload transport across floodplains cf pizzuto et al 2008 by contrast when cross floodplain water surface gradients are far lower than downstream channel slopes i e ponded floodplains thick splay deposits may accumulate adjacent to the crevasse opening but sediment dispersal and widespread aggradation farther from the channel will be limited millard et al 2017 together these model results help to explain the field evidence from their study rivers saskatchewan river splays that develop under relatively free draining floodplain conditions tend to be fewer in number but larger and divert more sediment than the more numerous smaller columbia river splays that develop under more ponded floodplain conditions this is similar to the modelling results from our study which show clearly that high floodplain water levels ponding restrict the spatial extent length area of splays fig 10 probably owing to deceleration of outflow as slow moving or standing floodplain water is encountered interestingly millard et al 2017 interpreted the sandover river data as more similar to the saskatchewan data in terms of splay area and extent but as falling between the columbia and saskatchewan data in terms of splay occurrence and splay covered floodplain fraction while a lack of discharge data meant that millard et al 2017 explicitly excluded the sandover data from their more detailed analyses of discharge splay sediment volume overall their results would suggest that the sandover and by implication other similar central australian rivers experience flood hydrological conditions that are relatively free draining and do not involve widespread or prolonged ponding this corresponds with the earlier field observations and interpretations of tooth 2005 and the interpretations resulting from a comparison of the central australian splays with our río colorado modelling results section 6 1 6 3 further model developments similar to previous modelling approaches that have made simplifying assumptions in order to isolate some of the key factors influencing splay development e g slingerland and smith 1998 millard et al 2017 nienhuis et al 2018 our model setup was designed primarily to investigate the role of hydrological controls specifically the relative roles of discharge floodplain water levels and backflow in the development of splays along a simple channel floodplain reach of the lower río colorado as such while our results and interpretations provide valuable insights to support and extend previous field remote sensing and conceptual model inferences about splay development along the río colorado in particular but also dryland splays more generally many uncertainties remain similar to millard et al 2017 we draw attention to the need for further studies of coupled channel floodplain systems that explore more fully the morphodynamic feedbacks and sensitivities associated with different mixes of hydrological sediment supply and floodplain topographic conditions various lines of investigation can be suggested as priorities for future investigations of splay development along the lower río colorado and other dryland rivers first given the rapid rise of stage that is characteristic of floods in ephemeral rivers in particular more attention needs to be given to the potential importance of this transient part of the flood wave in initiating and promoting crevasse splay development cf millard et al 2017 particularly in channels where ramping of coarse grained e g sand minor gravel bedload up elevated bars is a key component of the sediment supply to splays see tooth 2005 second more attention could be focused on the role of varied sediment supply across a range of grain size conditions for instance the río colorado is relatively fine grained with sediment typically supplied annually to splays whereas in the central australian rivers sediment is coarser grained and supplied more infrequently to developing splay channels third on highly complex floodplains like the río colorado model setups could explore the role of prior rainfall and pre existing floodplain topography e g as created by palaeochannels cutoffs older splay complexes or erosion cells see li et al 2019 in influencing hydrological conditions particularly the critical balance between relatively free draining and more ponded conditions that have such a strong influence on splay channel morphodynamics figs 8 and 10 on the río colorado and other similar rivers there is also scope for making use of improved insights into the spatial and temporal variations in hydrological conditions within and between floods that are resulting from advances in the use of repeat very high resolution satellite images and improved processing techniques li et al 2018 finally while not a focus of this study further attention could also be directed to the relative importance of crevasse splay development in promoting avulsions on the río colorado and other dryland rivers previous splay modelling studies e g slingerland and smith 1998 hajek and edmonds 2014 millard et al 2017 have considered the relation between crevasse splay development and the progradational avulsion style see also slingerland and smith 2004 while beyond the scope of our study some of the model outputs e g figs 8 and 10 suggest that certain hydrological conditions are more favourable for the development of a dominant splay channel that over time could lead to diversion of increasing volumes of flow and sediment from the trunk channel and ultimately result in avulsion cf donselaar et al 2013 2022 van toorenenburg et al 2018 li et al 2018 2019 it is worth noting however that avulsions on the lower río colorado do not necessarily involve splay development similar to some other dryland rivers tooth et al 2007 2008 larkin et al 2017 incisional avulsions involving floodplain scour and incision e g through development of headcutting channels or coalescence of erosion cells and or reoccupational avulsions involving reworking of older palaeochannels may be of equal or greater significance in redistributing water and sediment li et al 2019 indeed on distributive fluvial systems like the lower río colorado where abundant palaeochannels cutoffs older splay complexes and erosion cells create highly complex floodplain topography splays that initially develop as a result of splay progradation are increasingly likely to encounter headcutting channels erosion cells or palaeochannels as they lengthen perhaps leading to a change over time in the dominant avulsion style 7 conclusions present knowledge of the geomorphology and sedimentology of dryland river floodplains is incomplete with the characteristics of overbank deposits such as splays typically being poorly documented in comparison with channel forms and deposits over recent years however field remote sensing and modelling studies of the non vegetated ephemeral río colorado have contributed significant information particularly because regular flooding drives cascades of pronounced widespread channel floodplain changes on far shorter timescales than is typical in many other dryland systems this study has shown how process based modelling using delft3d can provide additional insights into splay development complementing and significantly extending previous findings both on the lower río colorado but also along dryland rivers more generally our modelling results show that discharge floodplain water levels and backflow all exert significant influences on splay development and potential wider channel floodplain dynamics simulated results reveal that increases in discharge lead to more rapid splay sedimentation and stabilization of a single crevasse channel increases in floodplain water level result in shorter but wider splays high water levels restrict the spatial extent of splays probably owing to deceleration of outflow as slow moving or standing floodplain water is encountered but these conditions promote separate crevasse channel formation farther downstream as backflow breaches the trunk channel levee during falling stage a key objective in future research into dryland splays will be to couple additional field and remote sensing observations with modelling studies that incorporate a wider range of hydrological sediment supply and floodplain topographic conditions this will help to build more comprehensive models of splay development that can advance knowledge of the spatial and temporal controls patterns processes and rates of channel floodplain development in dryland

2277,the operating conditions of large cascade hydropower stations are complex improving the water level prediction accuracy of large cascade hydropower stations is significant for flood control shipping irrigation etc a new hybrid model based on a refined deep residual shrinkage network and an optimized gated recurrent unit long term memory network gru lstm model is proposed for water level prediction at different time scales first to make the input data in the form of a feature map so the model can capture the weight characteristics of each influencing factor when the water level changes the water level flow rate and hydroelectric power plant output data are constructed as high dimensional feature inputs to reduce the prediction error caused by downstream tributary backwater jacking downstream tributary flow is added to the input data at the same time a semisoft threshold function with an adjustable function is inserted into the model to improve feature recognition accuracy reduce deviation and eliminate the noise of the original hydrological data second an error weight correction function is used to adjust the error between the predicted water level and the observed water level so that the model can automatically adjust the weights of each influencing factor according to the evaluation results of water level prediction in this process the parameters of lstm are optimized using the archimedes optimization algorithm and the output results of the lstm and gru networks are weighted to obtain a more accurate water level prediction the proposed model achieves good accuracy and efficiency in downstream water level prediction of the xiangjiaba hydropower station outperforms existing hydrodynamic and artificial intelligence methods and has robust scalability in flood forecasting and urban rainwater forecasting keywords refined deep residual shrinkage network gated recurrent unit long term memory network water level prediction backwater jacking multiple time scales abbreviations rdrsn refined deep residual shrinkage network drsn deep residual shrinkage network gru gated recurrent unit aoa archimedes optimization algorithm 1 introduction the yangtze river basin is rich in hydropower resources to enhance the comprehensive benefits of the yangtze river basin and reduce the threat of flooding in the basin several large scale cascade hydropower stations have been built and put into operation along the yangtze river these hydropower stations are responsible for essential tasks such as power generation shang et al 2019a irrigation zhou et al 2020 navigation ji et al 2018 flood control he et al 2014 and ecological protection ji et al 2018 however there are overlapping and coupling relationships between the upstream and downstream step hydropower stations shrestha and simonovic 2009 and accurately predicting the water level of a downstream hydropower station is a technical problem to achieve optimal utilization of water resources improve efficiency and optimal operation of the hydropower station different from traditional water level prediction for rivers and lakes or single reservoir water level prediction the water levels of cascade hydropower stations influence each other shang et al 2019b in addition to considering weather hydrology and other conditions it is also necessary to explore the impact of interactions between hydropower stations on water level changes at the same time the dispatch operation of an upper level hydropower station will bring more uncertain factors to the water level prediction for a downstream hydropower station which increases the difficulty of water level prediction for the hydropower station at present commonly used water level prediction methods mainly focus on two methods conventional hydrodynamic modeling and machine learning however there are few studies on cascade hydropower station water level prediction among them methods such as the unsteady flow numerical simulations method shao et al 2017 water level flow rate curve query values method shang et al 2019b and standard rating curve method ajmera and goyal 2012 are commonly used to obtain target water levels these methods are simple and convenient but in actual working conditions variations in soil geology weather temperature and other factors will lead to uncertainty in hydrological data under time series conditions moreover conventional numerical hydrodynamic simulation methods have difficulty handling dynamically changing hydrological information resulting in a low accuracy of final water level predictions or failing to reflect dynamic changes in the water level birgand et al 2013 in addition traditional hydrodynamic models lack intelligence and scalability due to the complex relationship between water levels in the yangtze river basin the interaction between the step hydropower plants and the posteriority of water levels compared with traditional physical conceptual models for water level prediction machine learning at this stage has achieved remarkable results in water level dynamics prediction hu et al 2019 mosavi et al 2018 first techniques such as machine learning can adjust their boundary conditions with dynamic changes in the hydrological conditions of a river basin without the need to initialize a large number of original parameters kebede et al 2006 which reduces the workload of hydrological surveys second machine learning can achieve unique predictions by learning the features of previous data which can capture the hydrological characteristics of the corresponding basin and make water level prediction fast and accurate even with a large amount of data currently artificial neural networks anns piasecki et al 2017 recurrent neural networks rnns sattari et al 2012 convolutional neural networks cnns kim and cho 2019 support vector machines svrs tehrany et al 2014 random forest rf models shortridge et al 2016 decision tree methods tehrany et al 2015 and other methods have been tested for water level prediction pham et al 2021 however these models have problems such as insufficient data feature extraction and low computational efficiency and the setting of some parameters relies on expert experience among many machine learning models an rnn can process input sequences of arbitrary time series using its internal memory module which makes it popular in water level prediction research apaydin et al 2020 however an rnn can only memorize part of a sequence when the length of the data sequence increases the prediction accuracy of the model will decrease therefore long short term memory lstm networks were developed for long sequence prediction work fang et al 2020 utilized lstm for flood sensitivity prediction and the results showed that the method was successful in flood prediction however the data in an lstm network can only be transmitted in one direction and cannot be parallelized which makes the model less sensitive to data features and the structure and parameters of the lstm are complex and need to be optimized in terms of timeliness in contrast a gated recurrent unit gru model is simpler and has only two gating units making it more scalable and suitable for building more extensive networks kisvari and lin 2021 in addition to inheriting the advantages of lstm the model also has faster operational efficiency and is suitable for tackling prediction tasks with higher efficiency requirements he and wang 2021 water level data based on time series have the characteristics of seasonality irregularity and dynamic change sattari et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 in this study the downstream water level of the xiangjiaba hydropower station is affected not only by upstream water weather hydropower station scheduling and other factors but also by the backwater jacking of downstream tributaries the complex conditions make it more difficult for traditional physical conceptual models to complete accurate water level predictions and a machine learning model alone cannot accurately capture the characteristics of dynamic changes in water level to ensure that the model can capture the hidden features in the time series data improve the intelligence of the model and make the results more accurate a cnn is often used to extract data features ince et al 2016 wang et al 2020 however a cnn model cannot avoid overfitting falling into local optimal solutions and low computational efficiency therefore zhao et al 2020 proposed deep residual shrinkage networks drsns to improve the feature extraction ability and the subchannel thresholding mechanism of these models can set separate thresholds for multidimensional input data a drsn can obtain a threshold set through iterative learning of the data and the data can be passed forward and backward in the model which effectively improves the model s ability to capture data features in addition noise interference or mapping errors can corrupt the time series of hydrological information and scholars have used methods such as wavelet transformation to remove noise dion et al 2021 designed an ensemble kalman filter hybrid model for water level prediction in canadian lakes barzegar et al 2021 used a maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt to process hydrological data and then used a cnn model to extract features and form a hybrid model with lstm the model achieved remarkable results for long time series of lake level prediction proving the feasibility of a hybrid model in water level prediction but its prediction at different time scales has not been verified additionally the process requires the design of a transformable filter which requires a great deal of signal processing expertise the hydrological data are decomposed and then reconstructed which increases the probability of errors and the workload this challenge can be avoided by embedding soft thresholding into deep learning where soft thresholding in drsns can effectively remove features that interfere with the information in the data or reduce their weights to achieve high precision feature capture the filtering of noisy features can be accomplished by relying on a gradient descent algorithm and soft thresholding mechanism alone hu et al 2021 ma et al 2021 this study proposes a hybrid deep learning approach for downstream water level prediction in a multi timescale step hydropower plant first to improve the model s accuracy in capturing data features and its performance in eliminating hydrological data noise a variable semisoft threshold function embedded into a drsn model is adopted to improve the model s accuracy in identifying features of water level influencing factors subsequently a prediction error correction mechanism is proposed and embedded into lstm and a gru so that the model can adjust the weights of each water level influence data according to previous water level prediction errors meanwhile the lstm and gru are set up with a weighting module to improve the prediction efficiency while ensuring the accuracy of the final prediction results in this process because of the problems of an lstm model with too many parameters and training difficulties optimizing the parameters of the lstm using the aoa is proposed to improve the lstm performance finally the hybrid model proposed in this study is used for multi timescale water level prediction of the xiangjiaba hydropower station the influence of dynamic changes of downstream tributaries on water level prediction is explored and the influence of the topping of larger tributaries on the water level prediction based on deep learning is revealed in addition the new model proposed in this study is compared with existing water level prediction models to verify its superiority the new model will provide more technical support in basin flood forecasting and urban flood forecasting with its high precision efficiency and scalability the structure of this paper is as follows part ii provides an overview of the method and innovative improvements of the model the flow and parameter settings of the model are provided in parts iii and iv respectively the experimental results and discussion are in part v and the conclusion is in part vi 2 methodologies 2 1 study area the xiluodu xiangjiaba cascade hydropower station is the last cascade hydropower station in the lower reaches of the jinsha river which undertakes the critical burden of flood control in the yangtze river basin these two hydropower stations and the three gorges gezhouba dam cooperate to provide an essential guarantee for flood control in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin the xiluodu hydropower station is located at the confluence of sichuan province and yunnan province the project is mainly for power generation with comprehensive benefits such as flood control sand control and improvement of the ecological environment and navigation conditions in the reservoir area and downstream rivers and provides step compensation for downstream hydropower stations the total installed capacity of the xiluodu hydropower station is 13 86 million kilowatts which is only lower than the three gorges hydropower station and brazil itaipu hydropower station the normal water level of the hydropower station is 600 m and the flood level drops to 560 m with a dead level of 540 m under normal conditions the total reservoir capacity reaches 12 67 billion m3 of which 4 6 billion m3 is the flood control capacity the xiangjiaba hydropower station is located on the downstream section of the jinsha river at the border of yunnan province and sichuan province and is the last level of hydropower stations in the jinsha river hydropower base it is the third largest hydropower station in china and the fifth largest in the world the upstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station is 157 km away from the xiluodu hydropower station dam site and the hydropower station controls a watershed area of 458 800 square kilometers the standard reservoir storage level is 380 m the flood level is 370 m the total reservoir capacity is 5 163 billion m3 the regulating reservoir capacity is 900 million m3 the installed capacity of the power station is 7 75 million kilowatts and the return length is 156 6 km the hydropower station also has irrigation functions and is the only hydropower station on the jinsha river hydropower base to build a boat hoist the hengjiang river joins 1 9 km downstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station and the minjiang river joins 28 km downstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station the hengjiang river and minjiang river have backwater jacking on the water level downstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station which makes the relationship between the water level and flow at the cross section complicated and increases the difficulty of water level forecasting downstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station which brings challenges to the optimal scheduling of hydropower station navigation power generation and water discharge 2 2 deep residual shrinkage network a deep residual shrinkage network is similar to a deep residual network and includes a convolutional layer activation function rectified linear unit activation function relu batch normalization bn for canonical processing and cross entropy error function the general structure of a developed drsn contains a continuous wave a large number of distinguishable wavelet packets are superimposed to learn distinguishable features by various nonlinear transformations and a soft threshold is used as a systolic function to eliminate the information associated with noise a drsn also draws on the advantages of wavelet neural networks to improve recognition accuracy ma et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 compared with a fully connected layer a convolution layer uses convolution instead of matrix multiplication effectively reducing the number of training parameters and avoiding overfitting at the same time because there are fewer parameters in a convolution kernel it is easier for the model to obtain higher training accuracy zhao et al 2018 the formula is as follows 1 a j i m j b i o ij c j where b i represents the i th channel of the input feature o represents the convolutional kernel c represents the bias a j represents the j th channel of the output feature and m j represents the output feature channels zhao et al 2018 after convolving the input feature and the convolution kernel the bias term is added and a complete feature map is obtained by repeating the steps above in zhao et al 2020 the feature map is a three dimensional 3d tensor in this study the data form of the water level influence factor is one dimensional and these data will be constructed into a three dimensional data distribution so that it has a similar structure to a feature map and it is convenient for the model to extract features repeatedly multiple convolutional kernels in each convolutional layer slide over the feature map to output a feature map with multiple feature channels the water level influence factors are all one dimensional data based on time series so the height of the feature map is 1 this study convolves various water level influencing factors into the feature map and each factor corresponds to a feature channel the new data structure will be introduced in the second part bn is added before the activation function the activation function is normalized to the same mean and variance through bn the initially reduced activation scale is enlarged which solves the effect of offset and increase in input data and the internal covariance shift is reduced ioffe and szegedy 2015 ma et al 2021 bn assists the parameter update in the convolutional layer to adapt to feature changes brought about by continuously input data the bn process is as follows 2 x n x n 1 n batch n 1 n batch x n σ 2 1 n batch n 1 n batch x n u 2 ε 3 y n γ x n ζ where x n and y n represent the features of the input and output data on a small scale respectively ε is a constant and γ and ζ represent the scaling distribution parameters that can be trained a relu activation function can effectively prevent the gradient from vanishing ensuring that the feature range does not change during its transfer between layers a relu activation function is as follows 4 y m a x x 0 where x represents the input of the activation function and y represents the output of the activation function goodfellow et al 2016 the output result is the maximum value between x and 0 the softmax function can place the feature s output between 0 and 1 it is used to calculate the cross entropy error using the cross entropy error can prevent the gradient from being zero and improve the overall efficiency of the model the expression of the softmax function is as follows 5 s o f t m a x z i e z i m 1 m e z m where z i represents the output value of the i th node and m is the number of output nodes a global average pooling layer gap is located in front of the fully connected output layer it is an operation to calculate the average value of each feature channel its function is to extract the main features reduce the number of weights lin et al 2014 zhao et al 2020 simplify the complexity of the model prevent the model from overfitting and make the model have an anti interference ability a residual shrinkage unit is an essential component of the network it introduces the soft threshold function into the path of the layer to layer link and uses an attention mechanism to automatically determine a threshold to achieve the effect of automatically extracting important features soft thresholding is a common method for denoising and enhancing feature accuracy donoho 1995 it makes a cnn automatically perform filter learning map the original data to high dimensional or low dimensional and then perform soft thresholding soft thresholding sets the features in the threshold interval λ λ to 0 or 1 so that the features x farther from 0 or 1 shrink toward 0 or 1 ma et al 2021 the soft thresholding function is as follows 6 z x λ x λ 0 λ x λ x λ x λ where x is the input feature z is the output feature and λ is the positive parameter thresholding λ is a parameter automatically learned by the network so the soft threshold can set a feature of any interval to 0 or 1 so that the feature of a certain value range can be flexibly deleted and the nonlinear mapping can be better expressed at the same time designing a filter for processing data requires much professional knowledge but the soft threshold function does not need to consider these issues it also avoids the problem that the accuracy is affected by setting artificial filters by relying on expert experience embedding soft thresholds in deep learning to improve the progress of feature recognition will have a wide range of application prospects in hydrological prediction the attention mechanism of the subchannel threshold is the essential core of the network the thresholds of the feature channels are set by the subchannel threshold structure a feature m is turned into a one dimensional vector after being processed by the absolute value and gap the purpose of an attention mechanism captures the part that should be considered in the corresponding background from a large amount of information and extract valuable features reduce the weight of useless features or delete the features of useless information different information has different influence weights in a sample on the final goal and the weight is dynamically changing for example in short term water level forecasting the evaporation weight is negligible in flood level forecasting the weight of the rainfall and the inflow of the reservoir area will increase the convolutional feature map will undergo absolute value and global averaging processing to generate a one dimensional vector then it will be passed to the fully connected layer where the number of neurons in the fully connected layer is equal to the number of input feature map channels the output value will be scaled to 0 1 using the following formula hu et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 7 a c 1 1 e z c where z c is the c th feature of the output neuron and a c is the c th scale parameter the corresponding thresholds are determined by 8 λ c a c a v e r a g e x i j c where λ is the thresholding of the c th channel i is the width of feature m j is the height of feature m and c is the number of channels of feature m the partial modules and overall structure of the subchannel threshold drsn are shown in fig 1 in the convolution process shown in fig 1 b u v and w represent the number of channels width and height of the feature map respectively the module on the right side in fig 1 a is the residual module which aims to learn and identify the sample features and determine the threshold values in this module a high dimensional vector will be compressed into one dimension which is actually a one dimensional vector of the absolute value of the feature map a factor α eventually a number of convolutional layers i e the base module are superimposed to form a complete deep residual systolic network hu et al 2021 2 3 long short term memory lstm can keep better memory than an rnn of long timespan time series by particular neurons lstm retains the cyclic feedback structure while adding forget gates input gates and output gates the gating unit structure

when the amount of data is less and the degree of complexity is lower the feature of this network is that the three gating units in an lstm network are replaced by update and reset gates an update gate determines the degree of retention of the state information at the last moment and a reset gate controls the degree of combination of the state information at the last moment and the state information at the current moment to obtain fast prediction results during short time floods this study introduces a more efficient gru network for water level prediction kisvari and lin 2021 the

tangent function and represents the dot product 2 5 model optimization 2 5 1 deep residual shrinkage network with an adjustable semisoft threshold the soft thresholding function in the network will have a constant bias when setting the threshold value which affects the accuracy of network feature extraction and leads to errors in water level classification therefore this study adopts a newly constructed adjustable semisoft thresholding function to replace the original soft thresholding function the newly constructed function has better continuity deviation and smoothness than the original function the specific proof process is shown in another study by this project team the adjustable semisoft thresholding function is as follows 19 y 0 x λ ν s g n x x sin x λ x λ λ 1 ν x x λ where ν e x λ λ n the new function will determine the threshold value for each feature channel further enhancing the distinction between normal and flood water levels 2 5 2 self correcting mechanism for errors errors are inevitable when using a gru and lstm for water level prediction and the prediction accuracy will be further improved if the model can be adjusted according to the evaluation results of the previous prediction therefore this study proposes an error loss correction mechanism and embeds it into the gru and lstm models x y is a sample of the state of the water level prediction the smaller the error between the predicted water level and the observed water level the higher the forecast accuracy and the lower the cross entropy loss the cross entropy evaluation function is as follows zhou et al 2019 20 l t 1 n x y d n y log o x 1 y log 1 o x where x xa xb xc xm is the prediction sequence which represents the input feature vector d is a training set of size n y 0 1 represents whether the prediction is accurate which is the state label of the predicted result and o x is the predicted value of the output fluctuations in the water level influence factor at a given moment will lead to successive changes in the water level therefore this study proposes error loss using b t 1 to supervise the feature extraction and transfer of h t at the last moment at the next moment the observed water level instance is taken as a positive sample and a negative sample is introduced a negative sample is the observed water level instance at a previous moment and there is an error between the observed water level negative sample and the predicted water level if the predicted water level at the last moment is equal to the observed water level at the last moment the error is 0 if the predicted water level at the last moment is not equal to the observed water level at the last moment negative sample the error will be used as an evaluation index to correct the model then the error loss correction function is as follows 21 l a 1 n i 1 n t log ϑ h t i f r i t 1 log 1 ϑ h t i f r i t 1 where ϑ is the sigmoid activation function and h t i represents the tth hidden state for the ith prediction when the network incorrectly predicts x y as the water level s the loss weight value ξ i s is as follows 22 ξ i s e 1 q i s e 1 q i s s y i 1 e 1 q i s e 1 q i s s 1 2 3 s a n d s y i where q i s represents the probability that the sample is judged to be the water level s the overall loss of the prediction model is 23 l total ξ i ξ i l t ω l a ξ i s where ω is a hyperparameter that balances the model s predicted trend and the observed water level with the help of the error self correction function each hidden layer can adjust the network itself according to the prediction error and the captured features at the last moment so that the prediction accuracy can better match the information conveyed by the dynamic changes of the data the structure of the gru lstm with an error loss correction function is shown in fig 4 overall the introduction of the error self correction function enables the hidden layer to inherit and express features better so the model can be adjusted to the subsequent output with more prediction errors and data features 2 5 3 output weight module to reduce the error in the final prediction results of the combined model an adaptive weight module is constructed in this study when the lstm network and gru network obtain the corresponding predicted water level separately a dense layer is added to the output port to add weights to the output values of the two models and an add layer is used to integrate the water level values with the weight parameters to obtain the final water level prediction values the steps of the weight module are as follows 24 y il α y i 25 y g β y j 26 y f α y i β y j where α and β are the weight parameters of the combined prediction model the optimal values of the parameters are obtained during the model training process and the optimization formula is as follows 27 y loss 1 n i 1 n y t y f where y loss is the water level prediction error of the combined model and y t and y f are the observed water level and the predicted water level at time t respectively 2 5 4 optimization strategy for lstm the choice of hyperparameters of an lstm network affects the final prediction accuracy and efficiency and its time based inverse transfer algorithm is prone to gradient disappearance and gradient explosion in the derivation process therefore in this study the archimedes algorithm is used to optimize the selection of the parameters and the iteration of weights is transformed into the optimal solution hashim et al 2021 the aoa a new metaheuristic can randomly open a search for an initial population of candidate solutions and each object will be initialized at the random position after evaluating the fitness of the initial population the aoa starts iterating until the termination condition is satisfied in each iteration the aoa updates candidate solutions for each object and each object s features are updated according to its collision with any other neighboring objects the aoa has outstanding performance in balancing local and global search ability and can effectively solve complex problems with multi objective constraints with outstanding convergence speed in the model debugging phase the lstm error is used as the fitness function and a gaussian random wandering strategy is used to jump out of an algorithm stall if there is no change for five consecutive iterations ma et al 2021 the gaussian random wandering strategy model is as follows 28 g t 1 g a u s s i a n x t v 1 29 ψ 1 cos π h t 2 h t max h x t x r t where x r t is the best individual in the population and cos π t 2 t max is used to adjust the step size of the gaussian walk to avoid a directed optimization algorithm that leads to a reduction of the updating speed of weights data sharing can be used i e the second prediction result is set as the initial object position of the aoa to reduce the algorithm search time the optimization strategy for lstm is shown in fig 5 3 proposed hybrid rdrsn lstm gru model 3 1 screening and reconstruction of input data data such as water level flow rainfall evaporation and power station output are independent time series the downstream water level of a hydropower station is related to the upstream and downstream water levels and the flow downstream of the station in the case of a flood flood related influences are also considered for example lope altitude plan curvature profile curvature and geology bui et al 2018 tien bui et al 2018 khosravi er al 2020 however among the water level flood influence factors above the influence weight of some factors on water level will change significantly with time which is the difficulty of water level change sensitivity analysis at this stage fang et al 2020 the research object of this study is a large cascade hydropower station and the change in the upstream water levels and downstream water levels can be indirectly reflected in addition in this study it is found that two tributaries converge downstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station when the converging flow of the tributaries is higher it has a backwater jacking effect on the water level downstream of the hydropower station therefore the flows of the two tributaries downstream of the hydropower plant are included in the input data at this stage influenced by energy allocation large hydropower plants take on the task of load supply peak and frequency regulation therefore changes in power plant output at different time scales also affect downstream water levels in summary the downstream post site water level of the upstream hydropower plant the presite water level of the target hydropower plant at the last moment the post site downstream water level of the target hydropower plant at a previous moment the total output of the target hydropower plant at the last moment and the flow of the downstream tributary at the last moment are used as inputs to the model the scheduling operation of the power station will largely affect the water level variation therefore in this study the input data are selected as those related to the operation of the power station the above monitoring data avoid the problem that the whole model error is magnified due to calculation error the study of other types of water level influencing factors as input data will be continued in subsequent work the input data to the new model are shown in table 1 to ensure that the features of these data are adequately captured these input factors are constructed in the form of a three dimensional data distribution to form new time series data the y axis direction indicates the inlet flow to the xiangjiaba hydropower station at the corresponding time the newly composed vector has a structure similar to a feature map including length width and feature channels and facilitates the extraction of data features by the convolutional layer the structure of the input data is shown in fig 6 3 2 proposed model implementation the hybrid prediction structure proposed in this study is shown in fig 7 the rdrsn part performs feature extraction and data denoising and the lstm and gru perform water level prediction since a gru network is faster than lstm it has higher accuracy in making short term predictions therefore the model only provides the output of the gru when the hydropower plant faces a high flood and the prediction duration is minute to hour in the case of nonhigh floods general conditions the gru and lstm perform water level prediction separately and the adaptive module adjusts the outputs of both models to obtain the final water level the specific application is as follows assuming that the current time is t the model uses the first n δ t steps where δ t is the sampling interval of the water level data these values are set according to the prediction step the prediction window is filled using the data from the first t n δ t to t moments next the data are input into the rdrsn model for data feature extraction and the high dimensional water level data processed by the rdrsn are input into the optimized gru and lstm networks it should be noted that when the discharge flow of the xiangjiaba hydropower station is greater than 12 000 m3 s the output of the lstm is set to 0 and only the output of the gru is used as the final water level the reason is that when the flow rate exceeds 12 000 m3 s several large terraced hydropower plants along the yangtze river basin will be dispatched for joint flood control at this time the requirement for the timeliness of water level prediction is increased moreover the gru is better than lstm in terms of timeliness therefore to obtain the water level faster only the water level output from the optimized gru network is extracted in this case if the discharge flow of the xiangjiaba hydropower station is less than 12 000 m3 s the output of the two prediction models will be weighted and then the final water level can be output during the prediction process the model s error loss correction mechanism evaluates the predicted water level and observed water levels and continuously adjusts the error threshold to ensure that the model can obtain better prediction accuracy in summary the schedulers of hydropower stations have ample time to take scheduling measures based on the predicted water levels 4 parameter setting and evaluation index the settings of the parameters in the model will impact the final prediction accuracy the feature extraction accuracy of the rdrsn increases with the number of network layers and the number of iterations but too many layers lead to an increase in model complexity in addition the improvement of model accuracy is not significant when using resnet 50 compared to using resnet 34 he et al 2016 therefore the structure of the rdrsn in this study adopts a structure based on resnet 34 and the training rate varies according to the time series which is set to 0 01 for the first 50 epochs and 0 001 for the subsequent 50 epochs when the number of lstm layers is between 8 and 10 the prediction accuracy and efficiency of the network achieve optimal results when the number of layers of the network increases ma et al 2021 the improvement of the prediction accuracy decreases significantly and tends to be flat combining the prediction accuracy and efficiency of the model the number of lstm layers is set to 10 the number of neurons is set to 16 and the learning rate is set to 0 01 similarly to ensure that the gru can obtain the best performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency kisvari 2021 the number of layers of the gru network is set to 10 the number of neurons is set to 16 and the learning rate is set to 0 001 the experimental data were obtained from the xiangjiaba hydropower station the xiluodu hydropower station and relevant hydrological and meteorological departments in the basin and the data ranged from june 2014 to september 2020 in this study sample data were used to train each network separately and the data set was divided into training and testing sets tenfold cross validation was used to ensure that each set of data could be trained to improve the generalization ability of the model tensorflow and keras were used in python to build the network models because of their advantages of modularity and enabling the combination and superposition of models and the experimental operating environment was a computer equipped with an i7 9750 cpu the model evaluation uses the statistical metrics of the correlation coefficient r root mean squared error

5 results and discussion 5 1 analysis of the prediction results of the model in this study the newly proposed hybrid model is used to predict the downstream water level of the xiangjiaba hydropower station to verify the reliability of the model at different time scales water level predictions were made for hour day week month and quarter year scales for the hour day scale the first 24 h of data were used for training to predict the water level for the next 1 h and the water level s sampling frequency was 1 h time for the week month scale the first seven days of data were used to predict the water level of the next day and the water level data were sampled at a frequency of 8 h time for the quarter year scale the water level data of the first 12 months were used to predict the water level of the next month and the water level data were sampled at a frequency of 10 days time distributed in the first middle and second half of each month figs 8 10 show the predicted water level values versus the observed values for the short medium and long term respectively the evaluation of the prediction results of the new model is given in table 2 according to the results of the experiments the new model proposed in this study achieves high accuracy in water level prediction at different time scales the maximum error of the short term water level of the new model is 0 082 m and a small amount of error over 0 13 m occurs in the short and medium term step size of an hour to a day predictions the maximum rmse of the short term prediction is 0 028 m and the maximum error of the medium term prediction is 0 163 m when the annual scale water level prediction is performed the rmse increases significantly reaching a maximum of 0 112 m analysis of the hydrological and meteorological data at the error points reveals that the large errors in the short term and medium term prediction processes are primarily due to extreme weather conditions such as heavy rainfall or flooding in the upper and lower reaches and a clear time lag characterizes the situation in addition the increased flow of the main and tributary streams in the basin and the backwater jacking of the min and heng rivers increase the error of water level prediction the large fluctuation of the water level due to measures such as peak regulation in hydropower stations is also one of the factors triggering the error however the above errors are within the acceptable range and will be reduced when the data sampling frequency is increased and the prediction step is reduced at this stage the above results demonstrate that the model proposed in this study can achieve better results in short and medium term water level prediction the error at the annual scale is related mainly to the data sampling frequency because this study uses three sets of data per month to predict the water level at the annual scale the data span is large so the data itself cannot fully reflect the characteristics of water level changes under the full time series thus affecting the feature capture effect of the model for example extreme weather in different seasons will cause water level fluctuations in the future and the data sampling interval may cause the water level changes in this time period to be ignored resulting in errors between the predicted water level and the observed water level in addition several large cascade hydropower stations in the upper reaches of the yangtze river basin are gradually put into operation which will have a more complex impact on the water level and flow of xiangjiaba hydropower station at the same time the power generation plan of large hydropower plants will influence the water level change due to the vigorous promotion of low carbon energy and the increase in energy demand in contrast the two factors of energy demand and the proportion of low carbon energy are influenced by human production and life which have apparent subjectivity and this will bring more uncertainty to long term water level prediction therefore it is considered that when predicting the water level of large hydropower plants on an annual scale or in the longer term the prediction results are mainly for the reference of the relevant authorities while ensuring the accuracy of the medium term and short term water level prediction will provide more valuable results for the actual operation of hydropower plants analysis of the operational data of the xiangjiaba hydropower station shows that when the water coming from upstream is large and the flow of the minjiang and hengjiang rivers downstream changes significantly the effect of the water level downstream is affected by backwater jacking when the flow rate of the hengjiang river is lower than 260 m3 s the impact of the hengjiang river on the downstream water level of the xiangjiaba hydropower station is negative when the flow rate of hengjiang river reaches more than 300 m3 s the influence of the hengjiang river inflow on the downstream water level of the xiangjiaba hydropower station is positive with the increase in the hengjiang river inflow the influence of its support gradually increases when the flow of the minjiang river is lower than 4700 m3 s the influence of the minjiang river on the downstream water level is mostly negative when the flow of the minjiang river reaches more than 5000 m3 s the inflowing water from the minjiang river begins to have a noticeable positive supporting effect on the xiangjiaba hydropower station with the increase in the inflowing water from the minjiang river the supporting effect also increases gradually according to the conclusion above when the flow rate of the hengjiang river is greater than 300 m3 s the inflow of the hengjiang river begins to have a supporting impact on the xiangjiaba hydropower station for every 100 m3 s increase in the flow of the hengjiang river the average variation in the top support water level is 0 06 m when the flow of the minjiang river is greater than 5000 m3 s the inflow of the minjiang river begins to have a supporting effect on the xiangjiaba hydropower station with every 1000 m3 s increase in the flow of the minjiang river the average variation in the top support water level is 0 05 m figs 11 and 12 show scatter plots of the downstream water level and flow of the xiangjiaba hydropower station without and with jacking respectively compared with other water level prediction research the impact of the jacking action of the downstream tributaries on the water level cannot be ignored in this study to verify that the addition of downstream tributary flows to the input data is significant in improving the prediction accuracy in this study the flows of the two downstream tributaries were removed from the input data then they were input into the proposed model for prediction and the results were compared with the new model using the complete input data fig 13 shows the short term water level predictions in both cases after the flow of the downstream tributaries is removed from the input data the error of the water level prediction is higher than that of the method proposed in this study and the maximum error reaches 0 09 m this result is more apparent when there is a flood in the basin when the flow of both downstream tributaries increases and this result is consistent with the actual situation therefore the method proposed in this study incorporates the flow of downstream tributaries into the input data which effectively improves the accuracy of water level prediction this helps the operators of the hydropower stations take timely and effective measures especially in the face of flooding and shipping dispatch this result also reminds us that when using artificial intelligence for water level prediction the flow changes of downstream tributaries play an important role taking this into account can significantly improve the prediction accuracy and provide meaningful technical support for water resource scheduling 5 2 comparison of the prediction results of the model in this study an svr cnn lstm rf bp mlp and traditional hydrodynamic models were used to predict the downstream water level of the xiangjiaba hydropower station on multiple time scales and the results are compared with the proposed method the adjustment factor of the svr model is set to 5 the radial kernel function is selected and the error is set to 0 05 the number of decision trees in the rf is set to 100 the maximum depth of a tree is set to 10 the minimum number of samples inside each node is set to 2 the maximum number of features in each group is 3 the minimum number of samples per leaf in each split and the maximum number of features is set to 2 in the cnn lstm model the size of the convolution kernel is set to 3 and the sigmoid activation function is adopted to output one dimensional water level data in the lstm network the learning rate is set to 0 001 the batch size is set to 32 the activation function is set to relu and the number of iterations is set to 100 the number of layers of the bp neural network is 3 the activation function is tanh and the number of hidden neurons is set to 10 the mlp model activation function is relu and the training method adopts adam to adaptively adjust the learning rate the hydrodynamic model adopts the water level of the xiangjiaba hydropower station and the terrain boundary adopts the mainstream of the yangtze river hengjiang river and minjiang river according to the results in table 3 table 4 and table 5 the model proposed in this study is superior to the other models in all indicators for short term water level prediction both the proposed model r 0 998 rmse 0 019 m mae 0 023 m nse 0 995 and the cnn lstm model r 0 995 rmse 0 038 m mae 0 035 m nse 0 982 have outstanding performance but the new model has smaller error and faster computational efficiency which is critical in the face of floods meanwhile the hydrodynamic model r 0 991 rmse 0 047 m mae 0 040 m nse 0 988 and bp model r 0 988 rmse 0 053 m mae 0 048 m nse 0 982 for short term water level prediction also achieved better results but the hydrodynamic method is time consuming and the method may not be able to provide timely reference results in the case of unexpected situations following the rf rmse 0 055 m mae 0 051 m nse 0 981 r 0 985 and svr models rmse 0 082 m mae 0 078 m nse 0 955 r 0 964 the short term water level prediction errors are significantly higher than those of the proposed method however their operation time is better than that of the hydrodynamic model and the prediction errors of these two models do not meet the operational requirements of the power station when considering that the xiangjiaba hydropower station is required to undertake many duties such as flood control and shipping during the flood season the worst prediction effect is the mlp model rmse 0 096 m mae 0 093 m nse 0 934 r 0 941 whose maximum error reaches 0 31 m and the performance on each index is also the worst when making medium term water level forecasts the forecast errors of all models increased with increasing forecast step size and the uncertain influence of more hydrological and meteorological factors however the model proposed in this study still maintains the optimal forecasting effect compared with short term forecasting the new model has the smallest fluctuation of medium term forecasting error and all indicators are optimal rmse 0 052 m mae 0 044 m nse 0 981 r 0 984 max error 0 14 m which proves that the proposed model has good stability and adaptability in terms of medium and short term water level prediction the good prediction accuracy of this model can effectively predict flood events which helps hydropower plants take emergency disposal measures in advance to reduce social losses at the same time the lower error provides valuable reference data for shipping which is conducive to improving economic efficiency when the forecast step length increased to the quarter year scale the data showed that the error of each model fluctuated significantly and the increase in time lag and various uncertain factors made long term water level forecasting difficult however the proposed new model still maintains an optimal forecasting effect and the result can provide a valuable data reference for formulating a load plan for the next time period year quarter the worst accuracy was achieved by the mlp model the performances of the svr and rf models are not satisfactory and there is instability in their prediction results in this study the data interval used in the annual scale water level prediction is relatively large which affects the accuracy of water level prediction although increasing the sampling frequency will help improve the prediction accuracy of each model the increase in the amount of data will lead to a decrease in the computational efficiency of the models therefore future research will continue to improve the prediction efficiency of the proposed model on an annual scale according to the data in tables 6 and the water level prediction figs 14 16 the water level prediction made by the proposed model is closer to the actual water level for each time scale which also verifies that the feature extraction mechanism and denoising mechanism in the model help deep learning achieve higher accuracy in water level prediction compared with the other models the proposed model can effectively reduce the bias caused by the time lag and has more robust prediction accuracy for the highest and lowest water levels the taylor plots in figs 17 19 show the relationship between each model s predicted and actual values at different prediction steps the new model proposed in this study exhibits the best correlation and the lowest standard deviation at all time ranges the performance of the cnn model is also excellent the results above indicate that the hybrid model can achieve better water level predictions than a single model the performances of the bp rf and hydrodynamic models are close and the worst is the mlp model which has the worst correlation and standard deviation these graphs show that the hybrid forecasting model proposed in this study improves the performance of existing models when water level forecasting is performed on a quarter year basis each model s performance decreases due to the larger period time this is because the weight of other factors nonweather and hydrological factors such as energy demand on the water level variation at the hydropower plant increases over a longer period time when the range of prediction time is small step size of hours days each model s prediction accuracy is higher which is consistent with the conclusion of barzegar et al 2017 barzegar et al 2020 in addition according to the results shown in figs 20 22 it can be seen that the proposed model has the lowest prediction dispersion and the scatter points are all distributed around the y x line especially for the short and medium term water level prediction which require higher accuracy however models such as the mlp have too many 0 estimates and a greater degree of bias between the low and high values of the predicted values compared to the observed values both the new and the cnn lstm models obtain better prediction results and their convergence of predicted values to the observed values is ideal during this research it was found that for the low frequency water level change conditions the model error has an increasing trend which is also related to the characteristics of a deep learning model itself however the model s attention mechanism and error correction mechanism evaluate the water level fluctuation caused by such low frequency events and realize self correction and improvement of the model accuracy the above results show that the water level prediction model proposed in this study has good application prospects the model can adaptively adjust the weight of each input quantity in the water level prediction process according to the error of the prediction result to ensure that the model captures the dynamic changes in water level after obtaining time series data the traditional lstm can effectively realize the prediction based on time series and couple the drsn with feature extraction ability to ensure that the features of water level influence factors can be included in the prediction so the final result is closer to the actual observed water level to meet the needs of flood control this study also adopts a rare classification prediction technique to adjust the model operation process and ensure that the model can provide fast and accurate prediction results in the event of flood hazards the new model can effectively avoid the occurrence of overfitting and gradient disappearance 5 3 applications to verify the effect of the newly proposed model under actual working conditions this study uses the new model to predict the water level downstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station in real time and the water level prediction standard needs to meet shipping demand according to relevant regulations when the xiluodu hydropower station and xiangjiaba hydropower station are in the cascade daily peak shaving operation during the flood season the minimum power generation flow of the xiluodu hydropower station is 435 m3 s the xiangjiaba hydropower station must undertake the function of back regulation and ensure that the minimum shipping base flow downstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station is 1200 m3 s at this time the highest navigable downstream water level at the xiangjiaba hydropower station is 277 25 m the lowest navigable water level is 265 80 m and the ship lift operates 22 h a day flood discharge will cause apparent water level fluctuations near the ship lock the wave at the end of the mouth is the strongest and the wave height is the largest the maximum wave height is concentrated between 0 85 m and 0 72 m and the highest wave height in the pilotage channel is concentrated between 0 32 m and 0 53 m therefore the downstream water level is taken from a radar water level gauge 300 m away from the downstream channel gate which minimizes the influence of waves on water level changes at the same time the difference in the design water level of the cabin is 0 1 m if the ideal error of the prediction model is kept at or below 0 1 m it will provide positive technical guidance for the operation of the power station fig 23 shows a comparison between the model s prediction and the observed value of the water level downstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station on september 20 2020 according to the results above although affected by the upstream flood discharge and backwater jacking of the downstream tributaries during the flood season the water level prediction model proposed in this study shows a good effect on the water level prediction of the downstream navigation requirements of the xiangjiaba hydropower station and the maximum water level error is 0 08 m which meets the requirements of power station operation and the shipping water level this result further proves that the rdrsn lstm gru water level prediction model proposed in this study can effectively capture the characteristics of water level changes during power station operation and provide complete accurate predictions 6 conclusions to accurately predict the downstream water level of the xiangjiaba hydropower station and realize the optimal allocation of water resources this study proposes a new hybrid model for water level prediction on multiple time scales the main contributions of this study are as follows an rdrsn is proposed to capture the features of water level influencing factors and the dynamic characteristics of water level changes the flow of downstream tributaries is introduced into the input data and combined with other water level influencing factors to form a high dimensional feature vector based on time series a variable threshold function is introduced into the network to improve the feature recognition accuracy and eliminate data noise effectively the rdrsn works with this form of input data effectively improving the accuracy and efficiency of the model for feature capture making the model more scalable from the data level compared to designing filters the new network is more convenient and intelligent experimental results verify that the proposed method can effectively reduce the prediction error caused by the backwater jacking of downstream tributaries an error correction mechanism embedded in the gru lstm network ensures that the model can correct its errors according to each prediction result an lstm network optimized by the aoa has higher accuracy and efficiency while avoiding overfitting in long term series a weighting module at the output side effectively improves the prediction accuracy of the model at each time scale range and avoids excessive errors due to the episodic factors of a single model in addition this study initially tried water level prediction based on flow classification combined with the actual working conditions and the high efficiency of a gru network to realize the rapid prediction of the model in the face of sudden floods the experimental results show that the new model is superior to existing models for water level prediction at all time scales it can make up for the shortcomings of a single model in water level prediction and the scalability of the new model makes it have good adaptability in the field of hydrology at the same time when the downstream tributary flow is large the flow will occupy a higher influence weight in water level prediction in subsequent water level prediction paying attention to the important downstream tributaries can improve the prediction accuracy in addition in the water level prediction of cascade hydropower stations energy demand will become an essential factor affecting water level changes funding this work was supported by the national key research and development program of china grant award number

2277,the operating conditions of large cascade hydropower stations are complex improving the water level prediction accuracy of large cascade hydropower stations is significant for flood control shipping irrigation etc a new hybrid model based on a refined deep residual shrinkage network and an optimized gated recurrent unit long term memory network gru lstm model is proposed for water level prediction at different time scales first to make the input data in the form of a feature map so the model can capture the weight characteristics of each influencing factor when the water level changes the water level flow rate and hydroelectric power plant output data are constructed as high dimensional feature inputs to reduce the prediction error caused by downstream tributary backwater jacking downstream tributary flow is added to the input data at the same time a semisoft threshold function with an adjustable function is inserted into the model to improve feature recognition accuracy reduce deviation and eliminate the noise of the original hydrological data second an error weight correction function is used to adjust the error between the predicted water level and the observed water level so that the model can automatically adjust the weights of each influencing factor according to the evaluation results of water level prediction in this process the parameters of lstm are optimized using the archimedes optimization algorithm and the output results of the lstm and gru networks are weighted to obtain a more accurate water level prediction the proposed model achieves good accuracy and efficiency in downstream water level prediction of the xiangjiaba hydropower station outperforms existing hydrodynamic and artificial intelligence methods and has robust scalability in flood forecasting and urban rainwater forecasting keywords refined deep residual shrinkage network gated recurrent unit long term memory network water level prediction backwater jacking multiple time scales abbreviations rdrsn refined deep residual shrinkage network drsn deep residual shrinkage network gru gated recurrent unit aoa archimedes optimization algorithm 1 introduction the yangtze river basin is rich in hydropower resources to enhance the comprehensive benefits of the yangtze river basin and reduce the threat of flooding in the basin several large scale cascade hydropower stations have been built and put into operation along the yangtze river these hydropower stations are responsible for essential tasks such as power generation shang et al 2019a irrigation zhou et al 2020 navigation ji et al 2018 flood control he et al 2014 and ecological protection ji et al 2018 however there are overlapping and coupling relationships between the upstream and downstream step hydropower stations shrestha and simonovic 2009 and accurately predicting the water level of a downstream hydropower station is a technical problem to achieve optimal utilization of water resources improve efficiency and optimal operation of the hydropower station different from traditional water level prediction for rivers and lakes or single reservoir water level prediction the water levels of cascade hydropower stations influence each other shang et al 2019b in addition to considering weather hydrology and other conditions it is also necessary to explore the impact of interactions between hydropower stations on water level changes at the same time the dispatch operation of an upper level hydropower station will bring more uncertain factors to the water level prediction for a downstream hydropower station which increases the difficulty of water level prediction for the hydropower station at present commonly used water level prediction methods mainly focus on two methods conventional hydrodynamic modeling and machine learning however there are few studies on cascade hydropower station water level prediction among them methods such as the unsteady flow numerical simulations method shao et al 2017 water level flow rate curve query values method shang et al 2019b and standard rating curve method ajmera and goyal 2012 are commonly used to obtain target water levels these methods are simple and convenient but in actual working conditions variations in soil geology weather temperature and other factors will lead to uncertainty in hydrological data under time series conditions moreover conventional numerical hydrodynamic simulation methods have difficulty handling dynamically changing hydrological information resulting in a low accuracy of final water level predictions or failing to reflect dynamic changes in the water level birgand et al 2013 in addition traditional hydrodynamic models lack intelligence and scalability due to the complex relationship between water levels in the yangtze river basin the interaction between the step hydropower plants and the posteriority of water levels compared with traditional physical conceptual models for water level prediction machine learning at this stage has achieved remarkable results in water level dynamics prediction hu et al 2019 mosavi et al 2018 first techniques such as machine learning can adjust their boundary conditions with dynamic changes in the hydrological conditions of a river basin without the need to initialize a large number of original parameters kebede et al 2006 which reduces the workload of hydrological surveys second machine learning can achieve unique predictions by learning the features of previous data which can capture the hydrological characteristics of the corresponding basin and make water level prediction fast and accurate even with a large amount of data currently artificial neural networks anns piasecki et al 2017 recurrent neural networks rnns sattari et al 2012 convolutional neural networks cnns kim and cho 2019 support vector machines svrs tehrany et al 2014 random forest rf models shortridge et al 2016 decision tree methods tehrany et al 2015 and other methods have been tested for water level prediction pham et al 2021 however these models have problems such as insufficient data feature extraction and low computational efficiency and the setting of some parameters relies on expert experience among many machine learning models an rnn can process input sequences of arbitrary time series using its internal memory module which makes it popular in water level prediction research apaydin et al 2020 however an rnn can only memorize part of a sequence when the length of the data sequence increases the prediction accuracy of the model will decrease therefore long short term memory lstm networks were developed for long sequence prediction work fang et al 2020 utilized lstm for flood sensitivity prediction and the results showed that the method was successful in flood prediction however the data in an lstm network can only be transmitted in one direction and cannot be parallelized which makes the model less sensitive to data features and the structure and parameters of the lstm are complex and need to be optimized in terms of timeliness in contrast a gated recurrent unit gru model is simpler and has only two gating units making it more scalable and suitable for building more extensive networks kisvari and lin 2021 in addition to inheriting the advantages of lstm the model also has faster operational efficiency and is suitable for tackling prediction tasks with higher efficiency requirements he and wang 2021 water level data based on time series have the characteristics of seasonality irregularity and dynamic change sattari et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 in this study the downstream water level of the xiangjiaba hydropower station is affected not only by upstream water weather hydropower station scheduling and other factors but also by the backwater jacking of downstream tributaries the complex conditions make it more difficult for traditional physical conceptual models to complete accurate water level predictions and a machine learning model alone cannot accurately capture the characteristics of dynamic changes in water level to ensure that the model can capture the hidden features in the time series data improve the intelligence of the model and make the results more accurate a cnn is often used to extract data features ince et al 2016 wang et al 2020 however a cnn model cannot avoid overfitting falling into local optimal solutions and low computational efficiency therefore zhao et al 2020 proposed deep residual shrinkage networks drsns to improve the feature extraction ability and the subchannel thresholding mechanism of these models can set separate thresholds for multidimensional input data a drsn can obtain a threshold set through iterative learning of the data and the data can be passed forward and backward in the model which effectively improves the model s ability to capture data features in addition noise interference or mapping errors can corrupt the time series of hydrological information and scholars have used methods such as wavelet transformation to remove noise dion et al 2021 designed an ensemble kalman filter hybrid model for water level prediction in canadian lakes barzegar et al 2021 used a maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt to process hydrological data and then used a cnn model to extract features and form a hybrid model with lstm the model achieved remarkable results for long time series of lake level prediction proving the feasibility of a hybrid model in water level prediction but its prediction at different time scales has not been verified additionally the process requires the design of a transformable filter which requires a great deal of signal processing expertise the hydrological data are decomposed and then reconstructed which increases the probability of errors and the workload this challenge can be avoided by embedding soft thresholding into deep learning where soft thresholding in drsns can effectively remove features that interfere with the information in the data or reduce their weights to achieve high precision feature capture the filtering of noisy features can be accomplished by relying on a gradient descent algorithm and soft thresholding mechanism alone hu et al 2021 ma et al 2021 this study proposes a hybrid deep learning approach for downstream water level prediction in a multi timescale step hydropower plant first to improve the model s accuracy in capturing data features and its performance in eliminating hydrological data noise a variable semisoft threshold function embedded into a drsn model is adopted to improve the model s accuracy in identifying features of water level influencing factors subsequently a prediction error correction mechanism is proposed and embedded into lstm and a gru so that the model can adjust the weights of each water level influence data according to previous water level prediction errors meanwhile the lstm and gru are set up with a weighting module to improve the prediction efficiency while ensuring the accuracy of the final prediction results in this process because of the problems of an lstm model with too many parameters and training difficulties optimizing the parameters of the lstm using the aoa is proposed to improve the lstm performance finally the hybrid model proposed in this study is used for multi timescale water level prediction of the xiangjiaba hydropower station the influence of dynamic changes of downstream tributaries on water level prediction is explored and the influence of the topping of larger tributaries on the water level prediction based on deep learning is revealed in addition the new model proposed in this study is compared with existing water level prediction models to verify its superiority the new model will provide more technical support in basin flood forecasting and urban flood forecasting with its high precision efficiency and scalability the structure of this paper is as follows part ii provides an overview of the method and innovative improvements of the model the flow and parameter settings of the model are provided in parts iii and iv respectively the experimental results and discussion are in part v and the conclusion is in part vi 2 methodologies 2 1 study area the xiluodu xiangjiaba cascade hydropower station is the last cascade hydropower station in the lower reaches of the jinsha river which undertakes the critical burden of flood control in the yangtze river basin these two hydropower stations and the three gorges gezhouba dam cooperate to provide an essential guarantee for flood control in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin the xiluodu hydropower station is located at the confluence of sichuan province and yunnan province the project is mainly for power generation with comprehensive benefits such as flood control sand control and improvement of the ecological environment and navigation conditions in the reservoir area and downstream rivers and provides step compensation for downstream hydropower stations the total installed capacity of the xiluodu hydropower station is 13 86 million kilowatts which is only lower than the three gorges hydropower station and brazil itaipu hydropower station the normal water level of the hydropower station is 600 m and the flood level drops to 560 m with a dead level of 540 m under normal conditions the total reservoir capacity reaches 12 67 billion m3 of which 4 6 billion m3 is the flood control capacity the xiangjiaba hydropower station is located on the downstream section of the jinsha river at the border of yunnan province and sichuan province and is the last level of hydropower stations in the jinsha river hydropower base it is the third largest hydropower station in china and the fifth largest in the world the upstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station is 157 km away from the xiluodu hydropower station dam site and the hydropower station controls a watershed area of 458 800 square kilometers the standard reservoir storage level is 380 m the flood level is 370 m the total reservoir capacity is 5 163 billion m3 the regulating reservoir capacity is 900 million m3 the installed capacity of the power station is 7 75 million kilowatts and the return length is 156 6 km the hydropower station also has irrigation functions and is the only hydropower station on the jinsha river hydropower base to build a boat hoist the hengjiang river joins 1 9 km downstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station and the minjiang river joins 28 km downstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station the hengjiang river and minjiang river have backwater jacking on the water level downstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station which makes the relationship between the water level and flow at the cross section complicated and increases the difficulty of water level forecasting downstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station which brings challenges to the optimal scheduling of hydropower station navigation power generation and water discharge 2 2 deep residual shrinkage network a deep residual shrinkage network is similar to a deep residual network and includes a convolutional layer activation function rectified linear unit activation function relu batch normalization bn for canonical processing and cross entropy error function the general structure of a developed drsn contains a continuous wave a large number of distinguishable wavelet packets are superimposed to learn distinguishable features by various nonlinear transformations and a soft threshold is used as a systolic function to eliminate the information associated with noise a drsn also draws on the advantages of wavelet neural networks to improve recognition accuracy ma et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 compared with a fully connected layer a convolution layer uses convolution instead of matrix multiplication effectively reducing the number of training parameters and avoiding overfitting at the same time because there are fewer parameters in a convolution kernel it is easier for the model to obtain higher training accuracy zhao et al 2018 the formula is as follows 1 a j i m j b i o ij c j where b i represents the i th channel of the input feature o represents the convolutional kernel c represents the bias a j represents the j th channel of the output feature and m j represents the output feature channels zhao et al 2018 after convolving the input feature and the convolution kernel the bias term is added and a complete feature map is obtained by repeating the steps above in zhao et al 2020 the feature map is a three dimensional 3d tensor in this study the data form of the water level influence factor is one dimensional and these data will be constructed into a three dimensional data distribution so that it has a similar structure to a feature map and it is convenient for the model to extract features repeatedly multiple convolutional kernels in each convolutional layer slide over the feature map to output a feature map with multiple feature channels the water level influence factors are all one dimensional data based on time series so the height of the feature map is 1 this study convolves various water level influencing factors into the feature map and each factor corresponds to a feature channel the new data structure will be introduced in the second part bn is added before the activation function the activation function is normalized to the same mean and variance through bn the initially reduced activation scale is enlarged which solves the effect of offset and increase in input data and the internal covariance shift is reduced ioffe and szegedy 2015 ma et al 2021 bn assists the parameter update in the convolutional layer to adapt to feature changes brought about by continuously input data the bn process is as follows 2 x n x n 1 n batch n 1 n batch x n σ 2 1 n batch n 1 n batch x n u 2 ε 3 y n γ x n ζ where x n and y n represent the features of the input and output data on a small scale respectively ε is a constant and γ and ζ represent the scaling distribution parameters that can be trained a relu activation function can effectively prevent the gradient from vanishing ensuring that the feature range does not change during its transfer between layers a relu activation function is as follows 4 y m a x x 0 where x represents the input of the activation function and y represents the output of the activation function goodfellow et al 2016 the output result is the maximum value between x and 0 the softmax function can place the feature s output between 0 and 1 it is used to calculate the cross entropy error using the cross entropy error can prevent the gradient from being zero and improve the overall efficiency of the model the expression of the softmax function is as follows 5 s o f t m a x z i e z i m 1 m e z m where z i represents the output value of the i th node and m is the number of output nodes a global average pooling layer gap is located in front of the fully connected output layer it is an operation to calculate the average value of each feature channel its function is to extract the main features reduce the number of weights lin et al 2014 zhao et al 2020 simplify the complexity of the model prevent the model from overfitting and make the model have an anti interference ability a residual shrinkage unit is an essential component of the network it introduces the soft threshold function into the path of the layer to layer link and uses an attention mechanism to automatically determine a threshold to achieve the effect of automatically extracting important features soft thresholding is a common method for denoising and enhancing feature accuracy donoho 1995 it makes a cnn automatically perform filter learning map the original data to high dimensional or low dimensional and then perform soft thresholding soft thresholding sets the features in the threshold interval λ λ to 0 or 1 so that the features x farther from 0 or 1 shrink toward 0 or 1 ma et al 2021 the soft thresholding function is as follows 6 z x λ x λ 0 λ x λ x λ x λ where x is the input feature z is the output feature and λ is the positive parameter thresholding λ is a parameter automatically learned by the network so the soft threshold can set a feature of any interval to 0 or 1 so that the feature of a certain value range can be flexibly deleted and the nonlinear mapping can be better expressed at the same time designing a filter for processing data requires much professional knowledge but the soft threshold function does not need to consider these issues it also avoids the problem that the accuracy is affected by setting artificial filters by relying on expert experience embedding soft thresholds in deep learning to improve the progress of feature recognition will have a wide range of application prospects in hydrological prediction the attention mechanism of the subchannel threshold is the essential core of the network the thresholds of the feature channels are set by the subchannel threshold structure a feature m is turned into a one dimensional vector after being processed by the absolute value and gap the purpose of an attention mechanism captures the part that should be considered in the corresponding background from a large amount of information and extract valuable features reduce the weight of useless features or delete the features of useless information different information has different influence weights in a sample on the final goal and the weight is dynamically changing for example in short term water level forecasting the evaporation weight is negligible in flood level forecasting the weight of the rainfall and the inflow of the reservoir area will increase the convolutional feature map will undergo absolute value and global averaging processing to generate a one dimensional vector then it will be passed to the fully connected layer where the number of neurons in the fully connected layer is equal to the number of input feature map channels the output value will be scaled to 0 1 using the following formula hu et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 7 a c 1 1 e z c where z c is the c th feature of the output neuron and a c is the c th scale parameter the corresponding thresholds are determined by 8 λ c a c a v e r a g e x i j c where λ is the thresholding of the c th channel i is the width of feature m j is the height of feature m and c is the number of channels of feature m the partial modules and overall structure of the subchannel threshold drsn are shown in fig 1 in the convolution process shown in fig 1 b u v and w represent the number of channels width and height of the feature map respectively the module on the right side in fig 1 a is the residual module which aims to learn and identify the sample features and determine the threshold values in this module a high dimensional vector will be compressed into one dimension which is actually a one dimensional vector of the absolute value of the feature map a factor α eventually a number of convolutional layers i e the base module are superimposed to form a complete deep residual systolic network hu et al 2021 2 3 long short term memory lstm can keep better memory than an rnn of long timespan time series by particular neurons lstm retains the cyclic feedback structure while adding forget gates input gates and output gates the gating unit structure

h is the hyperbolic tangent activation function 2 4 gated recurrent unit compared with an lstm model a gru has a more straightforward structure fewer parameters and higher computational efficiency when the amount of data is less and the degree of complexity is lower the feature of this network is that the three gating units in an lstm network are replaced by update and reset gates an update gate determines the degree of retention of the state information at the last moment and a reset gate controls the degree of combination of the state information at the last moment and the state information at the current moment to obtain fast prediction results during short time floods this study introduces a more efficient gru network for water level prediction kisvari and lin 2021 the specific structure of a gru is shown in fig 3 the calculation formula is as follows 15 z t σ w z h t 1 u z x t b z 16 r t σ w r h t 1 u r x t b r 17 h t t a n h w h x t u h r t h t 1 b h 18 h t 1 z t

tangent function and represents the dot product 2 5 model optimization 2 5 1 deep residual shrinkage network with an adjustable semisoft threshold the soft thresholding function in the network will have a constant bias when setting the threshold value which affects the accuracy of network feature extraction and leads to errors in water level classification therefore this study adopts a newly constructed adjustable semisoft thresholding function to replace the original soft thresholding function the newly constructed function has better continuity deviation and smoothness than the original function the specific proof process is shown in another study by this project team the adjustable semisoft thresholding function is as follows 19 y 0 x λ ν s g n x x sin x λ x λ λ 1 ν x x λ where ν e x λ λ n the new function will determine the threshold value for each feature channel further enhancing the distinction between normal and flood water levels 2 5 2 self correcting mechanism for errors errors are inevitable when using a gru and lstm for water level prediction and the prediction accuracy will be further improved if the model can be adjusted according to the evaluation results of the previous prediction therefore this study proposes an error loss correction mechanism and embeds it into the gru and lstm models x y is a sample of the state of the water level prediction the smaller the error between the predicted water level and the observed water level the higher the forecast accuracy and the lower the cross entropy loss the cross entropy evaluation function is as follows zhou et al 2019 20 l t 1 n x y d n y log o x 1 y log 1 o x where x xa xb xc xm is the prediction sequence which represents the input feature vector d is a training set of size n y 0 1 represents whether the prediction is accurate which is the state label of the predicted result and o x is the predicted value of the output fluctuations in the water level influence factor at a given moment will lead to successive changes in the water level therefore this study proposes error loss using b t 1 to supervise the feature extraction and transfer of h t at the last moment at the next moment the observed water level instance is taken as a positive sample and a negative sample is introduced a negative sample is the observed water level instance at a previous moment and there is an error between the observed water level negative sample and the predicted water level if the predicted water level at the last moment is equal to the observed water level at the last moment the error is 0 if the predicted water level at the last moment is not equal to the observed water level at the last moment negative sample the error will be used as an evaluation index to correct the model then the error loss correction function is as follows 21 l a 1 n i 1 n t log ϑ h t i f r i t 1 log 1 ϑ h t i f r i t 1 where ϑ is the sigmoid activation function and h t i represents the tth hidden state for the ith prediction when the network incorrectly predicts x y as the water level s the loss weight value ξ i s is as follows 22 ξ i s e 1 q i s e 1 q i s s y i 1 e 1 q i s e 1 q i s s 1 2 3 s a n d s y i where q i s represents the probability that the sample is judged to be the water level s the overall loss of the prediction model is 23 l total ξ i ξ i l t ω l a ξ i s where ω is a hyperparameter that balances the model s predicted trend and the observed water level with the help of the error self correction function each hidden layer can adjust the network itself according to the prediction error and the captured features at the last moment so that the prediction accuracy can better match the information conveyed by the dynamic changes of the data the structure of the gru lstm with an error loss correction function is shown in fig 4 overall the introduction of the error self correction function enables the hidden layer to inherit and express features better so the model can be adjusted to the subsequent output with more prediction errors and data features 2 5 3 output weight module to reduce the error in the final prediction results of the combined model an adaptive weight module is constructed in this study when the lstm network and gru network obtain the corresponding predicted water level separately a dense layer is added to the output port to add weights to the output values of the two models and an add layer is used to integrate the water level values with the weight parameters to obtain the final water level prediction values the steps of the weight module are as follows 24 y il α y i 25 y g β y j 26 y f α y i β y j where α and β are the weight parameters of the combined prediction model the optimal values of the parameters are obtained during the model training process and the optimization formula is as follows 27 y loss 1 n i 1 n y t y f where y loss is the water level prediction error of the combined model and y t and y f are the observed water level and the predicted water level at time t respectively 2 5 4 optimization strategy for lstm the choice of hyperparameters of an lstm network affects the final prediction accuracy and efficiency and its time based inverse transfer algorithm is prone to gradient disappearance and gradient explosion in the derivation process therefore in this study the archimedes algorithm is used to optimize the selection of the parameters and the iteration of weights is transformed into the optimal solution hashim et al 2021 the aoa a new metaheuristic can randomly open a search for an initial population of candidate solutions and each object will be initialized at the random position after evaluating the fitness of the initial population the aoa starts iterating until the termination condition is satisfied in each iteration the aoa updates candidate solutions for each object and each object s features are updated according to its collision with any other neighboring objects the aoa has outstanding performance in balancing local and global search ability and can effectively solve complex problems with multi objective constraints with outstanding convergence speed in the model debugging phase the lstm error is used as the fitness function and a gaussian random wandering strategy is used to jump out of an algorithm stall if there is no change for five consecutive iterations ma et al 2021 the gaussian random wandering strategy model is as follows 28 g t 1 g a u s s i a n x t v 1 29 ψ 1 cos π h t 2 h t max h x t x r t where x r t is the best individual in the population and cos π t 2 t max is used to adjust the step size of the gaussian walk to avoid a directed optimization algorithm that leads to a reduction of the updating speed of weights data sharing can be used i e the second prediction result is set as the initial object position of the aoa to reduce the algorithm search time the optimization strategy for lstm is shown in fig 5 3 proposed hybrid rdrsn lstm gru model 3 1 screening and reconstruction of input data data such as water level flow rainfall evaporation and power station output are independent time series the downstream water level of a hydropower station is related to the upstream and downstream water levels and the flow downstream of the station in the case of a flood flood related influences are also considered for example lope altitude plan curvature profile curvature and geology bui et al 2018 tien bui et al 2018 khosravi er al 2020 however among the water level flood influence factors above the influence weight of some factors on water level will change significantly with time which is the difficulty of water level change sensitivity analysis at this stage fang et al 2020 the research object of this study is a large cascade hydropower station and the change in the upstream water levels and downstream water levels can be indirectly reflected in addition in this study it is found that two tributaries converge downstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station when the converging flow of the tributaries is higher it has a backwater jacking effect on the water level downstream of the hydropower station therefore the flows of the two tributaries downstream of the hydropower plant are included in the input data at this stage influenced by energy allocation large hydropower plants take on the task of load supply peak and frequency regulation therefore changes in power plant output at different time scales also affect downstream water levels in summary the downstream post site water level of the upstream hydropower plant the presite water level of the target hydropower plant at the last moment the post site downstream water level of the target hydropower plant at a previous moment the total output of the target hydropower plant at the last moment and the flow of the downstream tributary at the last moment are used as inputs to the model the scheduling operation of the power station will largely affect the water level variation therefore in this study the input data are selected as those related to the operation of the power station the above monitoring data avoid the problem that the whole model error is magnified due to calculation error the study of other types of water level influencing factors as input data will be continued in subsequent work the input data to the new model are shown in table 1 to ensure that the features of these data are adequately captured these input factors are constructed in the form of a three dimensional data distribution to form new time series data the y axis direction indicates the inlet flow to the xiangjiaba hydropower station at the corresponding time the newly composed vector has a structure similar to a feature map including length width and feature channels and facilitates the extraction of data features by the convolutional layer the structure of the input data is shown in fig 6 3 2 proposed model implementation the hybrid prediction structure proposed in this study is shown in fig 7 the rdrsn part performs feature extraction and data denoising and the lstm and gru perform water level prediction since a gru network is faster than lstm it has higher accuracy in making short term predictions therefore the model only provides the output of the gru when the hydropower plant faces a high flood and the prediction duration is minute to hour in the case of nonhigh floods general conditions the gru and lstm perform water level prediction separately and the adaptive module adjusts the outputs of both models to obtain the final water level the specific application is as follows assuming that the current time is t the model uses the first n δ t steps where δ t is the sampling interval of the water level data these values are set according to the prediction step the prediction window is filled using the data from the first t n δ t to t moments next the data are input into the rdrsn model for data feature extraction and the high dimensional water level data processed by the rdrsn are input into the optimized gru and lstm networks it should be noted that when the discharge flow of the xiangjiaba hydropower station is greater than 12 000 m3 s the output of the lstm is set to 0 and only the output of the gru is used as the final water level the reason is that when the flow rate exceeds 12 000 m3 s several large terraced hydropower plants along the yangtze river basin will be dispatched for joint flood control at this time the requirement for the timeliness of water level prediction is increased moreover the gru is better than lstm in terms of timeliness therefore to obtain the water level faster only the water level output from the optimized gru network is extracted in this case if the discharge flow of the xiangjiaba hydropower station is less than 12 000 m3 s the output of the two prediction models will be weighted and then the final water level can be output during the prediction process the model s error loss correction mechanism evaluates the predicted water level and observed water levels and continuously adjusts the error threshold to ensure that the model can obtain better prediction accuracy in summary the schedulers of hydropower stations have ample time to take scheduling measures based on the predicted water levels 4 parameter setting and evaluation index the settings of the parameters in the model will impact the final prediction accuracy the feature extraction accuracy of the rdrsn increases with the number of network layers and the number of iterations but too many layers lead to an increase in model complexity in addition the improvement of model accuracy is not significant when using resnet 50 compared to using resnet 34 he et al 2016 therefore the structure of the rdrsn in this study adopts a structure based on resnet 34 and the training rate varies according to the time series which is set to 0 01 for the first 50 epochs and 0 001 for the subsequent 50 epochs when the number of lstm layers is between 8 and 10 the prediction accuracy and efficiency of the network achieve optimal results when the number of layers of the network increases ma et al 2021 the improvement of the prediction accuracy decreases significantly and tends to be flat combining the prediction accuracy and efficiency of the model the number of lstm layers is set to 10 the number of neurons is set to 16 and the learning rate is set to 0 01 similarly to ensure that the gru can obtain the best performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency kisvari 2021 the number of layers of the gru network is set to 10 the number of neurons is set to 16 and the learning rate is set to 0 001 the experimental data were obtained from the xiangjiaba hydropower station the xiluodu hydropower station and relevant hydrological and meteorological departments in the basin and the data ranged from june 2014 to september 2020 in this study sample data were used to train each network separately and the data set was divided into training and testing sets tenfold cross validation was used to ensure that each set of data could be trained to improve the generalization ability of the model tensorflow and keras were used in python to build the network models because of their advantages of modularity and enabling the combination and superposition of models and the experimental operating environment was a computer equipped with an i7 9750 cpu the model evaluation uses the statistical metrics of the correlation coefficient r root mean squared error

5 results and discussion 5 1 analysis of the prediction results of the model in this study the newly proposed hybrid model is used to predict the downstream water level of the xiangjiaba hydropower station to verify the reliability of the model at different time scales water level predictions were made for hour day week month and quarter year scales for the hour day scale the first 24 h of data were used for training to predict the water level for the next 1 h and the water level s sampling frequency was 1 h time for the week month scale the first seven days of data were used to predict the water level of the next day and the water level data were sampled at a frequency of 8 h time for the quarter year scale the water level data of the first 12 months were used to predict the water level of the next month and the water level data were sampled at a frequency of 10 days time distributed in the first middle and second half of each month figs 8 10 show the predicted water level values versus the observed values for the short medium and long term respectively the evaluation of the prediction results of the new model is given in table 2 according to the results of the experiments the new model proposed in this study achieves high accuracy in water level prediction at different time scales the maximum error of the short term water level of the new model is 0 082 m and a small amount of error over 0 13 m occurs in the short and medium term step size of an hour to a day predictions the maximum rmse of the short term prediction is 0 028 m and the maximum error of the medium term prediction is 0 163 m when the annual scale water level prediction is performed the rmse increases significantly reaching a maximum of 0 112 m analysis of the hydrological and meteorological data at the error points reveals that the large errors in the short term and medium term prediction processes are primarily due to extreme weather conditions such as heavy rainfall or flooding in the upper and lower reaches and a clear time lag characterizes the situation in addition the increased flow of the main and tributary streams in the basin and the backwater jacking of the min and heng rivers increase the error of water level prediction the large fluctuation of the water level due to measures such as peak regulation in hydropower stations is also one of the factors triggering the error however the above errors are within the acceptable range and will be reduced when the data sampling frequency is increased and the prediction step is reduced at this stage the above results demonstrate that the model proposed in this study can achieve better results in short and medium term water level prediction the error at the annual scale is related mainly to the data sampling frequency because this study uses three sets of data per month to predict the water level at the annual scale the data span is large so the data itself cannot fully reflect the characteristics of water level changes under the full time series thus affecting the feature capture effect of the model for example extreme weather in different seasons will cause water level fluctuations in the future and the data sampling interval may cause the water level changes in this time period to be ignored resulting in errors between the predicted water level and the observed water level in addition several large cascade hydropower stations in the upper reaches of the yangtze river basin are gradually put into operation which will have a more complex impact on the water level and flow of xiangjiaba hydropower station at the same time the power generation plan of large hydropower plants will influence the water level change due to the vigorous promotion of low carbon energy and the increase in energy demand in contrast the two factors of energy demand and the proportion of low carbon energy are influenced by human production and life which have apparent subjectivity and this will bring more uncertainty to long term water level prediction therefore it is considered that when predicting the water level of large hydropower plants on an annual scale or in the longer term the prediction results are mainly for the reference of the relevant authorities while ensuring the accuracy of the medium term and short term water level prediction will provide more valuable results for the actual operation of hydropower plants analysis of the operational data of the xiangjiaba hydropower station shows that when the water coming from upstream is large and the flow of the minjiang and hengjiang rivers downstream changes significantly the effect of the water level downstream is affected by backwater jacking when the flow rate of the hengjiang river is lower than 260 m3 s the impact of the hengjiang river on the downstream water level of the xiangjiaba hydropower station is negative when the flow rate of hengjiang river reaches more than 300 m3 s the influence of the hengjiang river inflow on the downstream water level of the xiangjiaba hydropower station is positive with the increase in the hengjiang river inflow the influence of its support gradually increases when the flow of the minjiang river is lower than 4700 m3 s the influence of the minjiang river on the downstream water level is mostly negative when the flow of the minjiang river reaches more than 5000 m3 s the inflowing water from the minjiang river begins to have a noticeable positive supporting effect on the xiangjiaba hydropower station with the increase in the inflowing water from the minjiang river the supporting effect also increases gradually according to the conclusion above when the flow rate of the hengjiang river is greater than 300 m3 s the inflow of the hengjiang river begins to have a supporting impact on the xiangjiaba hydropower station for every 100 m3 s increase in the flow of the hengjiang river the average variation in the top support water level is 0 06 m when the flow of the minjiang river is greater than 5000 m3 s the inflow of the minjiang river begins to have a supporting effect on the xiangjiaba hydropower station with every 1000 m3 s increase in the flow of the minjiang river the average variation in the top support water level is 0 05 m figs 11 and 12 show scatter plots of the downstream water level and flow of the xiangjiaba hydropower station without and with jacking respectively compared with other water level prediction research the impact of the jacking action of the downstream tributaries on the water level cannot be ignored in this study to verify that the addition of downstream tributary flows to the input data is significant in improving the prediction accuracy in this study the flows of the two downstream tributaries were removed from the input data then they were input into the proposed model for prediction and the results were compared with the new model using the complete input data fig 13 shows the short term water level predictions in both cases after the flow of the downstream tributaries is removed from the input data the error of the water level prediction is higher than that of the method proposed in this study and the maximum error reaches 0 09 m this result is more apparent when there is a flood in the basin when the flow of both downstream tributaries increases and this result is consistent with the actual situation therefore the method proposed in this study incorporates the flow of downstream tributaries into the input data which effectively improves the accuracy of water level prediction this helps the operators of the hydropower stations take timely and effective measures especially in the face of flooding and shipping dispatch this result also reminds us that when using artificial intelligence for water level prediction the flow changes of downstream tributaries play an important role taking this into account can significantly improve the prediction accuracy and provide meaningful technical support for water resource scheduling 5 2 comparison of the prediction results of the model in this study an svr cnn lstm rf bp mlp and traditional hydrodynamic models were used to predict the downstream water level of the xiangjiaba hydropower station on multiple time scales and the results are compared with the proposed method the adjustment factor of the svr model is set to 5 the radial kernel function is selected and the error is set to 0 05 the number of decision trees in the rf is set to 100 the maximum depth of a tree is set to 10 the minimum number of samples inside each node is set to 2 the maximum number of features in each group is 3 the minimum number of samples per leaf in each split and the maximum number of features is set to 2 in the cnn lstm model the size of the convolution kernel is set to 3 and the sigmoid activation function is adopted to output one dimensional water level data in the lstm network the learning rate is set to 0 001 the batch size is set to 32 the activation function is set to relu and the number of iterations is set to 100 the number of layers of the bp neural network is 3 the activation function is tanh and the number of hidden neurons is set to 10 the mlp model activation function is relu and the training method adopts adam to adaptively adjust the learning rate the hydrodynamic model adopts the water level of the xiangjiaba hydropower station and the terrain boundary adopts the mainstream of the yangtze river hengjiang river and minjiang river according to the results in table 3 table 4 and table 5 the model proposed in this study is superior to the other models in all indicators for short term water level prediction both the proposed model r 0 998 rmse 0 019 m mae 0 023 m nse 0 995 and the cnn lstm model r 0 995 rmse 0 038 m mae 0 035 m nse 0 982 have outstanding performance but the new model has smaller error and faster computational efficiency which is critical in the face of floods meanwhile the hydrodynamic model r 0 991 rmse 0 047 m mae 0 040 m nse 0 988 and bp model r 0 988 rmse 0 053 m mae 0 048 m nse 0 982 for short term water level prediction also achieved better results but the hydrodynamic method is time consuming and the method may not be able to provide timely reference results in the case of unexpected situations following the rf rmse 0 055 m mae 0 051 m nse 0 981 r 0 985 and svr models rmse 0 082 m mae 0 078 m nse 0 955 r 0 964 the short term water level prediction errors are significantly higher than those of the proposed method however their operation time is better than that of the hydrodynamic model and the prediction errors of these two models do not meet the operational requirements of the power station when considering that the xiangjiaba hydropower station is required to undertake many duties such as flood control and shipping during the flood season the worst prediction effect is the mlp model rmse 0 096 m mae 0 093 m nse 0 934 r 0 941 whose maximum error reaches 0 31 m and the performance on each index is also the worst when making medium term water level forecasts the forecast errors of all models increased with increasing forecast step size and the uncertain influence of more hydrological and meteorological factors however the model proposed in this study still maintains the optimal forecasting effect compared with short term forecasting the new model has the smallest fluctuation of medium term forecasting error and all indicators are optimal rmse 0 052 m mae 0 044 m nse 0 981 r 0 984 max error 0 14 m which proves that the proposed model has good stability and adaptability in terms of medium and short term water level prediction the good prediction accuracy of this model can effectively predict flood events which helps hydropower plants take emergency disposal measures in advance to reduce social losses at the same time the lower error provides valuable reference data for shipping which is conducive to improving economic efficiency when the forecast step length increased to the quarter year scale the data showed that the error of each model fluctuated significantly and the increase in time lag and various uncertain factors made long term water level forecasting difficult however the proposed new model still maintains an optimal forecasting effect and the result can provide a valuable data reference for formulating a load plan for the next time period year quarter the worst accuracy was achieved by the mlp model the performances of the svr and rf models are not satisfactory and there is instability in their prediction results in this study the data interval used in the annual scale water level prediction is relatively large which affects the accuracy of water level prediction although increasing the sampling frequency will help improve the prediction accuracy of each model the increase in the amount of data will lead to a decrease in the computational efficiency of the models therefore future research will continue to improve the prediction efficiency of the proposed model on an annual scale according to the data in tables 6 and the water level prediction figs 14 16 the water level prediction made by the proposed model is closer to the actual water level for each time scale which also verifies that the feature extraction mechanism and denoising mechanism in the model help deep learning achieve higher accuracy in water level prediction compared with the other models the proposed model can effectively reduce the bias caused by the time lag and has more robust prediction accuracy for the highest and lowest water levels the taylor plots in figs 17 19 show the relationship between each model s predicted and actual values at different prediction steps the new model proposed in this study exhibits the best correlation and the lowest standard deviation at all time ranges the performance of the cnn model is also excellent the results above indicate that the hybrid model can achieve better water level predictions than a single model the performances of the bp rf and hydrodynamic models are close and the worst is the mlp model which has the worst correlation and standard deviation these graphs show that the hybrid forecasting model proposed in this study improves the performance of existing models when water level forecasting is performed on a quarter year basis each model s performance decreases due to the larger period time this is because the weight of other factors nonweather and hydrological factors such as energy demand on the water level variation at the hydropower plant increases over a longer period time when the range of prediction time is small step size of hours days each model s prediction accuracy is higher which is consistent with the conclusion of barzegar et al 2017 barzegar et al 2020 in addition according to the results shown in figs 20 22 it can be seen that the proposed model has the lowest prediction dispersion and the scatter points are all distributed around the y x line especially for the short and medium term water level prediction which require higher accuracy however models such as the mlp have too many 0 estimates and a greater degree of bias between the low and high values of the predicted values compared to the observed values both the new and the cnn lstm models obtain better prediction results and their convergence of predicted values to the observed values is ideal during this research it was found that for the low frequency water level change conditions the model error has an increasing trend which is also related to the characteristics of a deep learning model itself however the model s attention mechanism and error correction mechanism evaluate the water level fluctuation caused by such low frequency events and realize self correction and improvement of the model accuracy the above results show that the water level prediction model proposed in this study has good application prospects the model can adaptively adjust the weight of each input quantity in the water level prediction process according to the error of the prediction result to ensure that the model captures the dynamic changes in water level after obtaining time series data the traditional lstm can effectively realize the prediction based on time series and couple the drsn with feature extraction ability to ensure that the features of water level influence factors can be included in the prediction so the final result is closer to the actual observed water level to meet the needs of flood control this study also adopts a rare classification prediction technique to adjust the model operation process and ensure that the model can provide fast and accurate prediction results in the event of flood hazards the new model can effectively avoid the occurrence of overfitting and gradient disappearance 5 3 applications to verify the effect of the newly proposed model under actual working conditions this study uses the new model to predict the water level downstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station in real time and the water level prediction standard needs to meet shipping demand according to relevant regulations when the xiluodu hydropower station and xiangjiaba hydropower station are in the cascade daily peak shaving operation during the flood season the minimum power generation flow of the xiluodu hydropower station is 435 m3 s the xiangjiaba hydropower station must undertake the function of back regulation and ensure that the minimum shipping base flow downstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station is 1200 m3 s at this time the highest navigable downstream water level at the xiangjiaba hydropower station is 277 25 m the lowest navigable water level is 265 80 m and the ship lift operates 22 h a day flood discharge will cause apparent water level fluctuations near the ship lock the wave at the end of the mouth is the strongest and the wave height is the largest the maximum wave height is concentrated between 0 85 m and 0 72 m and the highest wave height in the pilotage channel is concentrated between 0 32 m and 0 53 m therefore the downstream water level is taken from a radar water level gauge 300 m away from the downstream channel gate which minimizes the influence of waves on water level changes at the same time the difference in the design water level of the cabin is 0 1 m if the ideal error of the prediction model is kept at or below 0 1 m it will provide positive technical guidance for the operation of the power station fig 23 shows a comparison between the model s prediction and the observed value of the water level downstream of the xiangjiaba hydropower station on september 20 2020 according to the results above although affected by the upstream flood discharge and backwater jacking of the downstream tributaries during the flood season the water level prediction model proposed in this study shows a good effect on the water level prediction of the downstream navigation requirements of the xiangjiaba hydropower station and the maximum water level error is 0 08 m which meets the requirements of power station operation and the shipping water level this result further proves that the rdrsn lstm gru water level prediction model proposed in this study can effectively capture the characteristics of water level changes during power station operation and provide complete accurate predictions 6 conclusions to accurately predict the downstream water level of the xiangjiaba hydropower station and realize the optimal allocation of water resources this study proposes a new hybrid model for water level prediction on multiple time scales the main contributions of this study are as follows an rdrsn is proposed to capture the features of water level influencing factors and the dynamic characteristics of water level changes the flow of downstream tributaries is introduced into the input data and combined with other water level influencing factors to form a high dimensional feature vector based on time series a variable threshold function is introduced into the network to improve the feature recognition accuracy and eliminate data noise effectively the rdrsn works with this form of input data effectively improving the accuracy and efficiency of the model for feature capture making the model more scalable from the data level compared to designing filters the new network is more convenient and intelligent experimental results verify that the proposed method can effectively reduce the prediction error caused by the backwater jacking of downstream tributaries an error correction mechanism embedded in the gru lstm network ensures that the model can correct its errors according to each prediction result an lstm network optimized by the aoa has higher accuracy and efficiency while avoiding overfitting in long term series a weighting module at the output side effectively improves the prediction accuracy of the model at each time scale range and avoids excessive errors due to the episodic factors of a single model in addition this study initially tried water level prediction based on flow classification combined with the actual working conditions and the high efficiency of a gru network to realize the rapid prediction of the model in the face of sudden floods the experimental results show that the new model is superior to existing models for water level prediction at all time scales it can make up for the shortcomings of a single model in water level prediction and the scalability of the new model makes it have good adaptability in the field of hydrology at the same time when the downstream tributary flow is large the flow will occupy a higher influence weight in water level prediction in subsequent water level prediction paying attention to the important downstream tributaries can improve the prediction accuracy in addition in the water level prediction of cascade hydropower stations energy demand will become an essential factor affecting water level changes funding this work was supported by the national key research and development program of china grant award number

2278,ｄe concentration of the injected fluid decays smoothly around the location of the corresponding sharp interface which is beyond the theoretical range this concentration spread should be considered in redefining outer mixing boundaries around injection well between the injected and ambient contaminated solutions in this study a radial transport experiment was performed naphthol green b was first injected as a contaminant plume followed by potassium permanganate as the remediation agent to mimic the interface mixing in more realistic conditions the radial advection dispersion model e g dominated by interfacial driving r c c0 0 5 combined with dispersion mixing was used to obtain the position of the boundary r f at the mixing fringe of the injected fluid the results show that the injected oxidant front ran after the contaminated plume at a migration velocity of more than 1 29 times increasing the mechanical dispersion difference between potassium permanganate and naphthol green b the increase in the injection rate and ambient groundwater flow velocity improved the mixing of oxidant and contaminated plume the area difference between the contaminated plume and the oxidant decreased but also accelerated the contaminated plume coverage changing the injection mode such as linear injection was an effective method which enhanced the mixing of the oxidant contamination plume and weakly expanded the contaminated plume the swept area 254 cm2 was the smallest among the three injection modes the relationship between injection and mixing needs to be further strengthened keywords radial injection contamination plume agent driving mixing dispersion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the most common chlorinated organic solvent compounds in groundwater such as tetrachloroethylene trichloroethylene carbon tetrachloride and vinyl chloride tend to form large groundwater contamination plumes significantly impacting regional water resource sustainability brusseau et al 2011 in situ remediation is a commonly used technique for groundwater remediation it typically involves the injection of a reagent into the subsurface to create a zone in which biological and or chemical reactions lead to the destruction of contaminants song et al 2020 for example chemical oxidants are injected to destroy or transform a range of contaminants brau et al 2017 toth et al 2020 trevelyan and walker 2018 following the injection of a reagent solution into the subsurface the mixing and degradation reactions occur only where the amendment and contaminant are sufficiently close so that mixing can bring them together to react neupauer et al 2020 mixing in porous media is usually very poor because the flow in porous media is laminar as a result the injected fluid does not mix with the resident fluid and in situ remediations are confined to a narrow fluid interface between the injected plume of the treatment solution and the contaminated groundwater mays and neupauer 2012 with simplifying assumptions and boundary conditions analytical solutions for the shape of this sharp interface as a function of radial injection pore volume can be obtained lai et al 2016 this is the cumulative sweep area after chemical amendment injection however sizable traces of the injected oxidant may appear outside this boundary due to mechanical dispersion a mass transfer mechanism where velocity changes on the pore scale cause the fluid to spread out bear 1972 hyatt and leonenko 2022 this will cause the concentration of the injected fluid to smoothly decay around the region where this sharp boundary would be and this phenomenon has been examined in previous studies huang and chen 2015 mays and neupauer 2012 tang and van der zee 2021 trevelyan and walker 2018 therefore it is not difficult to understand that radial dispersion is the limiting step of mixing and reaction at the interface front and the radial dispersion characteristics of the solute have an impact on the properties of the interface front between the oxidant and pollution plume in earlier studies the dispersivities or dispersion coefficients obtained from the analysis of the breakthrough curves btcs by the advection dispersion equation ade are constant bear 1972 pang and hunt 2001 scheidegger 1961 but this situation does not correspond to the actual situation which increases with travel distance or time gao et al 2010 huang et al 2006 many authors have attempted to obtain analytical or numerical solutions for ades with distance dependent dispersion guo et al 2016 neuman 1991 pang and hunt 2001 pickens and grisak 1981 chen 1987 addressed analytical solutions related to a continuous and a pulse injection were determined for the radial dispersion problem concerning such a cauchy boundary condition hsieh proposed a simpler analytical solution to the radial dispersion problem hsieh 1986 chen et al obtained a semi analytical solution of one or two dimensional ade for solute transport in radially convergent or divergent flow with linear scale dependent dispersion chen 2007 chen et al 2007 lai et al 2016 used laplace and generalized integral transformations to obtain exact analytical solutions for radial solute transport with excellent agreement most studies did not compare their analytical solutions with experimental data in the vicinity of the injection well the groundwater velocity caused by injection is larger than the ambient groundwater flow velocity cha and borden 2012 and the flow field around the injection well is almost radial neupauer et al 2020 therefore it is advantageous to analyze radial flow the radial dispersion coefficient is positively correlated with the radial velocity of the solute ignoring molecular diffusion which means that slight changes in the solute transport velocity in the porous medium may cause changes in the dispersion characteristics of the oxidant or contaminated plume which in turn affects the mixing and reaction with the contamination plume after the injected oxidant their interfacial driving and the spreading of the contamination plume this is directly related to the remediation strategy although some studies have noted that the mixing of different solute fronts influences the properties of such a b c fronts ballarini et al 2012 gramling et al 2002 willingham et al 2008 ye et al 2015 the radial advection dispersion case where a diffuses radially into a pool of b such that the contact interface is an expanding circle has received less attention this is related to the impossibility of indefinitely sustaining a constant concentration of a at the initial point source because of diffusion and thus finding the asymptotic properties of such radial fronts brau and de wit 2020 however this procedure represents the initial step in injecting amendments into the contaminant plume during in situ remediation in song s research song et al 2020 quantitative parameters such as the migration distance migration area and area ratio of the remediation agent and pollutants were intuitively analyzed by image analysis the effect of radial injection of solute dispersion was not analyzed and there was no corresponding mathematical model analysis therefore the present study based on song et al 2020 considers the mechanical dispersion process with different injection schemes and ambient flow and applies it to generic interface geometries extending beyond the circle boundary case this allows quantifying a more precise peripheral boundary cutoff for the distances at which traces of the injected fluid may appear in the aquifer that is the boundary position r f at the mixing edge of the injected fluid is obtained through experiments and simple theoretical analysis in addition we also explore the velocity variation factor that can cause the dispersion characteristics of the pore media at this initial step such as the injection rate injection mode and ambient groundwater flow velocity to quantitatively describe oxidant front driving spreading of contamination plume and analyze oxidant contamination plume interface migration and mixing 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setting and test scenarios the experimental setup for the radial transport test was composed of a 2d sandbox consisting of three chambers the main chamber 4000 cm3 housed the sand and had internal dimensions of 50 cm length by 40 cm width by 2 cm height the other two chambers were upgradient inlet and downgradient outlet of the main chamber holes with a diameter of 1 5 mm were evenly drilled in the lucite plate at the inlet and outlet to ensure uniform distribution of fluid fig s1 a schematic of the flow cell is presented in fig 1 the model was made of plexiglass with

experimental groups potassium permanganate sino pharmaceutical beijing 200 mg l was used as the remediation agent and naphthol green b aladdin china 20 mg l was used as the contaminated plume which was emplaced 0 129 pv into the tank before the experiment in the first three experiments the oxidant was injected at a rate of 5 10 and 30 ml min from the central injection port three injection oxidant modes in experimental group 2 fig 3 were designed including linear injection constant injection and periodic injection the linear injection scheme was q 2 344 t fig 3 and the equivalent constant injection rate was 10 ml min out of a plethora of possibilities for time varying injection scenarios the simplest procedure was piecewise constant pumping specifically we split the time interval t0 t1 into t0 t m during which the constant injection rate was q 10 ml min and t m t1 with t m 10 m 1 min t0 10 m min and t1 10 m 2 min m 0 2 4 2i for which the injection was stopped the first two groups of experiments did not consider the ambient flow considering the actual ambient velocities are due to spatial variations in water velocity that may result in changes in mechanical dispersion at the injection plume front therefore group 3 was set to inject oxidants at a rate of 10 ml min under 1 0 2 5 and 5 0 m day ambient flow velocity the volume of oxidant injected into the sandbox was the same in all experimental groups the effluent was temporarily sampled every 2 to 6 min using gastight needles from the sampling ports and the absorbance of potassium permanganate wavelength 526 and naphthol green b wavelength 710 were analyzed the fluid height in a liquid column manometer measured the pressure of the sandbox and the sampling points and pressure measuring points are shown in fig 1 a digital camera sony dsc rx100m7g was used to record plume solute movement and coverage of the potassium permanganate 2 2 image processing methods the left bottom corner of the flow cell was denoted as x y 0 0 the concentration distribution of the solute c x y t where x and y were the spatial coordinates in the horizontal plane was reconstructed from the recorded images of the dynamics for this purpose we established a radial injection solute concentration image analysis method the basic image analysis protocol included the following steps which were elaborated on 1 extracting their information 2 selection of the color space 3 correction image 4 normalization image 5 background leveling and 6 calibration see the supporting information for details the evolution of the interface was captured using a digital video camera the images were analyzed in imagej software to track the position of the front and extract its behavior 2 3 analytical solution of radial transport to simulate the spreading and displacement of the fluid plume during radial injection in a porous medium and compare it to the image analysis data a two dimensional advection dispersion model was applied for the sake of simplicity we assumed that the two kinds of solution the indigenous water contaminated plume naphthol green b in the aquifer and the remediation agent potassium permanganate injected into the aquifer through wells were distinguishable by an abrupt front bear 1972 hyatt and leonenko 2022 the aquifer was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic chokejaroenrat et al 2013 unless otherwise specified the density and viscosity of the two kinds of water were identical willingham et al 2008 considering the case of a fully penetrating well in the aquifer of constant thickness b potassium permanganate was injected at a constant rate q l3 t the concentrations of the indigenous water in the aquifer and of the injection water were 0 and c0 respectively the sorption and decay processes are ignored and the following governing equation can be expressed bear 1972 1 c t d r 2 c r 2 v r c r initial and boundary conditions 2 c r 0 0 r r w c r w t c 0 t 0 c r t 0 t 0 where d r α l v r d aq n c is the solute concentration m l3 t is the time t r is the radial distance measured from the center of the injection zone l r w is well radius l d r is the hydrodynamic

volume of agent injected into the well with radius r w is 5 v 0 t q t d t π r f 2 b n r w r f therefore when r f r c c0 0 5 where r f represent the distance of the front l the exact analytical solution of eq 1 has been found chen 1987 hsieh 1986 lai et al 2016 tang and babu 1979 here we still use the classical approximate solutions eq 6 and 7 this assumption is approximately true away from the immediate vicinity of the source they also stated that eq 6 approximates a numerical solution of eq 1 for distances larger than 20 particle diameters from the well hoopes and harleman thought that eq 6 can be used as a good approximation to describe the dispersion phenomenon in radially diverging fields and also experimentally proves this result hoopes and harleman 1967 in addition in the exact analytical solutions obtained by subsequent researchers using the same model the approximate solutions have similar accuracy to the exact analytical solutions chen 1987 hsieh 1986 the approximate analytical solution of this equation is therefore reasonable for the radial distribution of a conservative dissolved substance which is injected into a homogeneous isotropic confined aquifer by a well in addition it should be pointed out that eq 6 and 7 are available for the situation of zero ambient flow and more specific analytical solutions can be referred to chen et al 2016 6 c r t c 0 1 2 e r

estimation of longitudinal dispersivity flow velocities and solute dispersion are key parameters for the description of fluid and solute transport in porous media delgado 2007 therefore several tests were performed to validate the parameter sensitivity by considering different concentrations injection rates injection positions and sampling positions a total of 300 ml potassium permanganate was injected into a two dimensional sandbox filled with water at different rates 5 10 and 30 ml min the detailed analysis of the images taken during the test allowed an accurate description of the transport process the image processing carried out on the plume images see si provided the concentration field in the study area for each monitoring time fig 5 shows the concentration breakthrough curve of potassium permanganate where monitoring point 3 was located as shown in fig 1 fig 6 shows the concentration decline curve from the center of the sandbox to the edge of the plume after the dye was emplaced into the sandbox 200 ml through experimental and theoretical derivation the radial dispersivity of potassium permanganate was 0 158 cm and the dispersivity was 0 162 cm using the best fitting of the experimental values the two values were similar therefore we took 0 16 cm as the parameter value of the dispersivity of potassium permanganate fig 6 shows that the experimental dispersivity of naphthol green b was 0 45 cm and the dispersivity obtained by the best fitting experimental was 0 35 cm therefore the average value of 0 40 cm was taken as the dispersivity of the dye in addition the dispersivity of tetrachloroethylene pce was 0 387 cm in a one dimensional column penetration test which is another reason why we chose naphthol green b as an aquifer contaminant therefore in the next experiments we assumed that no chemical reaction occurred between the injected oxidant and contaminant and only the displacement of physical factors was considered judging from the experimental results the dispersibility of oxidants was less than that of the contaminant which suggests that the dispersion and spreading of contaminated plumes cannot be ignored to test the validity of the imaging procedure a mass balance comparing the injected oxidants or contaminants with the volume calculated from the acquired pictures was performed at a certain time t the resident quantity mr t in each discretized image was calculated by eq 10 citarella et al 2015 10 m r t c x y t n d x d y area c x y t n b a pix where c x y t m l3 is the average concentration in the aggregated pixel area a pix l 2 with centroid location x l y l at time t t by assuming that the concentration is homogeneously distributed along the tank thickness b the total resident mass m r t m can be compared to the injected mass at the same time m inj t m 11 m inj t q inj c inj t see table 2 for specific data when the plume was completely and constantly injected into the sandbox the cumulative mass released presented a linear trend and the value grew over time until the end of the injection the relative errors were 2 12 and 6 54 suggesting that the resident quantity m r t fit satisfactorily with the mass line injected in addition the difference between the concentration of the sample analyzed in the experiment and the concentration obtained by the image method analysis was 1 07 6 51 it also shows that the dispersion characteristics of oxidants and pollutants obtained by the abovementioned image analysis method were more reliable 3 2 moving velocities of oxidant and contamination fronts when the oxidant was injected into the contaminated plume at 5 10 and 30 ml min the experimental results were shown in fig 7 and the more detailed experimental images were in the si fig s3 it was clearly observed that a concentric plume formed after the oxidant was injected into the contamination plume the width of the transition zone is relatively small and the abrupt interface c c0 0 5 used to describe the approximation movement of the plume front is applicable the rate of oxidant driving and contamination plume spreading is as shown in fig 8 when the radial injection rate is 30 ml min for 10 min the interface velocity of the oxidant is 0 553 cm min fig s3 and the velocity of the contaminated plume front is 0 429 cm min while the radial injection rate is 5 ml min for 60 min the pore volume of the injected oxidant is the same the interface velocity of the oxidant is 0 092 cm min fig s3 and the speed of the polluted plume front is 0 071 cm min at different injection rates the oxidant advancing velocity is larger than that of the contaminated plume and the oxidant interface front velocity with a high oxidant injection rate is 6 14 times that of low oxidant injection as shown in fig 8b the velocity difference vd continuously decreases between oxidant driving and contamination plume expansion which indicates that the oxidant affected area is continuously accelerating to cover the contaminated plume area however it should be noted that the expansion rate of the contaminated plume front at a high injection rate is also 6 04 times that of the low injection rate which means that the high injection rate also expands the pollution range of the plume this is not conducive to the remediation of polluted aquifers the most noticeable aspect of the data is from the pressure port in fig 1 which shows that the pressure injected at 30 ml min is 12 34 times higher than that injected at 5 ml min indicating that a high injection rate increases energy consumption and leads to the risk of hydraulic fracturing gale et al 2015 the experimental results of three radial injection strategies fig 3 were shown in fig 7 and the more detailed experimental images were in the si fig s3 s5 when linear injection occurs the injection rate is q 2 344 t and the oxidant front driving velocity can be obtained from eq 4 and eq 17 v r q 2 π b n 1 r k 2 π n b 0 692 cm min that is the linear injection oxidant is driven at a constant speed fig 9 a if we now turn to the spreading velocity of the contaminated plume we find that the velocity gradually increases and tends to stabilize fig 9b for constant and periodic injection the expansion speed is relatively similar regardless of the oxidant or the contaminated plume fig 7 shows the solute coverage at different ambient groundwater flow velocities after injecting 0 10 pv oxidant and the more detailed experimental images were in the si fig s6 at the ambient groundwater flow of 1 0 m d the shape of the plume is approximately circular the inner ring is the oxidant the semimajor axis is 24 65 cm after injection of 0 192 pv oxidant and the outer ring is the contaminated plume the semimajor axis is 33 33 cm after injection of 0 192 pv oxidant fig s6 however when the ambient velocity increases to larger values of 2 5 and 5 0 m d the oxidant and contamination infiltrate at a faster speed the center of both the oxidant and the pollutant plume moves rapidly downstream and the migration path changes long and narrow especially after injecting 0 192 pv oxidant the difference between different ambient groundwater flow velocities is more obvious fig s6 these results indicate that the larger ambient groundwater flow velocity promotes the longitudinal transport of the solute and weakens the transverse diffusion resulting in changes in the percolation path and transport velocity in the porous medium the increase in flow velocity also promotes the redistribution of the contamination plume expanding the contamination range of the contaminants in general considering the ambient groundwater flow velocity the largest difference is that the transverse spreading distance is reduced fig s6 the longitudinal velocity is increased fig 10 and most of the plume is transmitted along the direction of the water flow which makes it look narrower and longer as the ambient groundwater flow velocity increases this trend becomes more obvious therefore what can be clearly seen in fig s6 is the continual growth of the injected oxidant in the x direction and the extension of the contaminated plume in the same direction the transverse spreading distance decrease may have been an important factor in the longitudinal water pressure weakening the transverse dispersion of radial injection another possible explanation for this is that the transport of solute under the radius of the oxidant injection source was not considered lai et al 2016 4 discussions 4 1 potential mixing effect of oxidant and contamination the ambient groundwater flow velocity is assumed to be negligible and the velocity field in the aquifer is strictly radial in the direction outward from the injection site we can use the above average velocity fig 8 to determine the furthest radial extent of the interface to be determined after injecting for a certain period however the interface between the injected and residual fluids is never sharp there is always dispersion of the fluids due to mass transfer effects occurring at the interface therefore we use r f l as a measure of the displacement of the oxidant interface and the pollution plume front 12 r f r σ qt π n b 2 3 α l r where σ is the standard deviation of the plume concentration distribution l at this time the area driven by the expanded oxidant and contamination plume can be expressed as 13 a π r 2 3 α l r 2 therefore the difference between the oxidant driving area and the expansion area of the pollution plume can be expressed as 14 a 0 a 2 a 1 π r 2 2 3 α cl r 2 2 π r 1 2 3 α ol r 1 2 a2 represents the expansion area of the contaminated plume l2 and a1 represents the area driven by radial injection of oxidant l2 where r 1 qt π n b r 2 200 q t π n b fig 11 a shows that without considering dispersion the radius of interest of the oxidant and the spreading extent of the pollution plume is smaller than those considering the dispersion characteristics regardless of theoretical analysis or experimental analysis the theoretical displacement value of ade is relatively close to the experimental analysis displacement value the dispersion of the solute causes the contaminated plume to move farther and expands the pollution range we also know that the solute dispersion coefficient is proportional to the average velocity dentz et al 2018 therefore the greater the radial driving force is the greater the displacement distance of the pollution plume caused by the dispersion within the same time the extent of displacement of the contaminated plume and the difference in the radius of interest of the oxidant are shown in fig 11b when only advection is considered the displacement difference between the two gradually decreases with the injection pore volume in contrast under the ade model their displacement difference first increases and then decreases and the minimum difference value is 5 833 cm at 0 657 pv this proves that there is an optimal injection volume that minimizes the expansion distance of the contaminated plume and shows the importance of solute dispersion for plume expansion when the remediation agent is injected into wells the difference in the displacement caused by the plume velocity is directly reflected in the area therefore the area comparison of the oxidant and the contaminated plume and the area difference shows the degree of mixing between them see si for specific theories kitanidis 1994 fig s7a b and c reveal that there has been a steady rise in the oxidant driving area and contaminated plume expansion area the contaminated plume area of the three injection rates increased by 143 160 and 154 and the difference between the expanded area of the contaminated plume and the swept area of the oxidant finally decreased by 11 37 22 46 and 14 51 respectively it shows that the mixing ability of the injected oxidant plume and the contaminated plume is enhanced and the enhancement of the injection rate is beneficial to the mixing between them a possible explanation for this might be assumed in which the average radial velocity on the solute coverage area represents the radial velocity 15 v 2 π r r r 0 v r d r π r 2 the radial dispersion coefficient is simplified as 16 d r α l v fig 12 a shows the relationship between the dispersion coefficient of the oxidant contaminated plume and the driving distance at different injection rates the dispersion coefficient of the oxidant plume gradually decreases with radial distance while the dispersion coefficient of the pollution plume gradually increases with expansion distance however the dispersion coefficient of the oxidant is larger than that of the pollution plume at the same injection flow rate this means that the mixing ability of the oxidant increases with the injection which explains why the mixing area of the oxidant and the pollution plume is increasing in the experiment and with the increase in injection rate the dispersive ability difference between the oxidant and contaminated plume is increasing fig 12b this is favorable for the mixing of the oxidant active diffusion stage with the contaminated plume which is more favorable for the remediation efficiency of the in situ injected oxidant the more intuitive reason is that the migration speed of the oxidant interface near the injection well is much greater than the expansion speed of the pollution plume front the mechanical mixing effect is more significant and the sweeping range is wider resulting in a reduction in the difference between the expansion area of the contaminated plume and the spread area of the oxidant in observational studies there is a potential for bias from the early stage of oxidant injection in which the difference between the expansion area of the contaminated plume and the spread area of the oxidant is increasing which may be caused by the driving force of injection another possible explanation for this is the limitation of our hypothesis in which the injected fluid and resident fluid are immiscible and form sharp interface separating regions in fact due to the inhomogeneous saturated aquifer the hydrodynamic dispersion of the fluid causes the uneven transport speed of the solute which lengthens the contact interface between the injected remediation agent and the contaminated groundwater and generates an injected treatment plume driven by stretching and folding mays and neupauer 2012 this finding is consistent with that of neupauer and cho who thought that this enhanced spreading results from local velocity variations that emerge from aquifer heterogeneity and from spatial variations in the external forcings that drive flow cho et al 2019 neupauer et al 2014 therefore the actual interface driving increases the mixing between the injected oxidant and the contaminated plume and reduces the spreading area difference of the contaminated plume 4 2 the impact of the injection scheme three radial injection strategies fig 3 were selected to inject the same volume of oxidant for the contaminated plume expansion experiment according to the principle of continuity the linear injection volume v l3 is expressed as 17 v 1 2 k t 2 π n r 2 b where k is the linear ratio of injection for periodic injection during the t0 tm the constant injection period the plume front is measured by r f r σ qt π n b 2 3 α l r in the tm t1 period stop injection and the plume is displaced by solute diffusion according to the diffusion problem the transmission distance is x l 18 x ϕ 4 d d t where ϕ e r f c c 0 however during the injection stop period the sampling concentration in the experiment shows that the migration of the plume is not a simple diffusion therefore the correction coefficient k is obtained from the experiment and the corrected displacement is obtained in this experiment when c c0 0 7 and ϕ 0 25 the k value is 3 46 19 x k ϕ 4 d d t at this time the plume displacement in a period can be expressed as 20 r f r σ r σ k ϕ 4 d d t for different injection modes the expansion displacement of the contaminated plume does not change significantly fig 13 a in contrast it has a significant impact on the radius of interest of the injected oxidant for example compared with constant injection the oxidant plume interface can be driven a certain distance by using buffer power for some time periodic injection during the divergent phases the cumulative swept area rapidly increases with time as oxidants from the injection well are pushed to spread divergently fig 14 c however during the tm t1 period stop injection the cumulative swept area slowly increases with time from the injection well and the concentration of potassium permanganate from sampling ports 1 2 and 3 increases 3 6 1 3 and 2 7 times respectively the mixing zone c c0 0 3 0 9 increases by 11 12 27 50 as shown in fig 14c during 0 192 pv oxidant injection the corresponding contaminated plume area increases to 657 99 cm2 the original area is 319 79 cm2 while the area difference of the contaminated plume decreases these results are also basically consistent for linear injection and the mixing zone c c0 0 3 0 9 increases by 19 5 what can be clearly seen in fig 14 is the general decline in the area difference of the contaminated plume the area difference during linear injection is the smallest which is 254 cm2 fig 14a we also average the radial velocity over the swept area of the plume periodic and constant injection are similar therefore the radial velocity at the interface of the linear injection contamination plume is expressed as 21 v r 2 k π n b r 2 200 2 π n b r substituting into eq 15 determines the average radial velocity and the dispersion coefficient is obtained as a function of radial distance fig s8 compared to constant injection the dispersion difference between the oxidant and contamination plume increases whether it is linear injection or periodic injection which indicates that the mixing ability of the two solutes in contact after oxidant injection is enhanced this also explains the reason for the reduction in the difference between the oxidant sweep and the expansion area of the contaminated plume in these two injection modes therefore the analysis of the results suggests that a weak link may exist between interface mixing and injection modes taken together these results suggest that there is a relationship between the effective spreading of the oxidant and the expansion of the contaminated plume the time dependent injection rate including linear injection and periodic alternation was employed different from the widely applied constant injection rate this time dependent displacement rate results in different flow dynamics and sweep efficiency even though the injected volume is the same suk et al 2021 in particular compared with constant injection time dependent injection chaotic advection agitates oxidant transmission increases plume interface length enhances plume spreading and leads to significant solute mixing by stretching and folding the fluid interface between the injected treatment solution and contaminated groundwater coutinho and miranda 2020 huang and chen 2015 suk et al 2021 larger cumulative swept areas have greater contact between the remedial agent and contaminants leading to a more significant reduction in groundwater contaminants ultimately enhancing remediation neupauer et al 2020 toth et al 2020 trevelyan and walker 2018 the decreased area difference in the contaminated plume in this study corroborates these earlier findings compared to periodic injection it appears that linear injection has a faster cumulative swept area increase and a smaller plume oxidant expansion area difference in terms of injection volume time linear injection mode is the most efficient because linear injection lasts for 16 min but in the late stage of linear injection the pressure value at the pressure point is 15 times the pressure at the constant injection rate of 5 ml min 4 3 the impact of ambient groundwater flow the above experiments ignore the ambient groundwater flow velocity but in actual site remediation the ambient groundwater flow velocity is different therefore we need to consider the influence of different water flow velocities on the expansion and migration of pollution plumes injected radially by the remediation agent in addition it is also verified whether the above flow rate leads to the enhancement of mixing the experimental velocity may be larger than the actual site flow velocity to highlight the effect of flow velocity on plume expansion fig s6 the maximum influence radius is 22 r f r q 0 n t 2 d l t 23 d l d aq n α l v x where q 0 represents the seepage velocity l t and d l is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient l2 t due to the limitation of the size of the sand tank it is impossible to measure the spreading area of the completely contaminated plume but under the effect of the water flow fig s9 the area affected by the injected oxidant increases from 267 8 to 281 5 cm2 fig s10 it can be clearly seen from the processed image that the length of the mixing zone in the downstream area of the water flow increases fig s6 in addition the spread area difference of the contaminated plume first increases and then decreases and as the water flow rate increases the area difference decreases when the same volume is injected fig s10d we also used the mean radial velocity to quantify the diffusive mixing capacity of the plume for injections with ambient groundwater flow 24 v 2 π r r r 0 v r d r π r 2 v where v is the ambient groundwater flow velocity l t the displacement in the flow direction r is replaced by r l 25 r r v t fig 15 a shows that the dispersion capacity of the oxidant pollution plume increases as the flow rate increases there is a relationship between the dispersion coefficient and ambient groundwater flow fig 15b we establish a relationship between the dispersion coefficient after injecting 0 192 pv oxidant and ambient groundwater flow it is found that the ambient groundwater flow has a positive correlation with the dispersion coefficient of the oxidant pollution plume at a low flow rate the oxidant dispersion capacity is stronger than that of the contaminated plume which strengthens the mixing of the oxidant and pollution plume this is why the area difference in fig s10 is reduced at the same time it is also found that the dispersion ability of the contaminated plume increases with the flow rate and is greater than that of the oxidant in the later stage of injection the dispersion ability is stronger than that of the oxidant this is good news for the mixing of the oxidant and the contaminated plume but bad news for increasing the expansion area of the contaminated plume at the later stage of injection in actual site remediation the heterogeneity of the underground medium causes the difference in microscopic pore velocities to increase which increases the diffusion range of the contaminated plume and pollutes a wider range of water quality these are not friendly for in situ remediation these factors may explain the relative correlation between the ambient groundwater flow velocity and the mixing of the plume interface a possible consequence can be the transportation and displacement of a contaminated plume due to naturally or anthropogenically induced high groundwater flow velocities complicating the site investigation process and planning of remediation activities erning et al 2012 flushing velocity is an important factor that impacts contaminated plume remediation in several ways which is an indicator of the mass depletion rate within the system and increases with increasing velocity petri et al 2008 another positive result is that high water velocity increases the overall contact interface between oxidant plumes and contaminated plumes promotes mass transfer and deepens the mixing between them in addition it can be seen that the increase in flow rate also increases the dispersion coefficient and causes further mixing from eq 16 and our experimental results that is the increase in interface length and dispersion ability further deepens the mixing of oxidants and contaminants it can be inferred that if it is a reactive injection it will promote complete oxidation and the generated reaction products should increase with the water flow rate which is more beneficial to in situ remediation the amount of mass mixing rate enhancement caused by the presence of the plume area difference is positively impacted by velocity as evidenced by a significant decrease in the plume area difference with increasing velocities fig s10d this is similar to a prediction made by petri b g petri et al 2008 and several mechanisms can explain this effect velocity also has an impact on the pore volume flushing efficiency which decreases with increasing velocity at high velocities larger molar amounts of oxidant are introduced more rapidly into the contaminated zone and some oxidants may transport downstream without contacting enough pore volume leading to the area affected by the injected oxidant increasing thereby increasing the mixing zone 4 4 limitations of the experimental work some limitations of the experiment need to be explained firstly since the pressure from the pressure point 1 7 fig 1 rose instantaneously and the change range was small we took the average increase value from the points 1 7 the increase of 0 08 0 17 0 47 cm at the injection rate of 5 10 and 30 ml min respectively also only the concentration at sampling point 3 fig 5 was analyzed because the transition zone could be effectively observed under different injection rates secondly the plume front has a low concentration 50 mg l that correlates well with the light intensity in this range which does not affect the front analysis of the plume thirdly the oxidant contaminated plume lost a circle shape when pv is high due to the randomness of the filled quartz sand this might reduce the transport of the plume front at high injection rates but the plume sheared by the heterogeneous medium might increase the mixing of the oxidant with the contamination plume it is clear that a mechanical dispersion model for radial injection can allow the injected fluid concentration transition zone to expand considerably on either side of a sharp interface solution figs 11 13 the radial driving displacement of the plume evaluated by the constant dispersion coefficient matches the experimental value of the small sandbox model dispersivity is 0 16 cm and 0 40 cm which is close to the experimental data 0 15 cm of hoopes hoopes and harleman 1967 a higher injection rate is beneficial for mixing between oxidant and contaminated plume gale et al 2015 the linear injection scheme does stabilize the interface at early times and thus results in slower growth of the contaminated plume which agrees excellently with the experimental results huang and chen 2015 and the periodic injection amplifies the diffusion of solute and enhances the mixing suk et al 2021 the ambient groundwater flows velocity enhances the contact boundary and expands the range of contaminated plume in addition our experiments are conducted in a homogeneous isotropic aquifer of a finite horizontal extent but it was shown in many experimental works that it is scale dependent gao et al 2010 pang and hunt 2001 yeh 1987 the consistency of study is likely to exist and be visible on a small scale and the dispersion may increase with the distance and time of solute transport there is no guarantee that measured characteristics will work on large practical scales we have also observed such deviations which may become larger with the increase of scale 5 conclusion the understanding of mixing and dispersion processes between in situ injected radial flow and contaminated flow is one of the current major challenges in subsurface hydrology the sharp interface solution of injected fluid remediation agent often underestimates the upper limit of its radial location without considering mechanical dispersion this study allows for quantifying an upper boundary cutoff eg rf r σ for the bigger mixing zone at which traces of the injected fluid are effectively saturated exhibiting the desired concentration cutoff the main conclusions are as follows the average radial dispersive mixing capacity is positively correlated with the injection rate the injection rate mainly affects the plume driving of the oxidant contamination the high oxidant injection rate interface catches up with the contaminated plume range at a higher speed the interface driving velocity of high rate injection is 6 14 times that of low rate injection which enhances the mixing degree of the oxidant and contaminated plume and reduces their area difference by 11 37 22 46 and 14 51 at injection rates of 5 10 and 30 ml min respectively compared with constant injection the mixed area of the oxidant and pollution plume c c0 0 3 0 9 injected periodically increases by 11 12 27 50 during linearly increased rate injection the difference in the expansion area of the pollution plume is the smallest which is 254 cm2 the injection modes related to the time dependent injection rate can significantly increase the mixing area of the radial injection oxidant and contaminated zone increased by 19 53 27 50 and under the dispersion effect the mixing effect is stronger under the action of ambient groundwater flow velocity the flow direction velocity increases significantly the longitudinal distance increases by 28 00 the transverse displacement distance of the oxidant decreases by 23 40 the swept area of the oxidant increases by 5 10 and the average radial dispersion coefficient increases linearly with the flow velocity the ambient groundwater flow velocity increases the mixing of the oxidant with the contamination plume the increase in injection rate and ambient flow velocity improves the mixing of oxidant and contaminated plume but also intensifies the contamination expansion changing the injection model e g linear injection which enhances the mixing of the oxidant contaminated plume without aggravating the expansion of the pollution plume is an effective method therefore during the on site injection stage attention should be given to the expansion of the pollution plume caused by changes in the local flow velocity of artificial injection which will increase the difficulty of in situ remediation and affect the health of groundwater credit authorship contribution

e g dominated by interfacial driving r c c0 0 5 combined with dispersion mixing was used to obtain the position of the boundary r f at the mixing fringe of the injected fluid the results show that the injected oxidant front ran after the contaminated plume at a migration velocity of more than 1 29 times increasing the mechanical dispersion difference between potassium permanganate and naphthol green b the increase in the injection rate and ambient groundwater flow velocity improved the mixing of oxidant and contaminated plume the area difference between the contaminated plume and the oxidant decreased but also accelerated the contaminated plume coverage changing the injection mode such as linear injection was an effective method which enhanced the mixing of the oxidant contamination plume and weakly expanded the contaminated plume the swept area 254 cm2 was the smallest among the three injection modes the relationship between injection and mixing needs to be further strengthened keywords radial injection contamination plume agent driving mixing dispersion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the most common chlorinated organic solvent compounds in groundwater such as tetrachloroethylene trichloroethylene carbon tetrachloride and vinyl chloride tend to form large groundwater contamination plumes significantly impacting regional water resource sustainability brusseau et al 2011 in situ remediation is a commonly used technique for groundwater remediation it typically involves the injection of a reagent into the subsurface to create a zone in which biological and or chemical reactions lead to the destruction of contaminants song et al 2020 for example chemical oxidants are injected to destroy or transform a range of contaminants brau et al 2017 toth et al 2020 trevelyan and walker 2018 following the injection of a reagent solution into the subsurface the mixing and degradation reactions occur only where the amendment and contaminant are sufficiently close so that mixing can bring them together to react neupauer et al 2020 mixing in porous media is usually very poor because the flow in porous media is laminar as a result the injected fluid does not mix with the resident fluid and in situ remediations are confined to a narrow fluid interface between the injected plume of the treatment solution and the contaminated groundwater mays and neupauer 2012 with simplifying assumptions and boundary conditions analytical solutions for the shape of this sharp interface as a function of radial injection pore volume can be obtained lai et al 2016 this is the cumulative sweep area after chemical amendment injection however sizable traces of the injected oxidant may appear outside this boundary due to mechanical dispersion a mass transfer mechanism where velocity changes on the pore scale cause the fluid to spread out bear 1972 hyatt and leonenko 2022 this will cause the concentration of the injected fluid to smoothly decay around the region where this sharp boundary would be and this phenomenon has been examined in previous studies huang and chen 2015 mays and neupauer 2012 tang and van der zee 2021 trevelyan and walker 2018 therefore it is not difficult to understand that radial dispersion is the limiting step of mixing and reaction at the interface front and the radial dispersion characteristics of the solute have an impact on the properties of the interface front between the oxidant and pollution plume in earlier studies the dispersivities or dispersion coefficients obtained from the analysis of the breakthrough curves btcs by the advection dispersion equation ade are constant bear 1972 pang and hunt 2001 scheidegger 1961 but this situation does not correspond to the actual situation which increases with travel distance or time gao et al 2010 huang et al 2006 many authors have attempted to obtain analytical or numerical solutions for ades with distance dependent dispersion guo et al 2016 neuman 1991 pang and hunt 2001 pickens and grisak 1981 chen 1987 addressed analytical solutions related to a continuous and a pulse injection were determined for the radial dispersion problem concerning such a cauchy boundary condition hsieh proposed a simpler analytical solution to the radial dispersion problem hsieh 1986 chen et al obtained a semi analytical solution of one or two dimensional ade for solute transport in radially convergent or divergent flow with linear scale dependent dispersion chen 2007 chen et al 2007 lai et al 2016 used laplace and generalized integral transformations to obtain exact analytical solutions for radial solute transport with excellent agreement most studies did not compare their analytical solutions with experimental data in the vicinity of the injection well the groundwater velocity caused by injection is larger than the ambient groundwater flow velocity cha and borden 2012 and the flow field around the injection well is almost radial neupauer et al 2020 therefore it is advantageous to analyze radial flow the radial dispersion coefficient is positively correlated with the radial velocity of the solute ignoring molecular diffusion which means that slight changes in the solute transport velocity in the porous medium may cause changes in the dispersion characteristics of the oxidant or contaminated plume which in turn affects the mixing and reaction with the contamination plume after the injected oxidant their interfacial driving and the spreading of the contamination plume this is directly related to the remediation strategy although some studies have noted that the mixing of different solute fronts influences the properties of such a b c fronts ballarini et al 2012 gramling et al 2002 willingham et al 2008 ye et al 2015 the radial advection dispersion case where a diffuses radially into a pool of b such that the contact interface is an expanding circle has received less attention this is related to the impossibility of indefinitely sustaining a constant concentration of a at the initial point source because of diffusion and thus finding the asymptotic properties of such radial fronts brau and de wit 2020 however this procedure represents the initial step in injecting amendments into the contaminant plume during in situ remediation in song s research song et al 2020 quantitative parameters such as the migration distance migration area and area ratio of the remediation agent and pollutants were intuitively analyzed by image analysis the effect of radial injection of solute dispersion was not analyzed and there was no corresponding mathematical model analysis therefore the present study based on song et al 2020 considers the mechanical dispersion process with different injection schemes and ambient flow and applies it to generic interface geometries extending beyond the circle boundary case this allows quantifying a more precise peripheral boundary cutoff for the distances at which traces of the injected fluid may appear in the aquifer that is the boundary position r f at the mixing edge of the injected fluid is obtained through experiments and simple theoretical analysis in addition we also explore the velocity variation factor that can cause the dispersion characteristics of the pore media at this initial step such as the injection rate injection mode and ambient groundwater flow velocity to quantitatively describe oxidant front driving spreading of contamination plume and analyze oxidant contamination plume interface migration and mixing 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setting and test scenarios the experimental setup for the radial transport test was composed of a 2d sandbox consisting of three chambers the main chamber 4000 cm3 housed the sand and had internal dimensions of 50 cm length by 40 cm width by 2 cm height the other two chambers were upgradient inlet and downgradient outlet of the main chamber holes with a diameter of 1 5 mm were evenly drilled in the lucite plate at the inlet and outlet to ensure uniform distribution of fluid fig s1 a schematic of the flow cell is presented in fig 1 the model was made of plexiglass with 0 6 cm thick walls and completely sealed to resist high injection pressure the specific sandbox size is shown in fig s1 in si the quartz sand 20 40 mesh 0 51 mm from sinopharm chemical agent co ltd was packed homogeneously under water saturated conditions in the sandbox avoiding the presence of air and the formation of areas with different compaction after packing 5 pv di water was flushed through the sandbox to stabilize the water flow in the pore medium an injection port was provided at the center of the sandbox for emplacement contamination plumes and for injecting the remediation agents the average porosity and dry bulk density values listed in table s1 were obtained gravimetrically the packed systems had an average porosity of approximately 0 39 and a total pore volume pv of 1 56 10 3 m3 the entire experimental setup included a 2d sandbox light source camera and peristaltic pump power unit fig 2 details of the 9 experiments in the 3 groups are presented in table 1 in all experimental groups potassium permanganate sino pharmaceutical beijing 200 mg l was used as the remediation agent and naphthol green b aladdin china 20 mg l was used as the contaminated plume which was emplaced 0 129 pv into the tank before the experiment in the first three experiments the oxidant was injected at a rate of 5 10 and 30 ml min from the central injection port three injection oxidant modes in experimental group 2 fig 3 were designed including linear injection constant injection and periodic injection the linear injection scheme was q 2 344 t fig 3 and the equivalent constant injection rate was 10 ml min out of a plethora of possibilities for time varying injection scenarios the simplest procedure was piecewise constant pumping specifically we split the time interval t0 t1 into t0 t m during which the constant injection rate was q 10 ml min and t m t1 with t m 10 m 1 min t0 10 m min and t1 10 m 2 min m 0 2 4 2i for which the injection was stopped the first two groups of experiments did not consider the ambient flow considering the actual ambient velocities are due to spatial variations in water velocity that may result in changes in mechanical dispersion at the injection plume front therefore group 3 was set to inject oxidants at a rate of 10 ml min under 1 0 2 5 and 5 0 m day ambient flow velocity the volume of oxidant injected into the sandbox was the same in all experimental groups the effluent was temporarily sampled every 2 to 6 min using gastight needles from the sampling ports and the absorbance of potassium permanganate wavelength 526 and naphthol green b wavelength 710 were analyzed the fluid height in a liquid column manometer measured the pressure of the sandbox and the sampling points and pressure measuring points are shown in fig 1 a digital camera sony dsc rx100m7g was used to record plume solute movement and coverage of the potassium permanganate 2 2 image processing methods the left bottom corner of the flow cell was denoted as x y 0 0 the concentration distribution of the solute c x y t where x and y were the spatial coordinates in the horizontal plane was reconstructed from the recorded images of the dynamics for this purpose we established a radial injection solute concentration image analysis method the basic image analysis protocol included the following steps which were elaborated on 1 extracting their information 2 selection of the color space 3 correction image 4 normalization image 5 background leveling and 6 calibration see the supporting information for details the evolution of the interface was captured using a digital video camera the images were analyzed in imagej software to track the position of the front and extract its behavior 2 3 analytical solution of radial transport to simulate the spreading and displacement of the fluid plume during radial injection in a porous medium and compare it to the image analysis data a two dimensional advection dispersion model was applied for the sake of simplicity we assumed that the two kinds of solution the indigenous water contaminated plume naphthol green b in the aquifer and the remediation agent potassium permanganate injected into the aquifer through wells were distinguishable by an abrupt front bear 1972 hyatt and leonenko 2022 the aquifer was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic chokejaroenrat et al 2013 unless otherwise specified the density and viscosity of the two kinds of water were identical willingham et al 2008 considering the case of a fully penetrating well in the aquifer of constant thickness b potassium permanganate was injected at a constant rate q l3 t the concentrations of the indigenous water in the aquifer and of the injection water were 0 and c0 respectively the sorption and decay processes are ignored and the following governing equation can be expressed bear 1972 1 c t d r 2 c r 2 v r c r initial and boundary conditions 2 c r 0 0 r r w c r w t c 0 t 0 c r t 0 t 0 where d r α l v r d aq n c is the solute concentration m l3 t is the time t r is the radial distance measured from the center of the injection zone l r w is well radius l d r is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2 t d aq is the aqueous diffusion coefficient l2 t α l is the longitudinal dispersivity l v r represents the linear average velocity in the radial direction l t and n is the porosity of porous media 3 q 2 π r b n v r therefore 4 v r q 2 π r b n q 2 π b n 1 r where n is the effective porosity of porous media and b is the thickness of saturated aquifer l at time t the total volume of agent injected into the well with radius r w is 5 v 0 t q t d t π r f 2 b n r w r f therefore when r f r c c0 0 5 where r f represent the distance of the front l the exact analytical solution of eq 1 has been found chen 1987 hsieh 1986 lai et al 2016 tang and babu 1979 here we still use the classical approximate solutions eq 6 and 7 this assumption is approximately true away from the immediate vicinity of the source they also stated that eq 6 approximates a numerical solution of eq 1 for distances larger than 20 particle diameters from the well hoopes and harleman thought that eq 6 can be used as a good approximation to describe the dispersion phenomenon in radially diverging fields and also experimentally proves this result hoopes and harleman 1967 in addition in the exact analytical solutions obtained by subsequent researchers using the same model the approximate solutions have similar accuracy to the exact analytical solutions chen 1987 hsieh 1986 the approximate analytical solution of this equation is therefore reasonable for the radial distribution of a conservative dissolved substance which is injected into a homogeneous isotropic confined aquifer by a well in addition it should be pointed out that eq 6 and 7 are available for the situation of zero ambient flow and more specific analytical solutions can be referred to chen et al 2016 6 c r t c 0 1 2 e r

estimation of longitudinal dispersivity flow velocities and solute dispersion are key parameters for the description of fluid and solute transport in porous media delgado 2007 therefore several tests were performed to validate the parameter sensitivity by considering different concentrations injection rates injection positions and sampling positions a total of 300 ml potassium permanganate was injected into a two dimensional sandbox filled with water at different rates 5 10 and 30 ml min the detailed analysis of the images taken during the test allowed an accurate description of the transport process the image processing carried out on the plume images see si provided the concentration field in the study area for each monitoring time fig 5 shows the concentration breakthrough curve of potassium permanganate where monitoring point 3 was located as shown in fig 1 fig 6 shows the concentration decline curve from the center of the sandbox to the edge of the plume after the dye was emplaced into the sandbox 200 ml through experimental and theoretical derivation the radial dispersivity of potassium permanganate was 0 158 cm and the dispersivity was 0 162 cm using the best fitting of the experimental values the two values were similar therefore we took 0 16 cm as the parameter value of the dispersivity of potassium permanganate fig 6 shows that the experimental dispersivity of naphthol green b was 0 45 cm and the dispersivity obtained by the best fitting experimental was 0 35 cm therefore the average value of 0 40 cm was taken as the dispersivity of the dye in addition the dispersivity of tetrachloroethylene pce was 0 387 cm in a one dimensional column penetration test which is another reason why we chose naphthol green b as an aquifer contaminant therefore in the next experiments we assumed that no chemical reaction occurred between the injected oxidant and contaminant and only the displacement of physical factors was considered judging from the experimental results the dispersibility of oxidants was less than that of the contaminant which suggests that the dispersion and spreading of contaminated plumes cannot be ignored to test the validity of the imaging procedure a mass balance comparing the injected oxidants or contaminants with the volume calculated from the acquired pictures was performed at a certain time t the resident quantity mr t in each discretized image was calculated by eq 10 citarella et al 2015 10 m r t c x y t n d x d y area c x y t n b a pix where c x y t m l3 is the average concentration in the aggregated pixel area a pix l 2 with centroid location x l y l at time t t by assuming that the concentration is homogeneously distributed along the tank thickness b the total resident mass m r t m can be compared to the injected mass at the same time m inj t m 11 m inj t q inj c inj t see table 2 for specific data when the plume was completely and constantly injected into the sandbox the cumulative mass released presented a linear trend and the value grew over time until the end of the injection the relative errors were 2 12 and 6 54 suggesting that the resident quantity m r t fit satisfactorily with the mass line injected in addition the difference between the concentration of the sample analyzed in the experiment and the concentration obtained by the image method analysis was 1 07 6 51 it also shows that the dispersion characteristics of oxidants and pollutants obtained by the abovementioned image analysis method were more reliable 3 2 moving velocities of oxidant and contamination fronts when the oxidant was injected into the contaminated plume at 5 10 and 30 ml min the experimental results were shown in fig 7 and the more detailed experimental images were in the si fig s3 it was clearly observed that a concentric plume formed after the oxidant was injected into the contamination plume the width of the transition zone is relatively small and the abrupt interface c c0 0 5 used to describe the approximation movement of the plume front is applicable the rate of oxidant driving and contamination plume spreading is as shown in fig 8 when the radial injection rate is 30 ml min for 10 min the interface velocity of the oxidant is 0 553 cm min fig s3 and the velocity of the contaminated plume front is 0 429 cm min while the radial injection rate is 5 ml min for 60 min the pore volume of the injected oxidant is the same the interface velocity of the oxidant is 0 092 cm min fig s3 and the speed of the polluted plume front is 0 071 cm min at different injection rates the oxidant advancing velocity is larger than that of the contaminated plume and the oxidant interface front velocity with a high oxidant injection rate is 6 14 times that of low oxidant injection as shown in fig 8b the velocity difference vd continuously decreases between oxidant driving and contamination plume expansion which indicates that the oxidant affected area is continuously accelerating to cover the contaminated plume area however it should be noted that the expansion rate of the contaminated plume front at a high injection rate is also 6 04 times that of the low injection rate which means that the high injection rate also expands the pollution range of the plume this is not conducive to the remediation of polluted aquifers the most noticeable aspect of the data is from the pressure port in fig 1 which shows that the pressure injected at 30 ml min is 12 34 times higher than that injected at 5 ml min indicating that a high injection rate increases energy consumption and leads to the risk of hydraulic fracturing gale et al 2015 the experimental results of three radial injection strategies fig 3 were shown in fig 7 and the more detailed experimental images were in the si fig s3 s5 when linear injection occurs the injection rate is q 2 344 t and the oxidant front driving velocity can be obtained from eq 4 and eq 17 v r q 2 π b n 1 r k 2 π n b 0 692 cm min that is the linear injection oxidant is driven at a constant speed fig 9 a if we now turn to the spreading velocity of the contaminated plume we find that the velocity gradually increases and tends to stabilize fig 9b for constant and periodic injection the expansion speed is relatively similar regardless of the oxidant or the contaminated plume fig 7 shows the solute coverage at different ambient groundwater flow velocities after injecting 0 10 pv oxidant and the more detailed experimental images were in the si fig s6 at the ambient groundwater flow of 1 0 m d the shape of the plume is approximately circular the inner ring is the oxidant the semimajor axis is 24 65 cm after injection of 0 192 pv oxidant and the outer ring is the contaminated plume the semimajor axis is 33 33 cm after injection of 0 192 pv oxidant fig s6 however when the ambient velocity increases to larger values of 2 5 and 5 0 m d the oxidant and contamination infiltrate at a faster speed the center of both the oxidant and the pollutant plume moves rapidly downstream and the migration path changes long and narrow especially after injecting 0 192 pv oxidant the difference between different ambient groundwater flow velocities is more obvious fig s6 these results indicate that the larger ambient groundwater flow velocity promotes the longitudinal transport of the solute and weakens the transverse diffusion resulting in changes in the percolation path and transport velocity in the porous medium the increase in flow velocity also promotes the redistribution of the contamination plume expanding the contamination range of the contaminants in general considering the ambient groundwater flow velocity the largest difference is that the transverse spreading distance is reduced fig s6 the longitudinal velocity is increased fig 10 and most of the plume is transmitted along the direction of the water flow which makes it look narrower and longer as the ambient groundwater flow velocity increases this trend becomes more obvious therefore what can be clearly seen in fig s6 is the continual growth of the injected oxidant in the x direction and the extension of the contaminated plume in the same direction the transverse spreading distance decrease may have been an important factor in the longitudinal water pressure weakening the transverse dispersion of radial injection another possible explanation for this is that the transport of solute under the radius of the oxidant injection source was not considered lai et al 2016 4 discussions 4 1 potential mixing effect of oxidant and contamination the ambient groundwater flow velocity is assumed to be negligible and the velocity field in the aquifer is strictly radial in the direction outward from the injection site we can use the above average velocity fig 8 to determine the furthest radial extent of the interface to be determined after injecting for a certain period however the interface between the injected and residual fluids is never sharp there is always dispersion of the fluids due to mass transfer effects occurring at the interface therefore we use r f l as a measure of the displacement of the oxidant interface and the pollution plume front 12 r f r σ qt π n b 2 3 α l r where σ is the standard deviation of the plume concentration distribution l at this time the area driven by the expanded oxidant and contamination plume can be expressed as 13 a π r 2 3 α l r 2 therefore the difference between the oxidant driving area and the expansion area of the pollution plume can be expressed as 14 a 0 a 2 a 1 π r 2 2 3 α cl r 2 2 π r 1 2 3 α ol r 1 2 a2 represents the expansion area of the contaminated plume l2 and a1 represents the area driven by radial injection of oxidant l2 where r 1 qt π n b r 2 200 q t π n b fig 11 a shows that without considering dispersion the radius of interest of the oxidant and the spreading extent of the pollution plume is smaller than those considering the dispersion characteristics regardless of theoretical analysis or experimental analysis the theoretical displacement value of ade is relatively close to the experimental analysis displacement value the dispersion of the solute causes the contaminated plume to move farther and expands the pollution range we also know that the solute dispersion coefficient is proportional to the average velocity dentz et al 2018 therefore the greater the radial driving force is the greater the displacement distance of the pollution plume caused by the dispersion within the same time the extent of displacement of the contaminated plume and the difference in the radius of interest of the oxidant are shown in fig 11b when only advection is considered the displacement difference between the two gradually decreases with the injection pore volume in contrast under the ade model their displacement difference first increases and then decreases and the minimum difference value is 5 833 cm at 0 657 pv this proves that there is an optimal injection volume that minimizes the expansion distance of the contaminated plume and shows the importance of solute dispersion for plume expansion when the remediation agent is injected into wells the difference in the displacement caused by the plume velocity is directly reflected in the area therefore the area comparison of the oxidant and the contaminated plume and the area difference shows the degree of mixing between them see si for specific theories kitanidis 1994 fig s7a b and c reveal that there has been a steady rise in the oxidant driving area and contaminated plume expansion area the contaminated plume area of the three injection rates increased by 143 160 and 154 and the difference between the expanded area of the contaminated plume and the swept area of the oxidant finally decreased by 11 37 22 46 and 14 51 respectively it shows that the mixing ability of the injected oxidant plume and the contaminated plume is enhanced and the enhancement of the injection rate is beneficial to the mixing between them a possible explanation for this might be assumed in which the average radial velocity on the solute coverage area represents the radial velocity 15 v 2 π r r r 0 v r d r π r 2 the radial dispersion coefficient is simplified as 16 d r α l v fig 12 a shows the relationship between the dispersion coefficient of the oxidant contaminated plume and the driving distance at different injection rates the dispersion coefficient of the oxidant plume gradually decreases with radial distance while the dispersion coefficient of the pollution plume gradually increases with expansion distance however the dispersion coefficient of the oxidant is larger than that of the pollution plume at the same injection flow rate this means that the mixing ability of the oxidant increases with the injection which explains why the mixing area of the oxidant and the pollution plume is increasing in the experiment and with the increase in injection rate the dispersive ability difference between the oxidant and contaminated plume is increasing fig 12b this is favorable for the mixing of the oxidant active diffusion stage with the contaminated plume which is more favorable for the remediation efficiency of the in situ injected oxidant the more intuitive reason is that the migration speed of the oxidant interface near the injection well is much greater than the expansion speed of the pollution plume front the mechanical mixing effect is more significant and the sweeping range is wider resulting in a reduction in the difference between the expansion area of the contaminated plume and the spread area of the oxidant in observational studies there is a potential for bias from the early stage of oxidant injection in which the difference between the expansion area of the contaminated plume and the spread area of the oxidant is increasing which may be caused by the driving force of injection another possible explanation for this is the limitation of our hypothesis in which the injected fluid and resident fluid are immiscible and form sharp interface separating regions in fact due to the inhomogeneous saturated aquifer the hydrodynamic dispersion of the fluid causes the uneven transport speed of the solute which lengthens the contact interface between the injected remediation agent and the contaminated groundwater and generates an injected treatment plume driven by stretching and folding mays and neupauer 2012 this finding is consistent with that of neupauer and cho who thought that this enhanced spreading results from local velocity variations that emerge from aquifer heterogeneity and from spatial variations in the external forcings that drive flow cho et al 2019 neupauer et al 2014 therefore the actual interface driving increases the mixing between the injected oxidant and the contaminated plume and reduces the spreading area difference of the contaminated plume 4 2 the impact of the injection scheme three radial injection strategies fig 3 were selected to inject the same volume of oxidant for the contaminated plume expansion experiment according to the principle of continuity the linear injection volume v l3 is expressed as 17 v 1 2 k t 2 π n r 2 b where k is the linear ratio of injection for periodic injection during the t0 tm the constant injection period the plume front is measured by r f r σ qt π n b 2 3 α l r in the tm t1 period stop injection and the plume is displaced by solute diffusion according to the diffusion problem the transmission distance is x l 18 x ϕ 4 d d t where ϕ e r f c c 0 however during the injection stop period the sampling concentration in the experiment shows that the migration of the plume is not a simple diffusion therefore the correction coefficient k is obtained from the experiment and the corrected displacement is obtained in this experiment when c c0 0 7 and ϕ 0 25 the k value is 3 46 19 x k ϕ 4 d d t at this time the plume displacement in a period can be expressed as 20 r f r σ r σ k ϕ 4 d d t for different injection modes the expansion displacement of the contaminated plume does not change significantly fig 13 a in contrast it has a significant impact on the radius of interest of the injected oxidant for example compared with constant injection the oxidant plume interface can be driven a certain distance by using buffer power for some time periodic injection during the divergent phases the cumulative swept area rapidly increases with time as oxidants from the injection well are pushed to spread divergently fig 14 c however during the tm t1 period stop injection the cumulative swept area slowly increases with time from the injection well and the concentration of potassium permanganate from sampling ports 1 2 and 3 increases 3 6 1 3 and 2 7 times respectively the mixing zone c c0 0 3 0 9 increases by 11 12 27 50 as shown in fig 14c during 0 192 pv oxidant injection the corresponding contaminated plume area increases to 657 99 cm2 the original area is 319 79 cm2 while the area difference of the contaminated plume decreases these results are also basically consistent for linear injection and the mixing zone c c0 0 3 0 9 increases by 19 5 what can be clearly seen in fig 14 is the general decline in the area difference of the contaminated plume the area difference during linear injection is the smallest which is 254 cm2 fig 14a we also average the radial velocity over the swept area of the plume periodic and constant injection are similar therefore the radial velocity at the interface of the linear injection contamination plume is expressed as 21 v r 2 k π n b r 2 200 2 π n b r substituting into eq 15 determines the average radial velocity and the dispersion coefficient is obtained as a function of radial distance fig s8 compared to constant injection the dispersion difference between the oxidant and contamination plume increases whether it is linear injection or periodic injection which indicates that the mixing ability of the two solutes in contact after oxidant injection is enhanced this also explains the reason for the reduction in the difference between the oxidant sweep and the expansion area of the contaminated plume in these two injection modes therefore the analysis of the results suggests that a weak link may exist between interface mixing and injection modes taken together these results suggest that there is a relationship between the effective spreading of the oxidant and the expansion of the contaminated plume the time dependent injection rate including linear injection and periodic alternation was employed different from the widely applied constant injection rate this time dependent displacement rate results in different flow dynamics and sweep efficiency even though the injected volume is the same suk et al 2021 in particular compared with constant injection time dependent injection chaotic advection agitates oxidant transmission increases plume interface length enhances plume spreading and leads to significant solute mixing by stretching and folding the fluid interface between the injected treatment solution and contaminated groundwater coutinho and miranda 2020 huang and chen 2015 suk et al 2021 larger cumulative swept areas have greater contact between the remedial agent and contaminants leading to a more significant reduction in groundwater contaminants ultimately enhancing remediation neupauer et al 2020 toth et al 2020 trevelyan and walker 2018 the decreased area difference in the contaminated plume in this study corroborates these earlier findings compared to periodic injection it appears that linear injection has a faster cumulative swept area increase and a smaller plume oxidant expansion area difference in terms of injection volume time linear injection mode is the most efficient because linear injection lasts for 16 min but in the late stage of linear injection the pressure value at the pressure point is 15 times the pressure at the constant injection rate of 5 ml min 4 3 the impact of ambient groundwater flow the above experiments ignore the ambient groundwater flow velocity but in actual site remediation the ambient groundwater flow velocity is different therefore we need to consider the influence of different water flow velocities on the expansion and migration of pollution plumes injected radially by the remediation agent in addition it is also verified whether the above flow rate leads to the enhancement of mixing the experimental velocity may be larger than the actual site flow velocity to highlight the effect of flow velocity on plume expansion fig s6 the maximum influence radius is 22 r f r q 0 n t 2 d l t 23 d l d aq n α l v x where q 0 represents the seepage velocity l t and d l is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient l2 t due to the limitation of the size of the sand tank it is impossible to measure the spreading area of the completely contaminated plume but under the effect of the water flow fig s9 the area affected by the injected oxidant increases from 267 8 to 281 5 cm2 fig s10 it can be clearly seen from the processed image that the length of the mixing zone in the downstream area of the water flow increases fig s6 in addition the spread area difference of the contaminated plume first increases and then decreases and as the water flow rate increases the area difference decreases when the same volume is injected fig s10d we also used the mean radial velocity to quantify the diffusive mixing capacity of the plume for injections with ambient groundwater flow 24 v 2 π r r r 0 v r d r π r 2 v where v is the ambient groundwater flow velocity l t the displacement in the flow direction r is replaced by r l 25 r r v t fig 15 a shows that the dispersion capacity of the oxidant pollution plume increases as the flow rate increases there is a relationship between the dispersion coefficient and ambient groundwater flow fig 15b we establish a relationship between the dispersion coefficient after injecting 0 192 pv oxidant and ambient groundwater flow it is found that the ambient groundwater flow has a positive correlation with the dispersion coefficient of the oxidant pollution plume at a low flow rate the oxidant dispersion capacity is stronger than that of the contaminated plume which strengthens the mixing of the oxidant and pollution plume this is why the area difference in fig s10 is reduced at the same time it is also found that the dispersion ability of the contaminated plume increases with the flow rate and is greater than that of the oxidant in the later stage of injection the dispersion ability is stronger than that of the oxidant this is good news for the mixing of the oxidant and the contaminated plume but bad news for increasing the expansion area of the contaminated plume at the later stage of injection in actual site remediation the heterogeneity of the underground medium causes the difference in microscopic pore velocities to increase which increases the diffusion range of the contaminated plume and pollutes a wider range of water quality these are not friendly for in situ remediation these factors may explain the relative correlation between the ambient groundwater flow velocity and the mixing of the plume interface a possible consequence can be the transportation and displacement of a contaminated plume due to naturally or anthropogenically induced high groundwater flow velocities complicating the site investigation process and planning of remediation activities erning et al 2012 flushing velocity is an important factor that impacts contaminated plume remediation in several ways which is an indicator of the mass depletion rate within the system and increases with increasing velocity petri et al 2008 another positive result is that high water velocity increases the overall contact interface between oxidant plumes and contaminated plumes promotes mass transfer and deepens the mixing between them in addition it can be seen that the increase in flow rate also increases the dispersion coefficient and causes further mixing from eq 16 and our experimental results that is the increase in interface length and dispersion ability further deepens the mixing of oxidants and contaminants it can be inferred that if it is a reactive injection it will promote complete oxidation and the generated reaction products should increase with the water flow rate which is more beneficial to in situ remediation the amount of mass mixing rate enhancement caused by the presence of the plume area difference is positively impacted by velocity as evidenced by a significant decrease in the plume area difference with increasing velocities fig s10d this is similar to a prediction made by petri b g petri et al 2008 and several mechanisms can explain this effect velocity also has an impact on the pore volume flushing efficiency which decreases with increasing velocity at high velocities larger molar amounts of oxidant are introduced more rapidly into the contaminated zone and some oxidants may transport downstream without contacting enough pore volume leading to the area affected by the injected oxidant increasing thereby increasing the mixing zone 4 4 limitations of the experimental work some limitations of the experiment need to be explained firstly since the pressure from the pressure point 1 7 fig 1 rose instantaneously and the change range was small we took the average increase value from the points 1 7 the increase of 0 08 0 17 0 47 cm at the injection rate of 5 10 and 30 ml min respectively also only the concentration at sampling point 3 fig 5 was analyzed because the transition zone could be effectively observed under different injection rates secondly the plume front has a low concentration 50 mg l that correlates well with the light intensity in this range which does not affect the front analysis of the plume thirdly the oxidant contaminated plume lost a circle shape when pv is high due to the randomness of the filled quartz sand this might reduce the transport of the plume front at high injection rates but the plume sheared by the heterogeneous medium might increase the mixing of the oxidant with the contamination plume it is clear that a mechanical dispersion model for radial injection can allow the injected fluid concentration transition zone to expand considerably on either side of a sharp interface solution figs 11 13 the radial driving displacement of the plume evaluated by the constant dispersion coefficient matches the experimental value of the small sandbox model dispersivity is 0 16 cm and 0 40 cm which is close to the experimental data 0 15 cm of hoopes hoopes and harleman 1967 a higher injection rate is beneficial for mixing between oxidant and contaminated plume gale et al 2015 the linear injection scheme does stabilize the interface at early times and thus results in slower growth of the contaminated plume which agrees excellently with the experimental results huang and chen 2015 and the periodic injection amplifies the diffusion of solute and enhances the mixing suk et al 2021 the ambient groundwater flows velocity enhances the contact boundary and expands the range of contaminated plume in addition our experiments are conducted in a homogeneous isotropic aquifer of a finite horizontal extent but it was shown in many experimental works that it is scale dependent gao et al 2010 pang and hunt 2001 yeh 1987 the consistency of study is likely to exist and be visible on a small scale and the dispersion may increase with the distance and time of solute transport there is no guarantee that measured characteristics will work on large practical scales we have also observed such deviations which may become larger with the increase of scale 5 conclusion the understanding of mixing and dispersion processes between in situ injected radial flow and contaminated flow is one of the current major challenges in subsurface hydrology the sharp interface solution of injected fluid remediation agent often underestimates the upper limit of its radial location without considering mechanical dispersion this study allows for quantifying an upper boundary cutoff eg rf r σ for the bigger mixing zone at which traces of the injected fluid are effectively saturated exhibiting the desired concentration cutoff the main conclusions are as follows the average radial dispersive mixing capacity is positively correlated with the injection rate the injection rate mainly affects the plume driving of the oxidant contamination the high oxidant injection rate interface catches up with the contaminated plume range at a higher speed the interface driving velocity of high rate injection is 6 14 times that of low rate injection which enhances the mixing degree of the oxidant and contaminated plume and reduces their area difference by 11 37 22 46 and 14 51 at injection rates of 5 10 and 30 ml min respectively compared with constant injection the mixed area of the oxidant and pollution plume c c0 0 3 0 9 injected periodically increases by 11 12 27 50 during linearly increased rate injection the difference in the expansion area of the pollution plume is the smallest which is 254 cm2 the injection modes related to the time dependent injection rate can significantly increase the mixing area of the radial injection oxidant and contaminated zone increased by 19 53 27 50 and under the dispersion effect the mixing effect is stronger under the action of ambient groundwater flow velocity the flow direction velocity increases significantly the longitudinal distance increases by 28 00 the transverse displacement distance of the oxidant decreases by 23 40 the swept area of the oxidant increases by 5 10 and the average radial dispersion coefficient increases linearly with the flow velocity the ambient groundwater flow velocity increases the mixing of the oxidant with the contamination plume the increase in injection rate and ambient flow velocity improves the mixing of oxidant and contaminated plume but also intensifies the contamination expansion changing the injection model e g linear injection which enhances the mixing of the oxidant contaminated plume without aggravating the expansion of the pollution plume is an effective method therefore during the on site injection stage attention should be given to the expansion of the pollution plume caused by changes in the local flow velocity of artificial injection which will increase the difficulty of in situ remediation and affect the health of groundwater credit authorship contribution

2279,timely and accurate estimation of soil moisture content smc is essential for precise irrigation management at the farm scale unmanned aerial vehicle uav remote sensing with a high spatiotemporal resolution has become a promising method for smc monitoring many existing smc models have only been tested at a specific crop growth stage using a single type of sensor and the effects of growth stage and irrigation variation on smc estimation accuracy remain unclear to address these limitations this study used uav based multimodal data to quantify smc in a maize field under various levels of irrigation over two years using three machine learning algorithms mla partial least squares regression plsr k nearest neighbor knn and random forest regression rfr the results demonstrated that multimodal data fusion improves the smc estimation accuracy regardless of the mla especially the joint use of thermal and multispectral data among three smc regression models the rfr model produced the most accurate smc estimation for the two growing seasons regardless of sensor combinations the rfr model using all three types of data generated the most accurate and robust smc estimation at the vegetative stage with r2 of 0 68 and 0 78 and rrmse of 20 82 and 19 36 for 10 and 20 cm soil depths respectively it also produced the best smc estimation accuracy under well watered and mild to modest deficit irrigation treatments for both soil depths the study shows that the high spatial temporal maps of smc using uav based multimodal data has promising potential for supporting decision making in irrigation scheduling at the farmland scale keywords unmanned aerial vehicle uav soil moisture content smc machine learning maize growth stages deficit irrigation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture content smc plays an important role in agricultural meteorological climatological and hydrological applications a proper decision for precision irrigation is facilitated by accurate information about the smc at an appropriate spatial and temporal scale it is difficult to obtain spatially continuous observations using conventional in situ methods of smc measurement such as the drying method o kelly and sivakumar 2014 time domain reflectometry robinson et al 2003 neutron probe measurements evett and steiner 1995 and heat pulse measurements agliata et al 2019 owing to discrete sampling points and high cost guo et al 2022 with significant advances in remote sensing technology satellite data have been widely applied to smc estimation particularly the optical serrano et al 2019 thermal sohrabinia et al 2014 and microwave chen et al 2018 observations nevertheless the application of satellite data for smc estimation is limited by the low resolution and near surface depth of the measurements unmanned aerial vehicle uav technology provides high spatio temporal resolution data for estimating smc hill et al 2017 several studies have successfully used uav based optical remote sensing for smc estimation mainly in the near infrared and visible bands to establish vegetation indices vis kogan 1990 ge et al 2021 moreover uav based thermal remote sensing has been shown to accurately predict farmland moisture li et al 2022 recent studies have shown that integrating multi source remote sensing data can be effectively used for smc estimation for example wigmore et al 2019 used multispectral ms and thermal tir data from uav remote sensing to calculate the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi which was applied to predict surface smc within mountain environments and obtained results with r2 0 55 0 76 cheng et al 2022 combined uav based multimodal data to estimate the smc under high maize canopy coverage and obtained results with r2 0 78 guo et al 2022 combined microwave remote sensing and uav multispectral remote sensing to monitor smc in a winter wheat planting area and obtained results with r2 0 92 nevertheless microwaves cannot penetrate dense fields with tall plants such as maize therefore uav based optical and thermal sensing has been widely used in current research on smc estimations cheng et al 2022 because of the correlation between vegetation spectrum and smc under agricultural crops various parametric and non parametric regression models have been implemented to monitor smc e g machine learning algorithms mla chen et al 2021 döpper et al 2022 to improve the performance of smc estimation in saline soils partial least squares regression plsr with thermal infrared data was used to build the smc prediction model xu and wang 2015 ge et al 2019 applied the random forest regression rfr algorithm to predict the smc in winter wheat using uav based hyperspectral imagery consequently choosing a proper regression algorithm is essential for achieving accurate smc predictions for dense vegetation generally most approaches to estimating smc using a combination of uav remote sensing and mla have been applied at a specific growth stage or a single growth day cheng et al 2022 guo et al 2022 however the dynamics of vis and smc continuously change over time additionally one smc value may correspond to multiple vis and thus may affect the performance of the smc estimation however only a limited number of studies have been conducted to monitor smc using uav remote sensing and mla during the entire crop growing season furthermore smc estimation models were only tested and trained for one year and several samples seo et al 2021 crops are susceptible to changes in smc and spectral reflectance of maize canopy varies with growth stage and soil water content although uav remote sensing has been applied to smc prediction at arid and semi arid sites babaeian et al 2021 the irrigation regimes are the same therefore verification of smc is limited few studies have focused on different water treatments for crops thus the performance of smc estimation using vis and mla at different growth stages of crops under different water treatments is still unclear based on the above analysis this study used the smc under the maize planting area as the research object and acquired rgb ms and tir data at different growth stages of maize under different irrigation treatments for cross year smc estimation the specific objectives were to 1 compare the potential of uav multiple types of sensors in the smc prediction model by mla during the whole growing season and determine an optimal model 2 evaluate the robustness of smc estimation using the optimal model for different irrigation treatments and3 examine the performance of smc estimation using the optimal model at different growth stages 2 material 2 1 field site description the field site was located in ordos inner mongolia autonomous region china the climate is semi arid with an elevation of 1010 m maize cv junkai 918 was planted in may tasseled in july and harvested for silage in september 2018 and 2019 the soil type was loamy sand 80 7 sand 13 7 powder and 5 6 clay with a field capacity of 20 3 and a soil bulk density of 1 56 g cm 3 the row and planting spacing were 0 58 m and 0 25 m in 2018 and 0 40 m and 0 25 m in 2019 the entire field was irrigated with a center pivot sprinkler system valmont industries inc nebraska usa and divided into five regions with different irrigation treatments throughout the growing seasons may to september of 2018 and 2019 fig 1 a each irrigation treatment included three replicated individual plots 6 m 6 m fig 1b deficit irrigation was applied independently during the vegetative v reproductive r and maturation m stages the treatment was named based on the target percentage of evapotranspiration of non stressed crops during each growth stage for example a treatment 40 100 80 indicated the treatment received irrigation of 40 100 and 80 of maximum evapotranspiration during the v r and m growth stages respectively here we use tr1 tr5 to represent treatments at five different irrigation levels from maximum to minimum irrigation amounts respectively table 1 the amount of irrigation and precipitation table 1 were measured using a flowmeter and rain gauge cylinders with three replications 2 2 data acquisition 2 2 1 field measurements a soil auger was used to collect soil samples which were then used to measure gravimetric smc smcg at depths of 10 and 20 cm to ensure accurate measurements each plot was divided into 30 equal subplots each time three subplots were randomly selected among the 30 subplots to measure smc data to avoid repetition as shown in fig 2 the average of the three measurements was the in situ measured smc for a given plot smc measurements were performed after the uav flight campaign in the field a total of 300 in situ measured smc for a given plot were collected from 2018 to 2019 the volumetric soil moisture content smc cm3cm 3 was calculated as follows 1 smc s m c g ρ where ρ represents soil bulk density g cm 3 undisturbed soil samples at 0 20 cm were collected using a cutting ring diameter 5 cm height 5 cm the samples were then dried to a constant weight in an oven at 105 the measured weight was converted into standard units g cm 3 for example the measured soil moisture at two soil depths along with the rainfall irrigation in 2018 tr1 were shown in fig 3 2 2 2 uav data collection a six rotor unmanned aircraft dji s900 dji shenzhen china platform was developed to carry uav high resolution rgb dji technology co shenzhen china ms rededge micasense inc usa and tir flir systems usa sensors fig 4 the details of each camera are listed in table 2 the uav was used to capture images between 11 00 and 14 00 under low wind speeds and clear sky conditions during the entire maize growing season in 2018 10 d and 2019 10 d table 3 the flight heights were set at 70 m and the flight path resulted in 85 front and side overlap the spatial resolutions of rgb ms and tir images were 3 5 and 9 cm respectively during the uav flights a micasense micasense seattle wa usa calibrated reflectance panel and the temperatures of ground objects e g black and white cotton fabric pieces wet dry soil crop canopy water etc collected simultaneously were used for radiometric correction of the ms and tir imagery respectively six ground control points gcps were placed for georeferencing imagery from uav multi sensors 3 methods 3 1 image processing the uav rgb ms and tir images were preprocessed into orthomosaic maps using the pix4dmapper software pix4dinc lausanne switzerland the digital numbers of the raw multispectral images were later converted to reflectance values during post processing the parameters of the thermal images were adjusted according to the environmental conditions such as air temperature and humidity to conduct radiometric conversion the ground measured temperatures were compared with the corresponding temperatures from the uav thermal imagery which were converted using a linear model fig 5 3 2 features extraction all features derived from the uav imagery are listed in table 4 and in the subsequent sections 3 2 1 to 3 2 3 to relate different types of data with corresponding soil moisture content the average pixel values for each of the rgb ms and tir features listed in table 4 were computed at the plot level 6 6 m using zonal statistics 3 2 1 rgb features fractional vegetation cover fvc the proportion of green vegetation on the ground surface was extracted from the rgb imagery using the otsu maximum between class variance method otsu 1979 zhang et al 2019 the classified maize pixels were divided by the total pixels for a given plot and the formula for the fvc calculation is presented as follows 2 fvc n maize n total in addition the gray level co occurrence matrix glcm haralick et al 1973 was employed to extract texture features from the rgb in this study and then used as input data for smc prediction the glcm based texture information that is variance va contrast co entropy en correlation cor mean me homogeneity ho dissimilarity ds and second moment sm was computed using the envi 5 3 software table 4 3 2 2 multispectral features a set of uav based vis previously used to estimate the smc was extracted from the raw spectral bands and is listed in table 4 additionally glcm was extracted from the nir and red edge bands using the same methods as described above 3 2 3 thermal features normalized relative canopy temperature nrct was derived from uav thermal infrared imagery the nrct was used to assess crop water status maimaitijiang et al 2020 the detailed formula for nrct is as follows 3 nrct t i t min t max t min where ti represents the uav based temperature of the i th pixel and t min t max represents the lowest highest uav based temperature in the entire field moreover we applied the tvdi to predict smc which is based on the simplified surface temperature vegetation index ts ndvi space method fig 5 and has been commonly implemented to characterize water status and smc sandholt et al 2002 liu et al 2008 tvdi is calculated as follows 4 tvdi t s t s min t s max t s min t s max a dry b dry n d v i 6 t s min a wet b wet n d v i where tsmax tsmin is the highest lowest ts observation and adry awet bdry and bwet are the intercept and slope of the dry wet edge fig 6 respectively in addition glcm was extracted from the thermal based nrct using the methods described in section 3 2 1 and section 3 2 2 3 3 soil moisture content prediction model 3 3 1 modeling methods all the input features in table 4 were extracted for the 15 sampling plots figs 1 and 2 and then matched to the in situ measured smc of each plot a total of 300 in situ measured smc for a given plot were collected during the uav flights from 2018 to 2019 and used for training and testing the performance of the model developed in this study smc estimation models were developed using mla plsr rischbeck et al 2016 k nearest neighbor knn shahabul alam and elshorbagy 2015 and rfr cheng et al 2022 the rfr algorithm for smc estimation was compared with the plsr and knn algorithms to select an optimal smc prediction method the mla was implemented using python with the scikit learn library for a fair and uniform comparison of machine learning methods 80 of randomly selected input features and smc data 240 smc measurements were used as training samples and the remaining 20 60 smc measurements were used as unseen samples to test the performance of the prediction algorithms 3 3 2 validation methods the accuracy of the smc estimation algorithms was verified by fivefold cross validation therefore 240 smc measurements were used independently for model validation then the average accuracy was obtained the model performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and relative root mean square error rrmse the detailed workflow from feature extraction to model building and validation is shown in fig 7 first different features were extracted from three types of imagery such as fvc glcm and vegetation indices then three machine learning methods with the above features as inputs were used to establish smc prediction models and the measured smc data were used for model training and testing finally the applicability of the smc prediction models under different growth stages v r and m and irrigation levels tr1 tr5 was analyzed 4 results 4 1 estimation accuracy of soil moisture content as shown in table 5 generally rfr exhibited the highest estimation accuracy compared to plsr and knn with r2 ranging from 0 42 to 0 61 for 10 cm soil depth and 0 41 to 0 65 for 20 cm soil depth respectively the best smc prediction was observed in the case of using the combination of rgb ms and tir data with r2 0 61 and 0 65 rmse 1 9 and 2 1 as well as rrmse 23 4 and 26 3 for 10 and 20 cm soil depths respectively when using data from a single sensor the multispectral sensor produced better accuracy in smc prediction than the thermal and rgb sensors did generally all mla produced a gradually increasing r2 and a decreasing rrmse with an increasing number of sensors table 5 this is because all the methods can effectively fuse information from multimodal data the accuracy of the smc estimation model based on ms sensors a combination of ms and rgb sensors or a combination of rgb and tir sensors was similar at both soil depths r2 0 3 0 57 rrmse 25 3 34 8 the joint use of tir and ms data showed a higher estimation accuracy r2 0 41 0 64 making it more suitable for smc prediction table 5 however the combination of rgb and tir data had a relatively higher accuracy regardless of the mla table 5 the inclusion of rgb data in the combination of ms and tir data slightly increased the estimation accuracy with plsr r2 increased only by 0 02 for 10 cm soil depth while using knn r2 increased by 0 08 for 20 cm soil depth figs 8 and 9 show the observed and estimated smc using the rfr for various combinations of uav data for both 10 and 20 cm soil depths respectively the estimation result of the 20 cm soil depth was slightly better than that of the 10 cm soil depth regardless of the combination of sensors indicating that the estimation accuracy of smc was similar at the two depths during the entire growth period 4 2 soil water content prediction for different growth stages fig 10 shows the performance of the rfr model at v r and m stages the smc at the v stage was the most accurate estimation in both 2018 and 2019 regardless of the soil depth for the 10 cm depth smc estimation model r2 and rrmse were 0 68 and 20 82 for the 20 cm depth smc estimation model r2 and rrmse were 0 78 and 19 36 respectively at the r stage the rfr model exhibited the poorest performance with an r2 of 0 37 moreover the smc estimation accuracies at each stage for the two depths were similar and comparable among them the estimation model overestimated under low smc and underestimated under high smc in both years therefore the differences in irrigation amount and meteorological conditions especially precipitation may decrease the accuracy of smc estimation using the rfr model and uav based multimodal data 4 3 soil water content prediction for different water treatments figs 11 and 12 show the performance of the rfr model across different irrigation treatments in this study we divided the irrigation treatments into five levels tr1 tr5 from high to low the optimal estimation using the rfr algorithm was achieved for tr1 with r2 and rrmse of 0 65 and 21 33 at 10 cm soil depth and r2 and rrmse of 0 76 and 18 61 at 20 cm soil depth respectively this indicates that the rfr model based on uav based multimodal data can provide a comparable estimation of smc for different soil depths throughout the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons furthermore the accuracy of the smc prediction model under the severe stressed irrigation treatment tr5 was relatively low r2 0 35 0 41 rrmse 21 22 33 26 compared to tr2 tr4 irrigation levels it can be inferred that the rfr model utilizing multimodal information is more applicable to mild water stress treatments generally the rrmse for the 20 cm depth smc estimation had an average value of 25 40 which was slightly greater than the corresponding value of 24 38 for the 10 cm depth smc estimation at a depth of 10 cm the smc estimation had an r2 0 41 0 65 with an average value of 0 53 and at 20 cm depth r2 0 35 0 76 with a mean value of 0 56 therefore the smc estimation exhibited similar performance at both depths 4 4 spatial distribution of soil moisture content in the field figs 13 and 14 show the smc distribution spatial resolution 1 m using rfr with the fusion of rgb tir and ms data there were greater smc differences among irrigation treatments when irrigation regimes were different especially for the 10 cm depth smc maps on 23 aug 2018 the average of tr1 11 39 and tr5 9 33 and 20 cm depth smc map on 26 jul 2019 the average of tr1 12 21 tr2 10 35 and tr5 9 24 meanwhile the smc values for the different treatments were similar when irrigation regimes were the same for example the 10 cm depth smc on 26 jul 2018 the average of tr1 tr5 10 35 10 77 generally the rfr model with the fusion of rgb tir and ms data can be used to characterize the spatial distribution of the smc which provides a reference for precision irrigation 5 discussion several studies have already shown that uav remote sensing can be effectively employed to predict smc at a farmland scale table 6 but most experiments had only focused on a single day or specific growth stage in the growing season cheng et al 2022 ge et al 2021 in this study uav based multimodal data were used to build an smc prediction model throughout the growing season the fusion of multimodal data rgb ms and tir produced the best accuracy regardless of the modeling method with significant accuracy of approximately 2 rmse these results agree with those of previous studies such as cheng et al 2022 who also found that texture temperature and spectral information offered unique and complementary information conducive to smc prediction the joint use of tir and ms data showed a higher estimation accuracy making it more suitable for smc prediction table 5 this may be because the thermal based temperature data can solve asymptotic saturation problems of ms data at maturity stages rischbeck et al 2016 however the inclusion of rgb data in the ms data slightly improved the estimation accuracy of the plsr knn and rfr algorithms these results indicate that the ms and rgb data exhibit information overlap and homogeneity pelizari et al 2018 because of its indirect linkage with soil moisture under vegetation conditions optical and thermal observations are suitable for fitting nonlinear models to retrieve soil moisture particularly mla ge et al 2019 guan et al 2022 consequently we tested three mla to estimate the smc throughout the growing season for two years the results showed that the rfr model is more robust for multiple sensors at both 10 and 20 cm depths compared to the other mla table 5 and figs 8 9 consistent with previous research the rfr method can overcome redundant information and overfitting chen et al 2019 hu et al 2018 owing to vegetation interference especially in conditions of dense vegetation coverage optical and thermal infrared remote sensing may not be able to obtain soil status however the severe water stress at any crop growth stage of maize directly affects crop physiology growth and developmental processes e g leaf curl and senescence increased canopy temperature and decreased chlorophyll content resulting in phenotype spectral and temperature variations of the canopy kullberg et al 2017 the above changes provide a theoretical basis for indirect monitoring of soil moisture distribution in this case the smc has generally been estimated based on status of vegetation zhang and zhou 2016 cheng et al 2022 thus this approach bypasses the uncertainty in describing the physical process which makes this method simple and feasible the rfr based multimodal model performed robustly in the cross year soil moisture estimation at the v stage for both depths fig 10 this is because the growth characteristics such as canopy structure greenness and plant water status that are highly correlated with vis are sensitive to soil moisture at the v stage ma et al 2018 conversely the rfr based multimodal method produced a relatively low accuracy in the cross year smc estimation at the other stages fig 10 this is because high vegetation coverage may lead to saturation of the optical sensors wallace 2013 resulting in an overall bias in the estimation previous studies have shown that uav thermal imagery can be used to detect crop water stress zhang et al 2019 that responds to insufficient soil moisture in the root zone sampathkumar et al 2012 however optical and thermal based indices may be conservative indicators under high vegetation coverage and not able to detect the droughts caused by water stress or rainfall anomalies immediately consequently the top layer of the soil profile had the greatest error in estimating soil moisture at the r stage the accuracy at the m stage was lower than that reported by cheng et al 2022 with r2 0 78 this difference is related to climate water stress irrigation method cultivar and planting density further research regarding the impact of climatic and field management conditions on smc predictions should be conducted for different crop species deficit irrigation has been proposed as a strategy for maintaining yield while reducing agricultural water use al ghobari and dewidar 2018 the results showed that the rfr based multimodal method performed robustly throughout the growing season under well watered and mild to moderate stressed irrigation treatments indicating that the model built using uav multimodal data is feasible and effective for estimating smc figs 11 and 12 however under the full irrigation treatment there was an underestimation under wet conditions high smc for both years this is because the meteorological conditions and the increase in canopy coverage may decrease the smc estimation accuracy when using multimodal data cheng et al 2022 furthermore under the severe stressed irrigation treatment the smc was overestimated in the low smc region for both years this is because of the vi saturation issue and underestimation of the water stress status vergara díaz et al 2016 virnodkar et al 2020 additionally the estimation accuracy of smc by the rfr based multimodal model at the 20 cm depth was similar to that at the 10 cm depth under different irrigation treatments indicating that the estimation method is effective in utilizing multimodal information for both soil depths the results showed that the rfr based multimodal method outperformed the other regression methods under different irrigation treatments across the years the model using rfr with combined rgb tir and ms data can be used for smc estimation under well watered and mild to moderate deficit irrigation treatments therefore this smc map can be applied to design optimal regulated deficit irrigation strategies because maize productivity is improved by moderate deficit irrigation zou et al 2021 meanwhile in agricultural production farmers are most concerned about soil moisture status in the days after irrigation rainfall our study has proven the potential of the rfr based multimodal method to improve irrigation scheduling by precisely evaluating the smc further work is suggested to investigate other soil types which may determine the applicability and transferability of the method however the high deficit irrigation treatment led to low accuracy of the prediction model owing to optical saturation issues and redundant datasets recently technologies have been used to extract related information from uav based images for crop yield prediction using deep learning algorithms ma et al 2021 for instance maimaitijiang et al 2020 reported that uav based multimodal data using deep learning methods improved yield prediction model accuracy compared to mla such as rfr and plsr therefore further work should investigate the generality of deep learning based methods for smc estimation the application of our technique and prediction models to other climatological conditions should be investigated further 6 conclusions the ability of fused multimodal data rgb ms and tir data derived from uav based multi sensors for smc estimation by mla was investigated under different levels of irrigation the major conclusions are as follows 1 ms data outperformed rgb and tir data for single sensor based smc prediction during the entire growing season the joint use of tir and ms data showed great potential for smc prediction with higher estimation accuracy generally the combination of all types of sensors using the rfr algorithm exhibited the most accurate estimation of the smc regardless of the modeling method 2 the rfr method generated the most accurate and robust smc estimations at the vegetative stage followed by the maturation stage however they produced less accurate smc estimation under high vegetation coverage during the reproductive stage additionally the rfr method exhibited strong adaptability to the two soil depths 10 and 20 cm with similar prediction accuracy 3 the rfr method produced the best estimation accuracy

2279,timely and accurate estimation of soil moisture content smc is essential for precise irrigation management at the farm scale unmanned aerial vehicle uav remote sensing with a high spatiotemporal resolution has become a promising method for smc monitoring many existing smc models have only been tested at a specific crop growth stage using a single type of sensor and the effects of growth stage and irrigation variation on smc estimation accuracy remain unclear to address these limitations this study used uav based multimodal data to quantify smc in a maize field under various levels of irrigation over two years using three machine learning algorithms mla partial least squares regression plsr k nearest neighbor knn and random forest regression rfr the results demonstrated that multimodal data fusion improves the smc estimation accuracy regardless of the mla especially the joint use of thermal and multispectral data among three smc regression models the rfr model produced the most accurate smc estimation for the two growing seasons regardless of sensor combinations the rfr model using all three types of data generated the most accurate and robust smc estimation at the vegetative stage with r2 of 0 68 and 0 78 and rrmse of 20 82 and 19 36 for 10 and 20 cm soil depths respectively it also produced the best smc estimation accuracy under well watered and mild to modest deficit irrigation treatments for both soil depths the study shows that the high spatial temporal maps of smc using uav based multimodal data has promising potential for supporting decision making in irrigation scheduling at the farmland scale keywords unmanned aerial vehicle uav soil moisture content smc machine learning maize growth stages deficit irrigation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture content smc plays an important role in agricultural meteorological climatological and hydrological applications a proper decision for precision irrigation is facilitated by accurate information about the smc at an appropriate spatial and temporal scale it is difficult to obtain spatially continuous observations using conventional in situ methods of smc measurement such as the drying method o kelly and sivakumar 2014 time domain reflectometry robinson et al 2003 neutron probe measurements evett and steiner 1995 and heat pulse measurements agliata et al 2019 owing to discrete sampling points and high cost guo et al 2022 with significant advances in remote sensing technology satellite data have been widely applied to smc estimation particularly the optical serrano et al 2019 thermal sohrabinia et al 2014 and microwave chen et al 2018 observations nevertheless the application of satellite data for smc estimation is limited by the low resolution and near surface depth of the measurements unmanned aerial vehicle uav technology provides high spatio temporal resolution data for estimating smc hill et al 2017 several studies have successfully used uav based optical remote sensing for smc estimation mainly in the near infrared and visible bands to establish vegetation indices vis kogan 1990 ge et al 2021 moreover uav based thermal remote sensing has been shown to accurately predict farmland moisture li et al 2022 recent studies have shown that integrating multi source remote sensing data can be effectively used for smc estimation for example wigmore et al 2019 used multispectral ms and thermal tir data from uav remote sensing to calculate the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi which was applied to predict surface smc within mountain environments and obtained results with r2 0 55 0 76 cheng et al 2022 combined uav based multimodal data to estimate the smc under high maize canopy coverage and obtained results with r2 0 78 guo et al 2022 combined microwave remote sensing and uav multispectral remote sensing to monitor smc in a winter wheat planting area and obtained results with r2 0 92 nevertheless microwaves cannot penetrate dense fields with tall plants such as maize therefore uav based optical and thermal sensing has been widely used in current research on smc estimations cheng et al 2022 because of the correlation between vegetation spectrum and smc under agricultural crops various parametric and non parametric regression models have been implemented to monitor smc e g machine learning algorithms mla chen et al 2021 döpper et al 2022 to improve the performance of smc estimation in saline soils partial least squares regression plsr with thermal infrared data was used to build the smc prediction model xu and wang 2015 ge et al 2019 applied the random forest regression rfr algorithm to predict the smc in winter wheat using uav based hyperspectral imagery consequently choosing a proper regression algorithm is essential for achieving accurate smc predictions for dense vegetation generally most approaches to estimating smc using a combination of uav remote sensing and mla have been applied at a specific growth stage or a single growth day cheng et al 2022 guo et al 2022 however the dynamics of vis and smc continuously change over time additionally one smc value may correspond to multiple vis and thus may affect the performance of the smc estimation however only a limited number of studies have been conducted to monitor smc using uav remote sensing and mla during the entire crop growing season furthermore smc estimation models were only tested and trained for one year and several samples seo et al 2021 crops are susceptible to changes in smc and spectral reflectance of maize canopy varies with growth stage and soil water content although uav remote sensing has been applied to smc prediction at arid and semi arid sites babaeian et al 2021 the irrigation regimes are the same therefore verification of smc is limited few studies have focused on different water treatments for crops thus the performance of smc estimation using vis and mla at different growth stages of crops under different water treatments is still unclear based on the above analysis this study used the smc under the maize planting area as the research object and acquired rgb ms and tir data at different growth stages of maize under different irrigation treatments for cross year smc estimation the specific objectives were to 1 compare the potential of uav multiple types of sensors in the smc prediction model by mla during the whole growing season and determine an optimal model 2 evaluate the robustness of smc estimation using the optimal model for different irrigation treatments and3 examine the performance of smc estimation using the optimal model at different growth stages 2 material 2 1 field site description the field site was located in ordos inner mongolia autonomous region china the climate is semi arid with an elevation of 1010 m maize cv junkai 918 was planted in may tasseled in july and harvested for silage in september 2018 and 2019 the soil type was loamy sand 80 7 sand 13 7 powder and 5 6 clay with a field capacity of 20 3 and a soil bulk density of 1 56 g cm 3 the row and planting spacing were 0 58 m and 0 25 m in 2018 and 0 40 m and 0 25 m in 2019 the entire field was irrigated with a center pivot sprinkler system valmont industries inc nebraska usa and divided into five regions with different irrigation treatments throughout the growing seasons may to september of 2018 and 2019 fig 1 a each irrigation treatment included three replicated individual plots 6 m 6 m fig 1b deficit irrigation was applied independently during the vegetative v reproductive r and maturation m stages the treatment was named based on the target percentage of evapotranspiration of non stressed crops during each growth stage for example a treatment 40 100 80 indicated the treatment received irrigation of 40 100 and 80 of maximum evapotranspiration during the v r and m growth stages respectively here we use tr1 tr5 to represent treatments at five different irrigation levels from maximum to minimum irrigation amounts respectively table 1 the amount of irrigation and precipitation table 1 were measured using a flowmeter and rain gauge cylinders with three replications 2 2 data acquisition 2 2 1 field measurements a soil auger was used to collect soil samples which were then used to measure gravimetric smc smcg at depths of 10 and 20 cm to ensure accurate measurements each plot was divided into 30 equal subplots each time three subplots were randomly selected among the 30 subplots to measure smc data to avoid repetition as shown in fig 2 the average of the three measurements was the in situ measured smc for a given plot smc measurements were performed after the uav flight campaign in the field a total of 300 in situ measured smc for a given plot were collected from 2018 to 2019 the volumetric soil moisture content smc cm3cm 3 was calculated as follows 1 smc s m c g ρ where ρ represents soil bulk density g cm 3 undisturbed soil samples at 0 20 cm were collected using a cutting ring diameter 5 cm height 5 cm the samples were then dried to a constant weight in an oven at 105 the measured weight was converted into standard units g cm 3 for example the measured soil moisture at two soil depths along with the rainfall irrigation in 2018 tr1 were shown in fig 3 2 2 2 uav data collection a six rotor unmanned aircraft dji s900 dji shenzhen china platform was developed to carry uav high resolution rgb dji technology co shenzhen china ms rededge micasense inc usa and tir flir systems usa sensors fig 4 the details of each camera are listed in table 2 the uav was used to capture images between 11 00 and 14 00 under low wind speeds and clear sky conditions during the entire maize growing season in 2018 10 d and 2019 10 d table 3 the flight heights were set at 70 m and the flight path resulted in 85 front and side overlap the spatial resolutions of rgb ms and tir images were 3 5 and 9 cm respectively during the uav flights a micasense micasense seattle wa usa calibrated reflectance panel and the temperatures of ground objects e g black and white cotton fabric pieces wet dry soil crop canopy water etc collected simultaneously were used for radiometric correction of the ms and tir imagery respectively six ground control points gcps were placed for georeferencing imagery from uav multi sensors 3 methods 3 1 image processing the uav rgb ms and tir images were preprocessed into orthomosaic maps using the pix4dmapper software pix4dinc lausanne switzerland the digital numbers of the raw multispectral images were later converted to reflectance values during post processing the parameters of the thermal images were adjusted according to the environmental conditions such as air temperature and humidity to conduct radiometric conversion the ground measured temperatures were compared with the corresponding temperatures from the uav thermal imagery which were converted using a linear model fig 5 3 2 features extraction all features derived from the uav imagery are listed in table 4 and in the subsequent sections 3 2 1 to 3 2 3 to relate different types of data with corresponding soil moisture content the average pixel values for each of the rgb ms and tir features listed in table 4 were computed at the plot level 6 6 m using zonal statistics 3 2 1 rgb features fractional vegetation cover fvc the proportion of green vegetation on the ground surface was extracted from the rgb imagery using the otsu maximum between class variance method otsu 1979 zhang et al 2019 the classified maize pixels were divided by the total pixels for a given plot and the formula for the fvc calculation is presented as follows 2 fvc n maize n total in addition the gray level co occurrence matrix glcm haralick et al 1973 was employed to extract texture features from the rgb in this study and then used as input data for smc prediction the glcm based texture information that is variance va contrast co entropy en correlation cor mean me homogeneity ho dissimilarity ds and second moment sm was computed using the envi 5 3 software table 4 3 2 2 multispectral features a set of uav based vis previously used to estimate the smc was extracted from the raw spectral bands and is listed in table 4 additionally glcm was extracted from the nir and red edge bands using the same methods as described above 3 2 3 thermal features normalized relative canopy temperature nrct was derived from uav thermal infrared imagery the nrct was used to assess crop water status maimaitijiang et al 2020 the detailed formula for nrct is as follows 3 nrct t i t min t max t min where ti represents the uav based temperature of the i th pixel and t min t max represents the lowest highest uav based temperature in the entire field moreover we applied the tvdi to predict smc which is based on the simplified surface temperature vegetation index ts ndvi space method fig 5 and has been commonly implemented to characterize water status and smc sandholt et al 2002 liu et al 2008 tvdi is calculated as follows 4 tvdi t s t s min t s max t s min t s max a dry b dry n d v i 6 t s min a wet b wet n d v i where tsmax tsmin is the highest lowest ts observation and adry awet bdry and bwet are the intercept and slope of the dry wet edge fig 6 respectively in addition glcm was extracted from the thermal based nrct using the methods described in section 3 2 1 and section 3 2 2 3 3 soil moisture content prediction model 3 3 1 modeling methods all the input features in table 4 were extracted for the 15 sampling plots figs 1 and 2 and then matched to the in situ measured smc of each plot a total of 300 in situ measured smc for a given plot were collected during the uav flights from 2018 to 2019 and used for training and testing the performance of the model developed in this study smc estimation models were developed using mla plsr rischbeck et al 2016 k nearest neighbor knn shahabul alam and elshorbagy 2015 and rfr cheng et al 2022 the rfr algorithm for smc estimation was compared with the plsr and knn algorithms to select an optimal smc prediction method the mla was implemented using python with the scikit learn library for a fair and uniform comparison of machine learning methods 80 of randomly selected input features and smc data 240 smc measurements were used as training samples and the remaining 20 60 smc measurements were used as unseen samples to test the performance of the prediction algorithms 3 3 2 validation methods the accuracy of the smc estimation algorithms was verified by fivefold cross validation therefore 240 smc measurements were used independently for model validation then the average accuracy was obtained the model performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and relative root mean square error rrmse the detailed workflow from feature extraction to model building and validation is shown in fig 7 first different features were extracted from three types of imagery such as fvc glcm and vegetation indices then three machine learning methods with the above features as inputs were used to establish smc prediction models and the measured smc data were used for model training and testing finally the applicability of the smc prediction models under different growth stages v r and m and irrigation levels tr1 tr5 was analyzed 4 results 4 1 estimation accuracy of soil moisture content as shown in table 5 generally rfr exhibited the highest estimation accuracy compared to plsr and knn with r2 ranging from 0 42 to 0 61 for 10 cm soil depth and 0 41 to 0 65 for 20 cm soil depth respectively the best smc prediction was observed in the case of using the combination of rgb ms and tir data with r2 0 61 and 0 65 rmse 1 9 and 2 1 as well as rrmse 23 4 and 26 3 for 10 and 20 cm soil depths respectively when using data from a single sensor the multispectral sensor produced better accuracy in smc prediction than the thermal and rgb sensors did generally all mla produced a gradually increasing r2 and a decreasing rrmse with an increasing number of sensors table 5 this is because all the methods can effectively fuse information from multimodal data the accuracy of the smc estimation model based on ms sensors a combination of ms and rgb sensors or a combination of rgb and tir sensors was similar at both soil depths r2 0 3 0 57 rrmse 25 3 34 8 the joint use of tir and ms data showed a higher estimation accuracy r2 0 41 0 64 making it more suitable for smc prediction table 5 however the combination of rgb and tir data had a relatively higher accuracy regardless of the mla table 5 the inclusion of rgb data in the combination of ms and tir data slightly increased the estimation accuracy with plsr r2 increased only by 0 02 for 10 cm soil depth while using knn r2 increased by 0 08 for 20 cm soil depth figs 8 and 9 show the observed and estimated smc using the rfr for various combinations of uav data for both 10 and 20 cm soil depths respectively the estimation result of the 20 cm soil depth was slightly better than that of the 10 cm soil depth regardless of the combination of sensors indicating that the estimation accuracy of smc was similar at the two depths during the entire growth period 4 2 soil water content prediction for different growth stages fig 10 shows the performance of the rfr model at v r and m stages the smc at the v stage was the most accurate estimation in both 2018 and 2019 regardless of the soil depth for the 10 cm depth smc estimation model r2 and rrmse were 0 68 and 20 82 for the 20 cm depth smc estimation model r2 and rrmse were 0 78 and 19 36 respectively at the r stage the rfr model exhibited the poorest performance with an r2 of 0 37 moreover the smc estimation accuracies at each stage for the two depths were similar and comparable among them the estimation model overestimated under low smc and underestimated under high smc in both years therefore the differences in irrigation amount and meteorological conditions especially precipitation may decrease the accuracy of smc estimation using the rfr model and uav based multimodal data 4 3 soil water content prediction for different water treatments figs 11 and 12 show the performance of the rfr model across different irrigation treatments in this study we divided the irrigation treatments into five levels tr1 tr5 from high to low the optimal estimation using the rfr algorithm was achieved for tr1 with r2 and rrmse of 0 65 and 21 33 at 10 cm soil depth and r2 and rrmse of 0 76 and 18 61 at 20 cm soil depth respectively this indicates that the rfr model based on uav based multimodal data can provide a comparable estimation of smc for different soil depths throughout the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons furthermore the accuracy of the smc prediction model under the severe stressed irrigation treatment tr5 was relatively low r2 0 35 0 41 rrmse 21 22 33 26 compared to tr2 tr4 irrigation levels it can be inferred that the rfr model utilizing multimodal information is more applicable to mild water stress treatments generally the rrmse for the 20 cm depth smc estimation had an average value of 25 40 which was slightly greater than the corresponding value of 24 38 for the 10 cm depth smc estimation at a depth of 10 cm the smc estimation had an r2 0 41 0 65 with an average value of 0 53 and at 20 cm depth r2 0 35 0 76 with a mean value of 0 56 therefore the smc estimation exhibited similar performance at both depths 4 4 spatial distribution of soil moisture content in the field figs 13 and 14 show the smc distribution spatial resolution 1 m using rfr with the fusion of rgb tir and ms data there were greater smc differences among irrigation treatments when irrigation regimes were different especially for the 10 cm depth smc maps on 23 aug 2018 the average of tr1 11 39 and tr5 9 33 and 20 cm depth smc map on 26 jul 2019 the average of tr1 12 21 tr2 10 35 and tr5 9 24 meanwhile the smc values for the different treatments were similar when irrigation regimes were the same for example the 10 cm depth smc on 26 jul 2018 the average of tr1 tr5 10 35 10 77 generally the rfr model with the fusion of rgb tir and ms data can be used to characterize the spatial distribution of the smc which provides a reference for precision irrigation 5 discussion several studies have already shown that uav remote sensing can be effectively employed to predict smc at a farmland scale table 6 but most experiments had only focused on a single day or specific growth stage in the growing season cheng et al 2022 ge et al 2021 in this study uav based multimodal data were used to build an smc prediction model throughout the growing season the fusion of multimodal data rgb ms and tir produced the best accuracy regardless of the modeling method with significant accuracy of approximately 2 rmse these results agree with those of previous studies such as cheng et al 2022 who also found that texture temperature and spectral information offered unique and complementary information conducive to smc prediction the joint use of tir and ms data showed a higher estimation accuracy making it more suitable for smc prediction table 5 this may be because the thermal based temperature data can solve asymptotic saturation problems of ms data at maturity stages rischbeck et al 2016 however the inclusion of rgb data in the ms data slightly improved the estimation accuracy of the plsr knn and rfr algorithms these results indicate that the ms and rgb data exhibit information overlap and homogeneity pelizari et al 2018 because of its indirect linkage with soil moisture under vegetation conditions optical and thermal observations are suitable for fitting nonlinear models to retrieve soil moisture particularly mla ge et al 2019 guan et al 2022 consequently we tested three mla to estimate the smc throughout the growing season for two years the results showed that the rfr model is more robust for multiple sensors at both 10 and 20 cm depths compared to the other mla table 5 and figs 8 9 consistent with previous research the rfr method can overcome redundant information and overfitting chen et al 2019 hu et al 2018 owing to vegetation interference especially in conditions of dense vegetation coverage optical and thermal infrared remote sensing may not be able to obtain soil status however the severe water stress at any crop growth stage of maize directly affects crop physiology growth and developmental processes e g leaf curl and senescence increased canopy temperature and decreased chlorophyll content resulting in phenotype spectral and temperature variations of the canopy kullberg et al 2017 the above changes provide a theoretical basis for indirect monitoring of soil moisture distribution in this case the smc has generally been estimated based on status of vegetation zhang and zhou 2016 cheng et al 2022 thus this approach bypasses the uncertainty in describing the physical process which makes this method simple and feasible the rfr based multimodal model performed robustly in the cross year soil moisture estimation at the v stage for both depths fig 10 this is because the growth characteristics such as canopy structure greenness and plant water status that are highly correlated with vis are sensitive to soil moisture at the v stage ma et al 2018 conversely the rfr based multimodal method produced a relatively low accuracy in the cross year smc estimation at the other stages fig 10 this is because high vegetation coverage may lead to saturation of the optical sensors wallace 2013 resulting in an overall bias in the estimation previous studies have shown that uav thermal imagery can be used to detect crop water stress zhang et al 2019 that responds to insufficient soil moisture in the root zone sampathkumar et al 2012 however optical and thermal based indices may be conservative indicators under high vegetation coverage and not able to detect the droughts caused by water stress or rainfall anomalies immediately consequently the top layer of the soil profile had the greatest error in estimating soil moisture at the r stage the accuracy at the m stage was lower than that reported by cheng et al 2022 with r2 0 78 this difference is related to climate water stress irrigation method cultivar and planting density further research regarding the impact of climatic and field management conditions on smc predictions should be conducted for different crop species deficit irrigation has been proposed as a strategy for maintaining yield while reducing agricultural water use al ghobari and dewidar 2018 the results showed that the rfr based multimodal method performed robustly throughout the growing season under well watered and mild to moderate stressed irrigation treatments indicating that the model built using uav multimodal data is feasible and effective for estimating smc figs 11 and 12 however under the full irrigation treatment there was an underestimation under wet conditions high smc for both years this is because the meteorological conditions and the increase in canopy coverage may decrease the smc estimation accuracy when using multimodal data cheng et al 2022 furthermore under the severe stressed irrigation treatment the smc was overestimated in the low smc region for both years this is because of the vi saturation issue and underestimation of the water stress status vergara díaz et al 2016 virnodkar et al 2020 additionally the estimation accuracy of smc by the rfr based multimodal model at the 20 cm depth was similar to that at the 10 cm depth under different irrigation treatments indicating that the estimation method is effective in utilizing multimodal information for both soil depths the results showed that the rfr based multimodal method outperformed the other regression methods under different irrigation treatments across the years the model using rfr with combined rgb tir and ms data can be used for smc estimation under well watered and mild to moderate deficit irrigation treatments therefore this smc map can be applied to design optimal regulated deficit irrigation strategies because maize productivity is improved by moderate deficit irrigation zou et al 2021 meanwhile in agricultural production farmers are most concerned about soil moisture status in the days after irrigation rainfall our study has proven the potential of the rfr based multimodal method to improve irrigation scheduling by precisely evaluating the smc further work is suggested to investigate other soil types which may determine the applicability and transferability of the method however the high deficit irrigation treatment led to low accuracy of the prediction model owing to optical saturation issues and redundant datasets recently technologies have been used to extract related information from uav based images for crop yield prediction using deep learning algorithms ma et al 2021 for instance maimaitijiang et al 2020 reported that uav based multimodal data using deep learning methods improved yield prediction model accuracy compared to mla such as rfr and plsr therefore further work should investigate the generality of deep learning based methods for smc estimation the application of our technique and prediction models to other climatological conditions should be investigated further 6 conclusions the ability of fused multimodal data rgb ms and tir data derived from uav based multi sensors for smc estimation by mla was investigated under different levels of irrigation the major conclusions are as follows 1 ms data outperformed rgb and tir data for single sensor based smc prediction during the entire growing season the joint use of tir and ms data showed great potential for smc prediction with higher estimation accuracy generally the combination of all types of sensors using the rfr algorithm exhibited the most accurate estimation of the smc regardless of the modeling method 2 the rfr method generated the most accurate and robust smc estimations at the vegetative stage followed by the maturation stage however they produced less accurate smc estimation under high vegetation coverage during the reproductive stage additionally the rfr method exhibited strong adaptability to the two soil depths 10 and 20 cm with similar prediction accuracy 3 the rfr method produced the best estimation accuracy under well watered and mild to modest deficit irrigated treatments however they produced less accurate smc estimation under severe deficit irrigated treatments credit authorship contribution statement
