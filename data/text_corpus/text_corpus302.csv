1510,coastal managers are increasingly faced with the challenge of disposing of stranded whale carcasses on beaches direct burial in the beach is often used as a cost effective method of disposal however whale burial management plans are often met with public resistance owing to the perceived risk of shark attraction to burial leachate that may discharge from the seabed a reactive transport model was combined with a numerical variable density groundwater flow model to assess buried whale leachate plume formation transport influence on beach aquifer reactivity and discharge to coastal surface water for a range of burial setback distances depths and whale sizes a second set of simulations was performed to evaluate aquifer nitrate removal efficiencies for a range of buried wrack scenarios and to evaluate the role of organic carbon source on beach reactivity a sensitivity analysis was performed for both sets of models across ten physical and reaction parameters simulations using the best estimate parameter set showed that whale burials can produce doc and ammonium leachate plumes in the beach aquifer that are transported to and discharge near the low tide line in water depths of 0 4 2 4 m doc and ammonium concentrations in discharging whale leachate were1 6 and 26 times higher than typical surf zone concentrations respectively of the factors tested the burial distance inland from the high tide line was the most important factor affecting leachate fluxes to surface water burials placed farther inland led to smaller doc fluxes to surface water but increased ammonium fluxes burial depth also affected whale leachate to the subtidal zone with deeper burials resulting in smaller fluxes of doc leached doc from whale decomposition and from buried wrack can fuel denitrification hotspots within beach sediments the sensitivity analysis showed that nitrate removal supported by buried wrack and whale leachate fluxes are highly dependent on beach properties hydrologic forcing and reaction parameters the wrack model results have implications for beach scraping and the whale burial models show that whale leachate can be delivered to the shallow subtidal zone via groundwater discharge pathways with potential implications for shark attraction and whale burial management practices keywords beach aquifer biogeochemical processes groundwater surface water interactions submarine groundwater discharge whale burial 1 introduction the discharge of fresh groundwater across the seabed submarine groundwater discharge sgd is a primary vector of nutrient heavy metal and contaminant delivery to the surf zone and coastal ocean ecosystems these sgd borne solutes can contribute to the formation and maintenance of algal blooms lecher et al 2015 paerl 1997 affect fish production fujita et al 2019 decrease coral cover and species diversity amato et al 2016 crook et al 2012 lirman et al 2003 result in loss of seagrass habitat valiela et al 1997 and have cascading effects across trophic levels lecher and mackey 2018 the impacts of groundwater chemical fluxes to the surf zone are compounded by the large volume of fresh sgd which is estimated to be 6 10 of global river runoff zektser and loaiciga 1993 and higher in other coastal watersheds russoniello et al 2016 prior to discharge nutrient rich groundwater can undergo biogeochemical processing in beach aquifers that transforms nutrients to non bioavailable solutes the formation of the reactive zones along groundwater discharge pathways depends on the availability of reactants supplied by the physical groundwater flow system anwar et al 2014 heiss et al 2017 spiteri et al 2008b thus it is important to characterize and quantify chemical delivery to the coastal zone via sgd in the context of the interplay between physical and biogeochemical processes in coastal aquifers large marine vertebrates such as whales are often strand on beaches the number of whale carcass strandings have risen with whale populations since the 1986 commercial whaling moratorium tulloch et al 2018 along the east coast of south america for example there were a total of 11 761 documented strandings between 1976 and 2013 prado et al 2016 whale strandings in densely populated areas can detract beachgoers due to odors and unattractive sight during decomposition potentially impacting local tourist economies to combat these issues beach managers implement several disposal methods to remove whale carcasses from the beach including offshore towing transport to a waste facility and beach burial beach burial is the primary means of whale and other cetacean carcass disposal and is common in densely populated areas where recreational activity would be adversely impacted if the stranding were not removed the possible impacts of beach burial include 1 biogeochemical alteration of beach groundwater and 2 shark attraction to the burial vicinity from leaching of doc and nutrients into surrounding groundwater and subsequent discharge to surface water tucker et al 2018 the concern of shark attraction likely stems from the known behavior of sharks such as white fallows et al 2013 and tiger sharks clua et al 2013 that feed on floating whale carcasses tucker et al 2019 while potential whale burial impacts are unclear there remains a strong public resistance to burials due to the perceived risks despite the potential impacts the effects of beach whale burials on nutrient cycling and chemical fluxes to the surf zone are unclear owing to the limited number of existing studies tucker et al 2019 conducted a laboratory study of the effects of whale burials on beach pore water chemistry and showed through column experiments that whale decomposition following burial resulted in a doc nh4 and po4 3 leachate plume that extended up to 2 5 m from the burial location a field burial in the unsaturated zone of a beach in the same study provided no clear temporal or spatial trends in no3 or po4 3 concentrations in the beach subsurface tucker et al 2019 concluded that whale burial leachate plumes would unlikely serve as a shark attractant due to the short leachate travel distance through the beach subsurface to the author s knowledge tucker et al 2019 is the only study to investigate whale burial impacts on beach pore water chemistry decomposition leachate is likely to develop down gradient from a whale burial and may be transported to the subtidal zone due to 1 shallow beach water tables that inundate burials 2 seawater infiltration across the beachface that transports oxygen into the aquifer to support decomposition and 3 rapid circulating flow paths leading from typical burial locations to regions of groundwater discharge in the surf zone robinson et al 2007b xin et al 2010 a more complete understanding of the interactions between whale burials and groundwater dynamics in beach aquifers is needed to inform management decisions to minimize potential adverse impacts of burials on surface water quality and to provide insight into the potential risk of shark attraction to recreational beaches in addition to megafauna wave and tidal action on sandy beaches deposit algae intertidal invertebrates small crustaceans woody debris and drift macrophytes the latter originating from offshore reefs kelp forests and seagrass beds this organic matter collectively termed beach wrack is deposited across the upper middle and lower intertidal zone orr et al 2005 tidally deposited algal and macrophyte wrack can provide large quantities of organic material to the supratidal interface with deposits of up to 3 5 kg per meter length of shoreline per tidal cycle orr et al 2005 the organic matter undergoes degradation and burial as the beach profile cycles through accretionary and depositional stages dugan et al 2011 ford et al 1999 combined with permeable intertidal sediments spatially heterogeneous buried wrack may provide a significant organic carbon source to the beach aquifer microbial community rossi and underwood 2002 for instance aggregates of particulate organic carbon poc can lead to the development of denitrification microzones in aquatic sawyer 2015 and marine sakita and kusuda 2000 sediments and can leach doc that fuels aerobic respiration and denitrification in beach aquifers kim et al 2019 groundwater flow patterns and the distribution of fresh and saline groundwater in coastal aquifers is controlled by interactions between coastal ocean and terrestrial hydrologic forcings fig 1 fresh groundwater from terrestrial recharge flows seaward where it mixes with saltwater to form a lower saltwater ghyben herzberg interface density gradients between fresh and saline groundwater along the lower saltwater interface drive convective flow where seawater infiltrates into the seabed offshore which then circulates upward along the interface process 2 fig 1 cooper 1959 kohout 1960 tidal and wave activity on the sloping beach results in infiltration of seawater and a hydraulic gradient that drives flow downward and seaward forming an intertidal circulation cell process 3 fig 1 that is bounded by a saltwater freshwater mixing zone

discharge zone located near the base of the beach separates the intertidal circulation cell from the lower saltwater interface a wide range of microbially mediated redox reactions have been observed in beach aquifers including aerobic respiration slomp and van cappellen 2004 denitrification santos et al 2009 iron reduction roy et al 2010 sulfate reduction mcallister et al 2015 and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium santoro 2010 these biogeochemical processes influence the cycling of c n p fe and other metals altering the chemistry of groundwater discharging to coastal surface water field studies demonstrate that flowpaths and residence times are important factors influencing the location and type of redox activity within the intertidal mixing zone charette and sholkovitz 2006

flux controls on biogeochemical processing in beach sediments anwar et al 2014 heiss et al 2017 robinson et al 2009 spiteri et al 2008b most conceptual and numerical models assume that infiltrating seawater across the beach surface is the source of doc that fuels beach reactivity field observations reveal that the distribution of organic carbon and reactivity in the intertidal mixing zone can be spatially heterogeneous despite homogeneous aquifer material kim et al 2017 seibert et al 2019 the reactive hotspots within the beach aquifer can be fueled by scattered carbon pools that form as a result of filtering of circulating doc rich seawater and the differential accumulation of doc on intertidal sediments kim et al 2019 in addition in situ organic rich aggregates may derive from the deposition and burial of organic debris i e wrack deposited in the intertidal zone owing to wave and tidal action promoting the formation of reactive hotspots in the aquifer seidel et al 2015 sediment carbon pools are important for aquifer reactivity in other environments as well for example spatially heterogeneous carbon aggregates can drive localized denitrification in streambed sediments and significantly alter nitrate fluxes to aquatic ecosystems sawyer 2015 laboratory experiments have also shown that whale burials can serve as a source of carbon for beach microbial communities tucker et al 2019 in this study i apply numerical groundwater flow and reactive transport models to evaluate nutrient cycling in coastal aquifers for a range of whale burial and buried wrack scenarios for beaches exposed to tides a sensitivity analysis of whale size burial depth and distance inland from the high tide line is performed for a range of values obtained from whale burial reports to identify the key factors controlling beach aquifer reactivity and to assess whale leachate fluxes to the subtidal zone simulations involving buried wrack aggregates are performed to provide additional insight into the role of in situ particulate organic carbon poc on beach aquifer reactivity 2 methods groundwater flow and reactive transport models were used to simulate the effects of whale burials on chemical transport in beach aquifers for a range of burial distances inland from the high tide line hereafter referred to as setback distance burial depth and whale size whale burial setback distance burial depth and whale size were determined by compiling whale burial media reports table 1 whale burials have rarely been the focus of scientific investigations bui 2009 tucker et al 2019 and thus formal reporting is scarce in the models the setback distance ranged from 0 to 30 m burial depth from 2 to 8 m and whale length from 9 to 15 m whale width height was estimated using the length to width ratio 3 9 of adult female right whales miller et al 2012 the whale burials in the models were represented as permeable carbon rich sediment hereafter referred to as poc the organic carbon content of the sediment is discussed later in this section setback distance burial depth and whale size was varied around a base case parameter set adopted from spiteri et al 2008a and other studies with calibrated models or measurements table 2 a subset of the parameter set was previously calibrated to measurements from a beach aquifer spiteri et al 2008b a sensitivity analysis was performed around the base case parameter set for a base case whale burial scenario 10 m setback distance 4 m burial depth 12 m length to evaluate the effects of 10 model parameters on doc and ammonium leachate fluxes across the sediment water interface table 3 literature values were used to bound the range of each parameter a second set of simulations was performed to assess the effects of buried wrack aggregates on chemical cycling in the aquifer to incorporate realistic distributions of buried wrack gaussian random fields were generated geostatistically using the sequential gaussian simulation algorithm in sgems remy et al 2009 the gaussian random fields were then truncated using arbitrary threshold values corresponding to proportions of wrack in the intertidal sediment the buried wrack or poc aggregates represented macrophytes sticks invertebrates and other organic matter debris the overall spatial extent of the poc aggregates was assigned according to the area in the circulation cell where pore water was 1 ppt to ensure that poc was located between the high and low tide levels where wrack is deposited nine wrack deposit realizations were generated with poc rich sediments comprising 10 90 of intertidal circulation cell sediments the whale burial and buried wrack scenarios were modeled separately in order to isolate the individual effects of the two organic carbon sources on nitrogen cycling in the coastal aquifer the same physical and geochemical parameter set used in the whale burial models was used in the wrack models a wrack sensitivity analysis was performed across the same 10 physical and geochemical parameters that were tested in the whale burial sensitivity table 3 this second sensitivity analysis was used to assess the spectrum of nitrate removal efficiencies that may be expected across physical and geochemical parameter space for intertidal poc contents ranging from 10 to 100 a total of 467 simulations were performed in addition to buried organic matter tides can introduce doc rich seawater to sediments through infiltration across the shoreface which can serve as a source of carbon to drive microbial activity in intertidal mixing zones anwar et al 2014 kim et al 2019 seidel et al 2015 an additional simulation was performed with infiltrating seawater as a source of doc to compare to the whale burial and wrack aggregate scenarios to assess the relative importance of doc source on microbially mediated chemical transformations this simulation is hereafter referred to as the baseline simulation poc served as the only source of doc in the whale burial and wrack deposit scenarios density dependent groundwater flow and salt transport was simulated using seawat v4 0 langevin et al 2008 the model domain and boundary conditions were similar to previous modeling studies of groundwater flow in beach aquifers e g greskowiak 2014 heiss and michael 2014 robinson et al 2006 robinson et al 2007a 2007b 2007c the model domain extended 150 m landward of the shoreline 50 m seaward of the shoreline and to a depth of 30 m below msl the beach slope was 0 1 in the base case models the grid was non uniform and refined in the intertidal zone x 0 31 m y 0 06 m the third order total variation diminishing tvd scheme was used to solve the advection term the periodic boundary condition package post 2011 was used to simulate tidal forcing and seepage face development across the aquifer ocean interface a time dependent hydraulic head signal was applied to the intertidal and subtidal zone with the hydraulic head ht at the boundary defined as 1 h t acos ωt h o where h t m is the tidal elevation at time t a m is the tidal amplitude ω 2 π t is the tidal angular frequency in rad d 1 and h o m is a reference water level msl in all models a 1 0 m and ω 12 567 rad d 1 model cells along the shoreface with inflow were assigned a zero concentration gradient and cells with discharge were assigned a constant concentration of 35 ppt the hydraulic head at the landward vertical boundary was set to 1 0 m and the top bottom and right boundaries were assigned as no flow and zero solute flux the phase resolved flow fields from the seawat simulations were used with the multi species reactive transport model pht3d v2 13 prommer and post 2003 to simulate aerobic respiration denitrification nitrification ammonification and poc dissolution the reaction time steps in pht3d were set to correspond with the transport steps in seawat used to satisfy numerical stability criteria the reaction network and rate expressions for aerobic respiration denitrification and nitrification were adopted from previous modeling studies of geochemical reactions in coastal groundwater systems anwar et al 2014 cardenas et al 2008 spiteri

concentration falls below the limiting o2 or no3 concentration bardini et al 2012 spiteri et al 2008b when the concentration is above the limiting concentration the reduction rate of o2 and no3 follows a first order reaction and the rate is independent of the concentration the stoichiometry of aerobic respiration and denitrification is accounted for using the stoichiometric coefficients for each reaction table 2 the terminal n product of doc mineralization is represented as nh4 and is produced via ammonification assuming the c n stoichiometry of coastal environments τ nc 1 9 6 in the

thus the net change in doc is the doc generated in eq 10 less the doc degradation in eq 11 the redox reactions are coupled to the degradation of doc using the partial equilibrium approach that assumes

model parameters in the flow and reactive transport simulations are within the range of published values table 2 the doc rate constant in the whale burial models was obtained from laboratory experiments of whale carcass decomposition in beaches tucker et al 2019 the landward vertical boundary was assigned a constant no3 concentration to represent inflowing no3 rich fresh groundwater seawater entering the aquifer at the shoreface boundary contained salt and o2 and for the case with seawater as the source of organic carbon doc oxygen replenishment to pore water from the atmosphere

is within the range of organic carbon content of intertidal beach sands huettel and rusch 2000 3 results 3 1 baseline solute concentrations and reactivity tidal oscillations and seawater infiltration across the shoreface in the baseline simulation produced circulating flows in the beach aquifer where seawater flowed downward and to the base of the beach while mixing with underlying fresh groundwater to form a saltwater freshwater mixing zone fig 2a the simulated flow pattern and mixing zone is consistent with previous modeling studies of beach groundwater dynamics boufadel 2000 heiss and michael 2014 lebbe 1999 robinson et al 2006 doc concentrations were elevated in the shallow beach subsurface where seawater infiltration was highest and decreased with depth due to doc degradation fig 2b mineralization of doc maintained elevated nh4 concentrations in the circulation cell fig 2c doc oxidation was coupled to aerobic respiration so o2 concentrations were low throughout the intertidal circulation cell fig 2d however o2 concentrations were sufficient to maintain nitrification directly beneath the high tide line to a depth of 2 m fig 2e farther landward and at depth anoxia along the boundary of the circulation cell produced favorable conditions for denitrification which was highest on the landward side of the circulation cell where doc and no3 were abundant fig 2f denitrification within this region of the aquifer produced n2 that was transported to the lower part of the beachface fig 2g nitrate attenuation as a percent of total inflowing land derived nitrate defined as nitrate removal efficiency was 37 4 for the baseline simulation 3 2 whale burials solute concentrations and reaction zones the whale burials altered the chemical composition of pore water in the beach aquifer for the base case set of models fig 3 decomposition of the burials led to localized areas of elevated doc concentrations which decreased along flowpaths owing to doc oxidation fig 3 column 2 doc concentrations surrounding and down gradient of burials with a setback distance of 0 m were lower relative to burials at the same depth 20 m inland fig 3 rows a b burial depth also influenced spatial patterns of doc doc concentrations surrounding burials at 2 m depth were lower than burials at 8 m depth for the same setback distance fig 3 rows c d the variability in doc concentrations for different setback distances and burial depths is owed to the burial location relative to the intertidal circulation cell for a 0 m setback distance pore water circulating at high velocity below the high tide line readily flushed doc out of the system while the burial with a 20 m setback distance was landward of the circulation cell where flow rates were lower allowing doc to accumulate similarly burial depth controlled the proximity of the carcass relative to the circulation cell deeper burials with the same setback distance were offset horizontally from intertidal flows because the circulation cell tapered with depth the low flow velocities outside of the circulation cell led to the accumulation of doc lastly larger whale burials produced more doc and resulted in higher down gradient doc concentrations fig 3 rows e f burial location was a key factor controlling nh4 distributions and nitrification rates figs 3 and 4 regions of elevated nh4 concentrations developed due to doc degradation and ammonification for a setback distance of 20 m nh4 accumulated along flow paths leading to the intertidal mixing zone fig 3 row 2 low nh4 concentrations were maintained within the interior of the circulation cell 90 seawater as a result of nitrification and subsequent removal of nh4 in oxygen rich pore water nitrification rates were highest 1 3 m below the high tide line where infiltration of oxygen rich seawater was highest fig 4 the location of the nitrification zone was unaffected by whale burial distance inland depth or whale size because circulating flows in the mixing zone hydraulically restricted the extent of overlap between nh4 and o2 nitrate concentrations varied with typical setback distances burial depths and whale sizes nitrate rich fresh groundwater flowing into the aquifer was anoxic and thus burials inland of oxygenated intertidal pore water formed denitrification hotspots fig 3 row 4 denitrification rates within the hotspots increased with setback distance and reached a maximum of 2 5 10 3 m d fig 5 in the case of a 20 m setback distance slow transport rates and a high accumulation of doc in the freshwater aquifer promoted rapid no3 uptake which formed a large region of low no3 concentrations that merged with the circulation cell fig 3 row b no3 uptake was limited for burials located in the circulation cell due to the presence of o2 from infiltrating seawater and lower doc concentrations from rapid flushing of intertidal pore water figs 5a simulated doc and ammonium concentrations were elevated relative to observed data reported in literature while nitrate concentrations compare favorability with measured values in previous studies the maximum leached doc concentration 6 1 10 3 m was greater than the range of highest doc concentrations 2 5 10 4 3 0 10 3 m observed in natural beach aquifers e g santos et al 2008 seidel et al 2015 spiteri et al 2008a modeled ammonium concentrations maximum 1 8 10 4 m were near the upper end of the range 4 0 10 5 2 4 10 4 m of values measured in beach sediments kim et al 2017 kroeger and charette 2008 spiteri et al 2008a ullman et al 2003 nitrate concentrations in the intertidal mixing zone 1 90 seawater salinity ranged from 1 3 10 4 m 1 4 10 5 m consistent with observed concentrations reported in literature e g couturier et al 2017 charbonnier et a 2013 kroeger and charette 2008 3 3 whale burials nitrate removal the three physical burial factors affected the flux of land derived no3 across the aquifer ocean interface nitrate removal efficiency increased with setback distance and ranged from 41 to 52 reaching an asymptote at a setback distance of 20 30 m fig 6a removal efficiency increased from 50 to 58 with an increase in burial depth from 2 to 8 m fig 6b deeper burials were located farther outside of the circulation cell relative to shallow burials because the cell tapered with depth as discussed previously this offset had a similar effect as high setback distances slower transport rates outside of the circulation cell led to the accumulation of doc and longer residence times that enhanced reactivity removal efficiency increased from 24 to 68 as whale length increased from 9 to 15 m as a result of higher doc production fig 6c 3 4 total whale leachate flux to the subtidal zone leachate fluxes to surface water were nonzero for the range of setback distances burial depths and whale sizes considered doc flux decreased with increasing setback distance because longer flow paths lead to greater doc degradation fig 6d an increase in burial depth led to lower doc fluxes due to greater doc degradation along slow transport paths adjacent to the circulation cell fig 6e whale size was also a key factor controlling leachate flux decomposition of larger burials generated larger quantities of doc thus doc fluxes increased with increasing burial size fig 6f doc degradation is coupled to ammonification and thus nh4 flux across the aquifer ocean interface increased with setback distance and depth fig 6g h unlike setback distance and burial depth where nh4 flux varied inversely with doc flux the model results show that both nh4 and doc flux increased with whale size the four burials of different sizes were set in an identical location in the flow system this eliminated the effects of hydrological variation such as transport rates that contributed to the inverse relationship between doc and nh4 flux for differences in setback distance and burial depth 3 5 buried wrack solute concentrations and denitrification zone buried wrack aggregates altered the distribution of solutes in the beach aquifer fig 7 shows solute concentrations in sediments with 10 100 poc content decomposition of the wrack generated doc that accumulated along circulating flow paths fig 7 row 2 doc fueled aerobic respiration in the shallow beach subsurface however o2 concentrations remained elevated enough to inhibit denitrification in pore water greater than 50 seawater in the circulation cell figs 7 and 8 on the boundary of the circulation cell in pore water with salinity less than 50 seawater land derived no3 mixed with doc in anoxic pore water and denitrified as it was transported seaward fig 8 an increase in buried wrack content and corresponding increase in doc led to enhanced no3 removal and lower no3 concentrations in the fresh discharge zone fig 7 row 4 the baseline model and the wrack aggregate models both show that denitrification occurred in the intertidal mixing zone in pore water with salinity less than 50 seawater however reaction rates were highest on opposite ends of the circulation cell the landward side when seawater was the source of doc and on the seaward side when wrack aggregates were the source of doc fig 2f and fig 8 denitrification rates for the baseline model were highest on the landward side of the circulation cell because infiltrating seawater transported large quantities of doc into the aquifer below the high tide line while the accumulation of doc in the wrack simulations led to high no3 removal rates at the terminal end of circulating flow paths 4 sensitivity analysis effects of model parameters 4 1 whale burial leachate fluxes doc and ammonium fluxes to surface water varied with beach properties hydrologic forcing and reaction parameter values fig 9 shows the percent change in doc and ammonium flux relative to the base case parameter set and base case burial scenario for a range of physical and reaction parameter values hydraulic conductivity was the most important physical parameter affecting leachate fluxes followed by the tidal amplitude anisotropy ratio beach slope freshwater hydraulic gradient transverse dispersivity ratio and longitudinal dispersivity doc flux increased with hydraulic conductivity due to higher transport rates between the whale burial and discharge zone limiting doc degradation and ammonification fig 9a doc and ammonium leachate fluxes varied between 69 5 and 176 6 relative to the base case for hydraulic conductivity values of 2 50 m d tidal amplitude was the second most important physical factor with doc and ammonium fluxes varying between 72 1 and 128 5 around the base case for tidal amplitudes between 0 2 m and 1 3 m doc flux decreased with increasing tidal amplitude due to longer circulating intertidal flow paths that led to greater doc degradation but it was met with a corresponding increase in ammonium flux fig 9b beach slope had a moderate impact on doc and ammonium fluxes fluxes varied from 67 5 70 2 for beach slopes between 0 0375 and 0 1 steeper beaches formed smaller circulation cells owing to narrower intertidal zones which shortened transport paths between the whale burial and discharge zone thus doc fluxes increased with beach slope due to less doc degradation while ammonium fluxes decreased as a result of diminished ammonification fig 9c the freshwater hydraulic gradient was also an important factor affecting leachate flux fig 9d strong freshwater hydraulic gradients restricted tidally driven flows which resulted in shorter flow paths between the whale burial and discharge zone combined with shorter freshwater residence times this led to higher doc fluxes while simultaneously limiting ammonification fig 9d doc and ammonium fluxes varied between 62 5 and 40 5 relative to the base case across the range of freshwater hydraulic gradients the transverse dispersivity ratio and longitudinal dispersivity had a negligible effect on doc and ammonium fluxes because doc degradation and ammonification occurred as mixing independent reactions fig 9e f these results highlight the importance of physical hydrologic controls on the fate of whale leachate in beach aquifers leachate fluxes were also sensitive to reaction model parameters the mass transfer coefficient for organic carbon was the most important reactive parameter affecting doc and ammonium flux to the subtidal zone with fluxes varying between 77 7 and 110 2 relative to the base case for the range of tested mass transfer coefficients fig 9h increases in both the mass transfer coefficient and distribution coefficient enhanced dissolution of poc and resulted in higher doc and ammonium fluxes fig 9h i as expected higher doc rate constants led to lower doc fluxes as more doc was consumed along flow paths while ammonium fluxes increased owing to more rapid ammonification fig 9j 4 1 1 buried wrack nitrate removal the results of the parametric sensitivity analysis provide an upper and lower bound of leachate fluxes and nitrate removal efficiencies for the best estimate parameter values used in the base case burial scenario for the base case parameter set and burial scenario nitrate removal efficiency increased from 1 6 30 3 as intertidal poc content increased from 10 to 100 black symbology fig 10 while the removal efficiency was 37 4 for the baseline model with seawater as the source of doc not shown however the model sensitivity analysis showed that removal efficiency depends on physical beach properties and reaction parameter values removal efficiency was most sensitive to beach slope varying by an average of 55 8 range 0 55 8 relative to base case across all poc contents for slopes from 0 1 to 0 0375 fig 10c wider intertidal zones supported larger circulation cells with more wrack deposition leading to greater doc production and larger denitrification zones the freshwater hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity had a similar effect on removal efficiency removal efficiency across the range of freshwater hydraulic gradients 0 0083 0 003 and hydraulic conductivity values 2 50 m d varied respectively by an average of 29 0 range 8 6 20 4 relative to base case and 28 7 range 4 0 24 7 relative to base case across all poc contents fig 10a and d tidal amplitude had a moderate influence on removal efficiency differing by 19 7 range 11 3 8 4 relative to base case for amplitudes between 0 2 m and 1 3 m the effects of anisotropy were less with a mean variability of 8 8 range 0 8 8 relative to base case for anisotropy ratios of 0 1 1 0 fig 10g the combination of factors that resulted in large intertidal mixing zones i e gentle beach slope low freshwater hydraulic gradient high k large tidal amplitude yielded higher removal efficiencies due to larger accumulations of wrack and associated doc production as well as greater contact between nitrate rich fresh groundwater and anoxic circulating seawater for a detailed description of the role of each physical factor on physical flow and transport in beach aquifers see heiss et al 2017 removal efficiency varied by 6 2 range 2 6 3 6 relative to base case for transverse dispersivity ratios between 0 01 and 0 2 and by 2 3 range 0 9 1 4 relative to base case for longitudinal dispersivity values ranging from 0 1 1 0 m fig 10e and f the distribution coefficient was a key reaction parameter affecting removal efficiency 56 3 variability relative to base case followed by the mass transfer coefficient 29 5 and doc rate constant 25 2 as discussed in section 3 5 1 larger distribution and mass transfer coefficients enhanced doc production the greater doc availability which was also supported by lower doc rate constants promoted denitrification and increased removal efficiency for the range of parameter values tested 5 discussion 5 1 whale burial implications for shark attraction the discharging concentration of doc and nh4 relative to the surface water concentration is likely a primary factor determining the formation of surface water leachate plumes that could potentially serve as a shark attractant simulation results based on the base case set of parameters show that maximum doc concentrations in discharging leachate near the low tide line can reach 660 μm while observed ambient doc concentrations in coastal waters worldwide ranges from 180 to 420 μm bauer and bianchi 2012 thus leached doc concentrations in submarine groundwater discharge may be up to 1 6 times higher than in coastal surface water similarly the maximum nh4 concentration of discharging leachate for models using the base case parameter set was 56 μm more than an order of magnitude higher than 2 μm typical of surf zones pregnall and miller 1988 these findings may have implications for shark attraction to areas where whale leachate is discharging to surface water the depth of the water column where whale leachate discharges may be important for plume dispersal in the subtidal zone fig 11 shows the cross shore location of the doc and nh4 discharge zones and the water column depth across the subtidal zone during low mid and high tide the leached doc discharge zone spans approximately 11 m across the aquifer ocean interface and is centered 2 0 m seaward of the low tide line corresponding to a surface water depth of 2 2 m during high tide and 0 9 m during low tide nh4 fluxes peak 4 1 m seaward of the low tide line where the water depth is 2 4 m at high tide and 0 4 m at low tide the depth of the water column at the doc and nh4 discharge zones is typical of water depths occupied by swimmers combined with elevated leachate concentrations as discussed above these results may have important implications for shark attraction to the inner subtidal zone for a given leachate concentration and flux to the subtidal zone surface water doc and nh4 enrichment will ultimately depend on numerous factors that impact surf and subtidal zone plume dispersal that were not considered in this study including wave energy bathymetry tidal regime shape of the coastline water column depth and biological activity in the surface water additionally the specific compounds in a leachate plume that sharks may be attracted to is unclear and the stage of doc degradation and the chemical signature of a leachate plume will evolve along discharging transport pathways with greater complexity than modeled here the doc and nh4 fluxes in this study should therefore be considered a first order estimate of the impact of whale burial decomposition on material fluxes to coastal surface waters 5 2 whale burial nitrate attenuation implications the results of this study provide a framework for predicting the location and magnitude of biogeochemical reactivity in beach aquifers for typical whale burial management decisions with the rise in global whale populations since the commercial whaling moratorium in 1986 tulloch et al 2018 coastal managers must increasingly weigh the potential risks and benefits of whale disposal methods the base case model scenario used in this study reveals that whale burials may attenuate up to 68 of land derived no3 that would otherwise discharge to the coastal ocean ecosystem along the section of the beach where the whale is located no3 attenuation by whale burials as shown in this study is similar to and is of the same spatial scale as permeable reactive barriers designed to mitigate coastal eutrophication through the supply of carbon from the decomposition of buried woodchips hiller et al 2015 showed that a 20 m long x 3 m diameter woodchip permeable reactive barrier installed in a beach promoted denitrification and led to a decline in nitrate concentrations in discharging groundwater these artificial nitrogen treatment systems are most effective when installed at the mouth of watersheds where groundwater flow converges at the coast barbarso et al 2019 thus although the burials are small up to 15 m in length in this study relative to the length of coastline the burials may have the potential to significantly reduce nitrogen loads to receiving surface water bodies this newly identified artificial ecosystem service should be considered in decision tools used to assist beach managers coastal stakeholders and regulators when evaluating the optimal carcass disposal method for a particular stranding and surface water quality conditions the elevated no3 concentrations in inflowing fresh groundwater is representative of densely populated coastal communities or in areas with continued agricultural development where increased groundwater loading of n from wastewater and fertilizer to coastal surface water can have adverse ecosystem impacts slomp and van cappellen 2004 valiela et al 1990 the no3 attenuation capacity of whale burials as shown in this study is therefore most applicable to highly urbanized or rural coastal landscapes 5 3 optimal whale burial location the optimal burial depth and distance inland from the high tide line depends on management goals the findings suggest that managers should strive for a setback distance 10 m at the maximum achievable depth if coastal waters are susceptible to eutrophication this burial configuration increases no3 removal efficiency by increasing the residence time of reactive solutes if there is concern of shark attraction resulting from burial decomposition and related chemical fluxes two burial configurations may be considered to limit leachate flux to the subtidal zone carcasses buried at high setback distances 30 m should result in near zero doc flux due to greater doc degradation along longer flow paths however high setback distances result in higher nh4 fluxes thus an alternate configuration is more suitable to limit nh4 loading burials placed below the high tide line 0 m setback distance at the shallowest burial depth 2 m should lead to lower nh4 fluxes to surface water since short transport paths to the discharge zone coupled with rapid circulating flows in the circulation cell decrease the time available for ammonification the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that managers should also consider the physical characteristics of the beach and the hydrologic conditions of the coastal aquifer when formulating carcass disposal strategies and selecting burial sites model results show that leachate fluxes are highly dependent on beach properties and the hydrologic forces acting on the aquifer a set of beach e g gentle beach slope low hydraulic conductivity and hydrologic e g large tidal amplitude low freshwater gradient parameters that increase residence time in the coastal aquifer will reduce doc delivery to receiving coastal waters owing to greater doc degradation along flow paths however the longer residence times will enhance ammonification yielding higher ammonium fluxes prioritization of efforts focused on moderating doc or ammonium flux from whale burials will depend likely on management goals and ultimately the extent of shark attraction to the leachate compounds considered in this study 5 4 beach wrack the numerical simulations suggest that buried wrack can serve as source of doc that sustains bulk denitrification at rates that approach those supported by the supply of doc in infiltrating seawater these results support field observations of the role of buried wrack on moderating nutrient fluxes to coastal ecosystems rossi and underwood 2002 in addition denitrification rates were spatially discontinuous and highest farther along circulating flow paths where doc accumulated consistent with observed denitrification patterns that result from scattered pools of carbon within beach sediments kim et al 2019 this has important implications for beach managers engaged in beach grooming which invokes large machinery to scrape and sieve the sand surface to remove plastics paper fishing lines hooks and other debris that accumulate on popular beaches grooming is also conduced to remove beach wrack and is therefore likely to reduce wrack burial and subsequent supply of organic carbon to the beach aquifer leading to lower no3 attenuation coastal armoring is also likely to reduce the quantity of buried wrack and the availability of doc as the footprint of armored beach structures covers areas of the beachface where wrack accumulates dugan et al 2008 5 5 model simplifications there are additional factors not accounted for in the models the models assume that burials are submerged below the water table throughout the tidal cycle while this may not always be the case it is a reasonable assumption near the shoreline where vertical infiltration of seawater by wave and tidal action across the beachface maintains shallow water table elevations e g de drézigué et al 2009 turner et al 1997 that are above the shallowest burial depth 2 m identified in media reports in this study however shallow burials at high setback distances in high relief areas may be permanently located in the unsaturated zone or periodically inundated by an oscillating water table previous work has shown that transport of leachate from whale carcasses buried in the unsaturated zone is minimal tucker et al 2019 additionally decomposition of lipids in human graves in unsaturated soils is slowed or halted due limited oxygen availability and exposure to reducing conditions dent et al 2004 further suggesting that whale burials located above the water table are unlikely to produce leachate of sufficient quantity to be transported to surface water the results of the present study demonstrate that burials below the water table can produce leachate that is transported to the nearshore area by groundwater flow wave setup and swash spring neap variability in tidal amplitude seasonal oscillations in the freshwater hydraulic gradient and precipitation events affect flow transport and mixing in beach aquifers abarca et al 2013 heiss and michael 2014 heiss et al 2014 heiss et al 2015 robinson et al 2007a 2007b robinson et al 2014 xin et al 2010 oscillatory flows and shifting redox gradients that result from these transient hydrologic forcing mechanisms will may lead to temporal variability in the spatial distribution of reaction zones reactivity intensity and chemical fluxes the dynamic physical flow and chemical responses to these transient and interacting forcings may lead to optimal burial configurations that differ from those found in this study the numerical model accounted for n mineralization nitrification and denitrification however additional n cycling pathways have been observed in beach aquifers such as anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox slomp and van cappellen 2004 and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra santoro 2010 annamox would provide an additional n removal pathway that would reduce denitrification though the consumption of no3 similarly dnra competes with denitrification to reduce no3 and requires the same redox conditions thus actual no3 removal whether performed via anammox dnra or denitrification would unlikely deviate significantly from the simulated results if anammox and dnra were incorporated into the reaction network nh4 flux to the surface water would likely decrease with the incorporation of anammox owing to nh4 oxidation lastly the modeling approach does not consider interactions between overlapping decomposition plumes in settings with both a whale burial and buried wrack both sources of carbon were intentionally not implemented in model scenarios because data on organic carbon content of beach sediments at a potential whale burial site is often unavailable to coastal managers thus the goal was to understand the individual effects of each carbon source to independently support whale disposal and beach scraping management decisions 6 conclusions a reactive transport model was combined with a variable density groundwater flow model to simulate the effects of whale burial decomposition and buried organic matter i e wrack on the chemical composition and reactivity of coastal aquifers subjected to tides the findings demonstrate the importance of whale burial location on whale leachate extent and associated flux to surface water and the effects of buried wrack on nutrient fluxes to coastal ecosystems a sensitivity analysis of whale burial distance inland from the high tide line burial depth and whale size show that decomposition of whale burials produces doc and ammonium leachate plumes that are transported to and discharge from the aquifer near the low tide line in water depths between 0 4 and 2 4 m doc and ammonium concentrations in discharging leachate for the base case models are 1 6 and 26 times higher than typical surf zone concentrations respectively in instances where there is concern of shark attraction to discharging leachate two burial configurations may be considered to limit leachate flux to the subtidal zone burials located 30 m inland from the high tide line at a depth of 8 m will likely result in near zero doc flux however this burial configuration enhances ammonium fluxes thus an alternate configuration is more suitable to limit ammonium loading burials placed at shallow depth 2 m below the high tide line should lead to lower ammonium fluxes to surface water it should be noted that the model employed in this study assumes that the whales are submerged below the water table which may not always be the case leachate production from whales buried in the unsaturated zone is likely to differ than modeled in the present study simulation results suggest that managers should strive for a setback distance of greater than 10 m at the maximum achievable depth if a management objective is to promote denitrification and reduce n loading to coastal ecosystems whale burials serve as a source of doc that fuels denitrification hotspots surrounding and down gradient of the burials denitrification within the hotspots can remove 41 68 of land derived no3 prior to discharge along the length of beach where the whale is located for the burial scenarios considered whale burials are similar in size to artificial permeable reactive barriers that are installed in coastal aquifers to moderate nitrogen fluxes to coastal ecosystems these findings demonstrate a potentially new management strategy that may be implemented to help meet nutrient loading goals simulations were performed to evaluate no3 removal efficiencies for a range of buried wrack scenarios no3 removal increased with increasing sediment organic carbon content and ranged from 1 6 and 30 3 for 10 100 intertidal sediment organic carbon content while 37 4 of no3 was attenuated with infiltrating seawater as the only source of doc thus buried wrack is likely to serve as a large source of doc that fuels n transformations in beach aquifers a model sensitivity analysis was performed around the whale burial and wrack base case models for a range of physical beach characteristics hydrologic forcing conditions and reaction parameters to provide an upper and lower bound of leachate fluxes and nitrate removal efficiencies results indicate that doc and ammonium fluxes to surface water from whale decomposition can range from 72 1 to 176 6 relative to the base case scenario nitrate removal efficiencies can range from 0 to 44 2 for beaches composed of 10 wrack to 7 4 100 for beaches composed of 100 wrack depending on reaction parameters beach properties and hydrologic forcing the whale burial model results may have implications for shark attraction to the shallow subtidal zone water depth in the whale leachate discharge zone is within the range of swimming depths of beachgoers and discharging leachate concentrations are higher relative to typical ambient surface water concentrations the results of this study are based on numerical models with a simplified accounting of n speciation and transformation and the implications of whale leachate fluxes on shark attraction remains unclear due to limited shark sensory research it is suggested that future research identify the leachate compounds that are shark attractants and classify the corresponding concentrations that influence shark behavior acknowledgements i thank christopher russoniello

1510,coastal managers are increasingly faced with the challenge of disposing of stranded whale carcasses on beaches direct burial in the beach is often used as a cost effective method of disposal however whale burial management plans are often met with public resistance owing to the perceived risk of shark attraction to burial leachate that may discharge from the seabed a reactive transport model was combined with a numerical variable density groundwater flow model to assess buried whale leachate plume formation transport influence on beach aquifer reactivity and discharge to coastal surface water for a range of burial setback distances depths and whale sizes a second set of simulations was performed to evaluate aquifer nitrate removal efficiencies for a range of buried wrack scenarios and to evaluate the role of organic carbon source on beach reactivity a sensitivity analysis was performed for both sets of models across ten physical and reaction parameters simulations using the best estimate parameter set showed that whale burials can produce doc and ammonium leachate plumes in the beach aquifer that are transported to and discharge near the low tide line in water depths of 0 4 2 4 m doc and ammonium concentrations in discharging whale leachate were1 6 and 26 times higher than typical surf zone concentrations respectively of the factors tested the burial distance inland from the high tide line was the most important factor affecting leachate fluxes to surface water burials placed farther inland led to smaller doc fluxes to surface water but increased ammonium fluxes burial depth also affected whale leachate to the subtidal zone with deeper burials resulting in smaller fluxes of doc leached doc from whale decomposition and from buried wrack can fuel denitrification hotspots within beach sediments the sensitivity analysis showed that nitrate removal supported by buried wrack and whale leachate fluxes are highly dependent on beach properties hydrologic forcing and reaction parameters the wrack model results have implications for beach scraping and the whale burial models show that whale leachate can be delivered to the shallow subtidal zone via groundwater discharge pathways with potential implications for shark attraction and whale burial management practices keywords beach aquifer biogeochemical processes groundwater surface water interactions submarine groundwater discharge whale burial 1 introduction the discharge of fresh groundwater across the seabed submarine groundwater discharge sgd is a primary vector of nutrient heavy metal and contaminant delivery to the surf zone and coastal ocean ecosystems these sgd borne solutes can contribute to the formation and maintenance of algal blooms lecher et al 2015 paerl 1997 affect

cascading effects across trophic levels lecher and mackey 2018 the impacts of groundwater chemical fluxes to the surf zone are compounded by the large volume of fresh sgd which is estimated to be 6 10 of global river runoff zektser and loaiciga 1993 and higher in other coastal watersheds russoniello et al 2016 prior to discharge nutrient rich groundwater can undergo biogeochemical processing in beach aquifers that transforms nutrients to non bioavailable solutes the formation of the reactive zones along groundwater discharge pathways depends on the availability of reactants supplied by the physical groundwater flow system anwar et al 2014 heiss et al 2017 spiteri et al 2008b thus it is important to characterize and quantify chemical delivery to the coastal zone via sgd in the context of the interplay between physical and biogeochemical processes in coastal aquifers large marine vertebrates such as whales are often strand on beaches the number of whale carcass strandings have risen with whale populations since the 1986 commercial whaling moratorium tulloch et al 2018 along the east coast of south america for example there were a total of 11 761 documented strandings between 1976 and 2013 prado et al 2016 whale strandings in densely populated areas can detract beachgoers due to odors and unattractive sight during decomposition potentially impacting local tourist economies to combat these issues beach managers implement several disposal methods to remove whale carcasses from the beach including offshore towing transport to a waste facility and beach burial beach burial is the primary means of whale and other cetacean carcass disposal and is common in densely populated areas where recreational activity would be adversely impacted if the stranding were not removed the possible impacts of beach burial include 1 biogeochemical alteration of beach groundwater and 2 shark attraction to the burial vicinity from leaching of doc and nutrients into surrounding groundwater and subsequent discharge to surface water tucker et al 2018 the concern of shark attraction likely stems from the known behavior of sharks such as white fallows et al 2013 and tiger sharks clua et al 2013 that feed on floating whale carcasses tucker et al 2019 while potential whale burial impacts are unclear there remains a strong public resistance to burials due to the perceived risks despite the potential impacts the effects of beach whale burials on nutrient cycling and chemical fluxes to the surf zone are unclear owing to the limited number of existing studies tucker et al 2019 conducted a laboratory study of the effects of whale burials on beach pore water chemistry and showed through column experiments that whale decomposition following burial resulted in a doc nh4 and po4 3 leachate plume that extended up to 2 5 m from the burial location a field burial in the unsaturated zone of a beach in the same study provided no clear temporal or spatial trends in no3 or po4 3 concentrations in the beach subsurface tucker et al 2019 concluded that whale burial leachate plumes would unlikely serve as a shark attractant due to the short leachate travel distance through the beach subsurface to the author s knowledge tucker et al 2019 is the only study to investigate whale burial impacts on beach pore water chemistry decomposition leachate is likely to develop down gradient from a whale burial and may be transported to the subtidal zone due to 1 shallow beach water tables that inundate burials 2 seawater infiltration across the beachface that transports oxygen into the aquifer to support decomposition and 3 rapid circulating flow paths leading from typical burial locations to regions of groundwater discharge in the surf zone robinson et al 2007b xin et al 2010 a more complete understanding of the interactions between whale burials and groundwater dynamics in beach aquifers is needed to inform management decisions to minimize potential adverse impacts of burials on surface

depositional stages dugan et al 2011 ford et al 1999 combined with permeable intertidal sediments spatially heterogeneous buried wrack may provide a significant organic carbon source to the beach

discharge zone located near the base of the beach separates the intertidal circulation cell from the lower saltwater interface a wide range of microbially mediated redox reactions have been observed

seawater across the beach surface is the source of doc that fuels beach reactivity field observations reveal that the distribution of organic carbon and reactivity in the intertidal mixing zone can be spatially heterogeneous despite homogeneous aquifer material kim et al 2017 seibert et al 2019 the reactive hotspots within the beach aquifer can be fueled by scattered carbon pools that form as a result of filtering of circulating doc rich seawater and the differential accumulation of doc on intertidal sediments kim et al 2019 in addition in situ organic rich aggregates may derive from the deposition and burial of organic debris i e wrack deposited in the intertidal zone owing to wave and tidal action promoting the formation of reactive hotspots in the aquifer seidel et al 2015 sediment carbon pools are important for aquifer reactivity in other environments as well for example spatially heterogeneous carbon aggregates can drive localized denitrification in streambed sediments and significantly alter nitrate fluxes to aquatic ecosystems sawyer 2015 laboratory experiments have also shown that whale burials can serve as a source of carbon for beach microbial communities tucker et al 2019 in this study i apply numerical groundwater flow and reactive transport models to evaluate nutrient cycling in coastal aquifers for a range of whale burial and buried wrack scenarios for beaches exposed to tides a sensitivity analysis of whale size burial depth and distance inland from the high tide line is performed for a range of values obtained from whale burial reports to identify the key factors controlling beach aquifer reactivity and to assess whale leachate fluxes to the subtidal zone simulations involving buried wrack aggregates are performed to provide additional insight into the role of in situ particulate organic carbon poc on beach aquifer reactivity 2 methods groundwater flow and reactive transport models were used to simulate the effects of whale burials on chemical transport in beach aquifers for a range of burial distances inland from the high tide line hereafter referred to as setback distance burial depth and whale size whale burial setback distance burial depth and whale size were determined by compiling whale burial media reports table 1 whale burials have rarely been the focus of scientific investigations bui 2009 tucker et al 2019 and thus formal reporting is scarce in the models the setback distance ranged from 0 to 30 m burial depth from 2 to 8 m and whale length from 9 to 15 m whale width height was estimated using the length to width ratio 3 9 of adult female right whales miller et al 2012 the whale burials in the models were represented as permeable carbon rich sediment hereafter referred to as poc the organic carbon content of the sediment is discussed later in this section setback distance burial depth and whale size was varied around a base case parameter set adopted from spiteri et al 2008a and other studies with calibrated models or measurements table 2 a subset of the parameter set was previously calibrated to measurements from a beach aquifer spiteri et al 2008b a sensitivity analysis was performed around the base case parameter set for a base case whale burial scenario 10 m setback distance 4 m burial depth 12 m length to evaluate the effects of 10 model parameters on doc and ammonium leachate fluxes across the sediment water interface table 3 literature values were used to bound the range of each parameter a second set of simulations was performed to assess the effects of buried wrack aggregates on chemical cycling in the aquifer to incorporate realistic distributions of buried wrack gaussian random fields were generated geostatistically using the sequential gaussian simulation algorithm in sgems remy et al 2009 the gaussian random fields were then truncated using arbitrary threshold values corresponding to proportions of wrack in the intertidal sediment the buried wrack or poc aggregates represented macrophytes sticks invertebrates and other organic matter debris the overall spatial extent of the poc aggregates was assigned according to the area in the circulation cell where pore water was 1 ppt to ensure that poc was located between the high and low tide levels where wrack is deposited nine wrack deposit realizations were generated with poc rich sediments comprising 10 90 of intertidal circulation cell sediments the whale burial and buried wrack scenarios were modeled separately in order to isolate the individual effects of the two organic carbon sources on nitrogen cycling in the coastal aquifer the same physical and geochemical parameter set used in the whale burial models was used in the wrack models a wrack sensitivity analysis was performed across the same 10 physical and geochemical parameters that were tested in the whale burial sensitivity table 3 this second sensitivity analysis was used to assess the spectrum of nitrate removal efficiencies that may be expected across physical and geochemical parameter space for intertidal poc contents ranging from 10 to 100 a total of 467 simulations were performed in addition to buried organic matter tides can introduce doc rich seawater to sediments through infiltration across the shoreface which can serve as a source of carbon to drive microbial activity in intertidal mixing zones anwar et al 2014 kim et al 2019 seidel et al 2015 an additional simulation was performed with infiltrating seawater as a source of doc to compare to the whale burial and wrack aggregate scenarios to assess the relative importance of doc source on microbially mediated chemical transformations this simulation is hereafter referred to as the baseline simulation poc served as the only source of doc in the whale burial and wrack deposit scenarios density dependent groundwater flow and salt transport was simulated using seawat v4 0 langevin et al 2008 the model domain and boundary

the intertidal zone x 0 31 m y 0 06 m the third order total variation diminishing tvd scheme was used to solve the advection term the periodic boundary condition package post 2011 was used to simulate tidal forcing and seepage face development across the aquifer ocean interface a time dependent hydraulic head signal was applied to the intertidal and subtidal zone with the hydraulic head ht at the boundary defined as 1 h t acos ωt h o where h t m is the tidal elevation at time t a m is the tidal amplitude ω 2 π t is the tidal angular frequency in rad d 1 and h o m is a reference water level msl in all models a 1 0 m and ω 12 567 rad d 1 model cells along the shoreface with inflow were assigned a zero concentration gradient and cells with discharge were assigned a constant concentration of 35 ppt the hydraulic head at the landward vertical boundary was set to 1 0 m and the top bottom and right boundaries were assigned as no flow and zero solute flux the phase resolved flow fields from the seawat simulations were used with the multi species reactive transport model pht3d v2 13 prommer and post 2003 to simulate aerobic respiration denitrification nitrification ammonification and poc dissolution the reaction time steps in pht3d were set to correspond with the transport steps in seawat used to satisfy numerical stability criteria the reaction network and rate expressions for

seawater entering the aquifer at the shoreface boundary contained salt and o2 and for the case with seawater as the source of organic carbon doc oxygen replenishment to pore water from the atmosphere

van cappellen and wang 1996 poc concentrations were assigned for each of the two sets of whale burial and wrack deposit models the poc concentration for the whale burials was set to 1 27 m 1 organic

is within the range of organic carbon content of intertidal beach sands huettel and rusch 2000 3 results 3 1 baseline solute concentrations and reactivity tidal oscillations and seawater infiltration across the shoreface in the baseline simulation produced circulating flows in the beach aquifer where seawater flowed downward and to the base of the beach while mixing with underlying fresh groundwater to form a saltwater freshwater mixing zone fig 2a the simulated flow pattern and mixing zone is consistent with previous modeling studies of beach groundwater dynamics boufadel 2000 heiss and michael 2014 lebbe 1999 robinson et al 2006 doc concentrations were elevated in the shallow beach subsurface where seawater infiltration was highest and decreased with depth due to doc degradation fig 2b mineralization of doc maintained elevated nh4 concentrations in the circulation cell fig 2c doc oxidation was coupled to aerobic respiration so o2 concentrations were low throughout the intertidal circulation cell fig 2d however o2 concentrations were sufficient to maintain nitrification directly beneath the high tide line to a depth of 2 m fig 2e farther landward and at depth anoxia along the boundary of the circulation cell produced favorable conditions for denitrification which was highest on the landward side of the circulation cell where doc and no3 were abundant fig 2f denitrification within this region of the aquifer produced n2 that was transported to the lower part of the beachface fig 2g nitrate attenuation as a percent of total inflowing land derived nitrate defined as nitrate removal efficiency was 37 4 for the baseline simulation 3 2 whale burials solute concentrations and reaction zones the whale burials altered the chemical composition of pore water in the beach aquifer for the base case set of models fig 3 decomposition of the burials led to localized areas of elevated doc concentrations which decreased along flowpaths owing to doc oxidation fig 3 column 2 doc concentrations surrounding and down gradient of burials with a setback distance of 0 m were lower relative to burials at the same depth 20 m inland fig 3 rows a b burial depth also influenced spatial patterns of doc doc concentrations surrounding burials at 2 m depth were lower than burials at 8 m depth for the same setback distance fig 3 rows c d the variability in doc concentrations for different setback distances and burial depths is owed to the burial location relative to the intertidal circulation cell for a 0 m setback distance pore water circulating at high velocity below the high tide line readily flushed doc out of the system while the burial with a 20 m setback distance was landward of the circulation cell where flow rates were lower allowing doc to accumulate similarly burial depth controlled the proximity of the carcass relative to the circulation cell deeper burials with the same setback distance were offset horizontally from intertidal flows because the circulation cell tapered with depth the low flow velocities outside of the circulation cell led to the accumulation of doc lastly larger whale burials produced more doc and resulted in higher down gradient doc concentrations fig 3 rows e f burial location was a key factor controlling nh4 distributions and nitrification rates figs 3 and 4 regions of elevated nh4 concentrations developed due to doc degradation and ammonification for a setback distance of 20 m nh4 accumulated along flow paths leading to the intertidal mixing zone fig 3 row 2 low nh4 concentrations were maintained within the interior of the circulation cell 90 seawater as a result of nitrification and subsequent removal of nh4 in oxygen rich pore water nitrification rates were highest 1 3 m below the high tide line where infiltration of oxygen rich seawater was highest fig 4 the location of the nitrification zone was unaffected by whale burial distance inland depth or whale size because circulating flows in the mixing zone hydraulically restricted the extent of overlap between nh4 and o2 nitrate concentrations varied with typical setback distances burial depths and whale sizes nitrate rich fresh groundwater flowing into the aquifer was anoxic and thus burials inland of oxygenated intertidal pore water formed denitrification hotspots fig 3 row 4 denitrification rates within the hotspots increased with setback distance and reached a maximum of 2 5 10 3 m d fig 5 in the case of a 20 m setback distance slow transport rates and a high accumulation of doc in the freshwater aquifer promoted rapid no3 uptake which formed a large region of low no3 concentrations that merged with the circulation cell fig 3 row b no3 uptake was limited for burials located in the circulation cell due to the presence of o2 from infiltrating seawater and lower doc concentrations from rapid flushing of intertidal pore water figs 5a simulated doc and ammonium concentrations were elevated relative to observed data reported in literature while nitrate concentrations compare favorability with measured values in previous studies the maximum leached doc concentration 6 1 10 3 m was greater than the range of highest doc concentrations 2 5 10 4 3 0 10 3 m observed in natural beach aquifers e g santos et al 2008 seidel et al 2015 spiteri et al 2008a modeled ammonium concentrations maximum 1 8 10 4 m were near the upper end of the range 4 0 10 5 2 4 10 4 m of values measured in beach sediments kim et al 2017 kroeger and charette 2008 spiteri et al 2008a ullman et al 2003 nitrate concentrations in the intertidal mixing zone 1 90 seawater salinity ranged from 1 3 10 4 m 1 4 10 5 m consistent with observed concentrations reported in literature e g couturier et al 2017 charbonnier et a 2013 kroeger and charette 2008 3 3 whale burials nitrate removal the three physical burial factors affected the flux of land derived no3 across the aquifer ocean interface nitrate removal efficiency increased with setback distance and ranged from 41 to 52 reaching an asymptote at a setback distance of 20 30 m fig 6a removal efficiency increased from 50 to 58 with an increase in burial depth from 2 to 8 m fig 6b deeper burials were located farther outside of the circulation cell relative to shallow burials because the cell tapered with depth as discussed previously this offset had a similar effect as high setback distances slower transport rates outside of the circulation cell led to the accumulation of doc and longer residence times that enhanced reactivity removal efficiency increased from 24 to 68 as whale length increased from 9 to 15 m as a result of higher doc production fig 6c 3 4 total whale leachate flux to the subtidal zone leachate fluxes to surface water were nonzero for the range of setback distances burial depths and whale sizes considered doc flux decreased with increasing setback distance because longer flow paths lead to greater doc degradation fig 6d an increase in burial depth led to lower doc fluxes due to greater doc degradation along slow transport paths adjacent to the circulation cell fig 6e whale size was also a key factor controlling leachate flux decomposition of larger burials generated larger quantities of doc thus doc fluxes increased with increasing burial size fig 6f doc degradation is coupled to ammonification and thus nh4 flux across the aquifer ocean interface increased with setback distance and depth fig 6g h unlike setback distance and burial depth where nh4 flux varied inversely with doc flux the model results show that both nh4 and doc flux increased with whale size the four burials of different sizes were set in an identical location in the flow system this eliminated the effects of hydrological variation such as transport rates that contributed to the inverse relationship between doc and nh4 flux for differences in setback distance and burial depth 3 5 buried wrack solute concentrations and denitrification zone buried wrack aggregates altered the distribution of solutes in the beach aquifer fig 7 shows solute concentrations in sediments with 10 100 poc content decomposition of the wrack generated doc that accumulated along circulating flow paths fig 7 row 2 doc fueled aerobic respiration in the shallow beach subsurface however o2 concentrations remained elevated enough to inhibit denitrification in pore water greater than 50 seawater in the circulation cell figs 7 and 8 on the boundary of the circulation cell in pore water with salinity less than 50 seawater land derived no3 mixed with doc in anoxic pore water and denitrified as it was transported seaward fig 8 an increase in buried wrack content and corresponding increase in doc led to enhanced no3 removal and lower no3 concentrations in the fresh discharge zone fig 7 row 4 the baseline model and the wrack aggregate models both show that denitrification occurred in the intertidal mixing zone in pore water with salinity less than 50 seawater however reaction rates were highest on opposite ends of the circulation cell the landward side when seawater was the source of doc and on the seaward side when wrack aggregates were the source of doc fig 2f and fig 8 denitrification rates for the baseline model were highest on the landward side of the circulation cell because infiltrating seawater transported large quantities of doc into the aquifer below the high tide line while the accumulation of doc in the wrack simulations led to high no3 removal rates at the terminal end of circulating flow paths 4 sensitivity analysis effects of model parameters 4 1 whale burial leachate fluxes doc and ammonium fluxes to surface water varied with beach properties hydrologic forcing and reaction parameter values fig 9 shows the percent change in doc and ammonium flux relative to the base case parameter set and base case burial scenario for a range of physical and reaction parameter values hydraulic conductivity was the most important physical parameter affecting leachate fluxes followed by the tidal amplitude anisotropy ratio beach slope freshwater hydraulic gradient transverse dispersivity ratio and longitudinal dispersivity doc flux increased with hydraulic conductivity due to higher transport rates between the whale burial and discharge zone limiting doc degradation and ammonification fig 9a doc and ammonium leachate fluxes varied between 69 5 and 176 6 relative to the base case for hydraulic conductivity values of 2 50 m d tidal amplitude was the second most important physical factor with doc and ammonium fluxes varying between 72 1 and 128 5 around the base case for tidal amplitudes between 0 2 m and 1 3 m doc flux decreased with increasing tidal amplitude due to longer circulating intertidal flow paths that led to greater doc degradation but it was met with a corresponding increase in ammonium flux fig 9b beach slope had a moderate impact on doc and ammonium fluxes fluxes varied from 67 5 70 2 for beach slopes between 0 0375 and 0 1 steeper beaches formed smaller circulation cells owing to narrower intertidal zones which shortened transport paths between the whale burial and discharge zone thus doc fluxes increased with beach slope due to less doc degradation while ammonium fluxes decreased as a result of diminished ammonification fig 9c the freshwater hydraulic gradient was also an important factor affecting leachate flux fig 9d strong freshwater hydraulic gradients restricted tidally driven flows which resulted in shorter flow paths between the whale burial and discharge zone combined with shorter freshwater residence times this led to higher doc fluxes while simultaneously limiting ammonification fig 9d doc and ammonium fluxes varied between 62 5 and 40 5 relative to the base case across the range of freshwater hydraulic gradients the transverse dispersivity ratio and longitudinal dispersivity had a negligible effect on doc and ammonium fluxes because doc degradation and ammonification occurred as mixing independent reactions fig 9e f these results highlight the importance of physical hydrologic controls on the fate of whale leachate in beach aquifers leachate fluxes were also sensitive to reaction model parameters the mass transfer coefficient for organic carbon was the most important reactive parameter affecting doc and ammonium flux to the subtidal zone with fluxes varying between 77 7 and 110 2 relative to the base case for the range of tested mass transfer coefficients fig 9h increases in both the mass transfer coefficient and distribution coefficient enhanced dissolution of poc and resulted in higher doc and ammonium fluxes fig 9h i as expected higher doc rate constants led to lower doc fluxes as more doc was consumed along flow paths while ammonium fluxes increased owing to more rapid ammonification fig 9j 4 1 1 buried wrack nitrate removal the results of the parametric sensitivity analysis provide an upper and lower bound of leachate fluxes and nitrate removal efficiencies for the best estimate parameter values used in the base case burial scenario for the base case parameter set and burial scenario nitrate removal efficiency increased from 1 6 30 3 as intertidal poc content increased from 10 to 100 black symbology fig 10 while the removal efficiency was 37 4 for the baseline model with seawater as the source of doc not shown however the model sensitivity analysis showed that removal efficiency depends on physical beach properties and reaction parameter values removal efficiency was most sensitive to beach slope varying by an average of 55 8 range 0 55 8 relative to base case across all poc contents for slopes from 0 1 to 0 0375 fig 10c wider intertidal zones supported larger circulation cells with more wrack deposition leading to greater doc production and larger denitrification zones the freshwater hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity had a similar effect on removal efficiency removal efficiency across the range of freshwater hydraulic gradients 0 0083 0 003 and hydraulic conductivity values 2 50 m d varied respectively by an average of 29 0 range 8 6 20 4 relative to base case and 28 7 range 4 0 24 7 relative to base case across all poc contents fig 10a and d tidal amplitude had a moderate influence on removal efficiency differing by 19 7 range 11 3 8 4 relative to base case for amplitudes between 0 2 m and 1 3 m the effects of anisotropy were less with a mean variability of 8 8 range 0 8 8 relative to base case for anisotropy ratios of 0 1 1 0 fig 10g the combination of factors that resulted in large intertidal mixing zones i e gentle beach slope low freshwater hydraulic gradient high k large tidal amplitude yielded higher removal efficiencies due to larger accumulations of wrack and associated doc production as well as greater contact between nitrate rich fresh groundwater and anoxic circulating seawater for a detailed description of the role of each physical factor on physical flow and transport in beach aquifers see heiss et al 2017 removal efficiency varied by 6 2 range 2 6 3 6 relative to base case for transverse dispersivity ratios between 0 01 and 0 2 and by 2 3 range 0 9 1 4 relative to base case for longitudinal dispersivity values ranging from 0 1 1 0 m fig 10e and f the distribution coefficient was a key reaction parameter affecting removal efficiency 56 3 variability relative to base case followed by the mass transfer coefficient 29 5 and doc rate constant 25 2 as discussed in section 3 5 1 larger distribution and mass transfer coefficients enhanced doc production the greater doc availability which was also supported by lower doc rate constants promoted denitrification and increased removal efficiency for the range of parameter values tested 5 discussion 5 1 whale burial implications for shark attraction the discharging concentration of doc and nh4 relative to the surface water concentration is likely a primary factor determining the formation of surface water leachate plumes that could potentially serve as a shark attractant simulation results based on the base case set of parameters show that maximum doc concentrations in discharging leachate near the low tide line can reach 660 μm while observed ambient doc concentrations in coastal waters worldwide ranges from 180 to 420 μm bauer and bianchi 2012 thus leached doc concentrations in submarine groundwater discharge may be up to 1 6 times higher than in coastal surface water similarly the maximum nh4 concentration of discharging leachate for models using the base case parameter set was 56 μm more than an order of magnitude higher than 2 μm typical of surf zones pregnall and miller 1988 these findings may have implications for shark attraction to areas where whale leachate is discharging to surface water the depth of the water column where whale leachate discharges may be important for plume dispersal in the subtidal zone fig 11 shows the cross shore location of the doc and nh4 discharge zones and the water column depth across the subtidal zone during low mid and high tide the leached doc discharge zone spans approximately 11 m across the aquifer ocean interface and is centered 2 0 m seaward of the low tide line corresponding to a surface water depth of 2 2 m during high tide and 0 9 m during low tide nh4 fluxes peak 4 1 m seaward of the low tide line where the water depth is 2 4 m at high tide and 0 4 m at low tide the depth of the water column at the doc and nh4 discharge zones is typical of water depths occupied by swimmers combined with elevated leachate concentrations as discussed above these results may have important implications for shark attraction to the inner subtidal zone for a given leachate concentration and flux to the subtidal zone surface water doc and nh4 enrichment will ultimately depend on numerous factors that impact surf and subtidal zone plume dispersal that were not considered in this study including wave energy bathymetry tidal regime shape of the coastline water column depth and biological activity in the surface water additionally the specific compounds in a leachate plume that sharks may be attracted to is unclear and the stage of doc degradation and the chemical signature of a leachate plume will evolve along discharging transport pathways with greater complexity than modeled here the doc and nh4 fluxes in this study should therefore be considered a first order estimate of the impact of whale burial decomposition on material fluxes to coastal surface waters 5 2 whale burial nitrate attenuation implications the results of this study provide a framework for predicting the location and magnitude of biogeochemical reactivity in beach aquifers for typical whale burial management decisions with the rise in global whale populations since the commercial whaling moratorium in 1986 tulloch et al 2018 coastal managers must increasingly weigh the potential risks and benefits of whale disposal methods the base case model scenario used in this study reveals that whale burials may attenuate up to 68 of land derived no3 that would otherwise discharge to the coastal ocean ecosystem along the section of the beach where the whale is located no3 attenuation by whale burials as shown in this study is similar to and is of the same spatial scale as permeable reactive barriers designed to mitigate coastal eutrophication through the supply of carbon from the decomposition of buried woodchips hiller et al 2015 showed that a 20 m long x 3 m diameter woodchip permeable reactive barrier installed in a beach promoted denitrification and led to a decline in nitrate concentrations in discharging groundwater these artificial nitrogen treatment systems are most effective when installed at the mouth of watersheds where groundwater flow converges at the coast barbarso et al 2019 thus although the burials are small up to 15 m in length in this study relative to the length of coastline the burials may have the potential to significantly reduce nitrogen loads to receiving surface water bodies this newly identified artificial ecosystem service should be considered in decision tools used to assist beach managers coastal stakeholders and regulators when evaluating the optimal carcass disposal method for a particular stranding and surface water quality conditions the elevated no3 concentrations in inflowing fresh groundwater is representative of densely populated coastal communities or in areas with continued agricultural development where increased groundwater loading of n from wastewater and fertilizer to coastal surface water can have adverse ecosystem impacts slomp and van cappellen 2004 valiela et al 1990 the no3 attenuation capacity of whale burials as shown in this study is therefore most applicable to highly urbanized or rural coastal landscapes 5 3 optimal whale burial location the optimal burial depth and distance inland from the high tide line depends on management goals the findings suggest that managers should strive for a setback distance 10 m at the maximum achievable depth if coastal waters are susceptible to eutrophication this burial configuration increases no3 removal efficiency by increasing the residence time of reactive solutes if there is concern of shark attraction resulting from burial decomposition and related chemical fluxes two burial configurations may be considered to limit leachate flux to the subtidal zone carcasses buried at high setback distances 30 m should result in near zero doc flux due to greater doc degradation along longer flow paths however high setback distances result in higher nh4 fluxes thus an alternate configuration is more suitable to limit nh4 loading burials placed below the high tide line 0 m setback distance at the shallowest burial depth 2 m should lead to lower nh4 fluxes to surface water since short transport paths to the discharge zone coupled with rapid circulating flows in the circulation cell decrease the time available for ammonification the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that managers should also consider the physical characteristics of the beach and the hydrologic conditions of the coastal aquifer when formulating carcass disposal strategies and selecting burial sites model results show that leachate fluxes are highly dependent on beach properties and the hydrologic forces acting on the aquifer a set of beach e g gentle beach slope low hydraulic conductivity and hydrologic e g large tidal amplitude low freshwater gradient parameters that increase residence time in the coastal aquifer will reduce doc delivery to receiving coastal waters owing to greater doc degradation along flow paths however the longer residence times will enhance ammonification yielding higher ammonium fluxes prioritization of efforts focused on moderating doc or ammonium flux from whale burials will depend likely on management goals and ultimately the extent of shark attraction to the leachate compounds considered in this study 5 4 beach wrack the numerical simulations suggest that buried wrack can serve as source of doc that sustains bulk denitrification at rates that approach those supported by the supply of doc in infiltrating seawater these results support field observations of the role of buried wrack on moderating nutrient fluxes to coastal ecosystems rossi and underwood 2002 in addition denitrification rates were spatially discontinuous and highest farther along circulating flow paths where doc accumulated consistent with observed denitrification patterns that result from scattered pools of carbon within beach sediments kim et al 2019 this has important implications for beach managers engaged in beach grooming which invokes large machinery to scrape and sieve the sand surface to remove plastics paper fishing lines hooks and other debris that accumulate on popular beaches grooming is also conduced to remove beach wrack and is therefore likely to reduce wrack burial and subsequent supply of organic carbon to the beach aquifer leading to lower no3 attenuation coastal armoring is also likely to reduce the quantity of buried wrack and the availability of doc as the footprint of armored beach structures covers areas of the beachface where wrack accumulates dugan et al 2008 5 5 model simplifications there are additional factors not accounted for in the models the models assume that burials are submerged below the water table throughout the tidal cycle while this may not always be the case it is a reasonable assumption near the shoreline where vertical infiltration of seawater by wave and tidal action across the beachface maintains shallow water table elevations e g de drézigué et al 2009 turner et al 1997 that are above the shallowest burial depth 2 m identified in media reports in this study however shallow burials at high setback distances in high relief areas may be permanently located in the unsaturated zone or periodically inundated by an oscillating water table previous work has shown that transport of leachate from whale carcasses buried in the unsaturated zone is minimal tucker et al 2019 additionally decomposition of lipids in human graves in unsaturated soils is slowed or halted due limited oxygen availability and exposure to reducing conditions dent et al 2004 further suggesting that whale burials located above the water table are unlikely to produce leachate of sufficient quantity to be transported to surface water the results of the present study demonstrate that burials below the water table can produce leachate that is transported to the nearshore area by groundwater flow wave setup and swash spring neap variability in tidal amplitude seasonal oscillations in the freshwater hydraulic gradient and precipitation events affect flow transport and mixing in beach aquifers abarca et al 2013 heiss and michael 2014 heiss et al 2014 heiss et al 2015 robinson et al 2007a 2007b robinson et al 2014 xin et al 2010 oscillatory flows and shifting redox gradients that result from these transient hydrologic forcing mechanisms will may lead to temporal variability in the spatial distribution of reaction zones reactivity intensity and chemical fluxes the dynamic physical flow and chemical responses to these transient and interacting forcings may lead to optimal burial configurations that differ from those found in this study the numerical model accounted for n mineralization nitrification and denitrification however additional n cycling pathways have been observed in beach aquifers such as anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox slomp and van cappellen 2004 and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra santoro 2010 annamox would provide an additional n removal pathway that would reduce denitrification though the consumption of no3 similarly dnra competes with denitrification to reduce no3 and requires the same redox conditions thus actual no3 removal whether performed via anammox dnra or denitrification would unlikely deviate significantly from the simulated results if anammox and dnra were incorporated into the reaction network nh4 flux to the surface water would likely decrease with the incorporation of anammox owing to nh4 oxidation lastly the modeling approach does not consider interactions between overlapping decomposition plumes in settings with both a whale burial and buried wrack both sources of carbon were intentionally not implemented in model scenarios because data on organic carbon content of beach sediments at a potential whale burial site is often unavailable to coastal managers thus the goal was to understand the individual effects of each carbon source to independently support whale disposal and beach scraping management decisions 6 conclusions a reactive transport model was combined with a variable density groundwater flow model to simulate the effects of whale burial decomposition and buried organic matter i e wrack on the chemical composition and reactivity of coastal aquifers subjected to tides the findings demonstrate the importance of whale burial location on whale leachate extent and associated flux to surface water and the effects of buried wrack on nutrient fluxes to coastal ecosystems a sensitivity analysis of whale burial distance inland from the high tide line burial depth and whale size show that decomposition of whale burials produces doc and ammonium leachate plumes that are transported to and discharge from the aquifer near the low tide line in water depths between 0 4 and 2 4 m doc and ammonium concentrations in discharging leachate for the base case models are 1 6 and 26 times higher than typical surf zone concentrations respectively in instances where there is concern of shark attraction to discharging leachate two burial configurations may be considered to limit leachate flux to the subtidal zone burials located 30 m inland from the high tide line at a depth of 8 m will likely result in near zero doc flux however this burial configuration enhances ammonium fluxes thus an alternate configuration is more suitable to limit ammonium loading burials placed at shallow depth 2 m below the high tide line should lead to lower ammonium fluxes to surface water it should be noted that the model employed in this study assumes that the whales are submerged below the water table which may not always be the case leachate production from whales buried in the unsaturated zone is likely to differ than modeled in the present study simulation results suggest that managers should strive for a setback distance of greater than 10 m at the maximum achievable depth if a management objective is to promote denitrification and reduce n loading to coastal ecosystems whale burials serve as a source of doc that fuels denitrification hotspots surrounding and down gradient of the burials denitrification within the hotspots can remove 41 68 of land derived no3 prior to discharge along the length of beach where the whale is located for the burial scenarios considered whale burials are similar in size to artificial permeable reactive barriers that are installed in coastal aquifers to moderate nitrogen fluxes to coastal ecosystems these findings demonstrate a potentially new management strategy that may be implemented to help meet nutrient loading goals simulations were performed to evaluate no3 removal efficiencies for a range of buried wrack scenarios no3 removal increased with increasing sediment organic carbon content and ranged from 1 6 and 30 3 for 10 100 intertidal sediment organic carbon content while 37 4 of no3 was attenuated with infiltrating seawater as the only source of doc thus buried wrack is likely to serve as a large source of doc that fuels n transformations in beach aquifers a model sensitivity analysis was performed around the whale burial and wrack base case models for a range of physical beach characteristics hydrologic forcing conditions and reaction parameters to provide an upper and lower bound of leachate fluxes and nitrate removal efficiencies results indicate that doc and ammonium fluxes to surface water from whale decomposition can range from 72 1 to 176 6 relative to the base case scenario nitrate removal efficiencies can range from 0 to 44 2 for beaches composed of 10 wrack to 7 4 100 for beaches composed of 100 wrack depending on reaction parameters beach properties and hydrologic forcing the whale burial model results may have implications for shark attraction to the shallow subtidal zone water depth in the whale leachate discharge zone is within the range of swimming depths of beachgoers and discharging leachate concentrations are higher relative to typical ambient surface water concentrations the results of this study are based on numerical models with a simplified accounting of n speciation and transformation and the implications of whale leachate fluxes on shark attraction remains unclear due to limited shark sensory research it is suggested that future research identify the leachate compounds that are shark attractants and classify the corresponding concentrations that influence shark behavior acknowledgements i thank christopher russoniello

1511,shale matrix permeability is one of the most important parameters for characterizing a source rock reservoir and for predicting hydrocarbon production the low permeability value and the presence of induced fractures during core retrieval and transportation make the accurate measurement of the true permeability values for source rocks a significant challenge for the industry the steady state flow method and the transient pressure pulse decay method on core plug samples mainly measure the permeability of fractures when fractures are present while the gas research institute gri method that uses pressure decay on crushed rock samples was designed to overcome this difficulty associated with the induced fractures its measurement results are reported to be sensitive to the particle size of crushed rock samples and also need correction of knudsen diffusion effect moreover the gri method is limited to the unconfined stress condition this work develops a practical method to measure the matrix permeability values from fractured source rock samples by extending the commonly used pressure pulse decay method a source rock sample with fractures can be more accurately described by a dual continuum system consisting of a fracture continuum and a matrix continuum during the pulse decay test the initial flow across the source rock sample is dominated by the fracture continuum because it has much higher permeability values than those for the rock matrix thus the initial gas pressure signals from the test are used to estimate the fracture permeability during the late stage of a pulse decay test the flow process within the rock sample is controlled by the rock matrix the observed pressure signals at this stage are used for estimating matrix permeability the method is based on the analytical solution to gas flow in the fractured rock sample and relatively simple to apply in practice both fracture and matrix permeability s dependence on the effective stress can be assessed with this method 1 introduction source rock matrix permeability is one of the most important parameters for characterizing a source rock reservoir and for predicting hydrocarbon production e g clarkson et al 2012 clarkson 2013 the overall production and the late period production of an unconventional reservoir depend to a large degree on the matrix permeability of the rock formation e g heller et al 2014 it is a technical challenge to measure meaningful permeability values of source rocks in a laboratory because the matrix permeability is extremely small and there could be induced fractures due to the retrieval of the samples from the reservoir depth to the surface the transportation of source rock samples from well sites to laboratories and sample handling in laboratories civan 2017 the laminations of the source rocks make the samples highly susceptible to breaking up along the lamination surfaces for a cylindrical plug sample of source rock with induced fractures the fractures dominantly determine the permeability values measured in laboratory by the traditional methods including the steady state flow method american petroleum institute 1998 mallon and swarbrick 2008 and the transient pressure pulse decay pdp method brace et al 1968 hsieh et al 1981 dicker and smits 1988 jones 1997 alnoaimi et al 2014 the measured permeability values largely from the induced fractures do not represent the true matrix permeability values under reservoir conditions and can be misleading to reservoir engineers to minimize the effect caused by the induced fractures luffel et al 1993 proposed to use a pressure decay method on crushed source rock samples for the matrix permeability measurements which is called the gri gas research institute method the gri method is based on the consideration that there is no fracture or microfracture in small rock particles with sizes on the order of 1 mm it has gained popularity in the petroleum industry as it appears to have eliminated the effect of induced fractures and is relatively easy to use restech 1995 later studies however indicate that the gri method generates results that are very sensitive to the particle size of crushed rock samples cui and glover 2014 and to the test condition such as relative volume of the gas and solid tinni et al 2012 the gri method is also limited to the unconfined stress condition cui and glover 2014 and suffers from fluctuations in laboratory procedures and lack of standard sinha et al 2012 since the gri method is generally conducted at relatively low gas pressure conditions the impact of knudsen diffusion is another concern with the method liu and zhang 2020 efforts have been recently made to deal with the problems that the gri method faces realizing that crushing rock would alter the rock properties significantly peng and loucks 2016 proposed to measure the matrix permeability on plug samples with a confining pressure and low pore pressures between 0 and 200 psi though the correction of effects of knudson diffusion and slippage flow is needed due to the low gas pressure used in their procedure gan et al 2018 determined matrix permeability values using numerical simulation of the pressure decay tests on core plugs under low pore pressure based on an assumption that the permeability is uniform and isotropic in all directions nevertheless their methods are still limited to low gas pressure conditions or the use of numerical simulation based analysis approaches the focus of this study is on determining rock matrix permeability from fractured source rock plugs to the best of our knowledge ning 1992 and ning et al 1993 conducted early work with similar objectives they used numerical methods for historical matching of pressure pulse decay tests to determine the fracture and matrix permeability values from fractured plug samples however their procedures are complex and were developed for isotropic rocks while unconventional rocks are highly anisotropic as will be discussed later thus their methods have not been widely used in practice this work determines matrix permeability from pressure pulse decay test data of fractured source rock plugs based on observed gas pressure histories from different flow regimes unlike the previous methods mentioned above this work employs an easily used analytical method the method allows for measuring the permeability of unconventional source rock samples with minimal disturbance to the rock fabrics because it performs the measurements on whole plug samples without crushing both fracture and matrix permeability s dependence on the effective stress can be assessed with this method 2 method as previously indicated we estimate both fracture and matrix permeability values from a fractured core sample based on test data from different flow regimes observed from a pulse decay test the test setup consists of an upstream gas reservoir a core holder containing a core sample that is subject to confining pressure and a downstream gas reservoir they are connected to three different pumps to provide gas pressures and confining pressure respectively initially in a pulse decay test upstream gas reservoir downstream gas reservoir and pores in the core sample are in equilibrium at a gas saturation pressure of p saturation e g 2500 psi then the pressure in the upstream gas reservoir is increased by p pulse e g 100 psi and pulse decay measurement starts on the pressure history plot after the pulse decay measurement starts fig 1 the upstream and downstream pressures merge into one curve at point a after that the pressures continue to decline because the gas still flows from both upstream and downstream reservoirs into the sample although there is no pressure gradient between the two gas reservoirs the pressure decline continues until gas pressures in all connected pore space in the system are in equilibrium at point b we conceptualized the above observation into two stages for a source rock sample when the vertical permeability is significant smaller than the horizontal one fig 2 shows schematics of the dual flow regimes of fractures and matrix there is a fast flow regime owing to fractures fracture flow regime and a slow flow regime through matrix matrix flow regime during the initial stage of experiments both flow regimes coexist however when there is a large difference between the fracture permeability and the matrix permeability the flow through the fractures dominates in the early period of the experiments and the pressure gradient between the upstream and downstream reservoirs is relatively large before point a in fig 1 any conventional method e g dicker and smits 1988 can be used for calculating the fracture permeability using the data prior to point a the slow flow from both upstream and downstream reservoirs into the sample shows more prominently in the late stage after point a in fig 1 after the upstream and downstream pressures reach equilibrium in other words in the late stage there is no pressure gradient between the two gas reservoirs but there is one between the gas reservoirs fractures and the rock matrix the slow flow regime is largely determined by the matrix permeability the matrix permeability analysis uses the late time data after both upstream and downstream pressures merge into one curve the late stage experiment can also be conducted by switching to much smaller gas reservoirs on the both upstream and downstream sides than those used in the early stage so that the pressure decay in late stage becomes much more obvious and the data are more suitable for analysis the analytical schematics for the matrix flow regime are shown in fig 3 in this case the upstream and downstream are fully equilibrated such that the pressures in both reservoirs are equal and gas still flows from the reservoirs into the sample from the end faces of the plug sample note that gas flow from the fracture faces to the matrix is negligible due to the observation that matrix permeability in the horizontal z direction in fig 3b or along the bedding direction is much larger than that in the vertical direction x direction in fig 3b therefore the gas flow into the sample in the late stage is mainly from the end faces of a horizontal core plug sample in order to get an analytical solution for determining the matrix permeability two assumptions are made 1 the gas transfers along the vertical direction of the core is neglected and 2 there is little adsorption occurring at the measuring pore pressure some equivalent parameters need to be defined the sum of upstream and downstream volumes can be transformed to an equivalent volume v e as 1 v e v 1 v 2 v f where v 1 and v 2 are upstream and downstream volumes respectively and v f the volume of fractures which can be neglected in most cases compared with the upstream and downstream gas reservoirs combining darcy s law and the mass

is needed herein as an example fig 4 shows such an observed relationship between log p d and time for an unconventional carbonate source rock sample the sample is 1 in diameter and 1 long and has a porosity of 4 3 and a matrix permeability of 16 nd 3 permeability measurement results to validate the proposed method we performed a pulse decay measurement on a non fractured sample with low permeability the measured permeability is considered the true matrix permeability of the sample we then created artificial fractures by over pressurizing the sample and measured the matrix permeability from the fractured core plug using our method the comparison between permeability values measured before and after artificial fracturing can be used for evaluating the usefulness of our method for validation purposes we chose a pyrophyllite sample a metamorphic rock that is quite homogeneous and readily available from commercial sources profice et al 2015 table 1 shows a comparison of the matrix permeability results for the pyrophyllite sample that were obtained before and after artificial fracturing the true matrix permeability values obtained before fracturing are 232 nd and 215 nd at two pressure settings respectively the permeability with our method from the artificially fractured core sample is 238 nd and 200 nd at the corresponding pressure settings respectively the two permeability value sets are very close supporting the validity of the proposed approach to further demonstrate how our method can be used for investigating the stress dependency of permeability on unconventional source rocks without crushing we measured permeability as a function of confining pressure and a given pore pressure 2500 psi for a fractured source rock sample the measurements were run with 2500 psi as the initial gas pressure the use of the relatively high pore pressure was to minimize the diffusion effect after the pressure equilibrated overnight a pressure pulse around 100 psi was applied to the upstream gas reservoir and the pressures are monitored on both upstream and downstream gas reservoirs with high accuracy precision pressure transducers nitrogen gas was used as the working fluid in the tests each test stops when gas pressures from both gas reservoirs do not decrease any more all pressure lines reservoirs sample cell and inlet and outlet pumps are kept in a temperature controlled oven at 50 c with a maximum fluctuation of 0 5 c the pressure decay data were analysed with an in house software written in matlab and gas adsorption effect was negligible and thus was not considered the same test procedure was used for the pyrophyllite sample as well fig 5 shows measured fracture and matrix permeability for the source rock sample under different confining pressure conditions for a given test condition the fracture permeability is about two orders of magnitude higher than the matrix permeability for the traditional pressure pulse decay method one can only estimate the bulk permeability that is essentially the same as the fracture permeability because the core sample was treated as a single continuum system rather than a dual continuum system as shown in fig 5 stress dependency of permeability can be fitted by exponential functions for both fractures and the matrix which is consistent with previous studies on the subject liu and zhang 2020 note that for a given pore pressure the increase in confining pressure or differential pressure p d that is defined as the difference between confining pressure and pore pressure would decrease the pore size or fracture aperture size and thus reduce the permeability fig 5 4 discussion as previously indicated the stress release of rock samples when taken from the subsurface to the surface will induce fractures in these samples the transportation of the source rock samples from well sites to laboratories and plugging processes will further enhance the possibility of inducing fractures in the core samples to be used in laboratory for permeability measurements since source rock permeability is very low the existence of the induced fracture would make laboratory permeability measurement results significantly higher than its true value under reservoir conditions thus it has been highly desirable to find ways to eliminate the impact of the induced fractures for practical applications the industrial standard to deal with this issue is the gri method that however suffers from several limitations the gri permeability is sensitive to particle size of the crushed rock samples needs the correction of the diffusion effect and can only be applied to the un confined conditions cui et al 2009 this work developed a method to overcome the technical challenge stated above by extending the traditional pressure pulse decay method the method has several favourable features firstly it allows for estimating both fracture and matrix permeability values from fractured core samples under different stress conditions secondly it is based on analytical solutions to gas flow across the core sample and thus easy to use in practice the determination of the matrix permeability involves linear curve fitting only thirdly it uses the same experimental setup as the traditional pressure pulse decay method and thus is easily adopted it should be noted that the gas transfer from the fracture surfaces into the matrix is neglected for unconventional source rocks based on that the vertical permeability is much smaller than the horizontal permeability due to the anisotropy of unconventional source rocks the strong anisotropy of rock material in different physical properties is noticed by many researchers sone and zoback 2013 mokhtari et al 2013 anders et al 2014 lai et al 2015 and permeability anisotropy in source rocks can be expected lishman 1970 mentioned that vertical permeability is always lower than permeability in horizontal direction pan et al 2015 measured the permeability of two silurian longmaxi source rock samples and found that the vertical permeability is about two magnitude smaller than the horizontal permeability e g the vertical permeability of sample 1 is around 1 5 nd whereas the horizontal permeability is between 185 nd and 258 nd bhandari et al 2015 studied two barnet source rock samples with the vertical permeability around 2 nd and horizontal permeability around 96 nd pathi 1997 measured the permeability of six siliceous and calcareous source rock samples from west canadian sedimentary basin and found that the vertical permeability is 3 to 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the horizontal permeability therefore it is appropriate to neglect the gas transfer from fracture surfaces into the matrix if the unconventional source rock samples are highly anisotropic when a source rock sample is isotropic the simulation method by ning 1992 can be applied adsorption of the nitrogen as working fluid in permeability measurement is neglected for the analytical solution of this method when using the mass balance to calculate the porosity the calculated porosity values at high pore pressure should be much higher than that at low pore pressure if adsorption is significant as the adsorbed gas density is much higher than the free gas density at the same gas pressure we measured samples at different pore pressures at 1500 psi 2000 psi 2500 psi and 3500 psi using nitrogen gas while keeping the differential pressure pc pp constant and the changes in porosity values from these measurements are very small e g within 0 1 for a sample with the porosity around 11 suggesting that the contribution of adsorption can be neglected the accuracy of the matrix permeability of this method is demonstrated by the consistence between the measured matrix permeability values for the same rock sample with and without artificial fractures table 1 using this method and the traditional pressure pulse decay method for further ensuring the reliability of our instrument its pressure pulse decay measurement result is also compared with a permeability standard the standard consists of a nominal 8 μm inner diameter with manufacturing error of 1 μm capillary tube embedded in an aluminium cylinder 1 long and 1 in diameter with theoretical permeability values between 120 and 320 nd with an average of 200 nd the permeability range results from the manufacture error for the diameter of the capillary tube our pulse decay measurement for this microtube is 233 nd this is acceptable considering the great difficulty of accurately manufacturing a standard on this scale to have the required permeability for example ghanizadeh et al 2017 presented their work of manufacturing permeability standards of a 25 μm inner diameter microtube embedded in 2 long acrylic cylindrical plugs with 1 5 diameter owing to the manufacturing error these standards have very different permeability values ranging from 8000 nd and 12 000 nd it is even more difficult to make accurate permeability standards with a capillary tube having small diameters it may be useful to compare our method with the related efforts that measure plug scale matrix permeability by improving the current gri methodology for example gan et al 2018 provided a laboratory test procedure and data analysis method to estimate matrix permeability from fractured core samples in their experimental procedure pressure decay through gas flow into both the cylindrical surface and the end surfaces of a core plug is allowed to occur and a numerical model was used to match the pressure decay history for estimating the matrix permeability compared to our method the method of gan et al 2018 has several shortcomings it ignores the permeability anisotropy within a rock sample by assuming the permeability is uniform in all directions and this assumption is not valid as anisotropy is strong for unconventional source rock samples mokhtari et al 2013 similar to the gri method it cannot be applied to the confined stress conditions furthermore it is based on numerical simulations the non uniqueness of parameter estimation based on the numerical simulations is always a concern in practical applications peng and loucks 2016 also presented a method to measure the matrix permeability of plug samples in their method a sample is sleeved thus a confining pressure can be applied and gas is allowed to flow from one end face of the plug sample the experimental observations at the early time were skipped to avoid the effect of fractures their method is a useful improvement over the conventional gri method but only applicable to low pore pressures 0 to 200 psi because their theoretical framework treats working fluid as an ideal gas in addition their method can only provide matrix permeability measurement if the rock sample has fractures while our method can provide both matrix and fracture permeability measurements with different pore pressures and confining pressures fig 5 5 conclusions this work develops a practical method to measure the matrix permeability values from fractured source rock samples by extending a commonly used pressure pulse decay method a source rock sample with fractures can be more accurately described by a dual continuum system consisting of a fracture continuum and a matrix continuum during the pulse decay test the initial flow across the rock sample is dominated by the fracture continuum because it has a much higher permeability than that for the rock matrix thus the initial gas pressure signals from the test is used to estimate the fracture permeability during the late stage of the pulse decay test the flow process within the rock sample is controlled by the rock matrix the observed pressure signals at this stage are then used for estimating matrix permeability the method is based on the analytical solution to gas flow in the fractured rock sample and relatively simple to apply

1511,shale matrix permeability is one of the most important parameters for characterizing a source rock reservoir and for predicting hydrocarbon production the low permeability value and the presence of induced fractures during core retrieval and transportation make the accurate measurement of the true permeability values for source rocks a significant challenge for the industry the steady state flow method and the transient pressure pulse decay method on core plug samples mainly measure the permeability of fractures when fractures are present while the gas research institute gri method that uses pressure decay on crushed rock samples was designed to overcome this difficulty associated with the induced fractures its measurement results are reported to be sensitive to the particle size of crushed rock samples and also need correction of knudsen diffusion effect moreover the gri method is limited to the unconfined stress condition this work develops a practical method to measure the matrix permeability values from fractured source rock samples by extending the commonly used pressure pulse decay method a source rock sample with fractures can be more accurately described by a dual continuum system consisting of a fracture continuum and a matrix continuum during the pulse decay test the initial flow across the source rock sample is dominated by the fracture continuum because it has much higher permeability values than those for the rock matrix thus the initial gas pressure signals from the test are used to estimate the fracture permeability during the late stage of a pulse decay test the flow process within the rock sample is controlled by the rock matrix the observed pressure signals at this stage are used for estimating matrix permeability the method is based on the analytical solution to gas flow in the fractured rock sample and relatively simple to apply in practice both fracture and matrix permeability s dependence on the effective stress can be assessed with this method 1 introduction source rock matrix permeability is one of the most important parameters for characterizing a source rock reservoir and for predicting hydrocarbon production e g clarkson et al 2012 clarkson 2013 the overall production and the late period production of an unconventional reservoir depend to a large degree on the matrix permeability of the rock formation e g heller et al 2014 it is a technical challenge to measure meaningful permeability values of source rocks in a laboratory because the matrix permeability is extremely small and there could be induced fractures due to the retrieval of the samples from the reservoir depth to the surface the transportation of source rock samples from well sites to laboratories and sample handling in laboratories civan 2017 the laminations of the source rocks make the samples highly susceptible to breaking up along the lamination surfaces for a cylindrical plug sample of source rock with induced fractures the fractures dominantly determine the permeability values measured in laboratory by the traditional methods including the steady state flow method american petroleum institute 1998 mallon and swarbrick 2008 and the transient pressure pulse decay pdp method brace et al 1968 hsieh et al 1981 dicker and smits 1988 jones 1997 alnoaimi et al 2014 the measured permeability values largely from the induced fractures do not represent the true matrix permeability values under reservoir conditions and can be misleading to reservoir engineers to minimize the effect caused by the induced fractures luffel et al 1993 proposed to use a pressure decay method on crushed source rock samples for the matrix permeability measurements which is called the gri gas research institute method the gri method is based on the consideration that there is no fracture or microfracture in small rock particles with sizes on the order of 1 mm it has gained popularity in the petroleum industry as it appears to have eliminated the effect of induced fractures and is relatively easy to use restech 1995 later studies however indicate that the gri method generates results that are very sensitive to the particle size of crushed rock samples cui and glover 2014 and to the test condition such as relative volume of the gas and solid tinni et al 2012 the gri method is also limited to the unconfined stress condition cui and glover 2014 and suffers from fluctuations in laboratory procedures and lack of standard sinha et al 2012 since the gri method is generally conducted at relatively low gas pressure conditions the impact of knudsen diffusion is another concern with the method liu and zhang 2020 efforts have been recently made to deal with the problems that the gri method faces realizing that crushing rock would alter the rock properties significantly peng and loucks 2016 proposed to measure the matrix permeability on plug samples with a confining pressure and low pore pressures between 0 and 200 psi though the correction of effects of knudson diffusion and slippage flow is needed due to the low gas pressure used in their procedure gan et al 2018 determined matrix permeability values using numerical simulation of the pressure decay tests on core plugs under low pore pressure based on an assumption that the permeability is uniform and isotropic in all directions nevertheless their methods are still limited to low gas pressure conditions or the use of numerical simulation based analysis approaches the focus of this study is on determining rock matrix permeability from fractured source rock plugs to the best of our knowledge ning 1992 and ning et al 1993 conducted early work with similar objectives they used numerical methods for historical matching of pressure pulse decay tests to determine the fracture and matrix permeability values from fractured plug samples however their procedures are complex and were developed for isotropic rocks while unconventional rocks are highly anisotropic as will be discussed later thus their methods have not been widely used in practice this work determines matrix permeability from pressure pulse decay test data of fractured source rock plugs based on observed gas pressure histories from different flow regimes unlike the previous methods mentioned above this work employs an easily used analytical method the method allows for measuring the permeability of unconventional source rock samples with minimal disturbance to the rock fabrics because it performs the measurements on whole plug samples without crushing both fracture and matrix permeability s dependence on the effective stress can be assessed with this method 2 method as previously indicated we estimate both fracture and matrix permeability values from a fractured

sample 1 is around 1 5 nd whereas the horizontal permeability is between 185 nd and 258 nd bhandari et al 2015 studied two barnet source rock samples with the vertical permeability around 2 nd and horizontal permeability around 96 nd pathi 1997 measured the permeability of six siliceous and calcareous source rock samples from west canadian sedimentary basin and found that the vertical permeability is 3 to 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the horizontal permeability therefore it is appropriate to neglect the gas transfer from fracture surfaces into the matrix if the unconventional source rock samples are highly anisotropic when a source rock sample is isotropic the simulation method by ning 1992 can be applied adsorption of the nitrogen as working fluid in permeability measurement is neglected for the analytical solution of this method when using the mass balance to calculate the porosity the calculated porosity values at high pore pressure should be much higher than that at low pore pressure if adsorption is significant as the adsorbed gas density is much higher than the free gas density at the same gas pressure we measured samples at different pore pressures at 1500 psi 2000 psi 2500 psi and 3500 psi using nitrogen gas while keeping the differential pressure pc pp constant and the changes in porosity values from these measurements are very small e g within 0 1 for a sample with the porosity around 11 suggesting that the contribution of adsorption can be neglected the accuracy of the matrix permeability of this method is demonstrated by the consistence between the measured matrix permeability values for the same rock sample with and without artificial fractures table 1 using this method and the traditional pressure pulse decay method for further ensuring the reliability of our instrument its pressure pulse decay measurement result is also compared with a permeability standard the standard consists of a nominal 8 μm inner diameter with manufacturing error of 1 μm capillary tube embedded in an aluminium cylinder 1 long and 1 in diameter with theoretical permeability values between 120 and 320 nd with an average of 200 nd the permeability range results from the manufacture error for the diameter of the capillary tube our pulse decay measurement for this microtube is 233 nd this is acceptable considering the great difficulty of accurately manufacturing a standard on this scale to have the required permeability for example ghanizadeh et al 2017 presented their work of manufacturing permeability standards of a 25 μm inner diameter microtube embedded in 2 long acrylic cylindrical plugs with 1 5 diameter owing to the manufacturing error these standards have very different permeability values ranging from 8000 nd and 12 000 nd it is even more difficult to make accurate permeability standards with a capillary tube having small diameters it may be useful to compare our method with the related efforts that measure plug scale matrix permeability by improving the current gri methodology for example gan et al 2018 provided a laboratory test procedure and data analysis method to estimate matrix permeability from fractured core samples in their experimental procedure pressure decay through gas flow into both the cylindrical surface and the end surfaces of a core plug is allowed to occur and a numerical model was used to match the pressure decay history for estimating the matrix permeability compared to our method the method of gan et al 2018 has several shortcomings it ignores the permeability anisotropy within a rock sample by assuming the permeability is uniform in all directions and this assumption is not valid as anisotropy is strong for unconventional source rock samples mokhtari et al 2013 similar to the gri method it cannot be applied to the confined stress conditions furthermore it is based on numerical simulations the non uniqueness of parameter estimation based on the numerical simulations is always a concern in practical applications peng and loucks 2016 also presented a method to measure the matrix permeability of plug samples in their method a sample is sleeved thus a confining pressure can be applied and gas is allowed to flow from one end face of the plug sample the experimental observations at the early time were skipped to avoid the effect of fractures their method is a useful improvement over the conventional gri method but only applicable to low pore pressures 0 to 200 psi because their theoretical framework treats working fluid as an ideal gas in addition their method can only provide matrix permeability measurement if the rock sample has fractures while our method can provide both matrix and fracture permeability measurements with different pore pressures and confining pressures fig 5 5 conclusions this work develops a practical method to measure the matrix permeability values from fractured source rock samples by extending a commonly used pressure pulse decay method a source rock sample with fractures can be more accurately described by a dual continuum system consisting of a fracture continuum and a matrix continuum during the pulse decay test the initial flow across the rock sample is dominated by the fracture continuum because it has a much higher permeability than that for the rock matrix thus the initial gas pressure signals from the test is used to estimate the fracture permeability during the late stage of the pulse decay test the flow process within the rock sample is controlled by the rock matrix the observed pressure signals at this stage are then used for estimating matrix permeability the method is based on the analytical solution to gas flow in the fractured rock sample and relatively simple to apply both fracture and matrix permeability s dependence on the effective stress can be assessed with this method author statements jilin jay zhang developed the algorithm designed the experiments and

1512,this article provides an analytical solute transport model to investigate the potential of groundwater contamination by polluted surface water in a two dimensional domain the clogging of streambed which makes the aquifer partially penetrated by the stream is considered in the model the impacts of pumping process hydraulic conductivity and clogging layer on the quality of water produced from nearby drinking water wells are evaluated it is found that results are consistent with numerical simulation conducted by modflow software moreover the model is applied using data of contamination occurrence in malaysia where high contaminants concentrations are found close to streams results show that the pumping activities rate and time period are crucial factors when evaluating the risk of groundwater contamination from surface water additionally this study illustrates that the increase in either hydraulic conductivity or leakance coefficient parameters due to the clogging layer will enlarge the area of contamination the model is able to determine the suitable pumping rate and location of the well so that the contamination plume never reaches the extraction well which is useful in constructing riverbank filtration sites keywords analytical solutions solute transport groundwater surface water relations contamination hydraulic conductivity clogging notations a l a t

coefficient l t 1 introduction in many countries both agriculture and potable water supplies rely heavily or often exclusively on clean river water kallioras et al 2006 schwarzenbach et al 2010 however as a result of development and increasing economic activities the degree of contamination at river water is increased this pollution may cause detrimental effects on human health and on crop productivity and lead to groundwater contamination kan 2009 schwarzenbach et al 2010 additionally the deterioration of river water quality can affect the sustainability of using river water thus limiting the quantity of potable water supply and increasing treatment costs schwarzenbach et al 2010 drilling pumping wells for drinking water at locations adjacent to the streams may provide sustainable and economical solutions for river pollution in fact the lowering of water table due to pumping process can induce the water flow from surface water to groundwater and then to drinking water pumping wells when the water passes from the river to the pumping well contaminant attenuation occurs due to several chemical physical and biological processes dillon et al 2002 maliva and missimer 2012 the pumping process and hydraulic conductivity parameters can significantly affect the quality of extracted water if either the rate or the time of groundwater pumping is increased the level of contamination in the area around the well will raise which can threaten the drinking water quality mustafa et al 2016 on the other hand high values of hydraulic conductivity parameter k which measures the ability of the soil to transmit water lead to rapid velocities of water and subsequently decrease the quality of produced water maliva and missimer 2012 in this study the effect of both pumping process parameters rate and time and k value on the management and risk assessment of drinking water contamination from pollutants in surface water were evaluated this evaluation aims to determine the range of values of these parameters that can be applied when construction a pumping well the most common and reliable methods for determining k are the slug bail and pumping tests butler and james 1997 cheong et al 2008 istok and dawson 1991 the equations and formulas of these methods were tested in the laboratory and the results showed that k value is affected by several transport parameters such as porosity some researchers found that the laboratory measurements for kvalues were underestimated compared to field measurements fallico 2014 vienken and dietrich 2011 generally the parameters measured at laboratory samples cannot be applied at larger aquifer volumes or to the whole aquifer therefore in this model we used the formula developed by fallico 2014 who investigated the relationship between k value and porosity in the field the relationship obtained by his experiments had been tested at a sandy aquifer in south italy the one dimensional 1d two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d contaminant transport in aquifers have been widely described by using mathematical modelling techniques chen 2010 doussan et al 1997 gailey 2017 guo et al 2019 kim 2005 kim et al 2003 lemke and cypher 2010 malaguerra et al 2013 singh et al 2010 singh et al 2012 singh 2013 some of these modelling studies have focused solely on the fate of solute transport without considering the impact of groundwater pumping doussan et al 1997 kim 2005 kim et al 2003 on the other hand some mathematical models produced numerical solutions to manage groundwater quality by controlling pumping rates and or pumping time especially by using modflow software which depends on a finite difference approach ghoraba et al 2013 yang et al 2011 zhou and li 2011 numerical method is an approximation to analytical method it depends heavily on the problem to be solved however analytical solution is more general and can gauge the type of problem it can solve this would save computing time and implementation cost for example riverbank filtration system in malaysia has been first conducted in jenderam hilir located in langat basin selangor malaysia shamsuddin et al 2013 using experimental model this proposed analytical solution would be able to examine methodically in details of the use and reliability of riverbank system within the hydrological properties of malaysian geography the solution depends on one of the valuable analytical approaches which is the green s function this method can facilitate analytical solution of the advection dispersion equation for solute transport in uniform porous media with steady 1d or 2d flow due to its simplicity in solving multi dimensional problems leij and van genuchten 2000 previously this method had been applied to groundwater problems leij and van genuchten 2000 leij et al 1993 mustafa et al 2016 park and zhan 2001 woodside 1988 however some of these studies have focused on contaminant transport without considering any degradation or adsorption woodside 1988 meanwhile other studies have investigated contaminant movement under the natural gradient of a hydraulic head without any pumping well leij and van genuchten 2000 park and zhan 2001 also some researchers implemented green s function method to simulate radial pollutant transport towards a single fully penetrating pumping well adams and viramontes 1993 in our previous study the development of an analytical model based on green s function approach was described to simulate the effect of the pumping process on 1d contaminant transport mustafa et al 2016 it was assumed that the solute is transported in 1d domain and the aquifers are fully penetrated by a stream practically in most stream aquifer interactions the streambed is clogged which makes the aquifer only partially penetrated by the stream additionally the previous model did not consider the effect of hydraulic conductivity and its relation with porosity in the current study a 2d analytical transport model based on green s function approach is developed by assuming a partial connection between the river and aquifer due to the existence of a clogging layer here the model incorporated the influence of both the pumping rate period of pumping time and hydraulic conductivity parameters on the quality of the water produced by the extraction wells in particular the formula obtained by fallico 2014 was used to relate the hydraulic conductivity with the porosity value the governing equations were solved by using green s function approach and mathematica 8 software was used to calculate the numerical integration in the analytical solution and obtain the final solutions of concentration to validate the proposed model it was proved that at y 0 and when the aquifer was assumed fully penetrated by the stream the same solution developed by mustafa et al 2016 was obtained moreover the analytical results were compared with numerical results for the contaminant concentration at the pumping well obtained by modflow software which depends on finite difference method furthermore the model was applied to the pilot riverbank project conducted in malaysia 2 methodology 2 1 mathematical formulation the proposed model was developed to simulate the contaminant transport towards a pumping well located at a distance l l far from the river fig 1 the flow can be considered uniform along the x direction based on the following two assumptions that we are considered 1 the left and right boundaries of the domain has a fixed hydraulic head values and 2 there is no flow boundary conditions are set on the north and south boundaries of the domain libera et al 2017 assume that the pumping rate q l3 t of the well is constant and the aquifer is homogeneous isotropic and has a finite depth d l then the 2d advection dispersion equation for solute transport in uniform flow can be written as follows batu 2005 libera et al 2017 potsane and moitsheki 2014 wang and zhan 2015 1 r c t d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 u x c x νrc which gives the following equation 2 r c t d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 u x c x νrc 0 where c x y t refers to the concentration of contaminants m l3 d x d y refers to the components of longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficient along the xand y axis respectively l2 t u x is the seepage velocity l t v is the decay constant 1 t r is the linear retardation factor d x a l u x d y a t u x batu 2005 are the dispersion coefficient along the x and y axis respectively while a l and a t l are the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity along the x and y axis respectively if the equation β νr is inserted then the equation becomes 3 r c t d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 u x c x βc 0 where β is the degradation rate of the contaminants 1 t the functions c in x y t and c ads x y t were used to represent the concentration of contaminant penetration inside the aquifer and the concentration attenuated by bacteria by using a balanced equation we have 4 c in c ads c w wherec w t is the value of the contaminant concentration at the water produced from the pumping well m l3 t it is not necessary for c w t to be zero if c w t equals zero immediately then the water can be made available as drinking water for the public however if c w t does not equal zero which is more likely then additional treatment can be carried out prior to distribution this step depends on the degree of filtering and the concentration of contaminants in the pumped water so eq 3 is modified as follows 5 r c t d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 u x c x βc c

the dimensionless dirac delta function m is the length of the river that is under the effect of pumping well s 0 m l3 t is the initial mass of contaminants dissolved in one unit volume of water within one unit of time and f t y is a function of t and y which means that the river is not a uniform source of contaminant assume that the concentration of the contaminants released from the river are attenuated by adsorption with linear isotherm hence the function c w t from eq 4 can be calculated as follows dillon et al 2002 10 c w t q q s o exp βt r where q is the stream depletion flow rate l3 t that described the total flow from the incompressible streambed butler et al 2001 hunt et al 2001 andq q is the proportion of infiltrated river water in the pumping well by using the following

the following subsection 2 1 1 mathematical solution using green s functions in this problem green s function represents the values of contaminant concentration at position x y t located between the river and the pumping well assuming that the river located at they line the solution of eq 11 can be obtained by solving the following integration 16 c d x d y d t d 0 t d c w d τ d δ x d l d δ y d g x d y d τ d x 0 d y 0 d d τ d where gis the green s function that can be obtained by solving the following equation 17 2 g x d 2 2 g y d 2 g t d δ x d l d δ y d δ t d according to carslaw and jaeger 1986 park and zhan 2001 the 1d green s function is given by 18 g x d t d 1 2 π t d exp x d 2 4 t d since the part of the river that is affected by the pumping well is only extends from m to m then the green s function a long y axis will be integrated over this range to have the following form 19 s y d t d m d m d g y d ζ d t d m d m d 1 2 π t d exp y d ζ d 2 4 t d d ζ d 1 2 erfc y d m d 2 t d erfc

hence eq 22 will be converted to 23 c x t 1 2 π r q qs 0 d u x exp βt r 0 t 1 τ exp r x u x r τ 2 4 d x τ dτ which leads to 24 c x t 1 2 π r q q s 0 d u x exp β t r 2 u x t d exp r x u x t r 2 4 d x t πr a l d x u x t r erfc r x u x t r 2 d x t the existence of clogging layer under the streambed creates a partial connection between the river and the aquifer consequently the percentage of infiltrated river water inside the well will decrease to describe the effect of riverbed clogging in the model formulation the value of q q will be computed as follows hunt 1999 25 q q erfc s x l 2 4 tt p exp λ 2 t p 4 s x t λl 2 t erfc λ 2 t p 4 s x t s x l 4 tt p where t p is the pumping time t s x is the aquifer storage coefficient t is the aquifer transmissivity l2 t and λis the stream bed leakance coefficient l t 2 1 2 modelling the hydraulic conductivity effect groundwater pumping rate has a significant impact on water velocity and the time taken for the contaminants to reach the well in this model the influence of pumping rate is taken into account through the seeping velocity value according to the following equation dillon et al 2002 26 u x 3 q ϕ 2 πdl whereϕis the porosity by using the following equation from theis 1935 the transmissivity t for the wells is calculated as follows 27 t q 4 πδs where s is the drawdown change l and q is the pumping rate based on the calculated value for t the value of hydraulic conductivity k l t of the aquifer is then estimated according to 28 k t d where d is the aquifer thickness l by substituting eq 28 into eq 27 and rearranging the equation the following is obtained 29 q 4 dkπδs by substituting eq 29 into eq 26 the following equation is obtained 30 u x 6 kδs ϕl since the dispersion is calculated using d x au x batu 2005 the usage of eq 30 produces the following 31 d x 6 a l kδs ϕl d y 6 a t kδs ϕl to calculate travelling time t the following equation derived from eq 26 was used 32 t l u x ϕ l 2 6 kδs to show the effect of the k value on contaminant transport eqs 30 31 and 32 were substituted into the contaminant concentration for eq 22 2 2 numerical model a numerical simulation based on finite difference approach was conducted by using modflow version 5 3 software to check if the proposed analytical model can correctly simulate solutes transport from the river towards pumping well modflow is combined with modular transport three dimensional model simulator mt3d the mt3d can simulate the changes in contaminant concentration considering advection dispersion and some chemical reactions bergvall et al 2011 morway et al 2013 in our model mt3d package is used to simulate the contaminant concentration the model grid area is 500 m by 500 m along x and y directions a regular grid spacing of 10 m is used for each column and row to apply the infinite aquifer requirements in the model the model domain is chosen large enough to prevent the effect of pumping well to reach the boundaries to do this the boundary can be moved more further from the pumping well or the general head boundary in modflow can be used chiang and kinzelbach 2001 the length and thickness of streambed within a cell is assumed to be 10 m and 1 m respectively the hydraulic conductivity of stream bed is 0 5 m d all other input parameters applied in the modflow numerical simulation are summarized in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparing with modflow simulation fig 2 shows the concentration profiles for both simulations over 30 days of pumping initially it was assumed that the water inside the well is free of contamination in which both analytical and numerical solutions showed similar profiles a rapid growth of concentration was noticed during the first 10 days while the pumping time period increased reaching up to 4 mg l after that the increase in the solutes concentration was minor which indicates that the increase of the amount of river water travelled to the well became less after 10 days based on eq 25 at the beginning of pumping the q q value grows rapidly after a certain period of pumping the value ofq q will increase slowly until the ratio goes to 1 after a long time pumping hunt 1999 3 2 model implementation in order to investigate the effect of pumping rate and time hydraulic conductivity and clogging parameters on solute transport from river to nearby wells the model was applied to the data from langat river area malaysia shamsuddin et al 2013 a highly permeable homogeneous aquifer with 20 m thick was pumped by two vertical pumping wells dw1 and dw2 situated at 40 m band 18 m from the stream respectively in fact the two wells are located in two different areas near the river and thus are not affected by each other thus the contour lines for the spread of contaminants were drawn for dw1 and dw2 wells separately during the simulation the aquifer was assumed to be initially free from pollutants and d y d x 0 1 the same values of parameters listed in table 1 were used during the analytical model simulation the pumping time for dw1 was 9 7 days whereas for dw2 it was only 4 6 days the results obtained from both wells are shown in fig 3 for dw1 the simulation results showed that the contaminants do not reach the well after 9 7 days of pumping moreover the concentration drops until it reaches 0 027 mg l at a distance of 25 m from the river on the other hand the contaminants reaches dw2 despite the shorter pumping time of 4 6 days this was because dw2 is closer to the river compared to dw1 actually the drawdown of water in dw2 well was lesser than dw1 shamsuddin et al 2013 this means that the water produced from dw2 has more amount of river water than dw1 but with lower quality thus the model suggests using dw1 for drinking water supplies if there is no other source of contamination coming to the well otherwise dw2 have to be used according to shamsuddin et al 2013 dw2 is more efficient and can produce more quality water which indicates that the closeness of dw1 well location from the main airport of kuala lumpur increases the level of contamination inside the well along the y axis as noticeable in fig 3 the spread of contaminants did not exceed 30 m in spite of that the capture zone for both wells determined by shamsuddin et al 2014 did exceed this value this indicates that the contaminants are eliminated in the area that is smaller than the area being influenced by the pumping process 3 2 1 investigate the effect of clogging layer aside from affecting the concentration of the contaminants in the well the clogging layer also affects the amount of river water in the pumping well q q if the clogging layer becomes thicker then λl t values will be less and hence the percentage of infiltrated river water will become smaller in table 2 the amount of river water in the dw1 and dw2 wells were calculated by using eq 25 with the values of λl t 0 01 0 03 0 1 and 0 3 these values were chosen based on the values produced by hunt 1999 according to table 2 an increase in the thickness of clogging layer in the streambed i e the value of λl t is decreasing decreases the amount of river water moving towards the pumping well for dw1 the value of q q decreased from 66 to 5 2 when the λl t value dropped from 0 3 to 0 01 whereas in dw2 the q q decreased from 57 to 3 6 when the λl t value decreased from 0 3 to 0 01 which means that the existence of the clogging layer prevents some of the water from reaching the pumping well shamsuddin et al 2014 used chen 2001 approach that is based on the geometry of the affected area by the pumping well to calculate q q values for dw1 and dw2 wells they estimated that 33 of produced water from dw1 well was from the river after 9 6 days of pumping while the river water estimation in dw2 well was 28 after 4 6 days of pumping but there is no indication of results if the riverbed is clogged or not and how much is the clogging by using the proposed findings of hunt 1999 analytical model and by comparing their results with the results listed in table 2 it can be concluded that there is a clogging layer in langat river basin and the amount of leakage from the river is approximately 0 1 bakker 2010 calculated the leakage factor by using a formula based on the thickness of aquifer and hydraulic conductivity although a similar finding that states the inverse relation between the resistance of river bed and q q value is obtained his formula ignored the effect of pumping time which may produce inaccurate results based on the hunt s pumping time that has a significant effect on q q value where the long time of pumping makes the q q value goes to 1 thus this means that the aquifer will be fully penetrated by the stream moreover both shamsuddin et al 2014 and bakker 2010 did not show the effect of clogging on contaminant removal fig 4 shows the contour lines of contaminant concentration with λl t 0 01 0 03 0 1 and 0 3 it is noticeable that the decrease in λl t value due to clogging layers leads to reduce the concentration of contaminants around the pumping well therefore it can be concluded that clogging decreases the concentration of contaminants in the pumping well area producing water with better quality this is a logical result because the existence of the clogging layer gives bacteria enough time to adsorb contaminants such as nitrates consequently decreasing the contaminant concentration bouwer and rice 1989 3 2 2 investigate the effect of pumping process rate and time to highlight the effect of pumping time and pumping rate parameters on the concentrations of contaminants the leakance coefficient λl t 0 1 was used for both wells fig 5 represents the contamination in the region d x y 0 x 40 100 y 100 at different pumping time levels 100 400 800 and 1095 days the simulation was performed for dw1 with a pumping rate of 292 m3 day generally as pumping time increased contamination spread throughout a wider area for example after 100 days of pumping the contaminant concentration was around 0 0024 mg l at a distance of approximately 30 m from the river however the concentration reached more than 0 044 mg l at the same distance after 400 days after 800 and 1095 days the concentrations raised up to 0 1 and 0 13 mg l respectively this increase was probably due to the continuous flow of contaminants leaking from the river carried by the underground water towards the pumping well the effect of pumping rates on contaminant concentration is also investigated in the region d x y 0 x 40 100 y 100 fig 6 the simulation was performed for dw1 with a pumping time of 1095days and four pumping rates 292 584 1168 and 2336 m3 day when the pumping rate was doubled from 292 to 584 m3 day the contaminant concentration near the well improved from 0 065 to 0 1 mg l when pumping rates of 1168 and 2336 m3 day were used the contaminant concentrations around the well reached 0 13 and 0 28 mg l respectively these findings reveal that increasing pumping time as well as rate is not encouraged for wells that are close to contaminated rivers as this leads to higher contamination of wells shamsuddin et al 2014 proved that increasing pumping is beneficial in terms of expanding the capture zone and enlarging the amount of infiltrated river water inside the well however in spite of these benefits the high pumping rate is still undesirable in growing the contamination of pumped water due to the reducing of travel time of pollutants additionally their results indicated that enlarging the distance between well and river edge might reduce the travel time of river water they mentioned that this will not change the capture zone and subsequently suggested to double the pumping rate this is true if the concern only on the amount of river water inside the well nonetheless if the quality of water is taken into consideration then the distance from the pumping well to the river is a critical value and must be taken into account as shown in fig 3 baalousha 2016 found that water drawdown in aquifer due to taking the water directly from the river is lesser than drowdown resulting from extracting water from pumping well however pumping water from wells located near polluted streams is an economical approach to provide water with better quality as proved in fig 5 in general the proposed analytical model is suitable to manage the process of water extraction from pumping wells near the stream for example if it is expected to pump potable water from the well for 20 years at a maximum rate of 4800 m3 day then the model can predict the resulted levels of contamination accordingly appropriate decisions of pumping time periods and rates can be taken 3 2 3 investigate the effect of hydraulic conductivity parameter the effect of hydraulic conductivity k on water quality produced from dw1 well near the langat river shore was also investigated for 2d flow firstly a k value of 8 64 m d was used where it is the minimum values of hydraulic conductivity required for riverbank filtration site grischek et al 2002 maliva and missimer 2012 the value was then doubled twice to 17 28 m d and 34 56 m d the influence of hydraulic conductivity on the contaminant concentration was investigated over the area d x y 0 x l 30 y 30 as shown in fig 7 the simulation was performed for 3 days the drawdown s is 4 2 m shamsuddin et al 2013 it is noticed that the increase in k value led to a slight increase in the contamination area the concentration values measured near the rivers after 3 pumping days were 0 84 mg l 0 91 mg l and 1 05 mg l at k 8 64 m d 17 28 m d and 34 56 m d respectively at a distance of 30 m from the river edge the concentrations increased from less than 0 12 mg l to approximately 0 15 mg l when the k value increased from 8 64 m d to 34 56 m d this trend was noticeable along the y axis when equations with the same kvalue showed that the contamination decreased as the range of y values increased for example after 20 m along the y axis the concentration did not exceed 0 15 mg l and 0 55 mg l for all kvalues the model assumes that the aquifer is homogenous and isotropic which means that the hydraulic conductivity is the same everywhere and independent of the flow direction although the aquifer of riverbank filtration sites in reality is not homogenous and isotropic these assumptions are necessary for analyzing both analytical and numerical models this model can be used for designing a pumping well located near polluted stream including its pumping rate and location in particular it can determine the maximum value of pumping rate as well as the shortest distance between pumping well and river so that the contamination plume never reaches the extraction well as shown in the following example example illustrates the way of finding the location and pumping rate of the well based on nitrate concentration in this example the aquifer is assumed unconfined the pumping rate and well location will be determined based on the concentration for nitrate compound no3 however this model can be applied similarly for any other contaminant if the limit of its concentration in raw water is known the maximum allowable limit for no3 concentration is 10 mg l shamsuddin et al 2013 consider s x 0 7 β 2 5e 8 1 s t 2800m3 d λ 1 8m d r 1 d 20m assume that the pumping well is located at 150 m from the edge and the initial concentration equals 50 mg l thus the pumping rate will be determined after 700 days of pumping as illustrated in fig 8 the ranges of pumping rates that are plotted varies from 150 m3 h 3600 m3 d to 350m3 h 8400 m3 d it is found that the pumping rate should be less than 300 m3 h 7200 m3 d otherwise the no3 concentrations will exceed its limit 10 mg l in the extracted water which make it insufficient to be used directly for drinking if the pumping well is managed to be used for many years it would be more safe to maintain a pumping rate less than 250 m3 h 6000 m3 d based on fig 8 after 200 days the increasing rate of contaminants becomes very small but still exists and should be considered for long periods if the pumping well is not drilled yet and the pumping rate is proposed to be higher than 300 m3 h the well can be drilled farther from the river edge fig 9 shows the concentration of contaminant at different lvalues started from 50 to 250 m from river edge using a pumping rate of 300 m3 h 7200 m3 d these results indicate that that the well cannot be drilled before 150 m from the stream 4 conclusion an analytical model based on green s function has been developed to model the potential influence of a pumping well on 2d contaminant transport from surface water to adjacent wells in the case of clogged streambeds the results confirmed the suitability of the model in the simulation of contaminant spread in a 2d domain additionally the model is found to be useful in managing the pumping process from the well the model showed that the existence of a clogging layer lowers both the contaminant concentration and the amount of the river water inside the well additionally it is found that the long pumping periods cause considerable increase in contamination around the well the results obtained from contour plots for different pumping rates indicate that the degree of contamination is proportional to the pumping rate as the pumping time increases the contamination will continue to spread over a larger area moreover by increasing the hydraulic conductivity values the contamination around the well area will escalate this model is helpful in determining the suitable pumping rate and location of the well near the stream which is benefit in designing the riverbank filtration sites the current model can be further developed to manage groundwater extraction from a pumping well especially in urban areas where the contamination is very high acknowledgements the authors would like

1512,this article provides an analytical solute transport model to investigate the potential of groundwater contamination by polluted surface water in a two dimensional domain the clogging of streambed which makes the aquifer partially penetrated by the stream is considered in the model the impacts of pumping process hydraulic conductivity and clogging layer on the quality of water produced from nearby drinking water wells are evaluated it is found that results are consistent with numerical simulation conducted by modflow software moreover the model is applied using data of contamination occurrence in malaysia where high contaminants concentrations are found close to streams results show that the pumping activities rate and time period are crucial factors when evaluating the risk of groundwater contamination from surface water additionally this study illustrates that the increase in either hydraulic conductivity or leakance coefficient parameters due to the clogging layer will enlarge the area of contamination the model is able to determine the suitable pumping rate and location of the well so that the contamination plume never reaches the extraction well which

coefficient l t 1 introduction in many countries both agriculture and potable water supplies rely heavily or often exclusively on clean river water kallioras et al 2006 schwarzenbach et al 2010 however as a result of development and increasing economic activities the degree of contamination at river water is increased this pollution may cause detrimental effects on human health and on crop productivity and lead to groundwater contamination kan 2009 schwarzenbach et al 2010 additionally the deterioration of river water quality can affect the sustainability of using river water thus limiting the quantity of potable water supply and increasing treatment costs schwarzenbach et al 2010 drilling pumping wells for drinking water at locations adjacent to the streams may provide sustainable and economical solutions for river pollution in fact the lowering of water table due to pumping process can induce the water flow from surface water to groundwater and then to drinking water pumping wells when the water passes from the river to the pumping well contaminant attenuation occurs due to several chemical physical and biological processes dillon et al 2002 maliva and missimer 2012 the pumping process and hydraulic conductivity parameters can significantly affect the quality of extracted water if either the rate or the time of groundwater pumping is increased the level of contamination in the area around the well will raise which can threaten the drinking water quality mustafa et al 2016 on the other hand high values of hydraulic conductivity parameter k which measures the ability of the soil to transmit water lead to rapid velocities of water and subsequently decrease the quality of produced water maliva and missimer 2012 in this study the effect of both pumping process parameters rate and time and k value on the management and risk assessment of drinking water contamination from pollutants in surface water were evaluated this evaluation aims to determine the range of values of these parameters that can be applied when construction a pumping well the most common and reliable methods for determining k are the slug bail and pumping tests butler and james 1997 cheong et al 2008 istok and dawson 1991 the equations and formulas of these methods were tested in the laboratory and the results showed that k value is affected by several transport parameters such as porosity some researchers found that the laboratory measurements for kvalues were underestimated compared to field measurements fallico 2014 vienken and dietrich 2011 generally the parameters measured at laboratory samples cannot be applied at larger aquifer volumes or to the whole aquifer therefore in this model we used the formula developed by fallico 2014 who investigated the relationship between k value and porosity in the field the relationship obtained by his experiments had been tested at a sandy aquifer in south italy the one dimensional 1d two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d contaminant transport in aquifers have been widely described by using mathematical modelling techniques chen 2010 doussan et al 1997 gailey 2017 guo et al 2019 kim 2005 kim et al 2003 lemke and cypher 2010 malaguerra et al 2013 singh et al 2010 singh et al 2012 singh 2013 some of these modelling studies have focused solely on the fate of solute transport without considering the impact of groundwater pumping doussan et al 1997 kim 2005 kim et al 2003 on the other hand some mathematical models produced numerical solutions to manage groundwater quality by controlling pumping rates and or pumping time especially by using modflow software which depends on a finite difference approach ghoraba et al 2013 yang et al 2011 zhou and li 2011 numerical method is an approximation to analytical method it depends heavily on the problem to be solved however analytical solution is more general and can gauge the type of problem it can solve this would save computing time and implementation cost for example riverbank filtration system in malaysia has been first conducted in jenderam hilir located in langat basin selangor malaysia shamsuddin et al 2013 using experimental model this proposed analytical solution would be able to examine methodically in details of the use and reliability of riverbank system within the hydrological properties of malaysian geography the solution depends on one of the valuable analytical approaches which is the green s function this method can facilitate analytical solution of the advection dispersion equation for solute transport in uniform porous media with steady 1d or 2d flow due to its simplicity in solving multi dimensional problems leij and van genuchten 2000 previously this method had been applied to groundwater problems leij and van genuchten 2000 leij et al 1993 mustafa et al 2016 park and zhan 2001 woodside 1988 however some of these studies have focused on contaminant transport without considering any degradation or adsorption woodside 1988 meanwhile other studies have investigated contaminant movement under the natural gradient of a hydraulic head without any pumping well leij and van genuchten 2000 park and zhan 2001 also some researchers implemented green s function method to simulate radial pollutant transport towards a single fully penetrating pumping well adams and viramontes 1993 in our previous study the development of an analytical model based on green s function approach was described to simulate the effect of the pumping process on 1d contaminant transport mustafa et al 2016 it was assumed that the solute is transported in 1d domain and the aquifers are fully penetrated by a stream practically in most stream aquifer interactions the streambed is clogged which makes the aquifer only partially penetrated by the stream additionally the previous model did not consider the effect of hydraulic conductivity and its relation with porosity in the current study a 2d analytical transport model based on green s function approach is developed by assuming a partial connection between the river and aquifer due to the existence of a clogging layer here the model incorporated the influence of both the pumping rate period of pumping time and hydraulic conductivity parameters on the quality of the water produced by the extraction wells in particular the formula obtained by fallico 2014 was used to relate the hydraulic conductivity with the porosity value the governing equations were solved by using green s function approach and mathematica 8 software was used to calculate the numerical integration in the analytical solution and obtain the final solutions of concentration to validate the proposed model it was proved that at y 0 and when the aquifer was assumed fully penetrated by the stream the same solution developed by mustafa et al 2016 was obtained moreover the analytical results were compared with numerical results for the contaminant concentration at the pumping well obtained by modflow software which depends on finite difference method furthermore the model was applied to the pilot riverbank project conducted in malaysia 2 methodology 2 1 mathematical formulation the proposed model was developed to simulate the contaminant transport towards a pumping well located at a distance l l far from the river fig 1 the flow can be considered uniform along the x direction based on the following two assumptions that we are considered 1 the left and right boundaries of the domain has a fixed hydraulic head values and 2 there is no flow boundary conditions are set on the north and south boundaries of the domain libera et al 2017 assume that the pumping rate q l3 t of the well is constant and the aquifer is homogeneous isotropic and has a finite depth d l then the 2d advection dispersion equation for solute transport in uniform flow can be written as follows batu 2005 libera et al 2017 potsane and moitsheki 2014 wang and zhan 2015 1 r c t d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 u x c x νrc which gives the following equation 2 r c t d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 u x c x νrc 0 where c x y t refers to the concentration of contaminants m l3 d x d y refers to the components of longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficient along the xand y axis respectively l2 t u x is the seepage velocity l t v is the decay constant 1 t r is the linear retardation factor d x a l u x d y a t u x batu 2005 are the dispersion coefficient along the x and y axis respectively while a l and a t l are the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity along the x and y axis respectively if the equation β νr is inserted then the equation becomes 3 r c t d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 u x c x βc 0 where β is the degradation rate of the contaminants 1 t the functions c in x y t and c ads x y t were used to represent the concentration of contaminant penetration inside the aquifer and the concentration attenuated by bacteria by using a balanced equation we have 4 c in c ads c w wherec w t is the value of the contaminant concentration at the water produced from the pumping well m l3 t it is not necessary for c w t to be zero if c w t equals zero immediately then the water can be made available as drinking water for the public however if c w t does not equal zero which is more likely then additional treatment can be carried out prior to distribution this step depends on the degree of filtering and the concentration of contaminants in the pumped water so eq 3 is modified as follows 5 r c t d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 u x c x βc c

the dimensionless dirac delta function m is the length of the river that is under the effect of pumping well s 0 m l3 t is the initial mass of contaminants dissolved in one unit volume of water within one unit of time and f t y is a function of t and y which means that the river is not a uniform source of contaminant assume that the concentration of the contaminants released from the river are attenuated by adsorption with linear isotherm hence the function c w t from eq 4 can be calculated as follows dillon et al 2002 10 c w t q q s o exp βt r where q is the stream depletion flow rate l3 t

the following subsection 2 1 1 mathematical solution using green s functions in this problem green s function represents the values of contaminant concentration at position x y t located between the river and the pumping well assuming that the river located at they line the solution of eq 11 can be obtained by solving the following integration 16 c d x d y d t d 0 t d c w d τ d δ x d l d δ y d g

1986 park and zhan 2001 the 1d green s function is given by 18 g x d t d 1 2 π t d exp x d 2 4 t d since the part of the river that is affected by the pumping well is only extends from m to m then the

πr a l d x u x t r erfc r x u x t r 2 d x t the existence of clogging layer under the streambed creates a partial connection between the river and the aquifer consequently the percentage of infiltrated river water inside the well will decrease to describe the effect of riverbed clogging in the model formulation the value of q q will be computed as follows hunt 1999 25 q q erfc s x l 2 4 tt p exp λ 2 t p 4 s x t λl 2 t erfc λ 2 t p 4 s x t s x l 4 tt p where t p is the pumping time t s x is the aquifer storage coefficient t is the aquifer transmissivity l2 t and λis the stream bed leakance coefficient l t 2 1 2 modelling the hydraulic conductivity effect groundwater pumping rate has a significant impact on water velocity and the time taken for the contaminants to reach the well in this model the influence of pumping rate is taken into account through the seeping velocity value according to the following equation dillon et al 2002 26 u x 3 q ϕ 2 πdl whereϕis the porosity by using the following equation from theis 1935 the transmissivity t for the wells is calculated as follows 27 t q 4 πδs where s is the drawdown change l and q is the pumping rate based on the calculated value for t the value of hydraulic conductivity k l t of the aquifer is then estimated according to 28 k t d where d is the aquifer thickness l by substituting eq 28 into eq 27 and rearranging the equation the following is obtained 29 q 4 dkπδs by substituting eq 29 into eq 26 the following equation is obtained 30 u x 6 kδs ϕl since the dispersion is calculated using d x au x batu 2005 the usage of eq 30 produces the following 31 d x 6 a l kδs ϕl d y 6 a t kδs ϕl to calculate travelling time t the following equation derived from eq 26 was used 32 t l u x ϕ l 2 6 kδs to show the effect of the k value on contaminant transport eqs 30 31 and 32 were substituted into the contaminant concentration for eq 22 2 2 numerical model a numerical simulation based on finite difference approach was conducted by using modflow version 5 3 software to check if the proposed analytical model can correctly simulate solutes transport from the river towards pumping well modflow is combined with modular transport three dimensional model simulator mt3d the mt3d can simulate the changes in contaminant concentration considering advection dispersion and some chemical reactions bergvall et al 2011 morway et al 2013 in our model mt3d package is used to simulate the contaminant concentration the model grid area is 500 m by 500 m along x and y directions a regular grid spacing of 10 m is used for each column and row to apply the infinite aquifer requirements in the model the model domain is chosen large enough to prevent the effect of pumping well to reach the boundaries to do this the boundary can be moved more further from the pumping well or the general head boundary in modflow can be used chiang and kinzelbach 2001 the length and thickness of streambed within a cell is assumed to be 10 m and 1 m respectively the hydraulic conductivity of stream bed is 0 5 m d all other input parameters applied in the modflow numerical simulation are summarized in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparing with modflow simulation fig 2 shows the concentration profiles for both simulations over 30 days of pumping initially it was assumed that the water inside the well is free of contamination in which both analytical and numerical solutions showed similar profiles a rapid growth of concentration was noticed during the first 10 days while the pumping time period increased reaching up to 4 mg l after that the increase in the solutes concentration was minor which indicates that the increase of the amount of river water travelled to the well became less after 10 days based on eq 25 at the beginning of pumping the q q value grows rapidly after a certain period of pumping the value ofq q will increase slowly until the ratio goes to 1 after a long time pumping hunt 1999 3 2 model implementation in order to investigate the effect of pumping rate and time hydraulic conductivity and clogging parameters on solute transport from river to nearby wells the model was applied to the data from langat river area malaysia shamsuddin et al 2013 a highly permeable homogeneous aquifer with 20 m thick was pumped by two vertical pumping wells dw1 and dw2 situated at 40 m band 18 m from the stream respectively in fact the two wells are located in two different areas near the river and thus are not affected by each other thus the contour lines for the spread of contaminants were drawn for dw1 and dw2 wells separately during the simulation the aquifer was assumed to be initially free from pollutants and d y d x 0 1 the same values of parameters listed in table 1 were used during the analytical model simulation the pumping time for dw1 was 9 7 days whereas for dw2 it was only 4 6 days the results obtained from both wells are shown in fig 3 for dw1 the simulation results showed that the contaminants do not reach the well after 9 7 days of pumping moreover the concentration drops until it reaches 0 027 mg l at a distance of 25 m from the river on the other hand the contaminants reaches dw2 despite the shorter pumping time of 4 6 days this was because dw2 is closer to the river compared to dw1 actually the drawdown of water in dw2 well was lesser than dw1 shamsuddin et al 2013 this means that the water produced from dw2 has more amount of river water than dw1 but with lower quality thus the model suggests using dw1 for drinking water supplies if there is no other source of contamination coming to the well otherwise dw2 have to be used according to shamsuddin et al 2013 dw2 is more efficient and can produce more quality water which indicates that the closeness of dw1 well location from the main airport of kuala lumpur increases the level of contamination inside the well along the y axis as noticeable in fig 3 the spread of contaminants did not exceed 30 m in spite of that the capture zone for both wells determined by shamsuddin et al 2014 did exceed this value this indicates that the contaminants are eliminated in the area that is smaller than the area being influenced by the pumping process 3 2 1 investigate the effect of clogging layer aside from affecting the concentration of the contaminants in the well the clogging layer also affects the amount of river water in the pumping well q q if the clogging layer becomes thicker then λl t values will be less and hence the percentage of infiltrated river water will become smaller in table 2 the amount of river water in the dw1 and dw2 wells were calculated by using eq 25 with the values of λl t 0 01 0 03 0 1 and 0 3 these values were chosen based on the values produced by hunt 1999 according to table 2 an increase in the thickness of clogging layer in the streambed i e the value of λl t is decreasing decreases the amount of river water moving towards the pumping well for dw1 the value of q q decreased from 66 to 5 2 when the λl t value dropped from 0 3 to 0 01 whereas in dw2 the q q decreased from 57 to 3 6 when the λl t value decreased from 0 3 to 0 01 which means that the existence of the clogging layer prevents some of the water from reaching the pumping well shamsuddin et al 2014 used chen 2001 approach that is based on the geometry of the affected area by the pumping well to calculate q q values for dw1 and dw2 wells they estimated that 33 of produced water from dw1 well was from the river after 9 6 days of pumping while the river water estimation in dw2 well was 28 after 4 6 days of pumping but there is no indication of results if the riverbed is clogged or not and how much is the clogging by using the proposed findings of hunt 1999 analytical model and by comparing their results with the results listed in table 2 it can be concluded that there is a clogging layer in langat river basin and the amount of leakage from the river is approximately 0 1 bakker 2010 calculated the leakage factor by using a formula based on the thickness of aquifer and hydraulic conductivity although a similar finding that states the inverse relation between the resistance of river bed and q q value is obtained his formula ignored the effect of pumping time which may produce inaccurate results based on the hunt s pumping time that has a significant effect on q q value where the long time of pumping makes the q q value goes to 1 thus this means that the aquifer will be fully penetrated by the stream moreover both shamsuddin et al 2014 and bakker 2010 did not show the effect of clogging on contaminant removal fig 4 shows the contour lines of contaminant concentration with λl t 0 01 0 03 0 1 and 0 3 it is noticeable that the decrease in λl t value due to clogging layers leads to reduce the concentration of contaminants around the pumping well therefore it can be concluded that clogging decreases the concentration of contaminants in the pumping well area producing water with better quality this is a logical result because the existence of the clogging layer gives bacteria enough time to adsorb contaminants such as nitrates consequently decreasing the contaminant concentration bouwer and rice 1989 3 2 2 investigate the effect of pumping process rate and time to highlight the effect of pumping time and pumping rate parameters on the concentrations of contaminants the leakance coefficient λl t 0 1 was used for both wells fig 5 represents the contamination in the region d x y 0 x 40 100 y 100 at different pumping time levels 100 400 800 and 1095 days the simulation was performed for dw1 with a pumping rate of 292 m3 day generally as pumping time increased contamination spread throughout a wider area for example after 100 days of pumping the contaminant concentration was around 0 0024 mg l at a distance of approximately 30 m from the river however the concentration reached more than 0 044 mg l at the same distance after 400 days after 800 and 1095 days the concentrations raised up to 0 1 and 0 13 mg l respectively this increase was probably due to the continuous flow of contaminants leaking from the river carried by the underground water towards the pumping well the effect of pumping rates on contaminant concentration is also investigated in the region d x y 0 x 40 100 y 100 fig 6 the simulation was performed for dw1 with a pumping time of 1095days and four pumping rates 292 584 1168 and 2336 m3 day when the pumping rate was doubled from 292 to 584 m3 day the contaminant concentration near the well improved from 0 065 to 0 1 mg l when pumping rates of 1168 and 2336 m3 day were used the contaminant concentrations around the well reached 0 13 and 0 28 mg l respectively these findings reveal that increasing pumping time as well as rate is not encouraged for wells that are close to contaminated rivers as this leads to higher contamination of wells shamsuddin et al 2014 proved that increasing pumping is beneficial in terms of expanding the capture zone and enlarging the amount of infiltrated river water inside the well however in spite of these benefits the high pumping rate is still undesirable in growing the contamination of pumped water due to the reducing of travel time of pollutants additionally their results indicated that enlarging the distance between well and river edge might reduce the travel time of river water they mentioned that this will not change the capture zone and subsequently suggested to double the pumping rate this is true if the concern only on the amount of river water inside the well nonetheless if the quality of water is taken into consideration then the distance from the pumping well to the river is a critical value and must be taken into account as shown in fig 3 baalousha 2016 found that water drawdown in aquifer due to taking the water directly from the river is lesser than drowdown resulting from extracting water from pumping well however pumping water from wells located near polluted streams is an economical approach to provide water with better quality as proved in fig 5 in general the proposed analytical model is suitable to manage the process of water extraction from pumping wells near the stream for example if it is expected to pump potable water from the well for 20 years at a maximum rate of 4800 m3 day then the model can predict the resulted levels of contamination accordingly appropriate decisions of pumping time periods and rates can be taken 3 2 3 investigate the effect of hydraulic conductivity parameter the effect of hydraulic conductivity k on water quality produced from dw1 well near the langat river shore was also investigated for 2d flow firstly a k value of 8 64 m d was used where it is the minimum values of hydraulic conductivity required for riverbank filtration site grischek et al 2002 maliva and missimer 2012 the value was then doubled twice to 17 28 m d and 34 56 m d the influence of hydraulic conductivity on the contaminant concentration was investigated over the area d x y 0 x l 30 y 30 as shown in fig 7 the simulation was performed for 3 days the drawdown s is 4 2 m shamsuddin et al 2013 it is noticed that the increase in k value led to a slight increase in the contamination area the concentration values measured near the rivers after 3 pumping days were 0 84 mg l 0 91 mg l and 1 05 mg l at k 8 64 m d 17 28 m d and 34 56 m d respectively at a distance of 30 m from the river edge the concentrations increased from less than 0 12 mg l to approximately 0 15 mg l when the k value increased from 8 64 m d to 34 56 m d this trend was noticeable along the y axis when equations with the same kvalue showed that the contamination decreased as the range of y values increased for example after 20 m along the y axis the concentration did not exceed 0 15 mg l and 0 55 mg l for all kvalues the model assumes that the aquifer is homogenous and isotropic which means that the hydraulic conductivity is the same everywhere and independent of the flow direction although the aquifer of riverbank filtration sites in reality is not homogenous and isotropic these assumptions are necessary for analyzing both analytical and numerical models this model can be used for designing a pumping well located near polluted stream including its pumping rate and location in particular it can determine the maximum value of pumping rate as well as the shortest distance between pumping well and river so that the contamination plume never reaches the extraction well as shown in the following example example illustrates the way of finding the location and pumping rate of the well based on nitrate concentration in this example the aquifer is assumed unconfined the pumping rate and well location will be determined based on the concentration for nitrate compound no3 however this model can be applied similarly for any other contaminant if the limit of its concentration in raw water is known the maximum allowable limit for no3 concentration is 10 mg l shamsuddin et al 2013 consider s x 0 7 β 2 5e 8 1 s t 2800m3 d λ 1 8m d r 1 d 20m assume that the pumping well is located at 150 m from the edge and the initial concentration equals 50 mg l thus the pumping rate will be determined after 700 days of pumping as illustrated in fig 8 the ranges of pumping rates that are plotted varies from 150 m3 h 3600 m3 d to 350m3 h 8400 m3 d it is found that the pumping rate should be less than 300 m3 h 7200 m3 d otherwise the no3 concentrations will exceed its limit 10 mg l in the extracted water which make it insufficient to be used directly for drinking if the pumping well is managed to be used for many years it would be more safe to maintain a pumping rate less than 250 m3 h 6000 m3 d based on fig 8 after 200 days the increasing rate of contaminants becomes very small but still exists and should be considered for long periods if the pumping well is not drilled yet and the pumping rate is proposed to be higher than 300 m3 h the well can be drilled farther from the river edge fig 9 shows the concentration of contaminant at different lvalues started from 50 to 250 m from river edge using a pumping rate of 300 m3 h 7200 m3 d these results indicate that that the well cannot be drilled before 150 m from the stream 4 conclusion an analytical model based on green s function has been developed to model the potential influence of a pumping well on 2d contaminant transport from surface water to adjacent wells in the case of clogged streambeds the results confirmed the suitability of the model in the simulation of contaminant spread in a 2d domain additionally the model is found to be useful in managing the pumping process from the well the model showed that the existence of a clogging layer lowers both the contaminant concentration and the amount of the river water inside the well additionally it is found that the long pumping periods cause considerable increase in contamination around the well the results obtained from contour plots for different pumping rates indicate that the degree of contamination is proportional to the pumping rate as the pumping time increases the contamination will continue to spread over a larger area moreover by increasing the hydraulic conductivity values the contamination around the well area will escalate this model is helpful in determining the suitable pumping rate and location of the well near the stream which is benefit in designing the riverbank filtration sites the current model can be further developed to manage groundwater extraction from a pumping well especially in urban areas where the contamination is very high acknowledgements the authors would like

1513,a two dimensional analytical solution is developed to simulate vapor migration in layered soil laterally away from the edge of contaminant source and has advantages in considering the vapor concentration profile in a functional form near the source edge the analytical solution is validated against existing analytical solution numerical model and experimental results it has also proved to be an alternative screening tool to evaluate the vapor intrusion vi risk by compared with existing vi assessment tools the influence of the characteristics of contaminant source and soil layer on the vi risk are investigated the existence of capillary fringe effectively reduces vi risk among all the single layer soil cases the lateral inclusion zone for sand is the widest due to the thinnest capillary fringe and the lowest effective diffusivity ratio between soil and capillary fringe for layered soil the lower effective diffusivity layer overlying the higher one enhances the horizontal diffusion and extends the lateral inclusion zone the width of lateral inclusion zone increases logarithmically with increasing source concentration while it increases linearly with increasing source depth based on the calculation results a simplified formula is proposed to preliminarily estimate the width of lateral inclusion zone for the typical single layer soil cases considering the capillary fringe graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords two dimensional model analytical solution layered soil vapor intrusion lateral inclusion zone 1 introduction the spill of fuels and the leakage of underground storage tank always lead to volatile organic compounds vocs contamination in groundwater and soil the subsurface voc source can be of various types which typically include the contaminants dissolved in groundwater contaminated pore water in unsaturated soil and non aqueous phase liquids napls in the subsurface soil us epa 2012c the movement of voc vapors from the subsurface source to the nearby buildings is defined as vapor intrusion vi the accumulating voc vapors in house are adverse to human health therefore it is essential to study the migration of voc vapors in soil which is the basis for evaluating the vi risk in fact the migration of gas phase contaminant in soil has been studied for various scenarios such as pesticide transport jury et al 1983 yates et al 2000 yates and ashworth 2018 landfill gas migration in landfill cover xie et al 2017 2018 feng et al 2020 and vi yu et al 2009 wang et al 2012 shen et al 2014 shen and suuberg 2014 yao et al 2015b 2017 verginelli et al 2016 2017 since analytical methods can provide basic insight into the migration mechanisms and have advantage in computational efficiency this study will focus on analytical solutions developing one dimensional analytical models to simulate gas transport in soils jury et al 1983 yates et al 2000 xie et al 2017 2018 feng et al 2020 is not a novel idea but the receptor in these analytical models is atmosphere and the building foundation is not considered as to vi model with building foundation the one dimensional analytical model proposed by johnson and ettinger 1991 is a classic model considering vapor diffusion in soil and still adopted by the us epa 2017 to evaluate vi into buildings which has been the basis of numerous subsequent one dimensional analytical models devaull 2007 yao et al 2015a however all these one dimensional analytical models are built on the assumption that the contaminant source is infinite compared with the one dimensional analytical model two dimensional analytical model has advantage in considering the effect of building position and the scope of contaminant source so great efforts have been made by the pioneers lowell and eklund 2004 shen et al 2014 shen and suuberg 2014 yao et al 2015b 2017 lowell and eklund 2004 first built a two dimensional vapor diffusion model but the model is built based on the assumption that the soil is homogeneous which has also been adopted by most of the above models in fact the ground is generally layered and the soil properties can substantially vary with depth to accommodate layered soil yao et al 2015b proposed a semi analytical model aamlph to estimate the contaminant vapor concentration at sub slab of building however it is assumed that the vertical and horizontal vapor diffusions are independent and satisfy one dimensional transport in each direction which could not precisely reflect the two dimensional diffusion of vapor although yao et al 2017 also proposed an analytical model considering the vertical heterogeneity of soil the building is assumed to be just over the contaminant source which is infinitely extended on the groundwater table thus the model cannot consider the vi risk of building in region laterally away from the source edge similar limitation also exists in the analytical models proposed by shen et al 2014 and shen and suuberg 2014 to the best of our knowledge no existing two dimensional analytical solution is available for vapor migration in layered soil laterally away from the edge of contaminant source the objectives of this study are twofold 1 to develop an analytical model to predict vapor migration in the layered soil laterally away from the edge of contaminant source and 2 to preliminarily evaluate the vi risk for buildings that are not just over the contaminant source the performance of the present solution is verified by existing analytical solution numerical model and experimental results its applicability in vi assessment and the influence of several important factors are then investigated 2 two dimensional analytical solution for vapor diffusion in layered soil the concerned vapor migration process is shown in fig 1 a vapor moves mainly vertically above the contaminant plume e g contaminated groundwater while both vertical and horizontal migrations are important in region laterally away from the edge of contaminant plume the vapor concentration just above the contaminated groundwater is regarded as the source concentration c s the soil above the groundwater table is layered and the soil layer number can be arbitrary the capillary fringe is the zone immediately above the groundwater table within the bottom soil layer which sucks water up from the underlying groundwater and has higher water filled porosity than the above soil us epa 2012b the thickness and water filled porosity of the capillary fringe for 12 typical soils are listed in table 1 us epa 2012d in this study the scope between the source edge and the nearest building where the vapor concentration is just below the threshold concentration c cr e g the screening value for shallow soil gas is regarded as the lateral inclusion zone it means that the buildings located in the lateral inclusion zone are vulnerable to vi to facilitate deriving the analytical solution the concept model is simplified as fig 1 b the simplification is reasonable for preliminarily determining the lateral inclusion zone without considering the influence of buildings on the voc transport once the buildings or sites for future buildings are located in the lateral inclusion zone further more specific investigation is necessary to evaluate the exposure to the vapors us epa 2012a it should be noted that the analytical model is developed without considering the biodegradation of voc vapor in soil thus the analytical model cannot be applied to simulate the migration of biodegradable compounds such as petroleum vapor to develop the analytical model some assumptions are made 1 the vapor concentration at the source is regarded as a constant bozkurt et al 2009 verginelli et al 2017 2 the vapor volatilization from source is regarded as a slow process and the advection process is negligible 3 the vapor migration is regarded as a steady state process 4 each soil layer is homogeneous 5 the capillary fringe above the groundwater table is regarded as a homogeneous layer from which the contaminant vapor does not volatilize the capillary fringe and the overlying soil are regarded as two separated layers in the analytical model even if the soil types are the same the capillary fringe causes impediment effect on vapor migration due to the much higher water content it should be noted that the vapor concentration calculated under this assumption may be overestimated compared with the measured value or the calculated value accounting for the vertical moisture profile hers et al 2003 shen et al 2013 nonetheless the analytical solution can provide conservative estimation for the vapor intrusion problem although the vapor migration in soil is a transient process the steady state profile of vapor concentration can reflect the most dangerous situation thus the steady state assumption has also been widely adopted in other studies e g yao et al 2015b verginelli et al 2016 2 1 governing equation and boundary conditions the governing equation for vapor diffusion through the layered soil laterally away from the source edge can be expressed as 1 d i 2 c i x z x 2 d i 2 c i x z z 2 0 i 1 2 3 n where c i x z is the vapor concentration of the i th layer x and z are the coordinates in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the layer number i ranges from 1 to n the subscript i is replaced by cf for the capillary fringe d i is the effective diffusivity of the i th layer and can be calculated by the millington quirk equation millington and quirk 1961 2 d i d a φ g i 10 3 φ t i 2 d a φ t i φ w i 10 3 φ t i 2 where d a is the diffusivity of vapor in the atmosphere φ g i φ w i and φ t i are the gas filled porosity water filled porosity and total porosity of the i th layer respectively as shown in fig 1 b the rectangular region laterally away from the source edge is the calculation area where the vapor transport is concerned the top boundary of the calculation area is connected to the atmosphere the bottom boundary is the surface of the groundwater table if there is no barrier e g cutoff wall in the soil laterally away from the source edge the vapor concentration could be generally neglected at the right boundary which is far enough from the source if impervious vertical barrier exists non flux boundary condition should be adopted which is also suitable for laboratory scale experiment considering vapor migration limited by the experimental tank therefore two types of right boundary condition zero concentration boundary condition in eq 3c and non flux boundary condition in eq 3e are considered here the vapor concentration at the left boundary is a function of depth which enriches the applicability of the analytical solution thus the boundary conditions of the calculation area in fig 1 b can be expressed as 3a c 1 x 0 0 3b c n x l z 0 3c c i z 0 3d c i 0 z f i z 3e c i l x z x 0 where l is the depth of contaminant source l x is the width of the calculation area f i z is the vertical concentration profile in any function form at or near the source edge in fact it is not easy to obtain f i z in eq 3d therefore two methods are introduced to determine the calculation area for the two typical scenarios respectively for the first scenario the vapor concentration at different depths in a vertical plane laterally away from the source edge is monitored f i z eq 3d can be fitted with the monitored data and the boundary of the calculation area close to the source can be built at the vertical plane for the other scenario the vapor concentration at the source is known but f i z is unknown in such a scenario the vertical plane at the source edge is taken as the left boundary of the calculation area since vapor migration above the contaminant plume is mainly in vertical direction it is assumed that the vapor migration in this area satisfies one dimensional diffusion assumption which has also been adopted by some other scholars to simplify the derivation e g lowell and eklund 2004 yao et al 2015b the method based on the one dimensional diffusion assumption to determine f i z is enclosed in the appendix a apart from the boundary conditions the continuity of vapor concentration and flux between two adjacent layers should also be satisfied 4a c i x z i c i 1 x z i 4b d i c i x z i z d i 1 c i 1 x z i z 2 2 derivation of analytical solution the general solution

9 m 1 e b i m e α m x f b i m e α m x a b i m sin α m z b b i m cos α m z x 0 f bi m 0 can be derived according to eq 9 therefore the general solution to the governing equation with the zero

ci m e ci m and f ci m are all 0 by substituting c bi x z eq 7 into the non flux boundary condition eq 3e the following equation can be obtained 19 f b i m e b i m e 2 α m l x m 1 2 thus the general

solutions for the two types of boundary condition can be simplified as follows 21 c i x z m 1 a i m sin λ m z b i m cos λ m z x m x 22 λ m α m m 1 2 where λ m are the newly introduced eigenvalues for the zero concentration boundary condition eq 3c x m x in eq 21 can be expressed as 23 x m x e λ m x for the non flux boundary condition eq 3e x m x can be formulated as 24 x m x e λ m x e λ m x 2 λ m l x substituting eq 21 into eq 4a and eq 4b yields 25 a i 1 m sin λ m z i b i 1 m cos λ m z i a i m sin λ m z i b i m cos λ m z i 26 d i 1 a i 1 m cos λ m z i b i 1 m sin λ m z i d i a i m cos λ m z i

following equation can be obtained 32 a 1 m sin λ m 0 b 1 m cos λ m 0 0 the value of coefficient b 1 m is 0 while a 1 m is a arbitrary constant herein the general solution eq 21 can be further optimized by picking out a constant e m so that a 1 m is equal to 1 the general solution eq 21 can be rewritten as 33 c i x z m 1 e m a i m sin λ m z b i m cos λ m z x m x by substituting the

numerical solutions with one dimensional diffusion assumption at the left boundary the performance of the present analytical solution in describing two dimensional voc vapor diffusion is tested by the analytical solution proposed by lowell and eklund 2004 which focuses on the diffusion problem in single layer soil the solution proposed by lowell and eklund 2004 can be expressed as 37 c x z 2 c s m 1 1 m 1 β m 2 e β m x l sin β m z l where 38 β m 2 m 1 2 π in the analyzed case the effective diffusivity of vapor is 5 39 10 8 m2 s the vapor concentration at the contaminant source is 0 321 kg m3 and the source depth is 2 44 m due to the lack of considering the capillary fringe in their models all the analyzed cases in this section do not consider the capillary fringe based on eq 33 and eq 37 the vapor concentration profile can be calculated as shown in fig 2 a which matches the results calculated by lowell and eklund 2004 excellently well due to the lack of experimental data for layered scenario the results of numerical simulation using the comsol software are adopted for further verification here a case of layered soil taken from the work presented by yao et al 2015b is considered the source is located at depth of 8 m from the ground surface and vapor concentration at the source is 1 mol m3 the soil above the groundwater table is divided into three layers with effective diffusivities equaling 1 05 10 6 m2 s 8 68 10 7 m2 s and 4 37 10 7 m2 s from the top to the bottom respectively for the three layer soil cases in their study the capillary fringe was not considered either the thickness of the top two layers are 3 m while the bottom layer is 2 m thick based on the general solution developed in appendix a the vapor concentration profile at the source edge can be formulated with the one dimensional diffusion assumption 39 f 1 z 0 0875 z z 0 3 f 2 z 0 1057 z 0 055 z 3 6 f 3 z 0 2105 z 0 6842 z 6 8 the vapor concentration contours calculated by the proposed analytical solution also match those calculated by the two dimensional numerical model reasonably well fig 2b 3 2 comparison with experimental results with monitored vertical concentration profile the latest two dimensional pilot scale tank experiment conducted by wang et al 2019 is adopted here the tank size was 1 8 m in length 0 58 m in height and 0 2 m in width the tce solution with a size of 0 16 m in length and 0 2 m in width was placed at the bottom corner of the tank as the pollution source the effective diffusivity of the homogeneous soil in tank was 2 17 10 6 m2 s 36 sampling ports were designed for collecting vapor samples the effect of capillary fringe is not considered either because the bottom soil in the experiment was not saturated the measured data at the lateral distance of 0 17 m from the edge of the contaminant source are linearized piecewise as the boundary condition f i z of the analytical model the soil can be divided into 7 layers according to f i z in spite of the homogeneous soil in the test which can be simulated by the proposed analytical solution in this study although the adopted experiment was designed for homogeneous soil dividing the soil into several layers artificially based on the piecewise boundary condition can reflect the layering characteristics of soil to some extent the boundary condition f i z can be formulated as 40 f 1 z 0 5173 z z 0 0 03 f 2 z 0 7213 z 0 0061 z 0 03 0 13 f 3 z 0 4747 z 0 0259 z 0 13 0 23 f 4 z 1 0987 z 0 1176 z 0 23 0 33 f 5 z 0 3171 z 0 1403 z 0 33 0 43 f 6 z 0 2339 z 0 1761 z 0 43 0 53 f 7 z 0 3001 z 0 53 0 58 considering the non flux boundary condition at the right boundary the distance between the left and right boundaries is 1 47 m fig 3 shows the comparison between the measured data presented by wang et al 2019 and the results calculated by analytical solution which agree reasonably well 4 vapor migration in layered soil and estimation of lateral inclusion zone 4 1 comparison with existing vapor intrusion model although the present analytical model does not consider the existence of building i e the receptor of vi its applicability in vi assessment is still evaluated here by compared with the aamlph model proposed by yao et al 2015b which can consider the existence of building a case involving three layer soils is analyzed as an example the input parameters are the same as those in the second case in section 3 1 and come from yao et al 2015b the capillary fringe is not considered for better comparison since aamlph deals with the vertical and horizontal vapor transports independently the normalized vertical vapor concentration profile does not change with increasing lateral distance see the asterisk in fig 4 the present solution couples vertical and horizontal vapor transports thus it can provide the normalized vertical vapor concentration profile at any lateral distance from the contaminant source fig 4 reveals that after x is larger than 10 m the normalized concentration profile does not change much in order to judge the model capability of vi assessment two typical scenarios are considered in the first scenario the depth of building foundation is d f 2 m in the second one d f 0 02 m yao et al 2015b established three dimensional numerical model to test the performance of aamlph in describing vi problem which is also adopted in this study the width and the length of building foundation are both 10 m since the present solution does not involve building the calculated vapor concentration at the near edge of the foundation bottom is regarded as that at the sub slab of building c ss the calculation results of the three methods are compared in fig 5 the data of aamlph and numerical simulation come from yao et al 2015b the value of c ss calculated by the present solution is between those by the aamlph and the three dimensional numerical model indicating that the present analytical solution can be applied as an alternative tool to evaluate vi risk then the width of lateral inclusion zone w li can be estimated preliminarily by the proposed analytical solution 4 2 influence of source vapor concentration and source depth the parameters used in the following sections come from the us epa 2012b tce and pce two typical contaminants are adopted here the diffusivities of tce and pce in the atmosphere d a are 6 9 10 6 m2 s and 5 0 10 6 m2 s respectively the screening value for shallow soil gas of 6 μg m3 tce and 100 μg m3 pce are chosen as the thresholds of vapor concentration to determine w li eklund et al 2018 the soil characteristics including total porosity the range of water filled porosity as well as the thickness and the water filled porosity of capillary fringe are summarized in table 1 the effective diffusivity of each soil and capillary fringe can be calculated by eq 2 without special mentioning the depth of contaminant source is 9 m and the vapor concentration at source equals 8 38 104 μg m3 which is the maximum tce vapor concentration in the database of us epa 2012d the lateral inclusion zone is estimated for the building with the basement d f 2 m mainly fig 6 shows the influence of vapor concentration at contaminant source on w li the ground above the groundwater table consists of three layers sand silt and clay from top to bottom and the thickness of each layer is 3 m the bottom 0 815 m thick layer in the 3 m thick clay layer is separated as the capillary fringe similar rule is adopted to determine the thickness of capillary fringe for other soil layer combinations the w li of shallow foundation scenario d f 0 2 m is less than that of the deeper foundation scenario d f 2 m which is due to the smaller vapor concentration in the shallower soil for each curve w li increases logarithmically with increasing vapor concentration at the source the w li for tce is higher than that for pce because the threshold concentration for pce 100 μg m3 is larger than that for tce 6 μg m3 as aforementioned if the threshold concentration of 6 μg m3 is applied to pce the curves in fig 6 for tce and pce will overlapped which indicates that the vapor concentration profile in soil is not affected by the diffusivity of contaminants therefore tce is regarded as the representative contaminant in the following parametric study fig 7 shows the influence of the depth of contaminant source on w li here three single layer soil cases and two three layer soil cases are considered for three layer soil cases the thickness of the top two layers are both 2 m the bottom layer for the three layer soil cases is clay which contains the capillary fringe at the bottom for all the cases calculated in fig 7 w li increases linearly with increasing depth of contaminant source the difference among all the cases is due to the different effective diffusivities of soils which is discussed in the following section as aforementioned w li increases logarithmically with increasing vapor concentration at the source and increases linearly with increasing depth of contaminant source for the 12 typical soils in the database of us epa 2012d a simplified formula is proposed for single layer soil cases to calculate the width of lateral inclusion zone 41 w li t a b c s l k h m c s where t a b c s and k h m c s can be formulated as 42 t a b c s a log c s b 43 k h m c s h log c s m the coefficients a b h and m can be obtained by fitting the curves the fitting results are shown in fig 8 the r square of the fitting results almost all exceed 0 99 the value of coefficients in the simplified formulas for the different soils are listed in table 2 for reference in fact layered soil cases are more common in engineering practices the arrangement of soil layers may vary significantly which makes it rather difficult to list the coefficients for all the possible cases thus the simplified formula and corresponding coefficients are more meaningful for the single layer soil cases to estimate w li preliminarily as for layered soil cases w li can also be estimated by the analytical solution proposed in this study with less computational effort 4 3 influence of effective diffusivity and thickness of soil layer besides the influence of vapor source characteristics the soil layer characteristics e g effective diffusivity and layer thickness also affect the vapor concentration profile and w li fig 9 shows the influence of soil type on w li in single layer soil cases compared with the constant w li 47 33 m for the homogeneous soil without considering the capillary fringe w li considering the capillary fringe is lower due to the lower effective diffusivity of the capillary fringe which impedes the vapor diffusion from the source as to the possible range of water filled porosity for the different soil types listed in table 1 the corresponding ranges of w li are all shown in fig 9 the upper bound dashed line refers to the results calculated with the maximum water filled porosity while the lower bound dashed line refers to the minimum value which indicates that the decrease of effective diffusivity of soil above the capillary fringe leads to the expansion of lateral inclusion zone the vapor concentration profiles considering different soil layer arrangements are shown in fig 10 the vapor concentration decreases exponentially with increasing lateral distance at the same depth which agrees with the conclusion drawn by lowell and eklund 2004 under homogeneous soil condition without considering capillary fringe the vapor concentration drops by one order of magnitude with lateral distance increasing by about 13 0 m and 12 1 m for single layer soil cases in fig 10 a and b respectively while about 8 9 m and 11 6 m in fig 10 c and d for three layer soil cases respectively due to the existence of the higher effective diffusivity soil above the clay layer the contaminant vapor migrates upward more easily so that the horizontal diffusion of vapor in layered soil is weaker than that in the single layer clay case fig 10b additionally if the layer with lower effective diffusivity overlies that with higher effective diffusivity the horizontal diffusion in soil will be more intensive due to the impediment for vertical migration see fig 10d thus the arrangement of soil layer in layered soil cases affects the vapor migration significantly w li depends on the intensity of horizontal diffusion of vapor in soil fig 11 shows the influence of layer thickness in two layer soil cases on w li the 1st layer is sand or silt in fig 11 while the 2nd layer is clay the total thickness of the two layers is 9 m with the increase of l 1 w li decreases to the minimum in the first phase due to the higher effective diffusivity of the top layer soil then a further increase of l 1 leads to recovery of w li in the second phase the horizontal diffusion of vapor mainly occurs in deep soil while the vertical diffusion mainly occurs in the shallow soil when l 1 increases in the first phase the high effective diffusivity soil in shallow ground promotes the vertical diffusion in the shallow soil which weakens the horizontal diffusion and leads to the reduction of w li however if the top layer soil is thick enough the high effective diffusivity soil also enhances the horizontal diffusion of vapor in deep ground then the influence of l 1 on w li enters the second phase that w li recovers with the increase of l 1 the minimum w li occurs when the values of l 1 l 2 are 0 60 and 0 62 for sand and silt cases respectively the lateral inclusion zone for sand case changes more significantly than that for silt case with the same increase of l 1 which indicates that larger ratio of d 1 to d 2 leads to greater variation of w li based on the above analysis an interesting phenomenon in fig 9 can be explained although the effective diffusivity of sand is the largest of all the soil types in table 1 w li is the largest see fig 9 which is due to the joint effect of the thinnest capillary fringe and the lowest effective diffusivity ratio d 1 d cf 25 1 between the soil and capillary fringe 5 summary and conclusions this paper develops a two dimensional analytical solution to simulate vapor migration in the layered soil laterally away from the edge of contaminant source the analytical solution is validated against existing analytical solution numerical model and experimental results the feasibility of the analytical solution to evaluate the vi risk is discussed by compared with existing vi assessment tools finally the effects of source characteristics and soil layer characteristics on the vapor diffusion in soil and the width of lateral inclusion zone are investigated some major conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the present analytical solution can be used as an alternative screening tool to evaluate the vi risk the deep foundation building suffers larger vi risk than the shallow foundation building due to the higher vapor concentration in the deeper part given the same lateral distance 2 w li increases logarithmically with increasing vapor concentration at the source while it increases linearly with increasing depth of contaminant source considering the influence of capillary fringe a simplified formula is proposed to calculate w li for single layer soil cases 3 capillary fringe is highly important for evaluating vapor migration w li for homogeneous soil without considering the capillary fringe is unaffected by soil types and larger than that considering the capillary fringe among all the single layer soil cases w li for sand is the largest due to the joint effect of the thinnest capillary fringe and the lowest effective diffusivity ratio between soil and capillary fringe 4 for the layered soil cases lower effective diffusivity layer overlying higher effective diffusivity layer enhances the horizontal diffusion and expands the lateral inclusion zone the larger difference of effective diffusivity between the adjacent layers leads to greater variation of w li given the same change in relative thickness declaration of competing interest we declare

1513,a two dimensional analytical solution is developed to simulate vapor migration in layered soil laterally away from the edge of contaminant source and has advantages in considering the vapor concentration profile in a functional form near the source edge the analytical solution is validated against existing analytical solution numerical model and experimental results it has also proved to be an alternative screening tool to evaluate the vapor intrusion vi risk by compared with existing vi assessment tools the influence of the characteristics of contaminant source and soil layer on the vi risk are investigated the existence of capillary fringe effectively reduces vi risk among all the single layer soil cases the lateral inclusion zone for sand is the widest due to the thinnest capillary fringe and the lowest effective diffusivity ratio between soil and capillary fringe for layered soil the lower effective diffusivity layer overlying the higher one enhances the horizontal diffusion and extends the lateral inclusion zone the width of lateral inclusion zone increases logarithmically with increasing source concentration while it increases linearly with increasing source depth based on the calculation results a simplified formula is proposed to preliminarily estimate the width of lateral inclusion zone for the typical single layer soil cases considering the capillary fringe graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords two dimensional model analytical solution layered soil vapor intrusion lateral inclusion zone 1 introduction the spill of fuels and the leakage of underground storage tank always lead to volatile organic compounds vocs contamination in groundwater and soil the subsurface voc source can be of various types which typically include the contaminants dissolved in groundwater contaminated pore water in unsaturated soil and non aqueous phase liquids napls in the subsurface soil us epa 2012c the movement of voc vapors from the subsurface source to the nearby buildings is defined as vapor intrusion vi the accumulating voc vapors in house are adverse to human health therefore it is essential to study the migration of voc vapors in soil which is the basis for evaluating the vi risk in fact the migration of gas phase contaminant in soil has been studied for various scenarios such as pesticide transport jury et al 1983 yates et al 2000 yates and ashworth 2018 landfill gas migration in landfill cover xie et al 2017 2018 feng et al 2020 and vi yu et al 2009 wang et al 2012 shen et al 2014 shen and suuberg 2014 yao et al 2015b 2017 verginelli et al 2016 2017 since analytical methods can provide basic insight into the migration mechanisms and have advantage in computational efficiency this study will focus on analytical solutions developing one dimensional analytical models to simulate gas transport in soils jury et al 1983 yates et al 2000 xie et al 2017 2018 feng et al 2020 is not a novel idea but the receptor in these analytical models is atmosphere and the building foundation is not considered as to vi model with building foundation the one dimensional analytical model proposed by johnson and ettinger 1991 is a classic model considering vapor diffusion in soil and still adopted by the us epa 2017 to evaluate vi into buildings which has been the basis of numerous subsequent one dimensional analytical models devaull 2007 yao et al 2015a however all these one dimensional analytical models are built on the assumption that the contaminant source is infinite compared with the one dimensional analytical model two dimensional analytical model has advantage in considering the effect of building position and the scope of contaminant source so great efforts have been made by the pioneers lowell and eklund 2004 shen et al 2014 shen and suuberg 2014 yao et al 2015b 2017 lowell and eklund 2004 first built a two dimensional vapor diffusion model but the model is built based on the assumption that the soil is homogeneous which has also been adopted by most of the above models in fact the ground is generally layered and the soil properties can substantially vary with depth to accommodate layered soil yao et al 2015b proposed a semi analytical model aamlph to estimate the contaminant vapor concentration at sub slab of building however it is assumed that the vertical and horizontal vapor diffusions are independent and satisfy one dimensional transport in each direction which could not precisely reflect the two dimensional diffusion of vapor although yao et al 2017 also proposed an analytical model considering the vertical heterogeneity of soil the building is assumed to be just over the contaminant source which is infinitely extended on the groundwater table thus the model cannot consider the vi risk of building in region laterally away from the source edge similar limitation also exists in the analytical models proposed by shen et al 2014 and shen and suuberg 2014 to the best of our knowledge no existing two dimensional analytical solution is available for vapor migration in layered soil laterally away from the edge of contaminant source the objectives of this study are twofold 1 to develop an analytical model to predict vapor migration in the layered soil laterally away from the edge of contaminant source and 2 to preliminarily evaluate the vi risk for buildings that are not just over the contaminant source the performance of the present solution is verified by existing analytical solution numerical model and experimental results its applicability in vi assessment and the influence of several important factors are then investigated 2 two dimensional analytical solution for vapor diffusion in layered soil the concerned vapor migration process is shown in fig 1 a vapor moves mainly vertically above the contaminant plume e g contaminated groundwater while both vertical and horizontal migrations are important in region laterally away from the edge of contaminant plume the vapor concentration just above the contaminated groundwater is regarded as the source concentration c s the soil above the groundwater table is layered and the soil layer number can be arbitrary the capillary fringe is the zone immediately above the groundwater table within the bottom soil layer which sucks water up from the underlying groundwater and has higher water filled porosity than the above soil us epa 2012b the thickness and water filled porosity of the capillary fringe for 12 typical soils are listed in table 1 us epa 2012d in this study the scope between the source edge and the nearest building where the vapor concentration is just below the threshold concentration c cr e g the screening value for shallow soil gas is regarded as the lateral inclusion zone it means that the buildings located in the lateral inclusion zone are vulnerable to vi to facilitate deriving the analytical solution the concept model is simplified as fig 1 b the simplification is reasonable for preliminarily determining the lateral inclusion zone without considering the influence of buildings on the voc transport once the buildings or sites for future buildings are located in the lateral inclusion zone further more specific investigation is necessary to evaluate the exposure to the vapors us epa 2012a it should be noted that the analytical model is developed without considering the biodegradation of voc vapor in soil thus the analytical model cannot be applied to simulate the migration of biodegradable compounds such as petroleum vapor to develop the analytical model some assumptions are made 1 the vapor concentration at the source is regarded as a constant bozkurt et al 2009 verginelli et al 2017 2 the vapor volatilization from source is regarded as a slow process and the advection process is negligible 3 the vapor migration is regarded as a steady state process 4 each soil layer is homogeneous 5 the capillary fringe above the groundwater table is regarded as a homogeneous layer from which the contaminant vapor does not volatilize the capillary fringe and the overlying soil are regarded as two separated layers in the analytical model even if the soil types are the same the capillary fringe causes impediment effect on vapor migration due to the much higher water content it should be noted that the vapor concentration calculated under this assumption may be overestimated compared with the measured value or the calculated value accounting for the vertical moisture profile hers et al 2003 shen et al 2013 nonetheless the analytical solution can provide conservative estimation for the vapor intrusion problem although the vapor migration in soil is a transient process the steady state profile of vapor concentration can reflect the most dangerous situation thus the steady state assumption has also been widely adopted in other studies e g yao et al 2015b verginelli et al 2016 2 1 governing equation and boundary conditions the governing equation for vapor diffusion through the layered soil laterally away from the source edge can be expressed as 1 d i 2 c i x z x 2 d i 2 c i x z z 2 0 i 1 2 3 n where c i x z is the vapor concentration of the i th layer x and z are the coordinates in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the layer number i ranges from 1 to n the subscript i is replaced by cf for the capillary fringe d i is the effective diffusivity of the i th layer and can be calculated by the millington quirk equation millington and quirk 1961 2 d i d a φ g i 10 3 φ t i 2 d a φ t i φ w i 10 3 φ t i 2 where d a is the diffusivity of vapor in the atmosphere φ g i φ w i and φ t i are the gas filled porosity water filled porosity and total porosity of the i th layer respectively as shown in fig 1 b the rectangular region laterally away from the source edge is the calculation area where the vapor transport is concerned the top boundary of the calculation area is connected to the atmosphere the bottom boundary is the surface of the groundwater table if there is no barrier e g cutoff wall in the soil laterally away from the source edge the vapor concentration could be generally neglected at the right boundary which is far enough from the source if impervious vertical barrier exists non flux boundary condition should be adopted which is also suitable for laboratory scale experiment considering vapor migration limited by the experimental tank therefore two types of right boundary condition zero concentration boundary condition in eq 3c and non flux boundary condition in eq 3e are considered here the vapor concentration at the left boundary is a function of depth which enriches the applicability of the analytical solution thus the boundary conditions of the calculation area in fig 1 b can be expressed as 3a c 1 x 0 0 3b c n x l z 0 3c c i z 0 3d c i 0 z f i z 3e c i l x z x 0 where l is the depth of contaminant source l x is the width of the calculation area f i z is the vertical concentration profile in any function form at or near the source edge in fact it is not easy to obtain f i z in eq 3d therefore two methods are introduced to determine the calculation area for the two typical scenarios respectively for the first scenario the vapor concentration at different depths in a vertical plane laterally away from the source edge is monitored f i z eq 3d can be fitted with the monitored data and the boundary of the calculation area close to the source can be built at the vertical plane for the other scenario the vapor concentration at the source is known but f i z is unknown in such a scenario the vertical plane at the source edge is taken as the left boundary of the calculation area since vapor migration above the contaminant plume is mainly in vertical direction it is assumed that the vapor migration in this area satisfies one dimensional diffusion assumption which has also been adopted by some other scholars to simplify the derivation e g lowell and eklund 2004 yao et al 2015b the method based on the one dimensional diffusion assumption to determine f i z is enclosed in the appendix a apart from the boundary conditions the continuity of vapor concentration and flux between two adjacent layers should also be satisfied 4a c i x z i c i 1 x z i 4b d i c i x z i z d i 1 c i 1 x z i z 2 2 derivation of analytical solution the general solution to eq 1 can be readily obtained by solving laplace s equation 5 c i x z c a i x z c b i x z c c i x z c ai x z c bi x z and c ci x z are the general solutions to the governing equation and can be formulated as 6 c a i x z a a i 0 x b a i 0 e a i 0 z f a i 0 α m 0 7 c b i x z m 1 e b i m e α m x f b i m e α m x a b i m sin α m z b b i m cos α m z α m 0 8 c c i x z m 1 a c i m sin α m x b c i m cos α m x e c i m e α m z f c i m e α m z α m 0 here α m are eigenvalues by substituting the general solution c ai x z eq 6 and c ci x z eq 8 into zero concentration boundary condition eq 3c the coefficients a ai 0 b ai 0 e ai 0 f ai 0 a ci m b ci m e ci m and f ci m are all 0 by substituting c bi x z eq 7 into zero concentration boundary condition eq 3c the following equation can be obtained 9 m 1 e b i m e α m x f b i m e α m x a b i m sin α m z b b i m cos α m z x 0 f bi m 0 can be derived according to eq 9 therefore the general solution to the governing equation with the zero

obtained by substituting the general solution c ai x z eq 6 into non flux boundary condition eq 3e 11 a a i 0 l x b a i 0 e a i 0 z f a i 0 0 b ai 0 l x a ai 0 should be satisfied the general solution c ai x z eq 6 can be rewritten as 12 c a i x z a a i 0 x l x e a i 0 z f a i 0 by substituting eq 12 into the top and bottom boundary conditions eq 3a and eq 3b the equations can be derived as 13 a a

f a i 0 16 d i 1 a a i 1 0 e a i 1 0 d i a a i 0 e a i 0 eq 15 and eq 16 can be rewritten as 17 a a i 1 0 f a i 1 0 a a i 0 e a i 0 z i 1 d i d i 1 a a i 0 f a i 0 18 a a i 1 0 e a i 1 0 d i d i 1 a a i 0 e a i 0 based on eq 13 eq 14 eq 17 and eq 18 c ai x z 0 can be obtained readily by substituting the general solution c ci x z eq 8 into non flux boundary condition eq 3e the coefficients a ci m b ci m e ci m and f ci m are all 0 by substituting c bi x z eq 7 into the non flux boundary condition eq 3e the following equation can be obtained 19 f b i m e b i m e 2 α m l x m 1 2 thus the general solution to the governing equation with the non flux boundary condition can be rewritten as 20 c i x z c b i x z m 1 e b i m e α m x 2 α m l x e α m x a b i m sin α m z b b i m cos α m z the general solutions for the two types of boundary condition can be simplified as follows 21 c i x z m 1 a i m sin λ m z b i m cos λ m z x m x 22 λ m α m m 1 2 where λ m are the newly introduced eigenvalues for the zero concentration boundary condition eq 3c x m x in eq 21 can be expressed as 23 x m x e λ m x for the non flux boundary condition eq 3e x m x can be formulated as 24 x m x e λ m x e λ m x 2 λ m l x substituting eq 21 into eq 4a and eq 4b yields 25 a i 1 m sin λ m z i b i 1 m cos λ m z i a i m sin λ m z i b i m cos λ m z i 26 d i 1 a i 1 m cos λ m z i b i 1 m sin λ m z i d i a i m cos λ m z i

following equation can be obtained 32 a 1 m sin λ m 0 b 1 m cos λ m 0 0 the value of coefficient b 1 m is 0 while a 1 m is a arbitrary constant herein the general solution eq 21 can be further optimized by picking out a constant e m so that a 1 m is equal to 1 the general solution eq 21 can be rewritten as 33 c i x z m 1 e m a i m sin λ m z b i m cos λ m z x m x by substituting the

numerical solutions with one dimensional diffusion assumption at the left boundary the performance of the present analytical solution in describing two dimensional voc vapor diffusion is tested by the analytical solution proposed by lowell and eklund 2004 which focuses on the diffusion problem in single layer soil the solution proposed by lowell and eklund 2004 can be expressed as 37 c x z 2 c s m 1 1 m 1 β m 2 e β m x l sin β m z l where 38 β m 2 m 1 2 π in the analyzed case the effective diffusivity of vapor is 5 39 10 8 m2 s the vapor concentration at the contaminant source is 0 321 kg m3 and the source depth is 2 44 m due to the lack of considering the capillary fringe in their models all the analyzed cases in this section do not consider the capillary fringe based on eq 33 and eq 37 the vapor concentration profile can be calculated as shown in fig 2 a which matches the results calculated by lowell and eklund 2004 excellently well due to the lack of experimental data for layered scenario the results of numerical simulation using the comsol software are adopted for further verification here a case of layered soil taken from the work presented by yao et al 2015b is considered the source is located at depth of 8 m from the ground surface and vapor concentration at the source is 1 mol m3 the soil above the groundwater table is divided into three layers with effective diffusivities equaling 1 05 10 6 m2 s 8 68 10 7 m2 s and 4 37 10 7 m2 s from the top to the bottom respectively for the three layer soil cases in their study the capillary fringe was not considered either the thickness of the top two layers are 3 m while the bottom layer is 2 m thick based on the general solution developed in appendix a the vapor concentration profile at the source edge can be formulated with the one dimensional diffusion assumption 39 f 1 z 0 0875 z z 0 3 f 2 z 0 1057 z 0 055 z 3 6 f 3 z 0 2105 z 0 6842 z 6 8 the vapor concentration contours calculated by the proposed analytical solution also match those calculated by the two dimensional numerical model reasonably well fig 2b 3 2 comparison with experimental results with monitored vertical concentration profile the latest two dimensional pilot scale tank experiment conducted by wang et al 2019 is adopted here the tank size was 1 8 m in length 0 58 m in height and 0 2 m in width the tce solution with a size of 0 16 m in length and 0 2 m in width was placed at the bottom corner of the tank as the pollution source the effective diffusivity of the homogeneous soil in tank was 2 17 10 6 m2 s 36 sampling ports were designed for collecting vapor samples the effect of capillary fringe is not considered either because the bottom soil in the experiment was not saturated the measured data at the lateral distance of 0 17 m from the edge of the contaminant source are linearized piecewise as the boundary condition f i z of the analytical model the soil can be divided into 7 layers according to f i z in spite of the homogeneous soil in the test which can be simulated by the proposed analytical solution in this study although the adopted experiment was designed for homogeneous soil dividing the soil into several layers artificially based on the piecewise boundary condition can reflect the layering characteristics of soil to some extent the boundary condition f i z can be formulated as 40 f 1 z 0 5173 z z 0 0 03 f 2 z 0 7213 z 0 0061 z 0 03 0 13 f 3 z 0 4747 z 0 0259 z 0 13 0 23 f 4 z 1 0987 z 0 1176 z 0 23 0 33 f 5 z 0 3171 z 0 1403 z 0 33 0 43 f 6 z 0 2339 z 0 1761 z 0 43 0 53 f 7 z 0 3001 z 0 53 0 58 considering the non flux boundary condition at the right boundary the distance between the left and right boundaries is 1 47 m fig 3 shows the comparison between the measured data presented by wang et al 2019 and the results calculated by analytical solution which agree reasonably well 4 vapor migration in layered soil and estimation of lateral inclusion zone 4 1 comparison with existing vapor intrusion model although the present analytical model does not consider the existence of building i e the receptor of vi its applicability in vi assessment is still evaluated here by compared with the aamlph model proposed by yao et al 2015b which can consider the existence of building a case involving three layer soils is analyzed as an example the input parameters are the same as those in the second case in section 3 1 and come from yao et al 2015b the capillary fringe is not considered for better comparison since aamlph deals with the vertical and horizontal vapor transports independently the normalized vertical vapor concentration profile does not change with increasing lateral distance see the asterisk in fig 4 the present solution couples vertical and horizontal vapor transports thus it can provide the normalized vertical vapor concentration profile at any lateral distance from the contaminant source fig 4 reveals that after x is larger than 10 m the normalized concentration profile does not change much in order to judge the model capability of vi assessment two typical scenarios are considered in the first scenario the depth of building foundation is d f 2 m in the second one d f 0 02 m yao et al 2015b established three dimensional numerical model to test the performance of aamlph in describing vi problem which is also adopted in this study the width and the length of building foundation are both 10 m since the present solution does not involve building the calculated vapor concentration at the near edge of the foundation bottom is regarded as that at the sub slab of building c ss the calculation results of the three methods are compared in fig 5 the data of aamlph and numerical simulation come from yao et al 2015b the value of c ss calculated by the present solution is between those by the aamlph and the three dimensional numerical model indicating that the present analytical solution can be applied as an alternative tool to evaluate vi risk then the width of lateral inclusion zone w li can be estimated preliminarily by the proposed analytical solution 4 2 influence of source vapor concentration and source depth the parameters used in the following sections come from the us epa 2012b tce and pce two typical contaminants are adopted here the diffusivities of tce and pce in the atmosphere d a are 6 9 10 6 m2 s and 5 0 10 6 m2 s respectively the screening value for shallow soil gas of 6 μg m3 tce and 100 μg m3 pce are chosen as the thresholds of vapor concentration to determine w li eklund et al 2018 the soil characteristics including total porosity the range of water filled porosity as well as the thickness and the water filled porosity of capillary fringe are summarized in table 1 the effective diffusivity of each soil and capillary fringe can be calculated by eq 2 without special mentioning the depth of contaminant source is 9 m and the vapor concentration at source equals 8 38 104 μg m3 which is the maximum tce vapor concentration in the database of us epa 2012d the lateral inclusion zone is estimated for the building with the basement d f 2 m mainly fig 6 shows the influence of vapor concentration at contaminant source on w li the ground above the groundwater table consists of three layers sand silt and clay from top to bottom and the thickness of each layer is 3 m the bottom 0 815 m thick layer in the 3 m thick clay layer is separated as the capillary fringe similar rule is adopted to determine the thickness of capillary fringe for other soil layer combinations the w li of shallow foundation scenario d f 0 2 m is less than that of the deeper foundation scenario d f 2 m which is due to the smaller vapor concentration in the shallower soil for each curve w li increases logarithmically with increasing vapor concentration at the source the w li for tce is higher than that for pce because the threshold concentration for pce 100 μg m3 is larger than that for tce 6 μg m3 as aforementioned if the threshold concentration of 6 μg m3 is applied to pce the curves in fig 6 for tce and pce will overlapped which indicates that the vapor concentration profile in soil is not affected by the diffusivity of contaminants therefore tce is regarded as the representative contaminant in the following parametric study fig 7 shows the influence of the depth of contaminant source on w li here three single layer soil cases and two three layer soil cases are considered for three layer soil cases the thickness of the top two layers are both 2 m the bottom layer for the three layer soil cases is clay which contains the capillary fringe at the bottom for all the cases calculated in fig 7 w li increases linearly with increasing depth of contaminant source the difference among all the cases is due to the different effective diffusivities of soils which is discussed in the following section as aforementioned w li increases logarithmically with increasing vapor concentration at the source and increases linearly with increasing depth of contaminant source for the 12 typical soils in the database of us epa 2012d a simplified formula is proposed for single layer soil cases to calculate the width of lateral inclusion zone 41 w li t a b c s l k h m c s where t a b c s and k h m c s can be formulated as 42 t a b c s a log c s b 43 k h m c s h log c s m the coefficients a b h and m can be obtained by fitting the curves the fitting results are shown in fig 8 the r square of the fitting results almost all exceed 0 99 the value of coefficients in the simplified formulas for the different soils are listed in table 2 for reference in fact layered soil cases are more common in engineering practices the arrangement of soil layers may vary significantly which makes it rather difficult to list the coefficients for all the possible cases thus the simplified formula and corresponding coefficients are more meaningful for the single layer soil cases to estimate w li preliminarily as for layered soil cases w li can also be estimated by the analytical solution proposed in this study with less computational effort 4 3 influence of effective diffusivity and thickness of soil layer besides the influence of vapor source characteristics the soil layer characteristics e g effective diffusivity and layer thickness also affect the vapor concentration profile and w li fig 9 shows the influence of soil type on w li in single layer soil cases compared with the constant w li 47 33 m for the homogeneous soil without considering the capillary fringe w li considering the capillary fringe is lower due to the lower effective diffusivity of the capillary fringe which impedes the vapor diffusion from the source as to the possible range of water filled porosity for the different soil types listed in table 1 the corresponding ranges of w li are all shown in fig 9 the upper bound dashed line refers to the results calculated with the maximum water filled porosity while the lower bound dashed line refers to the minimum value which indicates that the decrease of effective diffusivity of soil above the capillary fringe leads to the expansion of lateral inclusion zone the vapor concentration profiles considering different soil layer arrangements are shown in fig 10 the vapor concentration decreases exponentially with increasing lateral distance at the same depth which agrees with the conclusion drawn by lowell and eklund 2004 under homogeneous soil condition without considering capillary fringe the vapor concentration drops by one order of magnitude with lateral distance increasing by about 13 0 m and 12 1 m for single layer soil cases in fig 10 a and b respectively while about 8 9 m and 11 6 m in fig 10 c and d for three layer soil cases respectively due to the existence of the higher effective diffusivity soil above the clay layer the contaminant vapor migrates upward more easily so that the horizontal diffusion of vapor in layered soil is weaker than that in the single layer clay case fig 10b additionally if the layer with lower effective diffusivity overlies that with higher effective diffusivity the horizontal diffusion in soil will be more intensive due to the impediment for vertical migration see fig 10d thus the arrangement of soil layer in layered soil cases affects the vapor migration significantly w li depends on the intensity of horizontal diffusion of vapor in soil fig 11 shows the influence of layer thickness in two layer soil cases on w li the 1st layer is sand or silt in fig 11 while the 2nd layer is clay the total thickness of the two layers is 9 m with the increase of l 1 w li decreases to the minimum in the first phase due to the higher effective diffusivity of the top layer soil then a further increase of l 1 leads to recovery of w li in the second phase the horizontal diffusion of vapor mainly occurs in deep soil while the vertical diffusion mainly occurs in the shallow soil when l 1 increases in the first phase the high effective diffusivity soil in shallow ground promotes the vertical diffusion in the shallow soil which weakens the horizontal diffusion and leads to the reduction of w li however if the top layer soil is thick enough the high effective diffusivity soil also enhances the horizontal diffusion of vapor in deep ground then the influence of l 1 on w li enters the second phase that w li recovers with the increase of l 1 the minimum w li occurs when the values of l 1 l 2 are 0 60 and 0 62 for sand and silt cases respectively the lateral inclusion zone for sand case changes more significantly than that for silt case with the same increase of l 1 which indicates that larger ratio of d 1 to d 2 leads to greater variation of w li based on the above analysis an interesting phenomenon in fig 9 can be explained although the effective diffusivity of sand is the largest of all the soil types in table 1 w li is the largest see fig 9 which is due to the joint effect of the thinnest capillary fringe and the lowest effective diffusivity ratio d 1 d cf 25 1 between the soil and capillary fringe 5 summary and conclusions this paper develops a two dimensional analytical solution to simulate vapor migration in the layered soil laterally away from the edge of contaminant source the analytical solution is validated against existing analytical solution numerical model and experimental results the feasibility of the analytical solution to evaluate the vi risk is discussed by compared with existing vi assessment tools finally the effects of source characteristics and soil layer characteristics on the vapor diffusion in soil and the width of lateral inclusion zone are investigated some major conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the present analytical solution can be used as an alternative screening tool to evaluate the vi risk the deep foundation building suffers larger vi risk than the shallow foundation building due to the higher vapor concentration in the deeper part given the same lateral distance 2 w li increases logarithmically with increasing vapor concentration at the source while it increases linearly with increasing depth of contaminant source considering the influence of capillary fringe a simplified formula is proposed to calculate w li for single layer soil cases 3 capillary fringe is highly important for evaluating vapor migration w li for homogeneous soil without considering the capillary fringe is unaffected by soil types and larger than that considering the capillary fringe among all the single layer soil cases w li for sand is the largest due to the joint effect of the thinnest capillary fringe and the lowest effective diffusivity ratio between soil and capillary fringe 4 for the layered soil cases lower effective diffusivity layer overlying higher effective diffusivity layer enhances the horizontal diffusion and expands the lateral inclusion zone the larger difference of effective diffusivity between the adjacent layers leads to greater variation of w li given the same change in relative thickness declaration of competing interest we declare

1514,much of the world s groundwater supply has been contaminated by aromatic hydrocarbons originating from anthropogenic sources to study the occurrence and distribution characteristics of aromatic hydrocarbons in groundwater 24 aromatic hydrocarbon compounds were selected five btex compounds benzene toluene ethylbenzene o xylene m xylene and p xylene 10 alkyl substituted benzene and 9 halogenated aromatics these aromatic hydrocarbons were then analyzed from 355 samples collected from across china results indicated that aromatic hydrocarbons were detected in 59 out of 355 samples of the selected aromatic hydrocarbons btex compounds were detected with high frequency and at low concentrations comparatively halogenated aromatics were detected with low frequency and at high concentrations the aromatic hydrocarbon characteristics found in both karst and pore groundwater samples were then determined using their respective hydrogeological conditions and corresponding human activities in karst groundwater btex compounds were the most frequently detected aromatic hydrocarbon the high detection frequencies of aromatic hydrocarbons were caused by their rapid migration owing to the developed conduit system in the sampled karst area the low concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons in karst groundwater samples were caused by low intensity human activity along with special hydrogeological conditions with higher redox potential and the unique compositions of aromatic hydrocarbons alkyl substituted aromatics and halogenated aromatics were detected at higher concentrations in pore groundwater owing to high intensity human activity aromatic hydrocarbon pollution was gradually decreased along piedmont alluvial plain coast line owing to a decrease in aquifer vulnerability these were positively correlated with the size of the aquifer s particles samples with a high accumulative concentration of these aromatic hydrocarbons tended to occur in pore groundwater with a high

quality in general has deteriorated dramatically as a result of industrialization arias estevez et al 2008 spalding and exner 1993 von der heyden and new 2004 moreover the inherent vulnerability of groundwater aquifers make any groundwater pollution mitigation difficult chapman and parker 2005 freitas et al 2015 moeck et al 2018 in recent years many studies have paid particular attention to groundwater pollution and prevention leading to small scale investigations that have sought to summarize the characteristics of groundwater pollution at individual locations barry et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 however large scale pollution investigations remain lacking and are urgently needed as common organic contaminants aromatic hydrocarbons have been previously investigated and reported in shallow groundwater di lorenzo et al 2015 rowe et al 2007 yu et al 2015 aromatic hydrocarbons derive from a variety of sources the major ones being solvent use vehicle emissions liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas leakage coal burning and industrial sources guo et al 2004a guo et al 2004b zhang et al 2013 based on their structures and uses 24 aromatic hydrocarbons are divided into three categories btex common term used for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and the xylenes alkyl substituted aromatics and halogenated aromatics mostly all aromatic hydrocarbons are toxic to living organisms and can cause direct harm to human health resulting in neurotoxicity genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity johnson et al 2009 khan 2007 win shwe and fujimaki 2010 as a result many countries have established threshold values for aromatic hydrocarbons primarily including btex in drinking water quality standards table 1 the thresholds for the most toxic aromatic hydrocarbons prescribed in most countries have been ranked as follows benzene styrene ethylbenzene xylenes toluene us epa 2006 ministry of public health of china 2006 health canada 1996 new zealand ministry of health 2005 japan

been found in north america europe and china balderacchi et al 2014 chen et al 2015 rivett and feenstra 2005 in this past work the aromatic hydrocarbons of focus have been principally benzene toluene chlorobenzene and other common aromatic hydrocarbons across these studies aromatic hydrocarbons found in surface water soil atmosphere groundwater and drinking water were investigated when compared with surface water and soil both detection frequency and concentration of groundwater aromatic hydrocarbons were low ranging from 0 to 1 μg l chen et al 2015 di lorenzo et al 2015 rowe et al 2007 yu et al 2015 much of the current work on aromatic hydrocarbon pollution in china has focused on that found in the atmosphere meng et al 2018 xia et al 2014 surface water pan et al 2010 and soil zhang 2012 moreover this past work has been mostly conducted in individual regions relatedly large scale investigations on groundwater aromatic hydrocarbon pollution remain scarce as a result the occurrence and distribution characteristics of aromatic hydrocarbons are relatively un known additionally research containing a more comprehensive assessment of other aromatic hydrocarbon species aside from btex are needed to better understand the differences in the occurrence and distribution of non btex aromatic hydrocarbons finally the spatial variations of aromatic hydrocarbons in different hydrogeological units as well as their potential influencing factors have also been neglected here 355 groundwater samples were obtained from four types of hydrogeological units in china samples were then analyzed regarding their aromatic hydrocarbon occurrence and distribution characteristics there were several objectives to this study 1 investigate the occurrence of aromatic hydrocarbons in the four types of hydrogeological units 2 identify potential hydrochemical and or hydrogeological factors on the detection frequencies and concentrations of identified aromatic hydrocarbons 3 evaluate the overall characteristics of aromatic hydrocarbons across different hydrogeological conditions 4 explore the effects of hydrogeological conditions on aromatic hydrocarbon detection and 5 provide

units in china and used to explore the distribution characteristics and presence of aromatic hydrocarbons across different hydrogeological conditions pore groundwater samples were collected from different zones of the alluvial plain which is china s most developed geological unit to better explore the effect of human activities on aromatic hydrocarbon occurrence and distribution sampling areas were selected with similar hydrogeological conditions but with different intensities of human activities i e north china plain and the northeast plain sampling areas specifically the study area was distributed across the northeast plain north china plain ncp southwest karst area and pearl river delta plain prd considering the impact of human activities on groundwater most of the sampling sites were to the east of china s population density line 97 5 and the majority of them were shallow groundwater with sampling depths of approximately 2 4 35 5 m based on their geographical locations

is a geological and mineral industry standard issued by the ministry of land and resources now the ministry of natural resources of the people s republic of china this standard is jointly completed by the china geological survey the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology of the chinese academy of geological sciences the national geological experimental testing center and the china geological environment monitoring institute before sampling 40 ml amber glass bottles were prepared for sample collection these brown glass bottles were soaked in 50 nitric acid for 24 h to remove potential organic compounds then sequentially washed with tap water alcohol and deionized water bottles were finally dried at 105 c for 24 h before sampling we followed the following procedure during the process of groundwater sample collection 1 recorded the hydrogeological characteristic and potential source of pollution around the sampling sites and filled in the groundwater sampling table 2 cleaned the sampling well stored well water was slowly and smoothly discharged during this process pumping was used to remove stagnant water from the top pumping did not result in a significant drop

drainage from the small diameter branch pipe installed at the outlet of the pump any bubbles in the sampling bottle were drained during sampling the cap was tightened after adding the corresponding protective agent the protective agent was added either directly or indirectly according to the different test items following collection all samples were stored and shipped in a cooler box with ice on return to the laboratory all collected samples were stored at 4 c and then sent to the water resources and environmental engineering laboratory of china university of geosciences beijing samples were

laboratory blank marking sample a laboratory parallel sample and a laboratory sample matrix addition sample were set and analyzed in each batch of samples the recovery of 24 aromatic hydrocarbons ranged from 70 0 to 130 0 and the concentrations of target substances in all blank samples were lower than their method detection limits the method detection limits of 24 aromatic hydrocarbons were 0

detected in sampled groundwater under the different hydrogeological conditions in china are shown in fig 2 one or more benzene compounds were detected in 16 6 of the tested groundwater samples fig 3 of the 24 aromatic hydrocarbons selected for this study 20 were detected fig 2 three aromatic hydrocarbons had detection frequencies 3 fig 2 six aromatic hydrocarbons had detection frequencies between 1 and 3 while 11 had detection frequencies between 0 1 and 1 table 4 aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were generally low 97 of groundwater samples had accumulative aromatic hydrocarbons concentrations 1 μg l while approximately 0 28 had accumulative aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations 10 μg l table 4 for the three types of aromatic hydrocarbons the detection frequency of btex was higher 3 7 than that of either alkyl substituted aromatic 2 5 or halogenated aromatic 2 3 btex concentrations varied from 0 30 3 17 μg l with a median of 0 53 μg l and a mean of 0 75 μg l the concentrations of alkyl substituted aromatics varied from 0 11 25 80 μg l with a median of 0 20 μg l and a mean of 1 06 μg l the concentrations of halogenated aromatics varied from 0 10 64 30 μg l with a median of 0 51 μg l and a mean of 3 24 μg l fig 2 for btex the detection frequencies were 3 66 benzene 3 66 toluene and 3 66 m xylene p xylene and 0 56 o xylene table 4 ethylbenzene was not detected table 4 the cumulative concentrations were high for benzene 10 13 μg l m xylene p xylene 10 03 μg l and toluene 9 75 μg l the cumulative concentration for o xylene 0 7 μg l was low fig 2 for alkyl substituted aromatics the detection frequencies were greater than 1 for tert butylbenzene 2 54 n propylbenzene 1 97 naphthalene 1 41 and 1 2 4 tritoluene 1 13 table 4 propylbenzene also had a high concentration 25 80 μg l which resulted in a high accumulative concentration 27 48 μg l fig 2 for halogenated aromatics the detection frequencies were greater than 1 for o chlorotoluene 2 25 and chlorobenzene 1 97 table 4 o chlorotoluene had a high concentration 64 30 μg l which led to a high accumulative concentration 68 4 μg l fig 3 of the groundwater samples 11 3 had a single aromatic hydrocarbon detected while 5 4 had a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons defined as two or more aromatic hydrocarbons present in the same groundwater sample as many as 11 individual aromatic hydrocarbons were detected in one sample however the most frequently occurring mixture was that composed of just two compounds fig 3 when compared with pore groundwater karst groundwater has a higher aromatic hydrocarbon detection frequency nevertheless aromatic hydrocarbons occurred more frequently in karst groundwater samples with a single benzene compound than in those with a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons additionally pore groundwater had mean detections across the various hydrogeological units in the following order piedmont 3 1 alluvial plain 1 8 coast 1 3 fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 effects of hydrochemical and hydrogeological factors on the detection of aromatic hydrocarbons organic contamination in aquatic environments is significantly affected by the environment s specific hydrochemistry for instance the presence of fe iii has a significant effect on btex oxidation rates dong et al 2015 when compared to natural remediation injection of nitrate and sulfate into a contaminated aquifer has been used to accelerate btex removal cunningham et al 2001 kolhatkar and schnobrich 2017 as such we analyzed the relationship between the accumulative concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons and a given environment s hydrochemistry as shown in fig 4 both karst and pore groundwater samples were projected into the indicated piper diagram based on the diamond shaped field in the piper diagram it is clear that accumulative aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were more closely related to anion composition from the trilinear cation plots ca2 and mg2 were the dominant cation species for all groundwater samples this in conjunction with the anion shukalev based classification we identified 4 different groundwater types in the piper diagram a hco3 ca mg water with low so4 2 and cl b hco3 ca mg water with high so4 2 and low cl c hco3 ca mg water with low so4 2 and d high cl and hco3 ca mg water with high so4 2 and cl for karst groundwater the dominant hydrochemistry type was hco3 ca mg water with low so4 2 and cl the high hco3 concentration was caused by carbonate dissolution aromatic hydrocarbons in the karst areas were generally detected with a low accumulative concentration resulting from a combination of factors including low intensity human activity its special hydrogeological condition with high redox potential high do concentration short residence time high dilution coefficient of karst groundwater and the unique composition of aromatic hydrocarbons found there was much lower human activity intensity in the karst areas relative to that of the pore groundwater areas the mean population density in the karst areas was 363 caps km2 which was less than half of that in the pore groundwater areas 874 caps km2 the mean gross industrial production in the pore groundwater areas 2148 billion yuan was approximately three times higher than that in the karst areas 736 billion yuan table 5 according to their oxygen requirements microorganisms that break down aromatic hydrocarbons can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic bacteria within these two groups aerobic microorganisms break down aromatic hydrocarbons faster than anaerobic ones atlas 1981 jindrova et al 2002 song et al 2019 our results found that the eh values of karst groundwater samples were not significantly higher than those in pore groundwater samples fig 5 as is known the oxidation reduction potential orp equivalent to eh reflects the comprehensive oxidation reduction capacity of a system in a groundwater system orp is a complex integrated system that is made of multiple sets of redox electron pairs e g o2 h2o mno2 mn2 and no3 no2 in other words the higher the eh in a given system the stronger its oxidation capacity however our results indicated that the do levels in karst groundwater were significantly higher than those in pore groundwater t test p 000 fig 5 aerobic break down of aromatic hydrocarbons is more likely to occur in karst groundwater which helps reduce their concentration in this specific groundwater type as a result biodegradation is one factor but not the main factor contributing to the low concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons in karst groundwater due to the open geological structure of karst areas there were no significant differences in do concentration at different sampling sites fig 6 however our results indicated that the eh in karst groundwater samples without aromatic hydrocarbons was significantly higher than that of karst samples with aromatic hydrocarbons fig 6 this finding indicated that the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons in karst groundwater may be partially correlated with eh given this we next conducted a correlational analysis of various environmental parameters and accumulative concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons these environmental parameters were as follows ph eh ec do f no3 2 no2 nh4 17 metal ions well depth and water depth of these the hydrogeological variable redox potential eh in karst groundwater was the most strongly and frequently associated with aromatic hydrocarbon concentration this was a key factor for biodegradation of aromatic hydrocarbons in karst groundwater the higher the eh the higher the accumulative concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons r 0 53 p 043 n 15 and alkyl substituted aromatics r 0 64 p 046 n 10 fig 7 thus aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in karst groundwater were significantly correlated with eh when compared with pore groundwater karst groundwater has both shorter residence time and a higher dilution coefficient the average annual rainfall in the selected karst areas was much higher than that in sampled pore groundwater areas except for area vii the average annual rainfall for the former was 400 600 mm a while that for the latter was 1000 2200 mm a past work has shown that in karst areas the precipitation infiltration coefficient was 0 2 0 8 and groundwater flow velocity was 100 10 000 m d lu et al 2006 in pore groundwater areas the precipitation infiltration coefficient was generally less than 0 2 with a groundwater flow velocity of 1 10 m d lu et al 2006 the high rainfall infiltration coefficient meant that large amounts of precipitation recharged the groundwater which allows for the dilution of aromatic hydrocarbons in karst groundwater additionally the high groundwater flow velocity also promoted the dilution in karst groundwater collectively these factors resulted in a lower concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons in the karst groundwater as the main aromatic hydrocarbons btex were detected in karst groundwater when compared with chlorinated aromatics these aromatic hydrocarbons were more easily degraded by microorganisms the difference in structure between chlorinated aromatics and btex is only in the presence or absence of a chlorine atom which led to the significant difference in microbial degradation between the two types of compounds under aerobic conditions the more chlorine atoms a compound has the weaker the dechlorination ability of a given microorganism song et al 2019 when compared with pore groundwater aromatic hydrocarbons tended to be naturally attenuated in karst groundwater owing to the unique composition of aromatic hydrocarbons for the pore groundwater samples the accumulative concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons varied with anion composition as shown in the trilinear anion plots pore groundwater samples with a higher accumulative concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons tended to be distributed in areas b c and d fig 4 these areas also corresponded to those where the concentration of either so4 2 or cl was also correspondingly higher using spss to conduct a correlation analysis we found that in pore groundwater the higher the accumulative concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons the higher the concentration of so4 2 and cl r 0 571 p 003 n 21 fig 8 the high concentrations of so4 2 or cl indicated the intense impact of human activities on groundwater for instance so4 2 may have dissolved in the groundwater from a number of sources including industrial effluents from textiles paper mills and tanneries as well as fertilizer runoff from agricultural activities cortecci et al 2002 cl in the groundwater principally derives from landfill leachate and industrial wastewater feng et al 2011 so4 2 and cl sources can be determined from the surroundings of the sampling sites table 6 since they have widespread use across life and industry aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations are partly reflective of the intensity of human activity therefore the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons tends to coexist with other human activity indicators e g high concentrations of so4 2 and cl in this light it is credible that the high concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons tended to occur in groundwater samples that also had high concentrations of so4 2 or cl by analyzing the hydrochemical characteristics of the pore groundwater samples that did not have aromatics hydrocarbons present we found that aromatic hydrocarbons were not detected even in the samples with extremely high concentrations of so4 2 and cl fig s1 in pore groundwater the higher the accumulative concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons the higher the concentration of so4 2 and cl fig 8 however this did not mean that aromatic hydrocarbons must have been detected in pore groundwater samples with high concentrations of so4 2 and cl or that concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons must be high in the pore groundwater samples with high concentrations of so4 2 and cl the reason for this result is that the high concentrations of so4 2 and cl in pore groundwater samples does not guarantee the existence of aromatic hydrocarbon sources when aromatic hydrocarbons were confirmed to be detected in pore groundwater the accumulative concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons were positively correlated with the concentrations of so4 2 and cl this partially reflected the intensity of human activity near the sampling sites 4 2 effects of hydrogeological conditions on the detection of aromatic hydrocarbons generally the occurrence and distribution of organic contaminants varies with hydrogeological conditions for example antibiotics have higher detection levels in shallow karst groundwater when compared with shallow pore groundwater owing to the unique hydrogeology in karst regions chen et al 2018 given this aromatic hydrocarbon characteristics under different hydrogeological conditions including detection frequency concentration and detections were compared and are shown in fig 9 the characteristics of aromatic hydrocarbons detected in karst and pore groundwater samples were notably different when compared with pore groundwater the detection frequency of aromatic hydrocarbons in karst groundwater was higher resulting from the rapid migration of aromatic hydrocarbons however aromatic hydrocarbons pollution generally occurred in karst groundwater samples with low detections resulting from the lower intensity human activity in karst areas table 5 the compositions of aromatic hydrocarbons in karst and pore groundwater samples were remarkably different for instance btex was the main component in karst groundwater samples while chlorobenzenes cbs occurred more frequently in pore groundwater samples this difference in aromatic hydrocarbon composition was caused by the difference in industrial levels between karst and pore groundwater areas to this end btex primarily derives from gasoline and building paint gasoline yang et al 2017 paint and varnish ryu et al 2017 usually consist of high amounts of btex benzene is a volatile aromatic hydrocarbon and is widespread in the ecosystem owing to the burning of fuels and leakage and or spillage of petroleum fuels kuykendall 2008 toluene and methylcyclohexane are components of petroleum mitsushima and hacker 2018 xylene is used as a solvent and a constituent of paint and dyes pohanish 2017 in addition cbs are important raw materials for chemical production widely used in industry as intermediates for synthetic dyes organic compounds pesticides manufacturing rubber additives and heat transfer medium wang et al 1992 cbs also widely exist in pharmaceutical and textile wastewater wang et al 1992 in 2015 the amount of sewage in treatment plants in china reached 1 5 108 m3 d and the corresponding sludge generated exceeded 3 5 107 t a dai et al 2017 this produced a variety of cbs vyas and murthy 2015 when compared with btex the presence of chlorobenzenes indicates a higher industrial level in given region according to the statistics table 5 the mean gross industrial production in pore groundwater sampling areas 2148 billion yuan was approximately three times greater than that in karst groundwater sampling areas 736 billion yuan therefore btex occurred more frequently in karst groundwater areas owing their lower industrial levels comparatively cbs were detected more frequently in pore groundwater areas aromatic hydrocarbons characteristics in pore groundwater samples were also different among the different hydrogeological conditions combining the detection frequency with concentration and detection we concluded that the aromatic hydrocarbon pollution gradually decreased along piedmont alluvial plain coast line this decrease was likely due to a decrease in aquifer vulnerability which were positively related with aquifer particles fig 9 moreover the detection frequency and concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons in the piedmont were much higher than those in the alluvial plain and coastal areas fig 9 the high aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in the piedmont were caused by the higher vulnerability of coarser aquifers chitsazan and akhtari 2009 jang et al 2017 miller et al 2014 along with the existence of large cities like beijing and shijiazhuang aromatic hydrocarbons with the high concentration likely resulted from the combined effects of municipal sewage and industrial wastewater the high vulnerability of aquifers in the piedmont made it easier for aromatic hydrocarbons to enter the groundwater fig 9 5 conclusions 1 aromatic hydrocarbons in karst groundwater had high detection frequency low concentration and low detections while those in pore groundwater had low detection frequency high concentration and high detections in karst groundwater btex was detected most frequently in pore groundwater alkyl substituted aromatics and halogenated aromatics were detected more frequently with higher concentrations 2 in karst groundwater the accumulative concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl substituted aromatics was negatively correlated with eh in pore groundwater the high accumulative concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons was often accompanied by high concentrations of so4 2 or cl 3 high detection frequency of btex in karst groundwater was caused by their rapid migration owing to well developed conduit system in karst areas when compared with karst groundwater the higher concentrations of alkyl substituted aromatics and halogenated aromatics in pore groundwater were caused by high intensity human activity 4 in karst groundwater aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were low owing to the low intensity human activity special hydrogeological conditions with high redox potential high do shorter residence time high dilution coefficient of karst groundwater and a unique composition of aromatic hydrocarbons in pore groundwater aromatic hydrocarbon pollution gradually decreased along the piedmont alluvial plain coast line this was due to decreased aquifer vulnerability which was positively related with aquifer particles

1514,much of the world s groundwater supply has been contaminated by aromatic hydrocarbons originating from anthropogenic sources to study the occurrence and distribution characteristics of aromatic hydrocarbons in groundwater 24 aromatic hydrocarbon compounds were selected five btex compounds benzene toluene ethylbenzene o xylene m xylene and p xylene 10 alkyl substituted benzene and 9 halogenated aromatics these aromatic hydrocarbons were then analyzed from 355 samples collected from across china results indicated that aromatic hydrocarbons were detected in 59 out of 355 samples of the selected aromatic hydrocarbons btex compounds were detected with high frequency and at low concentrations comparatively halogenated aromatics were detected with low frequency and at high concentrations the aromatic hydrocarbon characteristics found in both karst and pore groundwater samples were then determined using their respective hydrogeological conditions and corresponding human activities in karst groundwater btex compounds were the most frequently detected aromatic hydrocarbon the high detection frequencies of aromatic hydrocarbons were caused by their rapid migration owing to the developed conduit system in the sampled karst area the low concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons in karst groundwater samples were caused by low intensity human activity along with special hydrogeological conditions with higher redox potential and the unique compositions of aromatic hydrocarbons alkyl substituted aromatics and halogenated aromatics were detected at higher concentrations in pore groundwater owing to high intensity human activity aromatic hydrocarbon pollution was gradually decreased along piedmont alluvial plain coast line owing to a decrease in aquifer vulnerability these were positively correlated with the size of the aquifer s particles samples with a high accumulative concentration of these aromatic hydrocarbons tended to occur in pore groundwater with a high

quality in general has deteriorated dramatically as a result of industrialization arias estevez et al 2008 spalding and exner 1993 von der heyden and new 2004 moreover the inherent vulnerability of groundwater aquifers make any groundwater pollution mitigation difficult chapman and parker 2005 freitas et al 2015 moeck et al 2018 in recent years many studies have paid particular attention to groundwater pollution and prevention leading to small scale investigations that have sought to summarize the characteristics of groundwater pollution at individual locations barry et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 however large scale pollution investigations remain lacking and are urgently needed as common organic contaminants aromatic hydrocarbons have been previously investigated and reported in shallow groundwater di lorenzo et al 2015 rowe et al 2007 yu et al 2015 aromatic hydrocarbons derive from a variety of sources the major ones being solvent use vehicle emissions liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas leakage coal burning and industrial sources guo et al 2004a guo et al 2004b zhang et al 2013 based on their structures and uses 24 aromatic hydrocarbons are divided into three categories btex common term used for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and the xylenes alkyl substituted aromatics and halogenated aromatics mostly all aromatic hydrocarbons are toxic to living organisms and can cause direct harm to human health resulting in neurotoxicity genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity johnson et al 2009 khan 2007 win shwe and fujimaki 2010 as a result many countries have established threshold values for aromatic hydrocarbons primarily including btex in drinking water quality standards table 1 the thresholds for the most toxic aromatic hydrocarbons prescribed in most countries have been ranked as follows benzene styrene ethylbenzene xylenes toluene us epa 2006 ministry of public health of china 2006 health canada 1996 new zealand ministry of health 2005 japan

been found in north america europe and china balderacchi et al 2014 chen et al 2015 rivett and feenstra 2005 in this past work the aromatic hydrocarbons of focus have been principally benzene toluene chlorobenzene and other common aromatic hydrocarbons across these studies aromatic hydrocarbons found in surface water soil atmosphere groundwater and drinking water were investigated when compared with surface water and soil both detection frequency and concentration of groundwater aromatic hydrocarbons were low ranging from 0 to 1 μg l chen et al 2015 di lorenzo et al 2015 rowe et al 2007 yu et al 2015 much of the current work on aromatic hydrocarbon pollution in china has focused on that found in the atmosphere meng et al 2018 xia et al 2014 surface water pan et al 2010 and soil zhang 2012 moreover this past work has been mostly conducted in individual regions relatedly large scale investigations on groundwater aromatic hydrocarbon pollution remain scarce as a result the occurrence and distribution characteristics of aromatic hydrocarbons are relatively un known additionally research containing a more comprehensive assessment of other aromatic hydrocarbon species aside from btex are needed to better understand the differences in the occurrence and distribution of non btex aromatic hydrocarbons finally the spatial variations of aromatic hydrocarbons in different hydrogeological units as well as their potential influencing factors have also been neglected here 355 groundwater samples were obtained from four types of hydrogeological units in china samples were then analyzed regarding their aromatic hydrocarbon occurrence and distribution characteristics there were several objectives to this study 1 investigate the occurrence of aromatic hydrocarbons in the four types of hydrogeological units 2 identify potential hydrochemical and or hydrogeological factors on the detection frequencies and concentrations of identified aromatic hydrocarbons 3 evaluate the overall characteristics of aromatic hydrocarbons across different hydrogeological conditions 4 explore the effects of hydrogeological conditions on aromatic hydrocarbon detection and 5 provide supporting evidence for the prevention and control of groundwater pollution 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and sampling procedure groundwater samples were collected from four typical geomorphic units in china and used to explore the distribution characteristics and presence of aromatic hydrocarbons across different hydrogeological conditions pore groundwater samples were collected from different zones of the alluvial plain which is china s most developed geological unit to better explore the effect of human activities on aromatic hydrocarbon occurrence and distribution sampling areas were selected with similar hydrogeological conditions but with different intensities of human activities i e north china plain and the northeast plain sampling areas specifically the study area was distributed across the northeast plain north china plain ncp southwest karst area and pearl river delta plain prd considering the impact of human activities on groundwater most of the sampling sites were to the east of china s population density line 97 5 and the majority of them were shallow groundwater with sampling depths of approximately 2 4 35 5 m based on their geographical locations and hydrogeological conditions 7 representative sampling areas were selected fig 1 as shown in table 2 four types of groundwater were included karst pipe front pore alluvial diluvial plain pore and coastal pore sampling area i was located in the songnen plain of northeast china fig 1 which is a typical alluvial plain zhao et al 2012 and an important commodity grain base for china huang et al

is rich in precipitation woo et al 1997 this is notable for its significant difference from the alluvial plains in areas i and ii a total of 355 samples were collected from april 2016 to october 2018 the sample collection process was based on the specification for investigation and evaluation of regional groundwater pollution dz t 0288 2015 in chinese the ministry of land and resources 2015 which is a geological and mineral industry standard issued by the ministry of land and resources now the ministry of natural resources of the people s republic of china this standard is jointly completed by the china geological survey the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology of the chinese academy of geological sciences the national geological experimental testing center and the china geological environment monitoring institute before sampling 40 ml amber glass bottles were prepared for sample collection these brown glass bottles were soaked in 50 nitric acid for 24 h to remove potential organic compounds then sequentially washed with tap water alcohol and deionized water bottles were finally dried at 105 c for 24 h before sampling we followed the following procedure during the process of groundwater sample collection 1 recorded the hydrogeological characteristic and potential source of pollution around the sampling sites and filled in the groundwater sampling table 2 cleaned the sampling well stored well water was slowly and smoothly discharged during this process pumping was used to remove stagnant water from the top pumping did not result in a significant drop in the water table the cleaning process was finished when all on site testing items was finished 3 samples were individually collected in the sampling bottles samples were collected from part of the drainage from the small diameter branch pipe installed at the outlet of the pump any bubbles in the sampling bottle were drained during sampling the cap was tightened after adding the corresponding protective agent the protective agent was added either directly or indirectly according to the different test items following collection all samples were stored and shipped in a cooler box with ice on return to the laboratory all collected samples were stored at 4 c and then sent to the water resources and environmental engineering laboratory of china university of geosciences beijing samples were analyzed within one week after arrival at the lab 2 2 instruments and materials the instrumentation used for the testing was as follows agilent 6890 5973 n gas chromatography gc mass spectrometer ms

distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons various water chemistry parameters reflecting the groundwater environment were tested the parameters and corresponding instruments are shown in table 3 2 4 quality assurance and quality control to ensure the accuracy of the analysis process quality control was conducted by referring to epa8270d and epa8000b during this process a laboratory blank sample a laboratory blank marking sample a laboratory parallel sample and a laboratory sample matrix addition sample were set and analyzed in each batch of samples the recovery of 24 aromatic hydrocarbons ranged from 70 0 to 130 0 and the concentrations of target substances in all blank samples were lower than their method detection limits the method detection limits of 24 aromatic hydrocarbons were 0 02 0 1 μg l table s2 all laboratory analysis met our quality control requirements table s3 3 results 3 1 occurrence and levels of aromatic hydrocarbons the concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons detected in sampled groundwater under the different hydrogeological conditions in china are shown in fig 2 one or more benzene compounds were detected in 16 6 of the tested groundwater samples fig 3 of the 24 aromatic hydrocarbons selected for this study 20 were detected fig 2 three aromatic hydrocarbons had detection frequencies 3 fig 2 six aromatic hydrocarbons had detection frequencies between 1 and 3 while 11 had detection frequencies between 0 1 and 1 table 4 aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were generally low 97 of groundwater samples had accumulative aromatic hydrocarbons concentrations 1 μg l while approximately 0 28 had accumulative aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations 10 μg l table 4 for the three types of aromatic hydrocarbons the detection frequency of btex was higher 3 7 than that of either alkyl substituted aromatic 2 5 or halogenated aromatic 2 3 btex concentrations varied from 0 30 3 17 μg l with a median of 0 53 μg l and a mean of 0 75 μg l the concentrations of alkyl substituted aromatics varied from 0 11 25 80 μg l with a median of 0 20 μg l and a mean of 1 06 μg l the concentrations of halogenated aromatics varied from 0 10 64 30 μg l with a median of 0 51 μg l and a mean of 3 24 μg l fig 2 for btex the detection frequencies were 3 66 benzene 3 66 toluene and 3 66 m xylene p xylene and 0 56 o xylene table 4 ethylbenzene was not detected table 4 the cumulative concentrations were high for benzene 10 13 μg l m xylene p xylene 10 03 μg l and toluene 9 75 μg l the cumulative concentration for o xylene 0 7 μg l was low fig 2 for alkyl substituted aromatics the detection frequencies were greater than 1 for tert butylbenzene 2 54 n propylbenzene 1 97 naphthalene 1 41 and 1 2 4 tritoluene 1 13 table 4 propylbenzene also had a high concentration 25 80 μg l which resulted in a high accumulative concentration 27 48 μg l fig 2 for halogenated aromatics the detection frequencies were greater than 1 for o chlorotoluene 2 25 and chlorobenzene 1 97 table 4 o chlorotoluene had a high concentration 64 30 μg l which led to a high accumulative concentration 68 4 μg l fig 3 of the groundwater samples 11 3 had a single aromatic hydrocarbon detected while 5 4 had a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons defined as two or more aromatic hydrocarbons present in the same groundwater sample as many as 11 individual aromatic hydrocarbons were detected in one sample however the most frequently occurring mixture was that composed of just two compounds fig 3 when compared with pore groundwater karst groundwater has a higher aromatic hydrocarbon detection frequency nevertheless aromatic hydrocarbons occurred more frequently in karst groundwater samples with a single benzene compound than in those with a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons additionally pore groundwater had mean detections across the various hydrogeological units in the following order piedmont 3 1 alluvial plain 1 8 coast 1 3 fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 effects of hydrochemical and hydrogeological factors on the detection of aromatic hydrocarbons organic contamination in aquatic environments is significantly affected by the environment s specific hydrochemistry for instance the presence of fe iii has a significant effect on btex oxidation rates dong et al 2015 when compared to natural remediation injection of nitrate and sulfate into a contaminated aquifer has been used to accelerate btex removal cunningham et al 2001 kolhatkar and schnobrich 2017 as such we analyzed the relationship between the accumulative concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons and a given environment s hydrochemistry as shown in fig 4 both karst and pore groundwater samples were projected into the indicated piper diagram based on the diamond shaped field in the piper diagram it is clear that accumulative aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were more closely related to anion composition from the trilinear cation plots ca2 and mg2 were the dominant cation species for all groundwater samples this in conjunction with the anion shukalev based classification we identified 4 different groundwater types in the piper diagram a hco3 ca mg water with low so4 2 and cl b hco3 ca mg water with high so4 2 and low cl c hco3 ca mg water with low so4 2 and d high cl and hco3 ca mg water with high so4 2 and cl for karst groundwater the dominant hydrochemistry type was hco3 ca mg water with low so4 2 and cl the high hco3 concentration was caused by carbonate dissolution aromatic hydrocarbons in the karst areas were generally detected with a low accumulative concentration resulting from a combination of factors including low intensity human activity its special hydrogeological condition with high redox potential high do concentration short residence time high dilution coefficient of karst groundwater and the unique composition of aromatic hydrocarbons found there was much lower human activity intensity in the karst areas relative to that of the pore groundwater areas the mean population density in the karst areas was 363 caps km2 which was less than half of that in the pore groundwater areas 874 caps km2 the mean gross industrial production in the pore groundwater areas 2148 billion yuan was approximately three times higher than that in the karst areas 736 billion yuan table 5 according to their oxygen requirements microorganisms that break down aromatic hydrocarbons can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic bacteria within these two groups aerobic microorganisms break down aromatic hydrocarbons faster than anaerobic ones atlas 1981 jindrova et al 2002 song et al 2019 our results found that the eh values of karst groundwater samples were not significantly higher than those in pore groundwater samples fig 5 as is known the oxidation reduction potential orp equivalent to eh reflects the comprehensive oxidation reduction capacity of a system in a groundwater system orp is a complex integrated system that is made of multiple sets of redox electron pairs e g o2 h2o mno2 mn2 and no3 no2 in other words the higher the eh in a given system the stronger its oxidation capacity however our results indicated that the do levels in karst groundwater were significantly higher than those in pore groundwater t test p 000 fig 5 aerobic break down of aromatic hydrocarbons is more likely to occur in karst groundwater which helps reduce their concentration in this specific groundwater type as a result biodegradation is one factor but not the main factor contributing to the low concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons in karst groundwater due to the open geological structure of karst areas there were no significant differences in do concentration at different sampling sites fig 6 however our results indicated that the eh in karst groundwater samples without aromatic hydrocarbons was significantly higher than that of karst samples with aromatic hydrocarbons fig 6 this finding indicated that the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons in karst groundwater may be partially correlated with eh given this we next conducted a correlational analysis of various environmental parameters and accumulative concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons these environmental parameters were as follows ph eh ec do f no3 2 no2 nh4 17 metal ions well depth and water depth of these the hydrogeological variable redox potential eh in karst groundwater was the most strongly and frequently associated with aromatic hydrocarbon concentration this was a key factor for biodegradation of aromatic hydrocarbons in karst groundwater the higher the eh the higher the accumulative concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons r 0 53 p 043 n 15 and alkyl substituted aromatics r 0 64 p 046 n 10 fig 7 thus aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in karst groundwater were significantly correlated with eh when compared with pore groundwater karst groundwater has both shorter residence time and a higher dilution coefficient the average annual rainfall in the selected karst areas was much higher than that in sampled pore groundwater areas except for area vii the average annual rainfall for the former was 400 600 mm a while that for the latter was 1000 2200 mm a past work has shown that in karst areas the precipitation infiltration coefficient was 0 2 0 8 and groundwater flow velocity was 100 10 000 m d lu et al 2006 in pore groundwater areas the precipitation infiltration coefficient was generally less than 0 2 with a groundwater flow velocity of 1 10 m d lu et al 2006 the high rainfall infiltration coefficient meant that large amounts of precipitation recharged the groundwater which allows for the dilution of aromatic hydrocarbons in karst groundwater additionally the high groundwater flow velocity also promoted the dilution in karst groundwater collectively these factors resulted in a lower concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons in the karst groundwater as the main aromatic hydrocarbons btex were detected in karst groundwater when compared with chlorinated aromatics these aromatic hydrocarbons were more easily degraded by microorganisms the difference in structure between chlorinated aromatics and btex is only in the presence or absence of a chlorine atom which led to the significant difference in microbial degradation between the two types of compounds under aerobic conditions the more chlorine atoms a compound has the weaker the dechlorination ability of a given microorganism song et al 2019 when compared with pore groundwater aromatic hydrocarbons tended to be naturally attenuated in karst groundwater owing to the unique composition of aromatic hydrocarbons for the pore groundwater samples the accumulative concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons varied with anion composition as shown in the trilinear anion plots pore groundwater samples with a higher accumulative concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons tended to be distributed in areas b c and d fig 4 these areas also corresponded to those where the concentration of either so4 2 or cl was also correspondingly higher using spss to conduct a correlation analysis we found that in pore groundwater the higher the accumulative concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons the higher the concentration of so4 2 and cl r 0 571 p 003 n 21 fig 8 the high concentrations of so4 2 or cl indicated the intense impact of human activities on groundwater for instance so4 2 may have dissolved in the groundwater from a number of sources including industrial effluents from textiles paper mills and tanneries as well as fertilizer runoff from agricultural activities cortecci et al 2002 cl in the groundwater principally derives from landfill leachate and industrial wastewater feng et al 2011 so4 2 and cl sources can be determined from the surroundings of the sampling sites table 6 since they have widespread use across life and industry aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations are partly reflective of the intensity of human activity therefore the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons tends to coexist with other human activity indicators e g high concentrations of so4 2 and cl in this light it is credible that the high concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons tended to occur in groundwater samples that also had high concentrations of so4 2 or cl by analyzing the hydrochemical characteristics of the pore groundwater samples that did not have aromatics hydrocarbons present we found that aromatic hydrocarbons were not detected even in the samples with extremely high concentrations of so4 2 and cl fig s1 in pore groundwater the higher the accumulative concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons the higher the concentration of so4 2 and cl fig 8 however this did not mean that aromatic hydrocarbons must have been detected in pore groundwater samples with high concentrations of so4 2 and cl or that concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons must be high in the pore groundwater samples with high concentrations of so4 2 and cl the reason for this result is that the high concentrations of so4 2 and cl in pore groundwater samples does not guarantee the existence of aromatic hydrocarbon sources when aromatic hydrocarbons were confirmed to be detected in pore groundwater the accumulative concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons were positively correlated with the concentrations of so4 2 and cl this partially reflected the intensity of human activity near the sampling sites 4 2 effects of hydrogeological conditions on the detection of aromatic hydrocarbons generally the occurrence and distribution of organic contaminants varies with hydrogeological conditions for example antibiotics have higher detection levels in shallow karst groundwater when compared with shallow pore groundwater owing to the unique hydrogeology in karst regions chen et al 2018 given this aromatic hydrocarbon characteristics under different hydrogeological conditions including detection frequency concentration and detections were compared and are shown in fig 9 the characteristics of aromatic hydrocarbons detected in karst and pore groundwater samples were notably different when compared with pore groundwater the detection frequency of aromatic hydrocarbons in karst groundwater was higher resulting from the rapid migration of aromatic hydrocarbons however aromatic hydrocarbons pollution generally occurred in karst groundwater samples with low detections resulting from the lower intensity human activity in karst areas table 5 the compositions of aromatic hydrocarbons in karst and pore groundwater samples were remarkably different for instance btex was the main component in karst groundwater samples while chlorobenzenes cbs occurred more frequently in pore groundwater samples this difference in aromatic hydrocarbon composition was caused by the difference in industrial levels between karst and pore groundwater areas to this end btex primarily derives from gasoline and building paint gasoline yang et al 2017 paint and varnish ryu et al 2017 usually consist of high amounts of btex benzene is a volatile aromatic hydrocarbon and is widespread in the ecosystem owing to the burning of fuels and leakage and or spillage of petroleum fuels kuykendall 2008 toluene and methylcyclohexane are components of petroleum mitsushima and hacker 2018 xylene is used as a solvent and a constituent of paint and dyes pohanish 2017 in addition cbs are important raw materials for chemical production widely used in industry as intermediates for synthetic dyes organic compounds pesticides manufacturing rubber additives and heat transfer medium wang et al 1992 cbs also widely exist in pharmaceutical and textile wastewater wang et al 1992 in 2015 the amount of sewage in treatment plants in china reached 1 5 108 m3 d and the corresponding sludge generated exceeded 3 5 107 t a dai et al 2017 this produced a variety of cbs vyas and murthy 2015 when compared with btex the presence of chlorobenzenes indicates a higher industrial level in given region according to the statistics table 5 the mean gross industrial production in pore groundwater sampling areas 2148 billion yuan was approximately three times greater than that in karst groundwater sampling areas 736 billion yuan therefore btex occurred more frequently in karst groundwater areas owing their lower industrial levels comparatively cbs were detected more frequently in pore groundwater areas aromatic hydrocarbons characteristics in pore groundwater samples were also different among the different hydrogeological conditions combining the detection frequency with concentration and detection we concluded that the aromatic hydrocarbon pollution gradually decreased along piedmont alluvial plain coast line this decrease was likely due to a decrease in aquifer vulnerability which were positively related with aquifer particles fig 9 moreover the detection frequency and concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons in the piedmont were much higher than those in the alluvial plain and coastal areas fig 9 the high aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in the piedmont were caused by the higher vulnerability of coarser aquifers chitsazan and akhtari 2009 jang et al 2017 miller et al 2014 along with the existence of large cities like beijing and shijiazhuang aromatic hydrocarbons with the high concentration likely resulted from the combined effects of municipal sewage and industrial wastewater the high vulnerability of aquifers in the piedmont made it easier for aromatic hydrocarbons to enter the groundwater fig 9 5 conclusions 1 aromatic hydrocarbons in karst groundwater had high detection frequency low concentration and low detections while those in pore groundwater had low detection frequency high concentration and high detections in karst groundwater btex was detected most frequently in pore groundwater alkyl substituted aromatics and halogenated aromatics were detected more frequently with higher concentrations 2 in karst groundwater the accumulative concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl substituted aromatics was negatively correlated with eh in pore groundwater the high accumulative concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons was often accompanied by high concentrations of so4 2 or cl 3 high detection frequency of btex in karst groundwater was caused by their rapid migration owing to well developed conduit system in karst areas when compared with karst groundwater the higher concentrations of alkyl substituted aromatics and halogenated aromatics in pore groundwater were caused by high intensity human activity 4 in karst groundwater aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were low owing to the low intensity human activity special hydrogeological conditions with high redox potential high do shorter residence time high dilution coefficient of karst groundwater and a unique composition of aromatic hydrocarbons in pore groundwater aromatic hydrocarbon pollution gradually decreased along the piedmont alluvial plain coast line this was due to decreased aquifer vulnerability which was positively related with aquifer particles
