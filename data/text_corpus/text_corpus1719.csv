8595,being bounded by hydrological inflow and barrier boundaries natural aquifers have regular irregular shapes here we consider aquifers bounded by segmental inflow variable head boundaries in which water is extracted injected by a multi well system steady state analytical and semi analytical solutions are derived to delineate the capture envelopes of the multi well system the multi well system includes any number of extraction or injection wells each with an arbitrary flow rate the aquifer is bounded by an arbitrary number of boundary segments with and without uniform regional flow the solution is fully analytical and involves hypergeometric functions if the number of boundary segments exceeds three a sensitivity analysis shows that number position and extraction injection rate of wells numbers and geometry of boundary segments distance between wells and boundaries and direction and rate of regional flow independently and collectively control the size shape and pattern of the

its water intaraprasong and zhan 2007 todd and mays 2005 as pumping proceeds the capture zone grows in size at steady state it reaches a maximum size called the capture envelope samani and zarei doudeji 2012 it is affected by pumping rates hydraulic conductivity type and configuration of boundaries and type and position of wells the delineation of the capture zone in an aquifer well stream system plays an important role in the management of surface and subsurface water in terms of both quality and quantity javandel and tsang 1986 presented a series of capture zone type curves as tools for the design of aquifer clean up projects zarei doudeji and samani 2014 provided capture type curves to design in situ groundwater remediation systems to contain contaminant plumes to evaluate surface groundwater interactions and to verify numerical models intaraprasong and zhan 2007 developed a semi analytical method to calculate the stream depletion in an aquifer bounded by two parallel streams with and without a streambed in assessing groundwater surface water interactions and estimating the stream depletion rate sdr due to pumping near a meandering stream huang and yeh 2015 applied the image well method and derived an analytical solution by treating a low permeability streambed as a robin condition they verified the solution with a finite element model and concluded that a meandering stream has a significant effect on sdr compared with a rectilinear geometry huang and yeh 2016 considered a heterogenous confined aquifer with an irregular outer boundary under dirichlet neumann or robin conditions or a mix of them and developed an analytical solution for drawdown efforts have also been devoted to quantify the capture time zhan and cao 2000 luo and kitanidis 2004 xia

muskat s solution for a single fully penetrating well in an infinite confined aquifer with uniform flow using complex velocity potential theory the approach was generalized to a multi well system in infinite confined and unconfined aquifers via the superposition principle christ and goltz 2002 grubb 1993 javandel et al 1984 javandel and tsang 1986 shan 1999 zhan and zlotnik 2002 zlotnik 1997 the conjugating image well method ferris et al 1962 with the complex velocity potential as the dependent variable and superposition led to modeling of capture zones in bounded aquifers analytical models that predict capture zones include the following cases single well near an inflow boundary strack 1989 asadi aghbolaghi et al 2011 2013 single well between two parallel streams intaraprasong and zhan

doudeji and samani 2014 and rectangular bounded aquifers zarei doudeji and samani 2018 conformal mapping is often used instead of the image well method to obtain solutions lu et al 2015 strack 1989 wilson 1993 since it handles complex boundary conditions irregularly shaped aquifers and multiple wells much more conveniently for complex situations semi analytical and numerical methods are needed e g the capture zone for partially penetrating wells considered by faybishenko et al 1995 in which the range kutta method was used zlotnik 1997 and fienen et al 2005 extended the work of faybishenko et al 1995 to the case of an anisotropic aquifer using a similar approach schafer 1996 determined the three dimensional capture zone around horizontal drains and vertical wells by a range kutta particle tracking algorithm the capture zone and optimal well spacing of two wells pumping at different flow rates was obtained by christ and goltz 2002 they applied the newton raphson method to determine the stagnation point positions a range of numerical methods were used for capture zone delineation under different circumstances for instance ahlfeld and sawyer 1990 described a methodology to determine capture zones for contaminated groundwater remediation they found well locations and optimal pumping rates under a minimum cost constraint using the finite element method with the optimization handled by a linear programming scheme bair and roadcap 1992 modelled the capture zones of wells in leaky confined fractured carbonate aquifers by particle tracking they used a finite difference scheme to solve their three dimensional steady state flow model in which they considered five model layers specified flux boundary conditions spatially variable recharge and recharge from a lake capture zones for wells in a stratified drift buried valley aquifer were computed by springer and bair 1992 gailey and gorelick 1993 produced contaminant capture designs under the constraint of minimized pumping rates using the sutra model voss 1984 tiedeman and gorelick 1993 investigated the uncertainty in optimum extraction rates with a monte carlo analysis the effects of variable density groundwater flow on capture zones were assessed by taylor and person 1998 using the finite element method a useful tool for numerical modeling of capture zones is modpath which uses the particle tracking method pollock 1994 the aim of this research is to obtain analytical semi analytical solutions for the capture envelope of a multi well system in aquifers limited by segmental inflow variable head boundaries the areal extent of the irregularly shaped aquifer is semi infinite or finite solved using complex velocity potentials and conformal mapping the aquifer system with or without regional groundwater flow includes any number of extraction injection wells this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the conceptual models of investigated aquifers section 3 presents a systematic mathematical formulation of the capture zone from simple to complicated boundary conditions in section 4 the proposed capture zone models are applied in hypothetical aquifer well boundary systems and results are discussed in section 5 the analytical solutions are validated numerically section 6 presents the application of solution in groundwater in situ remediation projects and finally in section 7 conclusions are summarized 2 conceptual model aquifers bounded by a stream s could have regular or irregular geometries fig 1 gives a schematic plan view of the aquifer well boundary systems considered in this paper the bounding stream can consist of up to n segments and can form finite semi infinite shaped aquifers in semi infinite cases aquifers extend to infinity on the unbounded sides in fig 1 the aquifer boundaries are fully penetrating streams variable head inflow boundaries that have no hydraulic resistance with the aquifer if the uniform regional flow is perpendicular to the inflow boundary the boundary may be regarded as a constant head boundary the aquifer is homogeneous and isotropic with uniform thickness the flow is two dimensional 2 d and steady a vertical well at z w fully penetrates the aquifer and is either an extraction or injection well although only one well is shown in fig 1 the solution derived below is valid for a multiple well system well field with or without ambient regional flow spatially uniform far from the well field with each well having the same or different extraction injection rates the wells can be located anywhere within the aquifer domain the simplest bounded aquifer is shown in fig 1a it is a semi infinite aquifer an inflow boundary stream a stream segment on one side it extends to infinity in the other sides two streams that intersect at angle α form a bounded wedge shaped aquifer fig 1b streams often meander in plains if the meander is idealized as a semi rectangle it forms a peninsula shaped aquifer that is bounded by three inflow boundary segments and extends to infinity on the fourth side fig 1c coastal aquifers may also be peninsula shaped in fig 1d the three stream segments intersect and form a triangular aquifer more often the number of boundary segments exceed three and form aquifers of finite or semi infinite extent examples are shown in fig 1e h 3 mathematical formulation of the multi well capture zones 3 1 case 1 aquifer bounded with one stream segment the aquifer of fig 1a is first considered that is limited in one side by an inflow boundary a stream or a segment of a stream extended to infinity in the other sides and extracted by a well using the image well method and due to the linearity of the laplace equation the complex discharge potential for such a system is written as strack

segments of an inflow boundary intersecting or connecting each other at an angle α and forming a wedge shaped aquifer the solutions of samani and zarei doudeji 2012 for wedge shaped aquifers are limited to the case of α being a multiple of π if α is too low the number of image wells becomes large making the solution cumbersome therefore the application of image well method is not recommended in this case a better approach is to map the model from the physical plane z onto a simpler plane ζ fig 2 based on the schwarz christoffel transformation driscoll and trefethen 2002 the origin of the

are used to plot a variety of capture zones the plotted capture zones delineate the interaction of aquifer well boundaries which are useful for the sustainable management of aquifers in terms of quality and quantity the effects of the numbers of boundaries or wells rate and direction of reginal flow and extraction rates on the shape and properties of capture zones are readily investigated due to numerous parameters number type location and extraction injection rates of wells and the rate and direction of regional flow number of boundary segments that influence the flow field many capture

rates and positions as given in table 2 we assume that the regional flow rate dimensionless and direction are 0 001 and π 2 rad respectively eqs 5 7 are solved and the equipotential lines streamlines stagnation points and the capture envelopes of the five wells are plotted in fig 6 in fig 6a the capture envelope of wells 2 3 and 5 establish a connection with the stream i e the wells are fed by the stream however wells 1 and 4 gain their water from the aquifer which is of infinite extent in this pumping scenario if the stream is polluted wells 2 3 and 5 will be contaminated in fig 6b well 3 is assumed to be a wastewater disposal well in this case the pattern of the capture envelopes is quite different from that of the first scenario and all extraction wells are contaminated by well 3 these two hypothetical scenarios elucidate the surface and subsurface water interaction in terms of water quality and quantity b capture zones of a multi wells system in a wedge shaped aquifer case 2 in this section a wedge shaped aquifer that is limited by two intersecting inflow boundaries or two segments of a stream is considered with the data given in table 3 eqs 17 19 are solved for four

regional flow rate and direction are 0 19 π rad 0 001 and 0 09 π rad respectively the well captures the regional flow and water gained from the streams in fig 7b which considers two pumping wells the angle between intersecting boundaries is 0 42 π rad there is no regional flow which causes the equipotential lines to be parallel to the boundaries a water line divide is formed between the wells which are fed by the streams the capture zone for three wells in a 90 wedge α π 2 with a regional flow direction of π 4 rad is illustrated in fig 7c well 1 captures its water from the western boundary independently well 2 receives water from the southern boundary well 3 however shows flow lines to the streams that encompass the capture envelopes of wells 1 and 2 fig 7d illustrates the capture zones of five wells in a 127 wedge shaped aquifer α 0 7 π without regional flow the interaction of the aquifer well boundary system is self explanatory in that well 1 is fed by the eastern stream wells 2 and 3 are fed by the both streams and wells 4 and 5 are supplied by the southern stream note that well 3 is also recharged by the infinite boundary c capture zones of a multi well system in a peninsula shaped aquifer case 3a here a peninsula shaped aquifer is considered capture zones for one two three and five wells are generated by solving eqs 28 30 based on the data given in table 4 a regional flow rate of 0 001 at an angle of π 4 is assumed therefore the potential along the boundaries is variable fig 8 a depicts the capture zone of a single well the well is fed by water from the inflow boundaries and the regional flow its capture zone covers over half of the aquifer fig 8b illustrates the capture zone of two extraction wells a water divide line is formed between the wells and acts as a barrier boundary for well 2 well 1 captures the regional flow and blocks flow to well 2 as the result well 2 gains water from the northern and southern streams so that the streamlines of well 2 that are close to the water divide become parallel to it in fig 8c where three extraction wells are operating a water divide forms and well 3 cannot receive water from the western boundary well 1 is fed from the southern and western boundaries and by capturing the regional flow it prevents any regional flow reaching wells 2 and 3 well 2 instead receives water from the three boundaries fig 8d shows the capture zones of five extraction wells two water divide lines are formed one between wells 4 and 5 and another between wells 3 and 4 well 3 is fed by three boundaries only whereas the others receive water from one or two boundaries the capture zone of well 4 separates those of wells 3 and 5 d capture zones of multi well system in triangular aquifers case 3b based on eqs 38 40 and data in table s1 the capture zones of three wells are plotted for the case of a triangular aquifer the angles of α 1 and α 2 are 0 37 π and 0 47 π respectively in fig s2 the case of regional flow of 0 001 at an angle of π 4 rad is considered therefore the potential along boundaries is variable fig s2 shows that well 1 is mainly supplied by the lower boundary and well 2 is fed by the three boundaries although the pumping rate of well 3 is higher than those of other wells it is not supplied by the boundary along the y axis but is fully fed by the stream segments in its vicinity a water divide line separates the capture envelope of well 3 from that of well 2 and the capture zone of well 2 surrounds that of well 1 in fig 9 a a semi infinite aquifer with three inflow boundary segments is examined five extraction wells are assumed as given in table 5 the direction of the regional flow is from east to west β π the capture envelopes are calculated based on eqs 38 40 except for well 1 the other wells are fed by the inflow boundary the effect of the regional flow direction is obvious and the capture envelopes trend to the east if well 1 were a wastewater disposal well then well 2 would be contaminated only due the low injection rate of well 1 and the direction of the regional flow fig 9b e capture zones of a multi wells system in a rectangular aquifer case 4a in fig s3 a rectangle aquifer with four wells is considered the well coordinates and rates are tabulated in table s1 and their capture zones are obtained by eqs 48 and 49 a regional flow of 0 001 at the direction of π 3 rad is considered therefore the potential along boundaries is variable in fig s3a the capture zone of well 1 trends in the direction opposite to the regional flow to reach the streams while well 2 is fed by three boundaries and its capture envelope encompasses that of well 1 the capture zone of well 3 is limited by the two water divides formed at the right and left sides of the well well 3 prevents regional flow reaching well 4 which is fed by the eastern and northern streams the aquifer of fig s3b is the same as that in fig s3a but wells 2 and 3 are injection wells well 1 is fed by wells 2 and 3 as a result if well 2 is a wastewater disposal well it would contaminate well 1 as well as the western southern and northern boundaries with the same assumption injection well 3 contaminates well 1 well 4 and the western southern and northern streams note that well 4 is fully supplied by well 3 and is no longer connected to the boundaries a closed loop flow is established between wells 3 and 4 which reflects the usefulness of the derived capture zone models for the entrapment of contaminant plumes that may be exist in the aquifer f capture zones of a multi well system in a finite or semi infinite aquifer bounded by five or more stream segments case 4b fig 10 examines the interaction of aquifer well boundary system in an irregularly shaped aquifers of semi infinite or finite extent in fig 10a a semi infinite aquifer bounded by eight stream segments is pumped by six wells the extraction rates and positions of the wells are given in table 6 the rate and direction of the uniform regional flow are 0 001 and π 4 respectively well 1 is supplied by regional flow and has no connection with the stream in contrast wells 2 and 3 are fed by the regional flow and by the first third and last stream segments respectively the stream fully supplies wells 5 and 6 the capture envelope of well 4 surrounds the capture envelope of well 2 well 4 is supplied along the three segments of the stream and along a narrow strip by the regional flow fig 10a is replotted as fig 10b by installing an injection well well 6 the pattern of capture zones changes and wells 3 4 5 and 7 are influenced by well 6 while there is no flow between well 6 and wells 1 and 2 although the extent and size of their capture envelopes are affected indirectly the so formed water divide separates the northern and southern portions of the aquifer fig 10c and d are plotted for a finite irregularly shaped aquifer island aquifer based on data given in table 7 the difference between fig 10c and d is that in the former case the three wells are extraction wells whereas in fig 10d well 1 is an injection well which recharges the other wells as the result of the injection well the capture zone pattern of fig 10d changes markedly compared to that of fig 10c 5 validation of the solution to validate the developed capture zone solutions the capture zones of fig 6a fig 7c and fig 9a were generated by modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 and modpath pollock 1994 and plotted in fig s4 the capture zones and the pattern of streamlines in fig s4 generated by the numerical models are comparable to the analytical model capture curves i e fig 6a 7c and 9a the slight difference is mainly due to the approximation inherent in the numerical models it is worth mentioning that the usage of the capture zones equations developed in this paper is far easier more accurate and less time consuming using the abovementioned numerical models although numerical models are more flexible in dealing with complicated boundary conditions fig s4 demonstrates the credibility of the developed analytical capture zone models and their potential to verify the accuracy of numerical models 6 groundwater remediation scheme design the above dimensionless capture zone solutions can be used to design groundwater remediation projects such a bioremediation pump and treat plume containment etc in such projects polluted groundwater is typically extracted using one or more wells treated and possibly reinjected the capture zone the optimal number of wells the optimal injection extraction rates and the layout of wells with respect to the plume are the main components of an efficient and cost effective design javandel and tsang 1986 zarei doudeji and samani 2018 nagheli et al 2020 as an example we consider a semi infinite aquifer bounded with three stream segments fig 1e the problem setup includes known dimensions and hydraulic properties as tabulated in table 7 a contaminant plume is located along the direction of regional groundwater flow from the east to the west β 0 the aim is to contain the plume hydraulically and prevent its extension downgradient using two or three wells a logical step is to position one or more extraction wells at the leading edge of the plume and to place an injection well to inject treated water in the vicinity of the contaminant source a solution could be determined manually by using eqs 38 40 to generate a set of capture envelopes for various well layouts and extraction injection rates this approach although cumbersome could achieve a satisfactory plume capture design here this practice was carried out by embedding eqs 38 40 within an optimization algorithm specifically the genetic algorithm as presented by nagheli et al 2020 the result is presented in fig 11 where a closed circulation loop is formed and the optimal plan is achieved i e the plume is contained and can be extracted without disturbing the flow regime of the aquifer the optimized well positions and extraction injection rates are given in table s2 another example is illustrated in fig s5 where a contaminant plume spreads in the direction of regional flow in a peninsula shaped aquifer in fig s5a a set of capture envelopes is plotted for various extraction rates using eqs 28 and 29 as can be seen the capture envelope for q d 0 005 fully encompasses the plume i e the well extracts the plume and prevents its spread in the aquifer however the capture envelope reaches the stream an improvement is the duplet well system of fig s5b which forms a closed water circulation loop that separates the plume from the rest of aquifer and so more efficiently captures the plume than the single well case presented in fig s5a 7 conclusion a systematic mathematical formulation for determination of well capture zones consists of the stream function discharge potential and stagnation points this work provides this formulation for any number of extraction injection wells in aquifers bounded by segmented inflow variable head boundaries with without uniform regional flow solutions are obtained based on the theory of complex discharge potentials and the conformal mapping method the solutions are provided for simple i e one stream segment to complicated boundary conditions i e n stream segments the areal extent of the aquifers is semi infinite or finite and can have regular or irregular shapes the solutions are provided in dimensionless form these solutions generalize existing solutions the one stream segment solution is similar to that of asadi aghbolaghi et al 2011 but our solution generalizes this to consider multiple injection extraction wells with regional flow in any direction the two stream segments solution i e wedge shaped aquifer in contrast to samani and zarei doudeji 2012 is simpler and independent of the wedge angle the three stream segments solution is more general and flexible in terms of the segment interception angles than the peninsula shaped aquifers considered by zarei doudeji and samani 2014 the triangular aquifers solution is similar to that of asadi aghbolaghi and seyyedian 2010 but our solution is valid for multiple wells in scalene triangular aquifers our rectangular shaped aquifer solution is independent of the number of wells in contrast to the single well solution of lu et al 2015 the solutions provided for regular and irregular polygonal shaped aquifers with any number of boundary segments have no comparable existing solutions the examples in figs 6 11 demonstrate that the size and pattern of the capture envelopes are controlled by the extraction injection rate distance of wells from the boundary segments distances between wells the rate and direction of regional flow and the initial head along the boundaries we suggest that the capture zone models presented here can be used as a screening tool for better insight into problems such as surface subsurface water interaction water rights

8595,being bounded by hydrological inflow and barrier boundaries natural aquifers have regular irregular shapes here we consider aquifers bounded by segmental inflow variable head boundaries in which water is extracted injected by a multi well system steady state analytical and semi analytical solutions are derived to delineate the capture envelopes of the multi well system the multi well system includes any number of extraction or injection wells each with an arbitrary flow rate the aquifer is bounded by an arbitrary number of boundary segments with and without uniform regional flow the solution is fully analytical and involves hypergeometric functions if the number of boundary segments exceeds three a sensitivity analysis shows that number position and extraction injection rate of wells numbers and geometry of boundary segments distance between wells and boundaries and direction and rate of regional flow independently and collectively control the size shape and pattern of the

its water intaraprasong and zhan 2007 todd and mays 2005 as pumping proceeds the capture zone grows in size at steady state it reaches a maximum size called the capture envelope samani and zarei doudeji 2012 it is affected by pumping rates hydraulic conductivity type and configuration of boundaries and type and position of wells the delineation of the capture zone in an aquifer well stream system plays an important role in the management of surface and subsurface water in terms of both quality and quantity javandel and tsang 1986 presented a series of capture zone type curves as tools for the design of aquifer clean up projects zarei doudeji and samani 2014 provided capture type curves to design in situ groundwater remediation systems to contain contaminant plumes to evaluate surface groundwater interactions and to verify numerical models intaraprasong and zhan 2007 developed a semi analytical method to calculate the stream depletion in an aquifer bounded by two parallel streams with and without a streambed in assessing groundwater surface water interactions and estimating the stream depletion rate sdr due to pumping near a meandering stream huang and yeh 2015 applied the image well method and derived an analytical solution by treating a low permeability streambed as a robin condition they verified the solution with a finite element model and concluded that a meandering stream has a significant effect on sdr compared with a rectilinear geometry huang and yeh 2016 considered a heterogenous confined aquifer with an irregular outer boundary under dirichlet neumann or robin conditions or a mix of them and developed an analytical solution for drawdown efforts have also been devoted to quantify the capture time zhan and cao 2000 luo and kitanidis 2004 xia et al 2020 capture zone modeling methods may be classified into three model types analytical semi analytical and numerical analytical modeling was initiated by muskat 1946 bear 1972 1979 extended muskat s solution for a single fully penetrating well in an infinite confined aquifer with uniform flow using complex velocity potential theory the approach was generalized to a multi well system in infinite confined and unconfined aquifers via the superposition principle christ and goltz 2002 grubb 1993 javandel et al 1984 javandel and tsang 1986 shan 1999 zhan and zlotnik 2002 zlotnik 1997 the conjugating image well method ferris et al 1962 with the complex velocity potential as the dependent variable and superposition led to modeling of capture zones in bounded aquifers analytical models that predict capture zones include the following cases single well near an inflow boundary strack 1989 asadi aghbolaghi et al 2011 2013 single well between two parallel streams intaraprasong and zhan

doudeji and samani 2014 and rectangular bounded aquifers zarei doudeji and samani 2018 conformal mapping is often used instead of the image well method to obtain solutions lu et al 2015 strack 1989 wilson 1993 since it handles complex boundary conditions irregularly shaped aquifers and multiple wells much more conveniently for complex situations semi analytical and numerical methods are needed e g the capture zone for partially penetrating wells considered by faybishenko et al 1995 in which the range kutta method was used zlotnik 1997 and fienen et al 2005 extended the work of faybishenko et al 1995 to the case of an anisotropic aquifer using a similar approach schafer 1996 determined the three dimensional capture zone around horizontal drains and vertical wells by a range kutta particle tracking algorithm the capture zone and optimal well spacing of two wells pumping at different flow rates was obtained by christ and goltz 2002 they applied the newton raphson method to determine the stagnation point positions a range of numerical methods were used for capture zone delineation under different circumstances for instance ahlfeld and sawyer 1990 described a methodology to determine capture zones for contaminated groundwater remediation they found well locations and optimal pumping rates under a minimum cost constraint using the finite element method with the optimization handled by a linear programming scheme bair and roadcap 1992 modelled the capture zones of wells in leaky confined fractured carbonate aquifers by particle tracking they used a finite difference scheme to solve their three dimensional steady state flow model in which they considered five model layers specified flux boundary conditions spatially variable recharge and recharge from a lake capture zones for wells in a stratified drift buried valley aquifer were computed by springer and bair 1992 gailey and gorelick 1993 produced contaminant capture designs under the constraint of minimized pumping rates using the sutra model voss 1984 tiedeman and gorelick 1993 investigated the uncertainty in optimum extraction rates with a monte carlo analysis the effects of variable density groundwater flow on capture zones were assessed by taylor and person 1998 using the finite element method a useful tool for numerical modeling of capture zones is modpath which uses the particle tracking method pollock 1994 the aim of this research is to obtain analytical semi analytical solutions for the capture envelope of a multi well system in aquifers limited by segmental inflow variable head boundaries the areal extent of the irregularly shaped aquifer is semi infinite or finite solved using complex velocity potentials and conformal mapping the aquifer system with or without regional groundwater flow includes any number of extraction injection wells this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the conceptual models of investigated aquifers section 3 presents a systematic mathematical formulation of the capture zone from simple to complicated boundary conditions in section 4 the proposed capture zone models are applied in hypothetical aquifer well boundary systems and results are discussed in section 5 the analytical solutions are validated numerically section 6 presents the application of solution in groundwater in situ remediation projects and finally in section 7 conclusions are summarized 2 conceptual model aquifers bounded by a stream s could have regular or irregular geometries fig 1 gives a schematic plan view of the aquifer well boundary systems considered in this paper the bounding stream can consist of up to n segments and can form finite semi infinite shaped aquifers in semi infinite cases aquifers extend to infinity on the unbounded sides in fig 1 the aquifer boundaries are fully penetrating streams variable head inflow boundaries that have no hydraulic resistance with the aquifer if the uniform regional flow is perpendicular to the inflow boundary the boundary may be regarded as a constant head boundary the aquifer is homogeneous and isotropic with uniform thickness the flow is two dimensional 2 d and steady a vertical well at z w fully penetrates the aquifer and is either an extraction or injection well although only one well is shown in fig 1 the solution derived below is valid for a multiple well system well field with or without ambient regional flow spatially uniform far from the well field with each well having the same or different extraction injection rates the wells can be located anywhere within the aquifer domain the simplest bounded aquifer is shown in fig 1a it is a semi infinite aquifer an inflow boundary stream a stream segment on one side it extends to infinity in the other sides two streams that intersect at angle α form a bounded wedge shaped aquifer fig 1b streams often meander in plains if the meander is idealized as a semi rectangle it forms a peninsula shaped aquifer that is bounded by three inflow boundary segments and extends to infinity on the fourth side fig 1c coastal aquifers may also be peninsula shaped in fig 1d the three stream segments intersect and form a triangular aquifer more often the number of boundary segments exceed three and form aquifers of finite or semi infinite extent examples are shown in fig 1e h 3 mathematical formulation of the multi well capture zones 3 1 case 1 aquifer bounded with one stream segment the aquifer of fig 1a is first considered that is limited in one side by an inflow boundary a stream or a segment of a stream extended to infinity in the other sides and extracted by a well using the image well method and due to the linearity of the laplace equation the complex discharge potential for such a system is written as strack

segments of an inflow boundary intersecting or connecting each other at an angle α and forming a wedge shaped aquifer the solutions of samani and zarei doudeji 2012 for wedge shaped aquifers are limited to the case of α being a multiple of π if α is too low the number of image wells becomes large making the solution cumbersome therefore the application of image well method is not recommended in this case a better approach is to map the model from the physical plane z onto a simpler plane ζ fig 2 based on the schwarz christoffel transformation driscoll and trefethen 2002 the origin of the x y axes is located at point 2 in the ζ plane the ξ axis is the horizontal axis and the η axis is perpendicular to it at point 2 based on the schwarz christoffel transformation the relation between z

1c e are surrounded by three inflow variable head boundary segments to derive the capture zone equations the aquifers are transformed from the z plane to the upper half ζ plane fig 3 using the schwarz christoffel transformation after transformation the coordinates of points 1 3 in the ζ plane are ζ 1 ζ 2 1 and ζ 3 0 the schwarz christoffel transformation for these aquifers is 20 z ζ c 1 ζ 1 α 1 π 1

aquifers bounded with four or more stream segments the number of boundary segments for the rectangular polygonal shaped aquifers of fig 1f h is greater than three while the aquifers may have finite or

ln ζ δ j ζ δ j where q 0 ζ is the regional flow which is a function in the ζ plane that depends on the shape of the aquifer to rewrite eq 52 in the z plane it is solved numerically based on eq 41 the real and imaginary parts of the complex potential eq 52 in the z plane are the discharge potential and stream function respectively they are plotted using dimensionless parameters given in eq 3 to

saturated thickness varies eqs 3 15 26 36 47 and 52 maybe rewritten to give an approximation for unconfined aquifers by replacing the thickness b with h 0 the average saturated thickness in the dimensionless terms the derived discharge potential equations can also be rewritten in terms of drawdown supplementary materials 4 results and discussion in the following the above presented solutions are used to plot a variety of capture zones the plotted capture zones delineate the interaction of aquifer well boundaries which are useful for the sustainable management of aquifers in terms of quality and quantity the effects of the numbers of boundaries or wells rate and direction of reginal flow and extraction rates on the shape and properties of capture zones are readily investigated due to numerous parameters number type location and extraction injection rates of wells and the rate and direction of regional flow number of boundary segments that influence the flow field many capture envelopes can be simulated a capture zones of a multi wells system in a semi infinite aquifer case 1 the semi infinite aquifer shown in fig 1a is considered for the case of five wells with extraction rates and positions as given in table 2 we assume that the regional flow rate dimensionless and direction are 0 001 and π 2 rad respectively eqs 5 7 are solved and the equipotential lines streamlines stagnation points and the capture envelopes of the five wells are plotted in fig 6 in fig 6a the capture envelope of wells 2 3 and 5 establish a connection with the stream i e the wells are fed by the stream however wells 1 and 4 gain their water from the aquifer which is of infinite extent in this pumping scenario if the stream is polluted wells 2 3 and 5 will be contaminated in fig 6b well 3 is assumed to be a wastewater disposal well in this case the pattern of the capture envelopes is quite different from that of the first scenario and all extraction wells are contaminated by well 3 these two hypothetical scenarios elucidate the surface and subsurface water interaction in terms of water quality and quantity b capture zones of a multi wells system in a wedge shaped aquifer case 2 in this section a wedge shaped aquifer that is limited by two intersecting inflow boundaries or two segments of a stream is considered with the data given in table 3 eqs 17 19 are solved for four different scenarios which are plotted in fig 7 fig 7 illustrates the potential streamline stagnation points and capture envelopes for one two three and five wells in fig 7a the wedge angle and regional flow rate and direction are 0 19 π rad 0 001 and 0 09 π rad respectively the well captures the regional flow and water gained from the streams in fig 7b which considers two pumping wells the angle between intersecting boundaries is 0 42 π rad there is no regional flow which causes the equipotential lines to be parallel to the boundaries a water line divide is formed between the wells which are fed by the streams the capture zone for three wells in a 90 wedge α π 2 with a regional flow direction of π 4 rad is illustrated in fig 7c well 1 captures its water from the western boundary independently well 2 receives water from the southern boundary well 3 however shows flow lines to the streams that encompass the capture envelopes of wells 1 and 2 fig 7d illustrates the capture zones of five wells in a 127 wedge shaped aquifer α 0 7 π without regional flow the interaction of the aquifer well boundary system is self explanatory in that well 1 is fed by the eastern stream wells 2 and 3 are fed by the both streams and wells 4 and 5 are supplied by the southern stream note that well 3 is also recharged by the infinite boundary c capture zones of a multi well system in a peninsula shaped aquifer case 3a here a peninsula shaped aquifer is considered capture zones for one two three and five wells are generated by solving eqs 28 30 based on the data given in table 4 a regional flow rate of 0 001 at an angle of π 4 is assumed therefore the potential along the boundaries is variable fig 8 a depicts the capture zone of a single well the well is fed by water from the inflow boundaries and the regional flow its capture zone covers over half of the aquifer fig 8b illustrates the capture zone of two extraction wells a water divide line is formed between the wells and acts as a barrier boundary for well 2 well 1 captures the regional flow and blocks flow to well 2 as the result well 2 gains water from the northern and southern streams so that the streamlines of well 2 that are close to the water divide become parallel to it in fig 8c where three extraction wells are operating a water divide forms and well 3 cannot receive water from the western boundary well 1 is fed from the southern and western boundaries and by capturing the regional flow it prevents any regional flow reaching wells 2 and 3 well 2 instead receives water from the three boundaries fig 8d shows the capture zones of five extraction wells two water divide lines are formed one between wells 4 and 5 and another between wells 3 and 4 well 3 is fed by three boundaries only whereas the others receive water from one or two boundaries the capture zone of well 4 separates those of wells 3 and 5 d capture zones of multi well system in triangular aquifers case 3b based on eqs 38 40 and data in table s1 the capture zones of three wells are plotted for the case of a triangular aquifer the angles of α 1 and α 2 are 0 37 π and 0 47 π respectively in fig s2 the case of regional flow of 0 001 at an angle of π 4 rad is considered therefore the potential along boundaries is variable fig s2 shows that well 1 is mainly supplied by the lower boundary and well 2 is fed by the three boundaries although the pumping rate of well 3 is higher than those of other wells it is not supplied by the boundary along the y axis but is fully fed by the stream segments in its vicinity a water divide line separates the capture envelope of well 3 from that of well 2 and the capture zone of well 2 surrounds that of well 1 in fig 9 a a semi infinite aquifer with three inflow boundary segments is examined five extraction wells are assumed as given in table 5 the direction of the regional flow is from east to west β π the capture envelopes are calculated based on eqs 38 40 except for well 1 the other wells are fed by the inflow boundary the effect of the regional flow direction is obvious and the capture envelopes trend to the east if well 1 were a wastewater disposal well then well 2 would be contaminated only due the low injection rate of well 1 and the direction of the regional flow fig 9b e capture zones of a multi wells system in a rectangular aquifer case 4a in fig s3 a rectangle aquifer with four wells is considered the well coordinates and rates are tabulated in table s1 and their capture zones are obtained by eqs 48 and 49 a regional flow of 0 001 at the direction of π 3 rad is considered therefore the potential along boundaries is variable in fig s3a the capture zone of well 1 trends in the direction opposite to the regional flow to reach the streams while well 2 is fed by three boundaries and its capture envelope encompasses that of well 1 the capture zone of well 3 is limited by the two water divides formed at the right and left sides of the well well 3 prevents regional flow reaching well 4 which is fed by the eastern and northern streams the aquifer of fig s3b is the same as that in fig s3a but wells 2 and 3 are injection wells well 1 is fed by wells 2 and 3 as a result if well 2 is a wastewater disposal well it would contaminate well 1 as well as the western southern and northern boundaries with the same assumption injection well 3 contaminates well 1 well 4 and the western southern and northern streams note that well 4 is fully supplied by well 3 and is no longer connected to the boundaries a closed loop flow is established between wells 3 and 4 which reflects the usefulness of the derived capture zone models for the entrapment of contaminant plumes that may be exist in the aquifer f capture zones of a multi well system in a finite or semi infinite aquifer bounded by five or more stream segments case 4b fig 10 examines the interaction of aquifer well boundary system in an irregularly shaped aquifers of semi infinite or finite extent in fig 10a a semi infinite aquifer bounded by eight stream segments is pumped by six wells the extraction rates and positions of the wells are given in table 6 the rate and direction of the uniform regional flow are 0 001 and π 4 respectively well 1 is supplied by regional flow and has no connection with the stream in contrast wells 2 and 3 are fed by the regional flow and by the first third and last stream segments respectively the stream fully supplies wells 5 and 6 the capture envelope of well 4 surrounds the capture envelope of well 2 well 4 is supplied along the three segments of the stream and along a narrow strip by the regional flow fig 10a is replotted as fig 10b by installing an injection well well 6 the pattern of capture zones changes and wells 3 4 5 and 7 are influenced by well 6 while there is no flow between well 6 and wells 1 and 2 although the extent and size of their capture envelopes are affected indirectly the so formed water divide separates the northern and southern portions of the aquifer fig 10c and d are plotted for a finite irregularly shaped aquifer island aquifer based on data given in table 7 the difference between fig 10c and d is that in the former case the three wells are extraction wells whereas in fig 10d well 1 is an injection well which recharges the other wells as the result of the injection well the capture zone pattern of fig 10d changes markedly compared to that of fig 10c 5 validation of the solution to validate the developed capture zone solutions the capture zones of fig 6a fig 7c and fig 9a were generated by modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 and modpath pollock 1994 and plotted in fig s4 the capture zones and the pattern of streamlines in fig s4 generated by the numerical models are comparable to the analytical model capture curves i e fig 6a 7c and 9a the slight difference is mainly due to the approximation inherent in the numerical models it is worth mentioning that the usage of the capture zones equations developed in this paper is far easier more accurate and less time consuming using the abovementioned numerical models although numerical models are more flexible in dealing with complicated boundary conditions fig s4 demonstrates the credibility of the developed analytical capture zone models and their potential to verify the accuracy of numerical models 6 groundwater remediation scheme design the above dimensionless capture zone solutions can be used to design groundwater remediation projects such a bioremediation pump and treat plume containment etc in such projects polluted groundwater is typically extracted using one or more wells treated and possibly reinjected the capture zone the optimal number of wells the optimal injection extraction rates and the layout of wells with respect to the plume are the main components of an efficient and cost effective design javandel and tsang 1986 zarei doudeji and samani 2018 nagheli et al 2020 as an example we consider a semi infinite aquifer bounded with three stream segments fig 1e the problem setup includes known dimensions and hydraulic properties as tabulated in table 7 a contaminant plume is located along the direction of regional groundwater flow from the east to the west β 0 the aim is to contain the plume hydraulically and prevent its extension downgradient using two or three wells a logical step is to position one or more extraction wells at the leading edge of the plume and to place an injection well to inject treated water in the vicinity of the contaminant source a solution could be determined manually by using eqs 38 40 to generate a set of capture envelopes for various well layouts and extraction injection rates this approach although cumbersome could achieve a satisfactory plume capture design here this practice was carried out by embedding eqs 38 40 within an optimization algorithm specifically the genetic algorithm as presented by nagheli et al 2020 the result is presented in fig 11 where a closed circulation loop is formed and the optimal plan is achieved i e the plume is contained and can be extracted without disturbing the flow regime of the aquifer the optimized well positions and extraction injection rates are given in table s2 another example is illustrated in fig s5 where a contaminant plume spreads in the direction of regional flow in a peninsula shaped aquifer in fig s5a a set of capture envelopes is plotted for various extraction rates using eqs 28 and 29 as can be seen the capture envelope for q d 0 005 fully encompasses the plume i e the well extracts the plume and prevents its spread in the aquifer however the capture envelope reaches the stream an improvement is the duplet well system of fig s5b which forms a closed water circulation loop that separates the plume from the rest of aquifer and so more efficiently captures the plume than the single well case presented in fig s5a 7 conclusion a systematic mathematical formulation for determination of well capture zones consists of the stream function discharge potential and stagnation points this work provides this formulation for any number of extraction injection wells in aquifers bounded by segmented inflow variable head boundaries with without uniform regional flow solutions are obtained based on the theory of complex discharge potentials and the conformal mapping method the solutions are provided for simple i e one stream segment to complicated boundary conditions i e n stream segments the areal extent of the aquifers is semi infinite or finite and can have regular or irregular shapes the solutions are provided in dimensionless form these solutions generalize existing solutions the one stream segment solution is similar to that of asadi aghbolaghi et al 2011 but our solution generalizes this to consider multiple injection extraction wells with regional flow in any direction the two stream segments solution i e wedge shaped aquifer in contrast to samani and zarei doudeji 2012 is simpler and independent of the wedge angle the three stream segments solution is more general and flexible in terms of the segment interception angles than the peninsula shaped aquifers considered by zarei doudeji and samani 2014 the triangular aquifers solution is similar to that of asadi aghbolaghi and seyyedian 2010 but our solution is valid for multiple wells in scalene triangular aquifers our rectangular shaped aquifer solution is independent of the number of wells in contrast to the single well solution of lu et al 2015 the solutions provided for regular and irregular polygonal shaped aquifers with any number of boundary segments have no comparable existing solutions the examples in figs 6 11 demonstrate that the size and pattern of the capture envelopes are controlled by the extraction injection rate distance of wells from the boundary segments distances between wells the rate and direction of regional flow and the initial head along the boundaries we suggest that the capture zone models presented here can be used as a screening tool for better insight into problems such as surface subsurface water interaction water rights

8596,mass balance models using stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen provide useful estimates of the water balance of lakes particularly in the absence of instrumental data however isotopic mass balances are rarely compared directly to measured water fluxes here we compared instrumental and isotope based determinations of water fluxes in seven connected lakes over 12 years to quantify how agreement between the two approaches is affected by lake type and its position in the landscape overall lake specific ratios of evaporation to inflow e i from instrumental measurements median x 0 06 median absolute deviation mad 0 06 agreed well with isotopic estimates using headwater models x 0 14 mad 0 08 with the exception of one lake with limited channelized inflow of surface waters x instrumental 0 51 vs x headwater 0 24 isotope instrument agreement improved x 0 09 vs x 0 03 when basin specific best fit isotope models also considered local connectivity to upstream water bodies comparison among years revealed that mean isotopic e i values were lowest in 2011 mean μ 0 06 standard deviation σ 0 09 during a 1 in 140 year spring flood and highest during a relatively arid year 2003 μ 0 22 σ 0 19 while interannual variability in e i generally increased with distance downstream along the mainstem of the watershed similar patterns of agreement between methods were recorded for water residence time isotope models also documented the expected low water yield from lake catchments μ 36 2 mm yr 1 σ 62 3 suggesting that isotope models based on late summer samples integrate annual inputs from various sources that are difficult to measure with conventional methods overall the strong positive agreement between methods confirms that water isotopes can provide substantial insights into landscape patterns of lake hydrology even in ungauged systems keywords water isotopes mass balance e i residence time water yield long term monitoring 1 introduction quantification of hydrological processes that regulate the water balance of lakes is essential to both evaluate ecosystem vulnerability to climate change and sustain the health of surface water in the face anthropogenic development barnett et al 2005 estimates of inflow i and evaporative losses e from surface waters are especially important in dry regions such as the canadian prairies where water availability is already challenged by industrial extraction and global warming during the past century sauchyn et al 2016 schindler and donahue 2006 in addition as un gauged basins predominate in the global landscape other tools are needed to estimate how basin hydrology may respond to climatic and human pressures and to develop effective strategies for freshwater management kirchner 2006 wood et al 2011 for example only 12 of the canadian landscape is monitored by a hydrometric network with sufficient instrumentation to evaluate climate vulnerability coulibaly et al 2013 yet much of the nation s landmass high latitudes prairies is sensitive to future changes in regional water balance pachauri et al 2014 sauchyn et al 2016 analysis of stable isotopes of hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o

gibson et al 2010 2017 in particular analysis of δ2h and δ18o has been used to compare hydrology among lakes at spatial scales ranging from individual watersheds cui et al 2017 kang et al 2017 mackinnon et al 2016 to regional macdonald et al 2017 narancic et al 2017a turner et al 2014 and continental scales brooks et al 2014 despite increasing use relatively little is known of how the performance of isotope based approaches may vary on multi annual timescales in comparison to other methods gibson et al 1996 gibson and reid 2014 longinelli et al 2008 tyler et al 2007 in principle isotope derived estimates of water balance e i and associated parameters can also be used to better understand how catchment characteristics regulate the movement of water and solutes into lakes for example total runoff volume and catchment water yield depth equivalent runoff estimated from water isotopes have been used to quantify the influx of nutrients elmarami et al 2016 gibson et al 2016 and acids bennett et al 2008 gibson et al 2010 similarly the relationship between isotopic e i and landscape cover has been used to assess the relative sensitivity of aquatic ecosystems to salinization mackinnon et al 2016 pham et al 2009 and desiccation turner et al 2014 2010 due to summer evaporation however in most cases relationships between catchment and surface water bodies have been studied in ungauged systems with no measure of surface inflow to constrain isotopic estimates of water balance those studies that incorporate dual measurements largely focus on short term or survey based analyses in the most comprehensive comparison gibson et al 1998 observed a general agreement between isotopic and instrumental methods of calculating evaporation over 6 years of monitoring bennett et al 2008 found that isotope and instrumental analyses collected in the fall provided similar estimates of annual catchment water yield for 49 lakes in moderate sized drainage basins although isotopic values were lower and more variable than instrumental estimates of the water survey of canada wsc similarly comparison of groundwater flow derived from water isotopes with that based on measured flow sacks et al 2014 222rn content arnoux et al 2017a b or solute mass balances krabbenhoft et al 1990 confirms that isotope analyses can be used to quantify discrete water sources but also suggests that isotope models perform better when constrained with instrumental data in general theoretical uncertainty in e i derived from isotopic mass balance determinations has been estimated at 20 with errors mainly arising from uncertainty in isotope values of surface inflow waters humidity and atmospheric moisture cui et al 2017 jones et al 2016 wolfe et al 2007 to our knowledge there have been no comparisons of isotope derived hydrological parameters with instrumental data exceeding a decade in length in this study we analyzed water isotope compositions collected over 12 years from seven inter connected lakes to quantify the degree of agreement between isotopic and instrumental measures of lake hydrology including e i water residence time and catchment water yield our initial models were based on late summer samples alone and treated all lakes as headwater systems i e an unknown degree of connection as is commonly done in regional surveys e g brooks et al 2014 pham et al 2009 turner et al 2014 parameter estimates from headwater models were also compared with those derived from basin specific best fit models that were informed by an understanding of upstream basin hydrology by comparing instrumental and isotope based models over a series of lakes that span a range in morphological and hydrological properties we sought to identify the conditions under which isotope mass balance models and continuous monitoring of water fluxes provided comparable estimates of lentic hydrology in addition this study provides an additional method for assessing the effects of climate change on freshwaters in the canadian prairies 2 study area and data collection 2 1 site description the qu appelle river drainage basin covers 52 000 km2 of sub humid agricultural cropland and

study lakes during 2003 2014 surface water samples were also collected from 2006 to 2014 for this study isotope mass balance models used only the final depth integrated sample taken in late august as late summer samples are thought to most closely represent isotopic steady state result in more accurate estimations of annual water balance cui et al 2018 yi et al 2008 and are commonly used in lake surveys bennett et al 2008 gibson and edwards 2002 pham et al 2009 following collection samples were filtered through a cellulose filter nominal pore size 0 45 μm and stored in tightly sealed amber

wassenaar 2015 3 2 drainage basin area drainage areas were estimated for each lake with the exception of lake diefenbaker to allow for calculation of water yield for lake diefenbaker a drainage area was not calculated and instead we used the gross and effective drainage basin areas of north et al 2015 for the remaining sites a standard operating procedure was developed to identify gross and sink free drainage basin areas sfda using archydro esri v2 1 and the canadian digital elevation model cdem v1 1 we used sfda in place of the less easily defined effective drainage area martin et al 1983 base resolution of the cdem tiles is 0 75 arc seconds and each tile was converted to a plane coordinate projection 20 m resolution at the time of extraction we modified the esri terrain pre processing workflow uc4 esri 2013 to identify sfda by a filling any sink with an area 3700 m2 i e 32 dem tiles b burning lakes into the dem c fencing lakes that had no topographic lip at the outlet and d omitting stream segmentation sinks 32 dem cells and associated basins were thus excluded from the delineation of the sfda gross drainage basin area gda was delineated using the same workflow but after having filled all upstream sinks except the lake itself both sfda and gda were crosschecked with watercourses in the canvec 2016 reference product for blatant mismatches between adjacent watersheds at a scale of 1 50 000 3 3 statistical analysis an ancova like generalized additive model gam was used to compare measures of water balance e i from instrumental and isotopic methods in this gam lake and measured water balance were the main effects and the model included terms for their interaction as well as a random effect to control for between year differences use of the gam accounted for the non constant variance and the non normal gamma underlying data distribution by accounting for the underlying pattern in time series we were better able to assess the agreement between models similar gams were also used to assess the relationship between meteorological parameters and isotopic measures of water balance as well as the relationship between isotope inferred and instrumentally measured inflow all calculations were completed in r core team 2018 using the mgcv package wood 2011 wood et al 2016 4 theory 4 1 isotope mass balance to put lake water isotope samples into a regional perspective we compared values to a local meteoric water line lmwl derived from data collected in saskatoon saskatchewan 1990 2010 iaea wmo 2019 and calculated using the precipitation amount weighted least squares regression technique hughes and crawford 2012 in addition lmwl data were compared to three years of precipitation samples collected directly at wascana lake by the university of regina 2013 2016 despite a 250 km separation no practical difference was found in isotopic values of local precipitation at saskatoon and regina so the decadal scale saskatoon data were used for all subsequent calculations a local theoretical evaporative line lel was established to visualize the projected evolution of lake water isotopes in this region moving from the weighted mean isotopic value for local precipitation to a state of evaporative enrichment here the theoretical lel was estimated by linear regression of isotopic values of weighted mean precipitation weighted by precipitation amount δp the theoretical isotopic composition of lake waters in a closed basin at steady state δss and the theoretical maximum limiting isotopic enrichment δ δp was calculated using the data from saskatoon while δss and δ were calculated annually for each study lake from local meteorological data see full calculations in supplementary 1 eqs 1 7 although the theoretical lel is helpful for visual purposes previous hydrological studies in this region suggest that export of precipitation off the catchment to lakes is highly variable seasonally fang et al 2007 pomeroy et al 2007 and therefore would not necessarily intercept the lmwl at δp water balance for each lake was calculated using meteorological data precipitation temperature flux weighted evaporation and flux weighted relative humidity basin characteristics lake area watershed area lake volume and isotopic values of water sources including lake water inflow and local precipitation calculations followed conventional isotopic methods reviewed in gibson et al 2016 briefly water balance of a lake at hydrologic steady state can be calculated as 1 i q e a n d 2 i δ i q δ q e δ e where i q and e are the volumes of lake inflow outflow and evaporation in m3 and their respective isotopic values δi δq and δe as here isotopic values of outflow are assumed to be the same as that of the lake water δq δl although changes in lake volume occurred in all systems during the spring freshet lake volume varies little during the remainder of the ice free season because of the through flow hydrological settings of the lakes late summer samples were used in this study to minimize departures from steady state as suggested by yi et al 2008 and demonstrated in other mass balance studies gao et al 2018 turner et al 2014 supplementary fig 2 δe values were calculated using the craig and gordon 1965 model as shown in supplementary 1 eq 8 using this estimate evaporation to inflow ratios e i can be calculated by rearrangement of eq 2 as 3 x e i δ i δ l δ e δ l to solve the water balance inflow must also be estimated from key sources including precipitation p runoff r and upstream flow j and solved as 4 i p r j similar to the basic mass balance of eq 3 eq 4 can be expanded to include the isotopic signatures of each source as 5 δ i p δ p r δ r j δ j p r j where δi δp δr and δj are the isotopic composition of inflow amount weighted precipitation runoff and upstream source waters all we have assumed that δr δp gibson and reid 2014 4 2 model selection for δi in many surveys of lakes the isotopic value of inflow δi is unknown and must be approximated using one of three models depending on data availability first in the absence of data on the volume and isotopic composition of inflow investigators often model lakes as if each site were a headwater system using the coupled isotope tracer method citm yi et al 2008 second in cases where lakes receive inflow that may have been subject to evaporation previously in upstream water bodies δi is adjusted for the volume and isotopic composition of inflow flow aided to avoid over estimation up to 30 of evaporative losses gibson and reid 2014 third in instances where the citm produces unrealistic values alternative headwater models can be used to account for isotopic enrichment along a lake specific local evaporation line ls lel this study uses the citm of yi et al 2008 as the initial model for all sites because of its ability to calculate δi on a sample by sample basis this method uses the δe calculated annually by lake supplemental 1 eq 8 and δl of each sample to create a sample specific line and approximates δi from the intersection of the sample specific line and the lmwl due to the intersection with the lmwl this method assumes that input waters are of meteoric origin and have undergone limited evaporation when sufficient data were available lakes receiving input from upstream water bodies were also modeled using a flow aided calculation that incorporates the measured isotopic value of inflow water to constrain δi values this flow aided model assumed negligible groundwater inputs and that runoff was at isotopic steady state with δp but that surface inflow was subject to some evaporation in upstream water bodies in an effort to not overestimate evaporation in the lake of interest here flow aided δi was calculated as 6 δ i j δ j δ l e δ p δ e e δ l δ p j δ l δ p e δ e e δ l j δ j j δ p finally when the citm produced values that were inconsistent with the hydrological setting of the lake δi was calculated using the ls lel method in which the intercept between the linear regression of all δl values for that lake and the lmwl was used to approximate δi gibson et al 1993 wolfe et al 2007 this method is advantageous for lakes with many unmeasured inflow sources including groundwater and in situations where the isotopic values of inflow may be different from that of the amount weighted average precipitation of the region however while the ls lel model allows for groundwater influx the method fails to consider the effects of inter annual variability in input waters disregards the convention that regional lakes should converge to a common δ and can return unrealistic values for δi in instances where evaporation is not significant i e δl values vary parallel to the lmwl therefore is only suggested when the citm does not produce realistic values in this study mass balances were calculated using δi from the citm for all lakes additional models were calculated in instances where the hydrological setting indicated that upstream flow may be important for example the flow aided method was used for pasqua katepwa and crooked lakes where adequate upstream flow and isotopic values were available but not for lakes diefenbaker buffalo pound and wascana where inflow data were more limited finally the ls lel model was calculated for all lakes but used only for last mountain lake because the site was known to have elevated solute levels due to evaporative concentration leavitt et al 2006 and because δi calculated using the citm suggested summer precipitation was the sole water source a result which was inconsistent with regional water models and management practices fang et al 2007 pomeroy et al 2007 in the ls lel calculation δi for last mountain lake was 15 7 for δ18o a value that is similar to that of local groundwater 16 4 jasechko et al 2017 higher than spring runoff 22 3 but lower than that of long term precipitation δp 14 9 records from saskatoon sk supplementary fig 3 for the remainder of this paper will use the term best fit to describe the isotope model that was most appropriate for the study lake δi including citm diefenbaker buffalo pound wascana flow aided pasqua katepwa crooked and ls lel model last mountain table 2 4 3 calculation of water residence time and catchment water yield water residence time years and catchment water yield mm yr 1 were calculated for each lake at an annual time step specifically water residence time τ was calculated from isotopic values of inflow lakewater and evaporation as well as lake volume v and the measured annual evaporation e meyers method see section 2 3 as 7 τ δ i δ l δ e δ l v e the annual water yield wy was calculated by distributing the isotopically inferred inflow across the catchment area and not including precipitation directly into the lake resulting in a depth equivalent precipitation deposited into the lake from the catchment m3 to calculate the isotopically inferred inflow the annual depth equivalent evaporation e off the surface of the lake mm m 2 x as water balance e i calculated in eq 3 and p as the annual precipitation directly on the lake surface were required as follows 8 wy e x p wa 100 5 results 5 1 lake specific variability in isotopes the inter annual variability in lake water isotope δl values differed among study lakes with most points falling along a trajectory intermediate to the lmwl and the theoretical lel fig 3 inter annual variability was smallest in the lakes with the largest lake volumes specifically lake diefenbaker δ2h range 10 6 δ18o 1 9 and peripheral subsaline last mountain lake δ2h range 12 8 δ18o 2 7 both of these large lakes exhibited a narrow range in lakewater isotope values in contrast the smallest lake wascana lake displayed the largest variability δ2h range 32 1 δ18o 4 2 spatial variability was also apparent when comparing among lakes as upstream sites diefenbaker buffalo pound consistently displaying lower δl values relative to downstream lakes although sites did not follow a sequential change completely consistent with their landscape position in general downstream sites were positioned more closely to the theoretical lel suggesting that evaporation played a larger role in annual water balance of downstream lakes at most sites the variation in lake water isotope values lay parallel to the lmwl suggesting that evaporation played a relatively minor role in the overall water budget with the exception of last mountain lake in last mountain lake isotopic values were positioned between the lmwl and the theoretical lel suggesting a system more influenced by evaporation fig 3 lake diefenbaker clustered directly along the lmwl a pattern that suggests minimal evaporation and which is consistent with its management as a multipurpose reservoir with fast flushing rates comparison of surface and depth integrated δl values revealed little difference in isotopic values and suggested that all study sites were well mixed fig 3b consequently integrated samples were used for subsequent analyses and could be used as an accurate representation of δl without underestimating evaporation a paired t test revealed no statistically significant difference between sampling methods p 0 24 df 62 5 2 water isotope mass balance water mass balance as e i estimated using the citm confirmed the known hydrological setting of lakes within the qu appelle catchement and suggested that lakes were flow through ecosystems low e i except for last mountain e i 0 27 0 56 where flow was more restricted fig 4 in general mean e i values were lowest in 2011 μ 0 06 σ 0 09 and 2014 μ 0 08 σ 0 11 and highest in 2003 μ 0 22 σ 0 20 fig 5 similarly inter annual variability in water balance was lowest for headwater lake diefenbaker e i σ 0 02 and was generally greater in downstream lakes fig 4 these results are consistent with initial inferences based on the isotopic framework presented in fig 3 with lakes lying primarily along the lmwl exhibiting low importance of evaporation to their water balance 5 3 comparison of gauge data and citm models comparison of e i based on instrumental blue and citm yellow showed a wide range of agreement between approaches fig 4 across years and lakes citm estimated a median e i of 0 14 mad 0 08 a value that was similar to the values calculated from instrumental data x 0 06 mad 0 06 similarly the relationship between e i derived from isotope models and instrumental data was strong as indicated by the gam using lake as a random effect which explained 77 of deviance in e i values when the year specific trend is accounted for three of the seven sites diefenbaker buffalo pound last mountain had slopes where the 95 confidence interval did not overlap with zero suggesting a positive and significant relationship between isotopic and instrumental models table 3 relationships between e i methods table 3 were closest to 1 in buffalo pound β 1 34 95 confidence interval 0 02 2 7 and weakest in wascana β 0 07 0 95 to 1 1 overall agreement between isotopic headwater and instrumental models was poorest in last mountain lake the site with the longest residence time and the greatest variability in e i among years figs 4 5 tables 1 3 a landscape gradient in e i values was also observed with large upstream lakes diefenbaker buffalo pound last mountain exhibiting lower isotope inferred measurements than did instrumental data fig 5 in contrast isotopic estimates for downstream sites pasqua katepwa crooked were uniformly higher than instrumental values figs 4b 5 in general variation in isotopically derived e i was similar or less than that derived from direct measurements of qu appelle river inflow spatial and temporal patterns for determinations of water residence time τ were similar to those recorded for e i ratios fig 6 specifically the residence time of downstream lakes pasqua katepwa crooked was 1 6 years longer when calculated using the citm in comparison to those derived from instrumental data whereas isotope derived residence time was 0 2 years shorter than measured estimates in upstream diefenbaker and buffalo pound lakes citm values agreed best with instrumental data for shallow buffalo pound and wascana lakes with a median difference of 0 15 year fig 6 supplementary fig 4 isotopically derived τ differed substantially from measured values for the two lakes with the longest residence times although the citm underestimated residence time relative to gauge data in last mountain lake by 4 0 yrs and overestimated residence time for katepwa lake by 2 3 yrs although not assessed directly here the importance of seasonality in isotope values was unlikely a source of the disparity between methods see haig 2019 instead seasonal variability was greatest in lakes where method agreement was lowest and residence times were less than one year e g buffalo pound and wascana lakes 5 4 comparison of water balance with instrumental data and best fit isotopic models agreement between isotopic and instrumental estimates of hydrological parameters was generally improved by use of best fit isotopic models see table 2 for best fit models for example median instrument and isotope derived estimates of e i and residence time differed by only 0 03 and 0 5 years respectively over all lakes and years when ls lel last mountain lake and flow aided pasqua katepwa crooked isotope models were used in place of the citm figs 4 6 the relationship between e i derived from isotope best fit models and instrumental data was also well modeled by a gam using lake as a random effect deviance explained 83 4 as well a gam of e i values derived from best fit isotopic models and measured precipitation balance precipitation minus evaporation exhibited high 74 8 explained deviance table 3 5 5 water yield mean water yield was less than total annual precipitation for all lakes and most years except 2011 suggesting that most 90 watershed precipitation did not enter the study lakes fig 7 mean water yield calculated using the gross drainage area for each lake μ 36 2 mm yr 1 σ 62 3 x 15 6 mad 18 8 was more than the swsa predicted mean value for the entire qu appelle river basin 21 mm yr 1 whereas calculations using the effective or sfda resulted in higher yields μ 1899 mm yr 1 σ 6021 4 x 490 8 mad 457 1 water yields calculated using gross drainage areas were highest for the headwater reservoir lake diefenbaker whereas values were near zero for wascana lake and down stream sites pasqua katepwa crooked yields were generally higher in 2011 gda μ 143 4 mm yr 1 σ 161 3 x 73 9 mad 81 9 than in other years fig 7a except in buffalo pound lake consistent with the 1 in 140 year flood for lakes downstream of regina during spring of that year brimelow et al 2014 wheater and gober 2013 lowest water yields were observed in 2004 gda μ 17 1 mm yr 1 σ 21 2 x 6 7 mad 7 2 a year with below average annual precipitation figs 2 7a and were an order of magnitude lower than those recorded during 2011 5 6 instrumental data and best fit isotopic inflow comparison gams examining the relationship between instrumental and isotope inferred inflow explained most of the deviance 97 1 with lake as a random effect fig 8 when the relationship between inflow calculated using best fit models and instrumental data was compared on the log log scale a linear relationship was observed slope 1 1 for the entire basin fig 8h this gam demonstrated the linearity between methods for diefenbaker fig 8a buffalo pound fig 8b last mountain fig 8c and pasqua lakes fig 8e and non linear relationships in wascana fig 8d katepwa fig 8f and crooked lakes fig 8g all relationships between inflow methods were significant at 99 confidence interval with the exception of last mountain lake fig 8c 6 discussion comparison of isotopic mass balances and instrumental data suggests that δ2h and δ18o of late summer water samples can characterize basic hydrology of lakes specifically median values of isotopically and instrumentally derived determinations of e i and water residence time differed by only 0 09 mad 0 06 and 0 9 years mad 1 0 respectively across a 100 fold range in lake morphologies figs 4 6 table 1 such agreement suggests that standard protocols headwater models one late summer sample have the potential to provide robust and important insights into lake hydrology in unmonitored surface waters gao et al 2018 gibson et al 2016 pham et al 2009 as well these agreements can be improved to within 0 03 median for e i through the use of best fit models that incorporate only a modest amount of information on upstream ecosystems or in lake evaporation instrumental and isotope inferred inflow also have a strong positive relationships fig 8 confirming that isotopes are a valid method for estimating flow in ungauged systems finally consistent with regional models and monitoring coles et al 2017 coles and mcdonnell 2018 fang et al 2007 shook and pomeroy 2012 isotope based estimates of water yield indicate that very little overland non channelized flow occurs in non flood years and that years of high yield may be critical in sustaining lake ecosystems in this large sub humid continental region 6 1 comparison of isotopic and instruments estimates of water balance the capability of δ2h and δ18o analyses to quantify the water balance of managed lakes was demonstrated by the strong agreement between isotopic and instrumental estimates of e i particularly based on best fit models elsewhere the uncertainty associated with isotopic water balance in lakes exhibiting higher evaporation has been estimated wolfe et al 2007 although this variation can increase when a headwater isotope method is applied to lakes fig 4 where inflow may have undergone prior evaporation in upstream water bodies gibson and reid 2014 here we find that e i using the citm x 0 14 mad 0 08 agreed with instrumental values x 0 06 mad 0 06 at the scale of the entire qu appelle river catchment as seen elsewhere gibson et al 2017 wolfe et al 2007 yi et al 2008 however we also found that this agreement could be increased substantially by using isotope models which incorporate only a modest amount of data on either upstream isotopic values or the importance of in lake evaporation gibson and reid 2014 median difference between individual instrumental and best fit models 0 03 vs instrumental and headwater 0 09 in general this additional information can be obtained by simple analysis of surface flow patterns and differences in concentrations of chemically conservative solutes e g cl among adjacent basins estimates of water residence time based on best fit isotope models were similar to those derived from continuous annual monitoring programs across the qu appelle river drainage basin table 1 residence time strongly affects chemical content biological properties and ecosystem function of lakes romo et al 2013 schindler 2006 tranvik et al 2009 and is one of the most commonly estimated outputs of isotopic mass balance calculations balasubramaniam et al 2015 brooks et al 2014 gibson et al 2016 2015 narancic et al 2017a here we show that water residence time can be approximated for a variety of open drainage lakes using isotopic methods based solely on a single late summer sample a critical observation for application of the method to ungauged ecosystems as lake vulnerability to short term meteorological variability declines with increasing residence time adrian et al 2009 the broad application of isotopic models in lake surveys will allow investigators to develop regional maps of surface water sensitivity to future climate change macdonald et al 2017 turner et al 2010 agreement between isotopic and instrumental estimates of e i and residence time was influenced by lake position in the hydrological landscape figs 4 5 specifically higher e i values and longer residence times were calculated for downstream katepwa and crooked lakes with citm ls lel and best fit flow aided isotope methods relative to instrumental monitoring research elsewhere shows that such patterns can arise if isotope models do not account for enrichment of 2h and 18o via evaporation from inflowing waters gibson and reid 2014 in downstream sites pasqua katepwa crooked evaporatively enriched waters from last mountain have a variable impact on the isotopic values of inflow although our best fit models should account for such upstream isotopic enrichment the persistent elevation of e i and residence time in downstream lakes suggests that additional factors affect the agreement between instrumental and isotopic determinations although speculative we suggest that monitoring programs may have overestimated the importance of channelized inflow to downstream qu appelle lakes consistent with the tendency for wrmm models to overestimate river flow during periods of high precipitation bender 2012 in support of our hypothesis we note that e i and residence time of upstream lakes diefenbaker buffalo pound would be expected to exhibit few effects of upstream evaporation and that all sites had isotopically derived values lower than those from monitoring data variation in agreement between isotope and instrumental derived estimates of e i and residence time may also reflect the high degree of hydrological management in the qu appelle river drainage basin saskatchewan water security agency 2012 for example the overall relationship between e i values and precipitation amount mm evaporation mm and precipitation balance was weak possibly reflecting the use of control structures on the outlet of most lakes table 3 management in the basin includes urban agricultural and industrial extractions that are elevated in lake diefenbaker and buffalo pound both of which are operated as multipurpose reservoirs north et al 2015 pasqua lake directly receives wastewater from both moose jaw pop 45 000 and regina pop 220 000 which sustains river flow independent of runoff and therefore is unlikely to react to changes in local meteorological variability in addition the lack of basin wide response to reduced precipitation in 2007 09 indicates that augmenting flows from upstream reservoirs may be capable to preventing hydrologic stress in downstream systems further research is needed to determine whether the inconsistencies between methods of assessing basin specific hydrology metrics reflects management or monitoring issues or is part of a larger pattern related to lake position in the landscape gibson and reid 2014 and above in this regard a survey of regional lakes not subject to manipulation or hydrologically closed basins may be helpful e g pham et al 2009 6 2 isotopic estimates of water yield inflow in open basin lakes analysis of water isotopes can be used to estimate water yield for individual lake catchments as isotope mass balances integrate factors known to control runoff at the hillslope and catchment scale bennett et al 2008 gibson et al 2017 2015 2010 field research shows that runoff is greatest in years when snow accumulation is large and melt occurs quickly over frozen water saturated soils coles et al 2017 coles and mcdonnell 2018 pomeroy et al 2007 in this study isotope mass balance approaches accurately captured the low water yield of all lakes as well as the effects of a 1 in 140 spring flood fig 7 supplementary fig 1 particularly in lakes diefenbaker last mountain wascana katepwa and crooked this pattern suggests that these later lakes are more likely to receive elevated inputs from their local catchment during flood periods peak water yield was not detected in buffalo pound and pasqua lake during the period of flooding although water yields were above average at both sites in 2011 the ability of water isotopes to detect temporal and spatial differences in water yield during a large scale flood emphasizes the capability of these techniques to integrate catchment scale features that control the contribution of local precipitation within a single region in general isotope based estimates of catchment water yields were consistent with the knowledge that reservoirs exhibit higher yields than natural lakes in a given catchment hayes et al 2017 consistent with this expectation the two headwater reservoirs diefenbaker and buffalo pound routinely experienced elevated and variable water yields when calculated with either gda μ 85 2 mm yr 1 σ 83 2 x 64 0 mad 18 8 or sfda μ 655 0 mm yr 1 σ 511 8 x 794 0 mad 836 0 fig 7 in contrast water yields from other lake basins were similar to the 21 mm yr 1 estimated from instrumental data at the outflow of the qu appelle valley during 1977 1997 bender 2012 and spatial analysis of expected water yield from 1971 to 2000 bemrose et al 2009 the low water yield was also consistent with studies in other agrcultural catchments cerdan et al 2004 the finding of low water yield is consistent with the paradigm for the sub humid prairies that most runoff is collected by channelized tributaries except during the spring freshet coles et al 2017 fang et al 2007 pomeroy et al 2007 however at present it is unclear whether the higher water yield in the sites to the west reflects decadal scale variation in contributions from the catchment or merely the presence of reservoirs in the headwater region the strong positive relationship between instrumental and isotope estimates of inflow fig 8 provides critical evidence needed to demonstrate that water isotopes can be used to quantitatively estimate inflow to ungauged surface waterbodies this result is consistent with the conclusions of gibson and reid 2014 who compared isotopic and instrumental estimates of inflow over a five year period however unlike that study we found evidence that the relationship between instrumental and isotope values can differ among sites and may be non linear in some instances non linear relations between precipitation and runoff have been observed earlier for the canadian prairies coles et al 2017 and may reflect variation in soil infiltration of precipitation depending on landuse and antecedent climate conditions precipiation freezing etc the lack of statistically significant relationship at last mountain lake fig 8c likely reflects the comparatively low degree of instrumentation in this large lake basin or perhaps a high relative importance of unchannelized inflow nonetheless the strong overall relation between observed and isotope inferred inflow suggests that the isotopic approach is capable of capturing the main variation in inflow channelized overland groundwater to lakes that are poorly instrumented further research in other well studied basins with larger ranges in water balance as well as surveys of lakes on a sub continental landscape scale will help further refine this powerful hydrological technique 7 conclusions and future implications lakes in this study spanned a wide range of morphology hydrological settings and human influence and can be used as a model drainage system to evaluate the use of isotope mass balances to estimate the hydrology of open lakes with only isotopic values of a single late summer water sample and minimal upstream flow data lake specific

8596,mass balance models using stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen provide useful estimates of the water balance of lakes particularly in the absence of instrumental data however isotopic mass balances are rarely compared directly to measured water fluxes here we compared instrumental and isotope based determinations of water fluxes in seven connected lakes over 12 years to quantify how agreement between the two approaches is affected by lake type and its position in the landscape overall lake specific ratios of evaporation to inflow e i from instrumental measurements median x 0 06

water residence time isotope models also documented the expected low water yield from lake catchments μ 36 2 mm yr 1 σ 62 3 suggesting that isotope models based on late summer samples integrate annual inputs from various sources that are difficult to measure with conventional methods overall the strong positive agreement between methods confirms that water isotopes can provide substantial insights into landscape patterns of lake hydrology even in ungauged systems keywords water isotopes mass balance e i residence time water yield long term monitoring 1 introduction quantification of hydrological processes that regulate the water balance of lakes is essential to both evaluate ecosystem vulnerability to climate change and sustain the health of surface water in the face anthropogenic development barnett et al 2005 estimates of inflow i and evaporative losses e from surface waters are especially important in dry regions such as the canadian prairies where water availability is already challenged by industrial extraction and global warming during the past century sauchyn et al 2016 schindler and donahue 2006 in addition as un gauged basins predominate in the global landscape other tools are needed to estimate how basin hydrology may respond to climatic and human pressures and to develop effective strategies for freshwater management kirchner 2006 wood et al 2011 for example only 12 of the canadian landscape is monitored by a hydrometric network with sufficient instrumentation to evaluate climate vulnerability coulibaly et al 2013 yet much of the nation s landmass high latitudes prairies is sensitive to future changes in regional water balance pachauri et al 2014 sauchyn et al 2016 analysis of stable isotopes of hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o

gibson et al 2010 2017 in particular analysis of δ2h and δ18o has been used to compare hydrology among lakes at spatial scales ranging from individual watersheds cui et al 2017 kang et al 2017 mackinnon et al 2016 to regional macdonald et al 2017 narancic et al 2017a turner et al 2014 and continental scales brooks et al 2014 despite increasing use relatively little is known of how the performance of isotope based approaches may vary on multi annual timescales in comparison to other methods gibson et al 1996 gibson and reid 2014 longinelli et al 2008 tyler et al 2007 in principle isotope derived estimates of water balance e i and associated parameters can also be used to better understand how catchment characteristics regulate the movement of water and solutes into lakes for example total runoff volume and catchment water yield depth equivalent runoff estimated from water isotopes have been used to quantify the influx of nutrients elmarami et al 2016 gibson et al 2016 and acids bennett et al 2008 gibson et al 2010 similarly the relationship between isotopic e i and landscape cover has been used to assess the relative sensitivity of aquatic ecosystems to salinization mackinnon et al 2016 pham et al 2009 and desiccation turner et al 2014 2010 due to summer evaporation however in most cases relationships between catchment and surface water bodies have been studied in ungauged systems with no measure of surface inflow to constrain isotopic estimates of water balance those studies that incorporate dual measurements largely focus on short term or survey based analyses in the most comprehensive comparison gibson et al 1998 observed a general agreement between isotopic and instrumental methods of calculating evaporation over 6 years of monitoring bennett et al 2008 found that isotope and instrumental analyses collected in the fall provided similar estimates of annual catchment water yield for 49 lakes in moderate sized drainage basins although isotopic values were lower and more variable than instrumental estimates of the water survey of canada wsc similarly comparison of groundwater flow derived from water isotopes with that based on measured flow sacks et al 2014 222rn content arnoux et al 2017a b or solute mass balances krabbenhoft et al 1990 confirms that isotope analyses can be used to quantify discrete water sources but also suggests that isotope models perform better when constrained with instrumental data in general theoretical uncertainty in e i derived from isotopic mass balance determinations has been estimated at 20 with errors mainly arising from uncertainty in isotope values of surface inflow waters humidity and atmospheric moisture cui et al 2017 jones et al 2016 wolfe et al 2007 to our knowledge there have been no comparisons of isotope derived hydrological parameters with instrumental data exceeding a decade in length in this study we analyzed water isotope compositions collected over 12 years from seven inter connected lakes to quantify the degree of agreement between isotopic and instrumental measures of lake hydrology including e i water residence time and catchment water yield our initial models were based on late summer samples alone and treated all lakes as headwater systems i e an unknown degree of connection as is commonly done in regional surveys e g brooks et al 2014 pham et al 2009 turner et al 2014 parameter estimates from headwater models were also compared with those derived from basin specific best fit models that were informed by an understanding of upstream basin hydrology by comparing instrumental and isotope based models over a series of lakes that span a range in morphological and hydrological properties we sought to identify the conditions under which isotope mass balance models and continuous monitoring of water fluxes provided comparable estimates of lentic hydrology in addition this study provides an additional method for assessing the effects of climate change on freshwaters in the canadian prairies 2 study area and data collection 2 1 site description the qu appelle river drainage basin covers 52 000 km2 of sub humid agricultural cropland and

study lakes during 2003 2014 surface water samples were also collected from 2006 to 2014 for this study isotope mass balance models used only the final depth integrated sample taken in late august as late summer samples are thought to most closely represent isotopic steady state result in more accurate estimations of annual water balance cui et al 2018 yi et al 2008 and are commonly used in lake surveys bennett et al 2008 gibson and edwards 2002 pham et al 2009 following collection samples were filtered through a cellulose filter nominal pore size 0 45 μm and stored in tightly sealed amber

wassenaar 2015 3 2 drainage basin area drainage areas were estimated for each lake with the exception of lake diefenbaker to allow for calculation of water yield for lake diefenbaker a drainage area was not calculated and instead we used the gross and effective drainage basin areas of north et al 2015 for the remaining sites a standard operating procedure was developed to identify gross and sink free drainage basin areas sfda using archydro esri v2 1 and the canadian digital elevation model cdem v1 1 we used sfda in place of the less easily defined effective drainage area martin et al 1983 base resolution of the cdem tiles is 0 75 arc seconds and each tile was converted to a plane coordinate projection 20 m resolution at the time of extraction we modified the esri terrain pre processing workflow uc4 esri 2013 to identify sfda by a filling any sink with an area 3700 m2 i e 32 dem tiles b burning lakes into the dem c fencing lakes that had no topographic lip at the outlet and d omitting stream segmentation sinks 32 dem cells and associated basins were thus excluded from the delineation of the sfda gross drainage basin area gda was delineated using the same workflow but after having filled all upstream sinks except the lake itself both sfda and gda were crosschecked with watercourses in the canvec 2016 reference product for blatant mismatches between adjacent watersheds at a scale of 1 50 000 3 3 statistical analysis an ancova like generalized additive model gam was used to compare measures of water balance e i from instrumental and isotopic methods in this gam lake and measured water balance were the main effects and the model included terms for their interaction as well as a random effect to control for between year differences use of the gam accounted for the non constant variance and the non normal gamma underlying data distribution by accounting for the underlying pattern in time series we were better able to assess the agreement between models similar gams were also used to assess the relationship between meteorological parameters and isotopic measures of water balance as well as the relationship between isotope inferred and instrumentally measured inflow all calculations were completed in r core team 2018 using the mgcv package wood 2011 wood et al 2016 4 theory 4 1 isotope mass balance to put lake water isotope samples into a regional perspective we compared values to a local meteoric water line lmwl derived from data collected in saskatoon saskatchewan 1990 2010 iaea wmo 2019 and calculated using the precipitation amount weighted least squares regression technique hughes and crawford 2012 in addition lmwl data were compared to three years of precipitation samples collected directly at wascana lake by the university of regina 2013 2016 despite a 250 km separation no practical difference was found in isotopic values of local precipitation at saskatoon and regina so the decadal scale saskatoon data were used for all subsequent calculations a local theoretical evaporative line lel was established to visualize the projected evolution of lake water isotopes in this region moving from the weighted mean isotopic value for local precipitation to a state of evaporative enrichment here the theoretical lel was estimated by linear regression of isotopic values of weighted mean precipitation weighted by precipitation amount δp the theoretical isotopic composition of lake waters in a closed basin at steady state δss and the theoretical maximum limiting isotopic enrichment δ δp was calculated using the data from saskatoon while δss and δ were calculated annually for each study lake from local meteorological data see full calculations in supplementary 1 eqs 1 7 although the theoretical lel is helpful for visual purposes previous hydrological studies in this region suggest that export of precipitation off the catchment to lakes is highly variable seasonally fang et al 2007 pomeroy et al 2007 and therefore would not necessarily intercept the lmwl at δp water balance for each lake was calculated using meteorological data precipitation temperature flux weighted evaporation and flux weighted relative humidity basin characteristics lake area watershed area lake volume and isotopic values of water sources including lake water inflow and local precipitation calculations followed conventional isotopic methods reviewed in gibson et al 2016 briefly water balance of a lake at hydrologic steady state can be calculated as 1 i q e a n d 2 i δ i q δ q e δ e where i q and e are the volumes of lake inflow outflow and evaporation in m3 and their respective isotopic values δi δq and δe as here isotopic values of outflow are assumed to be the same as that of the lake water δq δl although changes in lake volume occurred in all systems during the spring freshet lake volume varies little during the remainder of the ice free season because of the through flow hydrological settings of the lakes late summer samples were used in this study to minimize departures from steady state as suggested by yi et al 2008 and demonstrated in other mass balance studies gao et al 2018 turner et al 2014 supplementary fig 2 δe values were calculated using the craig and gordon 1965 model as shown in supplementary 1 eq 8 using this estimate evaporation to inflow ratios e i can be calculated by rearrangement of eq 2 as 3 x e i δ i δ l δ e δ l to solve the water balance inflow must also be estimated from key sources including precipitation p runoff r and upstream flow j and solved as 4 i p r j similar to the basic mass balance of eq 3 eq 4 can be expanded to include the isotopic signatures of each source as 5 δ i p δ p r δ r j δ j p r j where δi δp δr and δj are the isotopic composition of inflow amount weighted precipitation runoff and upstream source waters all we have assumed that δr δp gibson and reid 2014 4 2 model selection for δi in many surveys of lakes the isotopic value of inflow δi is unknown and must be approximated using one of three models depending on data availability first in the absence of data on the volume and isotopic composition of inflow investigators often model lakes as if each site were a headwater system using the coupled isotope tracer method citm yi et al 2008 second in cases where lakes receive inflow that may have been subject to evaporation previously in upstream water bodies δi is adjusted for the volume and isotopic composition of inflow flow aided to avoid over estimation up to 30 of evaporative losses gibson and reid 2014 third in instances where the citm produces unrealistic values alternative headwater models can be used to account for isotopic enrichment along a lake specific local evaporation line ls lel this study uses the citm of yi et al 2008 as the initial model for all sites because of its ability to calculate δi on a sample by sample basis this method uses the δe calculated annually by lake supplemental 1 eq 8 and δl of each sample to create a sample specific line and approximates δi from the intersection of the sample specific line and the lmwl due to the intersection with the lmwl this method assumes that input waters are of meteoric origin and have undergone limited evaporation when sufficient data were available lakes receiving input from upstream water bodies were also modeled using a flow aided calculation that incorporates the measured isotopic value of inflow water to constrain δi values this flow aided model assumed negligible groundwater inputs and that runoff was at isotopic steady state with δp but that surface inflow was subject to some evaporation in upstream water bodies in an effort to not overestimate evaporation in the lake of interest here flow aided δi was calculated as 6 δ i j δ j δ l e δ p δ e e δ l δ p j δ l δ p e δ e e δ l j δ j j δ p finally when the citm produced values that were inconsistent with the hydrological setting of the lake δi was calculated using the ls lel method in which the intercept between the linear regression of all δl values for that lake and the lmwl was used to approximate δi gibson et al 1993 wolfe et al 2007 this method is advantageous for lakes with many unmeasured inflow sources including groundwater and in situations where the isotopic values of inflow may be different from that of the amount weighted average precipitation of the region however while the ls lel model allows for groundwater influx the method fails to consider the effects of inter annual variability in input waters disregards the convention that regional lakes should converge to a common δ and can return unrealistic values for δi in instances where evaporation is not significant i e δl values vary parallel to the lmwl therefore is only suggested when the citm does not produce realistic values in this study mass balances were calculated using δi from the citm for all lakes additional models were calculated in instances where the hydrological setting indicated that upstream flow may be important for example the flow aided method was used for pasqua katepwa and crooked lakes where adequate upstream flow and isotopic values were available but not for lakes diefenbaker buffalo pound and wascana where inflow data were more limited finally the ls lel model was calculated for all lakes but used only for last mountain lake because the site was known to have elevated solute levels due to evaporative concentration leavitt et al 2006 and because δi calculated using the citm suggested summer precipitation was the sole water source a result which was inconsistent with regional water models and management practices fang et al 2007 pomeroy et al 2007 in the ls lel calculation δi for last mountain lake was 15 7 for δ18o a value that is similar to that of local groundwater 16 4 jasechko et al 2017 higher than spring runoff 22 3 but lower than that of long term precipitation δp 14 9 records from saskatoon sk supplementary fig 3 for the remainder of this paper will use the term best fit to describe the isotope model that was most appropriate for the study lake δi including citm diefenbaker buffalo pound wascana flow aided pasqua katepwa crooked and ls lel model last mountain table 2 4 3 calculation of water residence time and catchment water yield water residence time years and catchment water yield mm yr 1 were calculated for each lake at an annual time step specifically water residence time τ was calculated from isotopic values of inflow lakewater and evaporation as well as lake volume v and the measured annual evaporation e meyers method see section 2 3 as 7 τ δ i δ l δ e δ l v e the annual water yield wy was calculated by distributing the isotopically inferred inflow across the catchment area and not including precipitation directly into the lake resulting in a depth equivalent precipitation deposited into the lake from the catchment m3 to calculate the isotopically inferred inflow the annual depth equivalent evaporation e off the surface of the lake mm m 2 x as water balance e i calculated in eq 3 and p as the annual precipitation directly on the lake surface were required as follows 8 wy e x p wa 100 5 results 5 1 lake specific variability in isotopes the inter annual variability in lake water isotope δl values differed among study lakes with most points falling along a trajectory intermediate to the lmwl and the theoretical lel fig 3 inter annual variability was smallest in the lakes with the largest lake volumes specifically lake diefenbaker δ2h range 10 6 δ18o 1 9 and peripheral subsaline last mountain lake δ2h range 12 8 δ18o 2 7 both of these large lakes exhibited a narrow range in lakewater isotope values in contrast the smallest lake wascana lake displayed the largest variability δ2h range 32 1 δ18o 4 2 spatial variability was also apparent when comparing among lakes as upstream sites diefenbaker buffalo pound consistently displaying lower δl values relative to downstream lakes although sites did not follow a sequential change completely consistent with their landscape position in general downstream sites were positioned more closely to the theoretical lel suggesting that evaporation played a larger role in annual water balance of downstream lakes at most sites the variation in lake water isotope values lay parallel to the lmwl suggesting that evaporation played a relatively minor role in the overall water budget with the exception of last mountain lake in last mountain lake isotopic values were positioned between the lmwl and the theoretical lel suggesting a system more influenced by evaporation fig 3 lake diefenbaker clustered directly along the lmwl a pattern that suggests minimal evaporation and which is consistent with its management as a multipurpose reservoir with fast flushing rates comparison of surface and depth integrated δl values revealed little difference in isotopic values and suggested that all study sites were well mixed fig 3b consequently integrated samples were used for subsequent analyses and could be used as an accurate representation of δl without underestimating evaporation a paired t test revealed no statistically significant difference between sampling methods p 0 24 df 62 5 2 water isotope mass balance water mass balance as e i estimated using the citm confirmed the known hydrological setting of lakes within the qu appelle catchement and suggested that lakes were flow through ecosystems low e i except for last mountain e i 0 27 0 56 where flow was more restricted fig 4 in general mean e i values were lowest in 2011 μ 0 06 σ 0 09 and 2014 μ 0 08 σ 0 11 and highest in 2003 μ 0 22 σ 0 20 fig 5 similarly inter annual variability in water balance was lowest for headwater lake diefenbaker e i σ 0 02 and was generally greater in downstream lakes fig 4 these results are consistent with initial inferences based on the isotopic framework presented in fig 3 with lakes lying primarily along the lmwl exhibiting low importance of evaporation to their water balance 5 3 comparison of gauge data and citm models comparison of e i based on instrumental blue and citm yellow showed a wide range of agreement between approaches fig 4 across years and lakes citm estimated a median e i of 0 14 mad 0 08 a value that was similar to the values calculated from instrumental data x 0 06 mad 0 06 similarly the relationship between e i derived from isotope models and instrumental data was strong as indicated by the gam using lake as a random effect which explained 77 of deviance in e i values when the year specific trend is accounted for three of the seven sites diefenbaker buffalo pound last mountain had slopes where the 95 confidence interval did not overlap with zero suggesting a positive and significant relationship between isotopic and instrumental models table 3 relationships between e i methods table 3 were closest to 1 in buffalo pound β 1 34 95 confidence interval 0 02 2 7 and weakest in wascana β 0 07 0 95 to 1 1 overall agreement between isotopic headwater and instrumental models was poorest in last mountain lake the site with the longest residence time and the greatest variability in e i among years figs 4 5 tables 1 3 a landscape gradient in e i values was also observed with large upstream lakes diefenbaker buffalo pound last mountain exhibiting lower isotope inferred measurements than did instrumental data fig 5 in contrast isotopic estimates for downstream sites pasqua katepwa crooked were uniformly higher than instrumental values figs 4b 5 in general variation in isotopically derived e i was similar or less than that derived from direct measurements of qu appelle river inflow spatial and temporal patterns for determinations of water residence time τ were similar to those recorded for e i ratios fig 6 specifically the residence time of downstream lakes pasqua katepwa crooked was 1 6 years longer when calculated using the citm in comparison to those derived from instrumental data whereas isotope derived residence time was 0 2 years shorter than measured estimates in upstream diefenbaker and buffalo pound lakes citm values agreed best with instrumental data for shallow buffalo pound and wascana lakes with a median difference of 0 15 year fig 6 supplementary fig 4 isotopically derived τ differed substantially from measured values for the two lakes with the longest residence times although the citm underestimated residence time relative to gauge data in last mountain lake by 4 0 yrs and overestimated residence time for katepwa lake by 2 3 yrs although not assessed directly here the importance of seasonality in isotope values was unlikely a source of the disparity between methods see haig 2019 instead seasonal variability was greatest in lakes where method agreement was lowest and residence times were less than one year e g buffalo pound and wascana lakes 5 4 comparison of water balance with instrumental data and best fit isotopic models agreement between isotopic and instrumental estimates of hydrological parameters was generally improved by use of best fit isotopic models see table 2 for best fit models for example median instrument and isotope derived estimates of e i and residence time differed by only 0 03 and 0 5 years respectively over all lakes and years when ls lel last mountain lake and flow aided pasqua katepwa crooked isotope models were used in place of the citm figs 4 6 the relationship between e i derived from isotope best fit models and instrumental data was also well modeled by a gam using lake as a random effect deviance explained 83 4 as well a gam of e i values derived from best fit isotopic models and measured precipitation balance precipitation minus evaporation exhibited high 74 8 explained deviance table 3 5 5 water yield mean water yield was less than total annual precipitation for all lakes and most years except 2011 suggesting that most 90 watershed precipitation did not enter the study lakes fig 7 mean water yield calculated using the gross drainage area for each lake μ 36 2 mm yr 1 σ 62 3 x 15 6 mad 18 8 was more than the swsa predicted mean value for the entire qu appelle river basin 21 mm yr 1 whereas calculations using the effective or sfda resulted in higher yields μ 1899 mm yr 1 σ 6021 4 x 490 8 mad 457 1 water yields calculated using gross drainage areas were highest for the headwater reservoir lake diefenbaker whereas values were near zero for wascana lake and down stream sites pasqua katepwa crooked yields were generally higher in 2011 gda μ 143 4 mm yr 1 σ 161 3 x 73 9 mad 81 9 than in other years fig 7a except in buffalo pound lake consistent with the 1 in 140 year flood for lakes downstream of regina during spring of that year brimelow et al 2014 wheater and gober 2013 lowest water yields were observed in 2004 gda μ 17 1 mm yr 1 σ 21 2 x 6 7 mad 7 2 a year with below average annual precipitation figs 2 7a and were an order of magnitude lower than those recorded during 2011 5 6 instrumental data and best fit isotopic inflow comparison gams examining the relationship between instrumental and isotope inferred inflow explained most of the deviance 97 1 with lake as a random effect fig 8 when the relationship between inflow calculated using best fit models and instrumental data was compared on the log log scale a linear relationship was observed slope 1 1 for the entire basin fig 8h this gam demonstrated the linearity between methods for diefenbaker fig 8a buffalo pound fig 8b last mountain fig 8c and pasqua lakes fig 8e and non linear relationships in wascana fig 8d katepwa fig 8f and crooked lakes fig 8g all relationships between inflow methods were significant at 99 confidence interval with the exception of last mountain lake fig 8c 6 discussion comparison of isotopic mass balances and instrumental data suggests that δ2h and δ18o of late summer water samples can characterize basic hydrology of lakes specifically median values of isotopically and instrumentally derived determinations of e i and water residence time differed by only 0 09 mad 0 06 and 0 9 years mad 1 0 respectively across a 100 fold range in lake morphologies figs 4 6 table 1 such agreement suggests that standard protocols headwater models one late summer sample have the potential to provide robust and important insights into lake hydrology in unmonitored surface waters gao et al 2018 gibson et al 2016 pham et al 2009 as well these agreements can be improved to within 0 03 median for e i through the use of best fit models that incorporate only a modest amount of information on upstream ecosystems or in lake evaporation instrumental and isotope inferred inflow also have a strong positive relationships fig 8 confirming that isotopes are a valid method for estimating flow in ungauged systems finally consistent with regional models and monitoring coles et al 2017 coles and mcdonnell 2018 fang et al 2007 shook and pomeroy 2012 isotope based estimates of water yield indicate that very little overland non channelized flow occurs in non flood years and that years of high yield may be critical in sustaining lake ecosystems in this large sub humid continental region 6 1 comparison of isotopic and instruments estimates of water balance the capability of δ2h and δ18o analyses to quantify the water balance of managed lakes was demonstrated by the strong agreement between isotopic and instrumental estimates of e i particularly based on best fit models elsewhere the uncertainty associated with isotopic water balance in lakes exhibiting higher evaporation has been estimated wolfe et al 2007 although this variation can increase when a headwater isotope method is applied to lakes fig 4 where inflow may have undergone prior evaporation in upstream water bodies gibson and reid 2014 here we find that e i using the citm x 0 14 mad 0 08 agreed with instrumental values x 0 06 mad 0 06 at the scale of the entire qu appelle river catchment as seen elsewhere gibson et al 2017 wolfe et al 2007 yi et al 2008 however we also found that this agreement could be increased substantially by using isotope models which incorporate only a modest amount of data on either upstream isotopic values or the importance of in lake evaporation gibson and reid 2014 median difference between individual instrumental and best fit models 0 03 vs instrumental and headwater 0 09 in general this additional information can be obtained by simple analysis of surface flow patterns and differences in concentrations of chemically conservative solutes e g cl among adjacent basins estimates of water residence time based on best fit isotope models were similar to those derived from continuous annual monitoring programs across the qu appelle river drainage basin table 1 residence time strongly affects chemical content biological properties and ecosystem function of lakes romo et al 2013 schindler 2006 tranvik et al 2009 and is one of the most commonly estimated outputs of isotopic mass balance calculations balasubramaniam et al 2015 brooks et al 2014 gibson et al 2016 2015 narancic et al 2017a here we show that water residence time can be approximated for a variety of open drainage lakes using isotopic methods based solely on a single late summer sample a critical observation for application of the method to ungauged ecosystems as lake vulnerability to short term meteorological variability declines with increasing residence time adrian et al 2009 the broad application of isotopic models in lake surveys will allow investigators to develop regional maps of surface water sensitivity to future climate change macdonald et al 2017 turner et al 2010 agreement between isotopic and instrumental estimates of e i and residence time was influenced by lake position in the hydrological landscape figs 4 5 specifically higher e i values and longer residence times were calculated for downstream katepwa and crooked lakes with citm ls lel and best fit flow aided isotope methods relative to instrumental monitoring research elsewhere shows that such patterns can arise if isotope models do not account for enrichment of 2h and 18o via evaporation from inflowing waters gibson and reid 2014 in downstream sites pasqua katepwa crooked evaporatively enriched waters from last mountain have a variable impact on the isotopic values of inflow although our best fit models should account for such upstream isotopic enrichment the persistent elevation of e i and residence time in downstream lakes suggests that additional factors affect the agreement between instrumental and isotopic determinations although speculative we suggest that monitoring programs may have overestimated the importance of channelized inflow to downstream qu appelle lakes consistent with the tendency for wrmm models to overestimate river flow during periods of high precipitation bender 2012 in support of our hypothesis we note that e i and residence time of upstream lakes diefenbaker buffalo pound would be expected to exhibit few effects of upstream evaporation and that all sites had isotopically derived values lower than those from monitoring data variation in agreement between isotope and instrumental derived estimates of e i and residence time may also reflect the high degree of hydrological management in the qu appelle river drainage basin saskatchewan water security agency 2012 for example the overall relationship between e i values and precipitation amount mm evaporation mm and precipitation balance was weak possibly reflecting the use of control structures on the outlet of most lakes table 3 management in the basin includes urban agricultural and industrial extractions that are elevated in lake diefenbaker and buffalo pound both of which are operated as multipurpose reservoirs north et al 2015 pasqua lake directly receives wastewater from both moose jaw pop 45 000 and regina pop 220 000 which sustains river flow independent of runoff and therefore is unlikely to react to changes in local meteorological variability in addition the lack of basin wide response to reduced precipitation in 2007 09 indicates that augmenting flows from upstream reservoirs may be capable to preventing hydrologic stress in downstream systems further research is needed to determine whether the inconsistencies between methods of assessing basin specific hydrology metrics reflects management or monitoring issues or is part of a larger pattern related to lake position in the landscape gibson and reid 2014 and above in this regard a survey of regional lakes not subject to manipulation or hydrologically closed basins may be helpful e g pham et al 2009 6 2 isotopic estimates of water yield inflow in open basin lakes analysis of water isotopes can be used to estimate water yield for individual lake catchments as isotope mass balances integrate factors known to control runoff at the hillslope and catchment scale bennett et al 2008 gibson et al 2017 2015 2010 field research shows that runoff is greatest in years when snow accumulation is large and melt occurs quickly over frozen water saturated soils coles et al 2017 coles and mcdonnell 2018 pomeroy et al 2007 in this study isotope mass balance approaches accurately captured the low water yield of all lakes as well as the effects of a 1 in 140 spring flood fig 7 supplementary fig 1 particularly in lakes diefenbaker last mountain wascana katepwa and crooked this pattern suggests that these later lakes are more likely to receive elevated inputs from their local catchment during flood periods peak water yield was not detected in buffalo pound and pasqua lake during the period of flooding although water yields were above average at both sites in 2011 the ability of water isotopes to detect temporal and spatial differences in water yield during a large scale flood emphasizes the capability of these techniques to integrate catchment scale features that control the contribution of local precipitation within a single region in general isotope based estimates of catchment water yields were consistent with the knowledge that reservoirs exhibit higher yields than natural lakes in a given catchment hayes et al 2017 consistent with this expectation the two headwater reservoirs diefenbaker and buffalo pound routinely experienced elevated and variable water yields when calculated with either gda μ 85 2 mm yr 1 σ 83 2 x 64 0 mad 18 8 or sfda μ 655 0 mm yr 1 σ 511 8 x 794 0 mad 836 0 fig 7 in contrast water yields from other lake basins were similar to the 21 mm yr 1 estimated from instrumental data at the outflow of the qu appelle valley during 1977 1997 bender 2012 and spatial analysis of expected water yield from 1971 to 2000 bemrose et al 2009 the low water yield was also consistent with studies in other agrcultural catchments cerdan et al 2004 the finding of low water yield is consistent with the paradigm for the sub humid prairies that most runoff is collected by channelized tributaries except during the spring freshet coles et al 2017 fang et al 2007 pomeroy et al 2007 however at present it is unclear whether the higher water yield in the sites to the west reflects decadal scale variation in contributions from the catchment or merely the presence of reservoirs in the headwater region the strong positive relationship between instrumental and isotope estimates of inflow fig 8 provides critical evidence needed to demonstrate that water isotopes can be used to quantitatively estimate inflow to ungauged surface waterbodies this result is consistent with the conclusions of gibson and reid 2014 who compared isotopic and instrumental estimates of inflow over a five year period however unlike that study we found evidence that the relationship between instrumental and isotope values can differ among sites and may be non linear in some instances non linear relations between precipitation and runoff have been observed earlier for the canadian prairies coles et al 2017 and may reflect variation in soil infiltration of precipitation depending on landuse and antecedent climate conditions precipiation freezing etc the lack of statistically significant relationship at last mountain lake fig 8c likely reflects the comparatively low degree of instrumentation in this large lake basin or perhaps a high relative importance of unchannelized inflow nonetheless the strong overall relation between observed and isotope inferred inflow suggests that the isotopic approach is capable of capturing the main variation in inflow channelized overland groundwater to lakes that are poorly instrumented further research in other well studied basins with larger ranges in water balance as well as surveys of lakes on a sub continental landscape scale will help further refine this powerful hydrological technique 7 conclusions and future implications lakes in this study spanned a wide range of morphology hydrological settings and human influence and can be used as a model drainage system to evaluate the use of isotope mass balances to estimate the hydrology of open lakes with only isotopic values of a single late summer water sample and minimal upstream flow data lake specific estimates of e i and residence time agreed with values derived from continuous monitoring to within 0 03 and 0 3 years respectively broad application of stable isotope mass budgets to ungauged ecosystems may allow scientists and managers to better identify systems vulnerable to global warming and future changes in regional hydrology in the future the prairie region is expected to experience reduction in stream flow and surface water availability gan and tanzeeba 2012 sauchyn et al 2016 although we noted that the low flow interval of 2007 2009 could be augmented by water from reservoirs fig 5 supplementary fig 1 we also note that this recent period of low moisture is comparatively mild when placed in both historic and future context cohen et al 2015 gan and tanzeeba 2012 consequently additional research will be required to evaluate the role of increased conveyance in sustaining regional lakes against severe droughts michels et al 2007 in contrast we found that analysis of water isotopes was an excellent means of capturing the effects of large runoff events such as the 1 in 140 year flood during 2011 blais et al 2015 when e i decreased synchronously in lakes subject to enhanced surface flow taken together these findings suggest that water isotope mass balances can be used as a metric of climate sensitivity in managed systems and are capable of assessing management

8597,in this work a reliable understanding of the storage patterns and flow dynamics of a tectonically complex karst system is attained by means of the combined analysis of results derived from geological and karst specific i e hydrogeological approaches hydrodynamic hydrochemical hydrothermal and isotopic the pilot site comprises rocks belonging to six different complexes within the betic cordillera external zone 1 flysch complex 1 and the internal zone 4 quick and sharp variations in natural responses after rainfall were recorded in the overflow springs located in the external zone in contrast groundwater drained by permanent springs placed in the internal zone present high mineralization and temperature values as well as lagged and buffered responses to precipitation events at a first glance one could assume that two independent systems with different behaviors are at work following a classical interpretation conduit flow type functioning for jurassic limestones external zone and diffuse flow behavior for the triassic calcareous rocks internal zone however integration of results with those derived from the water budget and geological observations leads us to propose a sole aquifer formed by rocks belonging to several geological domains but hydrogeologically connected where shorter and longer water rock interactions along flow paths coexist overthrust surfaces and the subsequent normal faults involve diverse low permeable formations imbricated within a tectonic suture inducing strong heterogeneities in groundwater flow patterns the geological complexity and the inner geometry at the southeast border of the aquifer jointly modulate the global signal coming from the external zone which is attenuated before arriving at the permanent springs found in the internal zone we conclude by emphasizing that a continuous transfer of feedback from geological to hydrogeological approaches and vice versa enhances knowledge in both directions helping us to avoid misinterpretations about the hydrogeological behaviors of aquifers and ultimately to better evaluate and manage water resources keywords karst aquifers geological complexity heterogeneous media dual approach hydraulic southern spain 1 introduction carbonate karst aquifers exhibit particular hydrogeological characteristics linked to their commonly high degree of heterogeneity and anisotropy bakalowicz 2005 ford and williams 2007 a better understanding of the inherent hydrological complexity of these aquifers is needed to advance in the elaboration and implementation of sustainable water governance strategies particularly in europe eu 1995 2004 researchers and administrations contribute to this progress by developing and applying karst specific approaches goldscheider and andreo 2007 which shed light on the functioning of aquifers and their available water resources many of these methodologies are based on qualitative and quantitative analyses of the natural responses hydrodynamic hydrothermal and hydrochemical of karst systems and on the interpretation of stable isotopes in groundwater white 2002 bakalowicz 2005 ford and williams 2007 drew and goldscheider 2007 geological aspects are sometimes underestimated even though they are essential for a proper interpretation of the results derived from the aforementioned techniques and to arrive at a general understanding of the hydrogeological functioning of aquifers on the whole goldscheider and andreo 2007 a lack of information regarding geological characteristics can lead to erroneous interpretations or cause confusion when assessing related water resources even more in any hydrogeological environments misunderstanding and unrecognized crucial geostructures controlling water movement may result in hazards for infrastructures mining activities or in the ecological preservation of natural areas li et al 2017 currell et al 2017 in tectonically complex dominated karst areas fracturing regional faults folds and other types of structures may predetermine surface and subsurface catchments the development of exo and endokarst features the preferential direction of flow paths and the residence time of groundwater within the systems herold et al 2000 goldscheider 2005 goldscheider and andreo 2007 perrin and luetscher 2008 it is often the case that geological units of different permeability and mineralogical composition are hydraulically connected protracting or constraining water rock interactions and mixing processes along flow paths hess and white 1993 aquilina et al 2003 moral et al 2008 martos rosillo et al 2013 among others the existence of tectonic deformation and or low permeability materials interbedded amid a calcareous series gives rise to uncertainty when interpreting output signals and the geochemical processes involved hence errors in the conceptualization of aquifer behavior are a common problem subsequent analyses of the natural responses of spring water might not reflect the hydrogeological features of the aquifer as a whole but rather the hydrogeological regime in the vicinity of the discharge points previous works in carbonate rock massifs such as the alps goldscheider 2005 perrin and luetscher 2008 the jura mountains herold et al 2000 or the betic cordillera sanz de galdeano et al 2019 have demonstrated that flows are greatly influenced by the regional structure and tectonics in other cases the thickness of non karstic rock covers affects to the hydrodynamic responses of carbonate aquifers constituting an argument to expand classical characterization methodologies el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 the application of hydrogeological research methods serves to enhance a purely geological knowledge of such complex areas methodological feedback they include the geological and hydrogeological control of boreholes analysis of the natural responses of springs hydrodynamics hydrochemistry water temperature isotopic signatures δ13ctdic δ34sso4 δ18oh2o etc and especially the use of artificial tracers to infer the role of geological structure in groundwater flow patterns ford and williams 2007 drew and goldscheider 2007 goldscheider et al 2008 likewise the existence of springs with high average flow rates or unbalanced water budgets may signal hydrogeological connections between or among cartographically separate permeable outcrops this does not mean that the hydrogeological techniques are always in themselves enough to reduce uncertainty surrounding aquifer behavior therefore there is a need to carefully delineate the geological context of a research site before applying hydrogeological techniques if an adequate geological framework is not available inferences as to the hydrogeological functioning of aquifers will be inaccurate or partial the aim of this work is precisely to highlights the importance of understanding a geological context like in alpine carbonate massif before making related hydrogeological interpretations we underline the back and forth complementarity of geological plus hydrogeological feedback implementing diverse tools hydrodynamic hydrochemical hydrothermal and isotopic ones we show how their simultaneous use can reinforce an understanding of hydrogeological workings based on these intertwined results a more robust conceptual model of the aquifer and its behavior could be established furthermore the integration of geological hydrogeological and water budget data leads to a more precise estimation of the effective catchment area 2 site settings the test site the jarastepar mountain ridge is located roughly 70 km west of the city of malaga and 9 km south of ronda in southern spain fig 1 the relief in this zone is rugged occasionally steep with altitudes ranging from 500 to 1 427 m a s l the region has a temperate mediterranean climate with a marked seasonal pattern in the annual distribution of rainfall mainly in autumn and winter to a lesser extent

period involved in this work from october 2014 to september 2017 could be considered relatively dry and slightly warm average annual rainfall and air temperature values of 764 mm and 15 8 c were recorded in meteorological stations situated between 583 and 1 317 m a s l over the carbonate outcrops fig 1 the average annual rainfall recorded in this site during the four years prior to the research period 2010 11 to 2013 14 was 1085 mm 2 1 geological framework geologically the pilot site and surrounding areas lie within the western most sector of the betic cordillera martín algarra 1987 balanyá et al 2007 expósito et al 2012 it contains rocks from the three main tectonic bodies of the betic cordillera from bottom to top and n to s the external zone the flysch complex and the internal zone the latter domain is a nappe stack in turn involving up to three complexes in this sector of the cordillera from bottom to top and n to s the frontal units almola and nieves and the malaguide and alpujarride complexes the stratigraphic series of the external zone at the pilot site consists of 500 550 m thick jurassic dolostones and limestones which present late triassic clays dolomitic beds sandstones and evaporite rocks mainly gypsum at the bottom and early cretaceous tertiary marly limestones and marls at the top martín algarra 1987 meanwhile the frontal units are made up of a triassic to early miocene succession over than 1 200 m thick largely containing carbonate formations in the nieves unit late triassic dolostones and limestones jurassic limestones and cherty limestones and early miocene carbonate breccias are the prevailing lithologies the sequence of the almola unit includes 200 m thick jurassic limestones followed by early cretaceous and eocene marly limestones and marls martín algarra 1987 mazzoli et al 2013 the malaguide and alpujarride complexes comprise metamorphic rocks mainly schists of paleozoic age finally the flysch complex is broadly formed by tertiary brownish clays and sandstones structural associations involving these geological domains their geometry and limits have been described at a regional scale martín algarra 1987 expósito et al 2012 mazzoli et al 2013 the geological structure of the jarastepar area is particularly complex determined by an overlapping of all the tectonic units having a general vergence toward the nw fig 1 the external zone occupies the lowest tectonic position whereas paleozoic metapellitic rocks from the malaguide and alpujarride complexes occupy the upper part of the accretionary wedge and their outcrops are well represented south of the pilot site the frontal units appear in a lower tectonic position within the internal zone wedge just below a major hanging wall ramp defined by the overthrusting of the malaguide and alpujarride complexes imbricated between the internal and the external zones highly deformed and strongly thinned flysch type clays and sandstones discontinuously exist in a narrow and elongated ne sw outcrop whose trace reflects the suture between the two main zones of the betic cordillera the dip of the primary overthrust surfaces shifts from practically horizontal in the ne

fracturation network have given rise to a labyrinthic karstic landscape featuring small towers and corridors patchy soil cover up to 60 cm thick is found especially where the slope is low overall vegetation is scarce mainly consisting of mediterranean shrub growth on the patchy soils no sources of pollution exist in the recharge area of the aquifer except for some disperse livestock farming 2

dominant permeable formations existing in the site autogenic recharge takes place through direct infiltration of rainwater over the carbonate outcrops three perennial springs located at the southern border of the carbonate outcrops pertaining to the internal zone are the main drainage points of the area fig 1 huertos 560 m a s l charco 589 m a s l and la zúa 603 m a s l in addition there are two overflow springs alfaguara 658 m a s l and pozancón 643 664 m a s l situated at the southern edge of the external zone just north of the major tectonic contact where flysch clays are imbricated

natural drainage contributes to the environmental preservation of groundwater ecodependent systems downstream from the springs 3 methods the description of the different methodological procedures employed in this work are detailed in the following sections and they are schematized in the flowchart of fig 3 3 1 geological procedure advances in the knowledge of the geology of the pilot site comes from several field campaigns done in the framework of this scientific contribution and prior geological information martín algarra 1987 balanyá et al 2007 expósito et al 2012 mazzoli et al 2013 as well as a review of thematic cartography igme 1973 1980a b 1981 special attention was given to sectors of greater geological complexity such as the major tectonic contact between the external and internal zones due to their hydrogeological implications updated information stratigraphic contacts strike and dip of the strata faults etc was digitalized and georeferenced using gis software the corpus of geological knowledge was completed by considering data from four boreholes drilled in the area fig 1 in the framework of this study five geological hydrogeological cross sections were performed fig 4 to illustrate the general structure and geometry of the sierra de jarastepar and surrounding areas three of them at the southern border of the pilot site identified as a a b b and c c

periods in the case of pozancón spring 52 measurements were taken at outflowing conditions while the rest up to 166 in total were directly performed on the water table inside the cave fig 2 similarly at the alfaguara spring where suitable monitoring of physico chemical parameters was only possible at high water conditions 71 records were obtained at the same time 676 spring water samples were manually collected in 150 ml amber glass bottles transported and stored at temperatures below 4 c for subsequent chemical and isotopic determinations in the laboratory along with field measurements

respectively using an ott ecolog 800 data logger probe accuracy of 0 05 with 40 m of cable length fig 2 and an odyssey capacitance water level logger 1 mm accuracy in both cases water level variation series were afterwards transformed into continuous records of discharge by applying the corresponding rating equations whose accuracy was checked against individual discharge flow measurements 129 in la zúa using an ott c2 flow meter and 28 joint discharge measurements of pozancón alfaguara with an etrelec salinomadd the correlation coefficient between single measurements and continuous record of water stage was 0 97 for la zúa spring in the case of pozancón alfaguara its rating curve was composed by two equations one derived from situations in which only alfaguara was active and another more when alfaguara and pozancón springs were draining groundwater simultaneously with correlation coefficients values of 0 92 and 0 99 discharge from huertos charco and other secondary springs was punctually controlled by means of an ott c2 flow meter 3 3 analytical procedures chemical and δ13ctdic isotopic analyses were carried out at the laboratory of the center of hydrogeology of the university of malaga cehiuma alkalinity alk as hco3 was determined by volumetric titration using 0 02 n h2so4 to ph 4 45 chemical analyses of the major components ca2 mg2 na k f cl so4 2 no3 were

performed with a picarro g1111 i analyzer for isotopic co2 coupled to an oi a aurora 1030 toc analyzer values of δ13ctdic are given in per mil relative to pdb the standard deviations are 0 5 based on replicate measurements of internal standards additionally one sampling campaign was conducted to analyze the sulphur isotope δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 for sampling so4 2 enriched groundwater these determinations were carried out in the technology and science centre of the university of barcelona using an isotope mass ratio spectrometer irms thermofisher delta plus xp water samples were originally pretreated by precipitating so4 2 in the form baso4 through the addition of a concentrated solution of bacl2 50 g l finally the values of partial pressure of co2 logpco2 and the mineral saturation indexes of calcite sical dolomite sidol and gypsum sigyp were calculated using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 1999 3 4 water balance estimation to assess the water budget of the sierra de jarastepar autogenic recharge and total discharge spring outflows and pumping abstractions were independently evaluated for the study period the aplis method andreo et al 2008 2018 marín 2009 was applied for recharge estimation this gis based approach was developed to estimate the mean annual recharge that take places in carbonate aquifers expressed as a percentage of precipitation

infiltration landforms i and soil type s to obtain a map of the average recharge rates previous information is transformed following rating criteria and then corrected by means of a factor fhj ranging

coefficient map eq 1 and by the surface of carbonate outcrops also using spatial analysis tools from gis the total annual recharge for each year and the mean during the study period was calculated the aplis approach has been successfully applied to other carbonate aquifers worldwide representing a range of climatic and geological contexts zagana et al 2011 gerner et al 2012 hartmann et al 2016 the inferred inputs were compared with the water resources drained at the discharge points in all cases mean annual discharge of the springs was calculated through a mathematical integration of hydrographs plotted from single measurements of discharge and continuous records the water budget assessment allowed the effective autogenic recharge area of the pilot site to be estimated 4 results 4 1 geological observations the geological map of fig 1 and the geological cross sections of fig 4 show the structure of the south and southeast borders of pilot site according to background information and specially field observations the cross sections present the lithologies and the main tectonic features around the contact between the external and the internal zones according to the updated information compiled and analyzed in the framework of current research the geostructural features define the hydraulic relationship between the different rocks and ultimately the aquifer s geometry note the overthrust ramps of the alpujarride complex over the frontal units and of the latter over the external zone the presence of imbricated flysch type clays and sandstones between the internal and the external zones and the existence of more recent strike slip faults and normal faults which affect the pre existing compressive structures the geological structure of the external zone within the study area features the normal limb with moderate dip 25 35 of a ne sw anticlinorium fold from which an overthrust develops with vergence toward nw affecting triassic clays expósito et al 2012 the general dip of the bedding planes towards the se determines the presence of cretaceous tertiary marl and marly limestones on the jurassic calcareous rocks near the tectonic suture and consequently under the flysch clays and the internal zone rocks even several kilometers southward from the suture the external zone series appear in a lower tectonic position with respect to the internal zone wedge these deductions were confirmed by data provided from the boreholes drilled on the northeastern edge of the pilot site cross section e e in fig 4 for instance early cretaceous tertiary marls were detected at 82 m depth in a borehole near parauta fig 1 southeast of the tectonic suture the superposition of the nieves unit upon the external zone outcrops is not continuous over the entire internal zone front a tectonic slice of the almola unit whose stratified layers plunge 40 50 toward the se appears imbricated between the external zone and the flysch complex at the bottom and the nieves unit atop cross section e e in fig 4 the outcrops of the almola unit are limited to the vicinity of the almola massif they sharply disappear towards the sw as it was noted by changes of the

slip displacements acquires greater weight in the general structure of the pilot site affecting especially to the geometry of the suture plane still the thickness of the brecciated dolostones is the same or somewhat greater towards the sw as revealed by the lithological columns collected in this study in two boreholes up to 200 m depth near cartajima fig 1 and cross section d d in fig 4 the triassic calcareous outcrops cartographically disappear south of alpandeire due to other dextral and normal strike slip faults but having a nw se direction affecting the entire previous structure these strike slip faults are easily visible in places where they separate different lithologies presumably towards the se under the alpujarride and malaguide nappes the permeable rocks belonging to the nieves unit would be found several klippes in the eastern part of the site as well as in other location along the western sector of betic cordillera involving alpujarride complex materials that overlap the triassic carbonate formations are coherent with this hypothesis fig 1 and cross section e e in fig 4 later an extensional deformation phase provoked more recent normal fractures in a ne sw direction jointly affecting the set of geological units this deformation can involve a large part of the lithologic sequences for instance locally affecting the whole thickness of the external zone then generally shifting down along the se blocks as can be seen to the north and northwest of cartajima town fig 1 near the tectonic suture the propagation of extensional deformation was directed throughout the preexisting compressive structures as a result a hydraulic connection between diverse rocks from the external zone jurassic dolostones and limestones and the internal zone triassic dolostones and limestones is feasible cross sections a a b b and c c in fig 4 the magnitude of the fault block displacements and the stratigraphic sequences involved determine the degree of connection

2 hydrodynamic data and water balance table 1 presents the most significant statistical parameters regarding the hydrodynamic response of the springs monitored in this work as well as the results from the water budget estimation made for jarastepar area during the period 2014 15 2016 17 la zúa is the spring with the greatest flow rate 204 l s of average value whereas the lowest flow rates without taking into account the overflow springs alfaguara and pozancón were registered at huertos and charco springs ranging from 25 to 23 l s of average values respectively on the other hand alfaguara and pozancón springs showed a mean annual joint flow rate value of 85 l s if only effective drainage situations are considered the average discharge value is 1 961 l s 1 9 m3 s fig 5 with a maximum flow peak of 21 433 l s 664 8 m a s l november 2014 the spring hydrographs fig 5 indicate various periods when discharge increased in response to the principal recharge periods autumn 2014 winter spring and autumn 2015 spring and autumn 2016 winter spring 2017 significant differences in the shape in the magnitude of the fluctuations of discharge rates also in water level variations in the case of pozancón and in the response to precipitation events are found between the springs located in the internal zone and those in the external zone thus the hydrographs of la zúa charco and huertos springs fig 5 display similar global shapes despite the fact that la zúa spring shows an order of magnitude in discharge values higher than the other two with one or two increases in flow rate per year in response to the main recharge periods it takes several weeks or even a few months to record its maximum flood peak depending on the amount and magnitude of rainfall these variations took place gradually reflecting a buffered hydrodynamic response of the springs located in the internal zone to precipitation events in the external zone in contrast the continuous records of piezometric variations within fig 5 show that during each recharge event there were sharp rises in the water level in pozancón shaft from 0 5 up to 21 8 m approximately between 643 and 664 m a s l the mean response time lag between the rainfall input signal and the hydrodynamic response output signal was about 30 h very quick variations in the mutual outflow dynamic of pozancón and alfaguara springs were likewise detected in response to the main recharge events the corresponding decreases in the water table in pozancón shaft also occurred very rapidly fig 5 whereas very slow variations were recorded at depletion conditions piezometric variations registered in the pozancón shaft fig 5 can be considered representative of the hydrodynamic behavior of the southwestern border of the carbonate formations belonging to the external zone of the aquifer considering the hydrodynamic information the average natural discharge measured from all springs located in the internal zone la zúa charco and huertos amounted to 7 8 hm3 year during the control period table 1a in the case of the external zone 2 7 hm3 year corresponded to the average annual discharge drained by the pozancón alfaguara overflow springs in addition 1 8 hm3 year was estimated for all the secondary springs some of them overflow type located along the northern edge of the aquifer fig 1 finally the mean rate of groundwater extracted by pumping was around 0 1 hm3 year as derived from one active borehole located at the southern border of the external zone fig 1 the mean total discharge measurement in the pilot site was therefore 12 4 hm3 year table 1a mean annual values of recharge indirectly assessed using the aplis method for the study period are summarized in table 1b recharge rates between 24 and 80 of the annual rainfall were obtained from eq 1 equivalent to an average value of 44 for the pilot site as a whole the lowest recharge rates occur in tertiary flysch clays cretaceous tertiary marls and marly limestones and triassic clay outcrops in fig 1 while quaternary deposits show moderate recharge rates an average value of 38 was detected in the triassic and jurassic carbonate outcrops of the internal zone increasing up to 50 on the average in the case of the permeable outcrops of the external zone according to the results obtained using the aplis method the average value of recharge 1 2 hm3 year occurring over the 3 km2 of triassic dolomitic outcrops nieves unit southern sector the aquifer fig 1 was clearly lower than the mean annual volume of water resources drained by the springs located in the internal zone 7 8 hm3 year table 1a similarly the recharge amount estimated for the external zone outcrops 9 7 hm3 year is not coherent with the discharge measured in this sector of the aquifer 4 6 hm3 year table 1a even the combined contribution of the autogenic infiltration occurring in the aforementioned sectors of the aquifer 1 2 9 7 hm3 year is inferior to the total value of the discharge measured for the pilot site 12 4hm3 year table1a a consistent approximation to the water budget 12 8 hm3 year table1b is only reached when the surface considered in the aplis routine is extended towards the e so that the catchment area of the aquifer includes the carbonate formations belonging to the almola and nieves units fig 1 hence a maximum apparent contributing area of 38 km2 to recharge the jarastepar aquifer can be invoked in view of geological field evidences and considering the aplis method as a suitable way to obtain realistic results as in other karst aquifers worldwide zagana et al 2011 gerner et al 2012 hartmann et al 2016 4 3 spatial variability of hydrochemical and isotopic composition of groundwater table 2 presents the most significant statistical parameters concerning the results of the in situ measurements and selected chemical and isotopic determinations performed in the framework of this work results in table 2 and fig 6 show that the mean mineralization and temperature values in the water from pozancón are slightly lower when this outlet is active average contents of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 respectively vary from 56 1 4 6 and 5 5 mg l alfaguara to 71 5 5 4 and 10 2 mg l pozancón cave whereas a higher mean value for alkalinity was recorded in the water samples collected in the shaft 218 5 mg l and a lower one at alfaguara spring 179 4 mg l in contrast the groundwater drained by the springs located in the internal zone shows clearly higher mineralization and temperature values fig 6 with a progressive increase of ec and temperature from 1 564 μs cm and 15 7 c la zúa to 1 866 μs cm and 16 6 c huertos as the altitude of the outflow points falls in general terms ca2 and so4 2 are by far the most abundant ions in the water samples collected in these springs followed by hco3 and mg2 the highest mean concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 were always found in the water drained by huertos spring table 2 followed by charco and la zúa springs average concentrations of cl and na are similar or slightly higher than those obtained for the water drained by the overflow springs situated in the external zone all the spring waters showed low or very low toc and no3 contents table 2 fig 6 though they are somewhat higher in the outlets along the external zone outcrops with mean values ranging from 0 3 la zúa charco and huertos to 0 8 mg l pozancón cave and from 3 5 charco to 7 6 mg l pozancón outflowing respectively only single determinations of both parameters recorded in alfaguara and pozancón springs reveal an incipient degree of contamination affecting the aquifer all analyzed water samples were undersaturated with respect to gypsum table 2 although the more mineralized waters internal zone were close to equilibrium sigyp 0 groundwater samples from the external zone were clearly undersaturated in dolomite while those of the internal zone presented positive average values for sidol table 2 fig 6 the mean maximum value being that of huertos spring most samples had a positive calcite saturation index sical reflecting equilibrium or an oversaturation in this mineral phase higher mean values were again reached in la zúa charco and huertos springs table 2 fig 6 yet the greatest variability for this parameter corresponds to pozancón both under outflowing and non outflowing conditions partial pressure of co2 for alfaguara spring is the lowest of the whole set of outlets and its mean value logpco2 2 5 best approximates the atmospheric equilibrium value higher mean values were calculated for the springs located in the internal zone table 2 which indicates a greater co2 enrichment with respect to the atmospheric air table 2 and the box plots of fig 6 also present stable isotopic values for the inorganic carbon δ13ctdic dissolved in groundwater from the pilot site the mean δ13ctdic values range considerably from the most depleted samples taken in alfaguara and pozancón 12 4 and 12 9 to the most enriched ones from huertos and charco springs 5 9 and 6 0 in the case of groundwater from the external zone the obtained values of δ13ctdic are similar to the theoretical δ13ctdic equilibrium mean value 13 2 pozancón cave calculated following previous studies in karst system emblanch 1997 batiot 2002 and assuming a δ13cco2 g signal of 17 from a gibraltar cave mattey et al 2010 in general the springs hosted in the internal zone of the aquifer drain water having enriched values of δ13ctdic as well as higher mean mineralization and temperature finally fig 7 shows results of the isotopic composition of the dissolved sulphate in groundwater δ34s so4 and δ18o so4 from the three water samples taken at depletion conditions in the outlets located in the internal zone the values of the two stable isotopes are very similar varying from 12 4 huertos to 12 5 charco and zúa for δ18o so4 and from 15 1 zúa to 15 3 charco for δ34s so4 the biplot diagram of δ34s so4 vs δ18o so4 points to the dissolution of triassic evaporite rocks gypsum as the most plausible explanation of sulphate in the groundwater of the entire study area δ18o so4 from 12 to 14 garcía veigas et al 2013 the two main factors of the principal component analysis pca provide 83 16 of explained variance fig 8 a the positive value of factor 1 explaining 60 73 is determined by ec so4 2 ca2 mg2 f and water temperature fig 8a these variables would be related to the dissolution of evaporite rocks gypsum associated with the drainage of more mineralized water with longer residence time within the aquifer and flowing mainly in the saturated zone toc and no 3 tracers of infiltration from the soil appear among the negative part of f1 and positive part of f2 in turn cl na and alkalinity variables are situated towards the positive parts of f1 and f2 the last variable comes from the dissolution of carbonates mainly calcite whereas cl and na values could derive predominantly from the concentration by evaporation of rain water in the soil therefore factor 2 with 22 43 of the variability distinguishes the hydrochemical signature of the variables related to low mineralization primarily due to the dissolution of calcite and to shorter residence time of groundwater flowing through the soil epikarst unsaturated zone fig 8a the data set 634 samples from the springs of jarastepar aquifer differs into two main groups fig 8b alfaguara and pozancón waters plot to the left of the diagram negative side of the f1 axis showing minor values of water mineralization on the contrary samples collected at huertos charco and la zúa springs appear at the positive side of f1 the samples from the less mineralized spring waters are more disperse fig 8b especially in the case of pozancón overflow where we find samples enriched in toc and no3 together with higher values of alkalinity cl and na than in the samples with little mineralization 4 4 time series figs 9 10 11 and 12 show the temporal evolutions of discharge also water level in the case of pozancón ec temperature and the main hydrochemical and isotopic parameters listed in table 2 from each of the springs monitored in this work the figures also display the daily rainfall recorded in the pilot site during the study period see location of the weather station in fig 1 the springs located in the internal zone figs 10 11 and 12 presented markedly diverse hydrochemical and hydrothermal responses to precipitation events especially when compared to those recorded at pozancón spring fig 9 the latter referred figure includes hydrochemical information from samples collected within pozancón cave directly from the water table light colored dots in fig 9 and in outflowing conditions dark colored dots data for alfaguara spring are not represented in fig 9 due to the similarity of their hydrochemical behavior a general seasonal fluctuation in temperature ec and chemical composition of pozancón water can be seen in fig 9 the values of all these parameters were higher during the autumn coinciding with the first rainfall events of the hydrological year and lower in spring and summer more specifically each recharge episode commonly provoked different magnitude increases in mineralization and temperature as the piezometric level inside pozancón rose however this pattern was suddenly interrupted during the most significant recharge events when the water table went up above the threshold defined by alfaguaras altitude 658 m a s l the magnitude of these dilutions up to 45 with respect to the maximum value of ec depends on the previous hydrodynamic conditions of the aquifer and on the volume of new recharge water changes in ec and temperature were followed by fast rises of equal magnitude as the flow rate and especially water level decreased until reaching similar values prior to dilution once the drainage from alfaguara spring ceased the variations in ec in pozancón waters were clearly influenced by changes in alkalinity and ca2 content and to a lesser extent in so4 2 fig 9 likewise small drops in mg2 contents were recorded when alfaguara and pozancón springs were active mg2 values tend to decrease during high water conditions and to increase progressively with falling water levels inside the spring until the next recharge meanwhile the contents of toc and no3 follow the general pattern of mineralization they tend to be greater during recharge events especially at the beginning of the hydrogeological year fig 9 and diminish as the aquifer underwent to low water conditions the temporal evolutions of both natural markers of recently infiltrated water also reflect sudden decreases even the lowest yearly values coinciding with the aerial outflowing stages whereas the subsequent quick and progressive rises of the toc and no3 content are seen whenever superficial drainage finished in terms of δ13ctdic the values tend to be more negative during high water conditions and progressively but slightly rise in the absence of recharge in summer months reaching a maximum at the beginning of the hydrogeological year in autumn the most negative values were recorded in the water samples gathered in the pozancón shaft before or just after the outflowing periods and frequently coinciding with the highest toc and no3 contents fig 9 in general terms a decrease in pco2 values immediately follows recharge and then it gradually increases during low water conditions in some of the most significant recharge events i e october 2015 the water drained by pozancón spring even reached the atmospheric equilibrium value of logpco2 3 5 regarding the time series of the hydrochemical parameters measured in the water drained by the springs sited in the internal zone figs 10 11 and 12 some differences in the magnitude and the response times to precipitation events can be observed the magnitude of dilutions in huertos spring following seasonal rainfall generally coinciding with flow peaks fig 10 depends on the degree of mixing between the recently infiltrated rainwater and the groundwater stored in the aquifer the higher the volume of infiltrated rain with respect to stored water the greater the dilution e g autumn 2016 winter 2017 fig 10 after each dilution when the rain ceased mineralization progressively rose although this recovery could be interrupted by subsequent precipitations causing new dilutions a marked rising trend in ec values under depletion conditions was observed in charco spring during the study period fig 11 from values around 1650 µs cm at the end of 2014 to approximately 1700 µs cm in summer 2017 this hydrochemical trend was disrupted in the most significant recharge periods when sharp falls in water mineralization up to 159 µs cm occurred in 13 days dilutions were followed by quick increases of similar magnitudes or even greater in ec when the influence of recharge water ceased finally la zúa is the outlet presenting the smallest hydrochemical variations during the study period fig 12 there are only buffered and lagged dilutions of up to 87 μs cm in the course of 15 days after precipitation water from the springs located in the internal zone displays virtually no hydrothermal variations recharge has little or no influence on groundwater temperature general changes in the water mineralization of huertos charco and la zúa springs are mainly due to variations in so4 2 contents and to a lesser extent in ca2 and mg2 figs 10 11 and 12 which evolved similarly to ec values on occasion significant recharge events provoked decreases in these parameters followed by increases whose minimum values coincide with the flood peaks on the other hand toc and no3 contents tend to be higher particularly toc in the three springs at high water situations still increases in both these natural tracers of infiltration after rainfall were preceded by accentuated decreases if significant rainfall occurred i e november 2015 figs 10 11 and 12 as well as drops in the values of so4 2 mg2 and ca2 such behavior was always more clearly observed in huertos spring fig 10 than in charco fig 11 or la zúa springs fig 12 in fact slight and gradual rises of toc and no3 contents rather than falls were seen for huertos spring where the maximum values coincide with the minima for ec with a time lag of several weeks after the last rainfall episode the springs located in the internal zone of the aquifer presented remarkable variations in δ13ctdic values during the control period showing clear similarities with the temporal evolutions of ec in the three cases the most negative values were recorded during recharge periods whereas δ13ctdic values tend towards enrichment at recession stages relatively sharp variations in δ13c occurred simultaneously in the three outlets during the recharge event of may 2016 this is especially observable in la zúa spring fig 12 where the least negative values of the time series up to 5 03 were recorded possibly caused by a piston flow effect as a consequence of 78 mm of precipitation in two days finally during recharge periods groundwater drained by the springs located in the internal zone showed an initial decline in logpco2 values followed by rises as the flow rate approached depletion conditions figs 10 11 and 12 5 discussion and interpretation 5 1 geological structure and related hydrodynamic and hydrogeochemical processes in view of the geological characteristics of the pilot site and surrounding areas illustrated in the cross sections of fig 4 the spatial distribution and geometry of the different geological formations involved in the aquifer functioning can be inferred the permeable jurassic carbonate rocks belonging to the external zone must be hydraulically connected with the triassic rocks located in the internal zone having an inner geometry defined mainly by the accretionary overthrust surfaces and subsequent normal faults results from the water budget implemented in this study table 1 are coherent with transferences of water resources among the calcareous formations involved from the external zone nw towards the nieves unit se and also with the geological position and lower altitude of the permanent springs la zúa charco and huertos situated at the southern border of the aquifer furthermore no permanent karst springs drain the jurassic limestones indeed alfaguara and pozancón shaft are overflow springs however the presence of flysch type clays and sandstones discontinuously imbricated between the internal and external permeable rocks and even the cretaceous tertiary marly limestones and marls could restrict the hydraulic continuity thus provoking strong heterogeneities in groundwater flow patterns hydraulic connections would moreover be affected by local structural features primarily the magnitude of the vertical displacement related to the normal faults near the tectonic suture or fault displacement exceeding or not the thickness of the intervening aquicludes the geological cross sections fig 4 also reflect the thickness reached in the study area 500 600 m by the carbonate rocks which could be greater by juxtaposition of the different permeable units for instance considering the tectonic nappe of almola ridge as a part of the aquifer following the water balance criteria and the aplis method results table 1 the hydrostratigraphic sequence in this sector would extend up to 700 m cross section e e in fig 4 there is a noteworthy absence of outlet points related to almola ridge despite the fact that its limestone outcrops are almost completely surrounded by low permeability material fig 1 hence substantial development of the unsaturated and saturated zones could concur in some sectors of the aquifer especially at the vertical of the tectonic contact among the external and internal zones given the structural configuration of the pilot site accordingly the storage capacity of the aquifer could be a significant factor bearing a strong influence on the hydrodynamic response of the permanent springs fig 5 as occurs in some karst systems el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 the role of the geological structure in the hydrogeological behavior of the sierra de jarastepar aquifer is also evidenced by the marked heterogeneity found in the hydrochemical hydrothermal and isotopic characteristics of groundwater and in related processes fig 6 groundwater flows with an initial chemical composition reflecting the dissolution of limestone rocks table 2 figs 6 8 and 13 a gradually acquire higher temperature and mineralization values this is consistent with the existence of longer and deeper flows through the aquifer towards the springs located at lower altitudes the rising contents in all chemical components particularly so4 2 ca2 and mg2 together with the data reported for δ34sso4 δ18oso4 fig 7 garcía veigas et al 2013 ortí et al 2014 would denote dissolution processes mainly affecting gypsum dispersed within the late triassic clays of the external zone series or in contact with the gypsum bearing basement such processes have great implications for the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater as can be inferred from the molar relationships displayed in the biplots of fig 13 the situation slightly below the stoichiometric 1 1 line in the ca2 vs so4 2 plot gypsum dissolution of huertos charco and la zúa water samples fig 13b suggests calcite precipitation ca2 excesses fig 13a linked to a common ion effect wigley 1973 appelo and postma 2005 the fact that groundwater drained by the springs located in the internal zone was always saturated and oversaturated respect to calcite sical 0 table 2 fig 6 is coherent with the existence of progressively major travertine outcrops downstream from the three permanent outlets as its altitude falls fig 1 likewise the increasing mg2 contents observed in the springs located in the internal zone figs 6 and 13 is due to the progressively longer interaction of groundwater with dolostone rocks stratigraphically below limestones in the external zone series and forming the nieves unit in the saturated zone of the aquifer in addition to an evaporite origin lópez chicano et al 2001 martos rosillo et al 2013 the 3 1 stoichiometric line that defines ca2 vs mg2 in the groundwater from huertos spring fig 13c can be explained by the dedolomitization effect a geochemical process involving multi mineral phases such as gypsum calcite and dolomite wigley 1973 appelo and postma 2005 the presence of rich so4 2 and ca2 fluids in dissolution as the main product in the gypsum dissolution reaction could induce calcite precipitation due to ca2 excess the aforementioned common ion effect and a subsequent reduction of hco3 contents this combined effect accelerates the dolomite dissolution reaction kinetics as a consequence of the high capability of the water to dissolve more carbonate minerals if calcite and dolomite availability is sufficient resulting in a greater mg2 mass transference appelo and postma 2005 moral et al 2008 the slight deviation from the 3 1 line of charco spring and more pronounced in la zúa indicates their impoverishment in mg2 therefore although groundwater with significant mean residence time is drained through the outlets by the internal zone the waters that are less evolved geochemically would have undergone shorter water rock interactions particularly in deeper compartments featuring evaporite layers plummer et al 1990 capaccioni et al 2001 mcmahon et al 2004 carucci et al 2012 the δ13ctdic results fig 6 table 2 confirm previous deductions regarding the storage capacities and residence times of groundwater within the saturated zone as well as the water rock interactions the higher proportion of water coming from the unsaturated zone characterized by short residence times determines the real and theoretical δ13ctdic signal of groundwater in the external zone of the aquifer giving values closer to the carbon isotopic signature of the soil 22 deines 1980 drever 1982 clark and fritz 1997 in contrast the less negative values of δ13ctdic of the permanent springs at the southern border of the aquifer corroborate that they drain water of progressively longer residence time within the aquifer mainly in the saturated zone where the δ13ctdic signature tends to equilibrium with the carbonate rock matrix 0 clark and fritz 1997 in the highly complex geological context of the pilot site the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of la zúa spring denote 1 a geochemical stage less evolved than in the other springs located in the internal zone or 2 a possibly greater influence of short residence flows in groundwater mixing involving larger transferences of water resources from the external zone permeable rocks the second option would be in agreement with the markedly higher volume of groundwater annually drained by this outlet table1 fig 5 accordingly a preferential zone with better hydraulic properties can be envisaged north northeast of la zúa spring fig 1 in that sector jurassic and triassic calcareous outcrops are cartographically separated by just a few meters in a narrow band 1500 m long logically the hydrogeological uncertainty inherent to these deductions could be reduced by integrating further types of quantitative observations such as tracer test results subsurface hydraulic connections within the external zone of the aquifer from the central part of the sierra de jarastepar to pozancón and alfaguara springs were recently determined through a multi injection tracer test performed in 2016 at high water conditions de la torre et al 2017 barberá et al 2017 5 2 hydrogeological functioning the quick and substantial variations in piezometric level temperature ec and most hydrochemical parameters analyzed in the water from pozancón shaft fig 9 indicate a very low capacity of the carbonate rocks of the external zone to modulate the input signal rainfall recharge effects are almost instantaneously transmitted to the saturated zone due to the good development of karst conduits within the unsaturated zone this is consistent with the general variations observed in toc and no3 contents and with the δ13ctdic signal direct measurements and theoretical calculations suggesting a significant contribution of rapid flows of fresh recharge water from the soil and epikarst to the functioning of the aquifer in addition the inferred behavior is conditioned by groundwater stored in the saturated zone of this sector as can be discerned from the increases in water temperature ec and the most influential components alk and ca2 that took place systematically at the beginning of the hydrological year fig 9 the rises in water mineralization were simultaneous to those in no3 and toc contents hence autumn recharge events provoked a general mobilization of water previously stored in both the unsaturated and the saturated zones the latter with a notable thickness at the sw edge of the external zone close to the tectonic suture fig 1 and cross section a a in fig 4 the inferred karst network acquires particular relevance in the behavior pattern of the external zone of the aquifer after significant recharge events when the water level rises and exceeds the overflow altitudinal threshold a feature commonly found in karst aquifers with functional overflow springs barberá and andreo 2012 lauber and goldscheider 2014 brkic et al 2018 under these conditions increases in the hydraulic head proportional to the magnitude of recharge together with the high hydraulic conductivity found in this sector of the aquifer would induce a sudden modification of flow velocities into the conduits that begin to feed the overflow springs consequently a well defined groundwater flow path with great drainage capacity is established allowing the fast arrival of recently infiltrated water towards the temporary discharge zone and leading to increases in flow rates up to 20 m3 s as a result in the groundwater mixing drained through the outlets the fraction of freshwater directly coming from the surface abruptly grows the water shows lower mineralization and temperature values but also lower contents in natural tracers of infiltration due to soil leaching during previous recharge episodes and or because the recharge volume is such that its concentrations in groundwater are even diluted the lower soil water interaction moreover induces quick falls in pco2 values even reaching the atmospheric equilibrium value and slight rises in the δ13ctdic signal of groundwater as it tends to be in equilibrium with the δ13cco2 signal of the atmosphere 8 friedli et al 1986 cerling et al 1991 clark and fritz 1997 this is an uncommon process in karst systems but it was described by banks 2018 in vadu crişului karst basin in the apuseni mountains nw romania unlike the well established karst drainage network of the jurassic sector of the aquifer external zone a certain natural regulatory capacity for the triassic calcareous rocks of the internal zone may be inferred a priori according to the classical interpretation of the lagged and buffered responses to precipitation events recorded in the permanent springs figs 10 11 and 12 that is a typical fissured or diffuse flow behavior pattern for the southern sector of the aquifer could be deduced after analyzing results following conventional hydrogeological criteria perrin et al 2003 jeannin et al 2007 mudarra and andreo 2011 in this case however the specific responses of the outlets and their variability cannot be exclusively attributed to the intrinsic functioning of the carbonate rocks as a whole the geological complexity of the pilot site is always a factor to be considered imbricated flysch type clays and sandstones and cretaceous tertiary marly limestones and marls regulate groundwater transferences and attenuate the input signals coming from the external zone carbonate outcrops typified by pozancón spring water figs 6 and 9 hence strong heterogeneities in the hydraulic properties involving the different formations among the internal and external zones contribute to modulating the global response of each permanent spring the aquifer appears to have an inertial behavior pattern but in fact it shows global karst functioning to be taken into account in addition is the modulating role exerted by the thick saturated zone that exits in the vertical of the tectonic contact where triassic permeable rocks are possibly confined under the paleozoic metapellitic formations alpujárride and maláguide complexes therefore by applying a combined geological and hydrogeological approach a more realistic conceptual model for the pilot site can be adequately developed in accordance with its functioning fig 14 rainwater infiltrated over the carbonate outcrops of sierra de jarastepar flows in s and se directions and is finally drained by the permanent springs la zúa charco and huertos sited at the internal zone and punctually by the overflow springs alfaguara and pozancón located south of the carbonate outcrop of the external zone ultimately the proposed conceptual model entails a sole aquifer formed by rocks of different ages belonging to several geological domains but hydrogeologically connected where two basic types of flow behavior or regulatory capacities of water resources can be discerned fig 14 most of the discharge occurs naturally by means of the permanent springs located at lower altitudes in the internal zone through which warm and mineralized groundwater is drained the greater residence time of the groundwater component in the media thus lengthy water rock interaction means a greater content in solutes along its long and deep flowpaths in high water conditions the aquifer geometry and the strong hydraulic heterogeneities would impede full drainage of the recharge volume by the permanent outlets moreover good hydrogeological connections between the recharge area and the overflow outlets would exist given the hierarchically well developed drainage network established in the external zone sector of the aquifer as a result of the structural framework and the markedly karst behavior sharp rises in water level and the subsequent activation of overflow springs take place from which cooler and poorly mineralized waters are drained in a context of high geological complexity the lack of precise information on the geometry of the different permeable formations as well as on their hydraulic relationships hampers efforts addressed to accurately inferring the hydrogeological behavior of carbonate aquifers structural features that control groundwater movement can furthermore lead to imprecisions when the extent of the catchment area for water recharge is assessed by simultaneously applying as many experimental methods and characterizing techniques as possible a more reliable understanding of aquifer characteristics and a better appraisal of available water resources can be attained drew and goldscheider 2007 mudarra et al 2019 there is always a risk of drawing inaccurate conclusions about the functioning of aquifers not considering how prior geological knowledge is translated into the hydrogeological sphere the pilot site called for deeper geological insight since hydrogeological techniques in themselves did not suffice to reduce uncertainty surrounding the aquifer behavior for example attending exclusively to the hydrodynamic analysis of the permanent springs fig 5 a clear decomposition of recession curves could be carried out using mangin s methodology mangin 1975 nevertheless the changes in discharge rate at huertos charco and la zúa springs are not properly linked to flows through the unsaturated and saturated zones they reflect how the geological complexity and the saturated zone modulate the signal derived from the hydraulic head variations in the external zone of the aquifer likewise the application of hydrogeological research methods can help to resolve specific questions in areas where geological knowledge is not enough certain hydrogeological techniques prove especially useful for discerning the tectonic relationships between different geological domains or to validate hypotheses about a geological structure häuselmann et al 1999 sanz de galdeano et al 2019 hence transferring knowledge from geological to hydrogeological approaches and vice versa feedback leads researchers to an enhanced understanding of hydrogeological systems and ultimately serves to better manage water resources 6 conclusions in tectonically complex areas such as the peri mediterranean alpine orogenic belt an adequate comprehension of the geological framework is crucial for successfully addressing hydrogeological investigations knowledge of the hydrogeological functioning in these areas especially regarding the estimation of limits and geometry and the storage patterns and flow dynamics could be adequately inferred after applying a combined geological and hydrogeological approach the pilot site that acts as example in this work is formed by carbonate rocks of different ages belonging to several paleogeography domains of the betic cordillera external and internal zones that are hydrogeologically connected structural features overthrust surfaces and subsequent normal faults and different low permeable formations involving both domains imbricated within the tectonic suture induce strong heterogeneities in groundwater flow patterns resulting in very short to much longer water rock interactions along flow paths the geological complexity and the existence of a thick saturated zone at the southeast border of the aquifer jointly modulate the original hydrodynamic hydrochemical and isotopic signals they point to a typical karst functioning for the external zone which is attenuated before arriving at the permanent spring found in the internal zone during this process groundwater evolves geochemically and acquires gradually higher temperature and mineralization values owing to significant increases in the residence time within the aquifer the natural responses of the permanent springs studied could have easily been misinterpreted if the results were analyzed following conventional hydrogeological criteria without attention to the intrinsic geological characteristics of the area an inertial behavior pattern would have been deduced for the aquifer when it actually has a general karst functioning by combining conventional and cheap methods e g geological mapping and the estimation of groundwater budget components one can easily deduce reliable information about the hydrogeological workings of karst aquifers in tectonically complex areas accordingly feedback between geology and hydrogeology must be constantly conducted and compared so as to fine tune interpretations of an aquifer s behavior the results may prove crucial for enhanced protection and management of water resources since they have direct implications for spring protection and the environmental preservation of groundwater ecodependent systems this is especially important when dealing with complex mountainous areas declaration of competing interest the

8597,in this work a reliable understanding of the storage patterns and flow dynamics of a tectonically complex karst system is attained by means of the combined analysis of results derived from geological and karst specific i e hydrogeological approaches hydrodynamic hydrochemical hydrothermal and isotopic the pilot site comprises rocks belonging to six different complexes within the betic cordillera external zone 1 flysch complex 1 and the internal zone 4 quick and sharp variations in natural responses after rainfall were recorded in the overflow springs located in the external zone in contrast groundwater drained by permanent springs placed in the internal zone present high mineralization and temperature values as well as lagged and buffered responses to precipitation events at a first glance one could assume that two independent systems with different behaviors are at work following a classical interpretation conduit flow type functioning for jurassic limestones external zone and diffuse flow behavior for the triassic calcareous rocks internal zone however integration of results with those derived from the water budget and geological observations leads us to propose a sole aquifer formed by rocks belonging to several geological domains but hydrogeologically connected where shorter and longer water rock interactions along flow paths coexist overthrust surfaces and the subsequent normal faults involve diverse low permeable formations imbricated within a tectonic suture inducing strong heterogeneities in groundwater flow patterns the geological complexity and the inner geometry at the southeast border of the aquifer jointly modulate the global signal coming from the external zone which is attenuated before arriving at the permanent springs found in the internal zone we conclude by emphasizing that a continuous transfer of feedback from geological to hydrogeological approaches and vice versa enhances knowledge in both directions helping us to avoid misinterpretations about the hydrogeological behaviors of aquifers and ultimately to better evaluate and manage water resources keywords karst aquifers geological complexity heterogeneous media dual approach hydraulic southern spain 1 introduction carbonate karst aquifers exhibit particular hydrogeological characteristics linked to their commonly high degree of heterogeneity and anisotropy bakalowicz 2005 ford and williams 2007 a better understanding of the inherent hydrological complexity of these aquifers is needed to advance in the elaboration and implementation of sustainable water governance strategies particularly in europe eu 1995 2004 researchers and administrations contribute to this progress by developing and applying karst specific approaches goldscheider and andreo 2007 which shed light on the functioning of aquifers and their available water resources many of these methodologies are based on qualitative and quantitative analyses of the natural responses hydrodynamic hydrothermal and hydrochemical of karst systems and on the interpretation of stable isotopes in groundwater white 2002 bakalowicz 2005 ford and williams 2007 drew and goldscheider 2007 geological aspects are sometimes underestimated even though they are essential for a proper interpretation of the results derived from the aforementioned techniques and to arrive at a general understanding of the hydrogeological functioning of aquifers on the whole goldscheider and andreo 2007 a lack of information regarding geological characteristics can lead to erroneous interpretations or cause confusion when assessing related water resources even more in any hydrogeological environments misunderstanding and unrecognized crucial geostructures controlling water movement may result in hazards for infrastructures mining activities or in the ecological preservation of natural areas li et al 2017 currell et al 2017 in tectonically complex dominated karst areas fracturing regional faults folds and other types of structures may predetermine surface and subsurface catchments the development of exo and endokarst features the preferential direction of flow paths and the residence time of groundwater within the systems herold et al 2000 goldscheider 2005 goldscheider and andreo 2007 perrin and luetscher 2008 it is often the case that geological units of different permeability and mineralogical composition are hydraulically connected protracting or constraining water rock interactions and mixing processes along flow paths hess and white 1993 aquilina et al 2003 moral et al 2008 martos rosillo et al 2013 among others the existence of tectonic deformation and or low permeability materials interbedded amid a calcareous series gives rise to uncertainty when interpreting output signals and the geochemical processes involved hence errors in the conceptualization of aquifer behavior are a common problem subsequent analyses of the natural responses of spring water might not reflect the hydrogeological features of the aquifer as a whole but rather the hydrogeological regime in the vicinity of the discharge points previous works in carbonate rock massifs such as the alps goldscheider 2005 perrin and luetscher 2008 the jura mountains herold et al 2000 or the betic cordillera sanz de galdeano et al 2019 have demonstrated that flows are greatly influenced by the regional structure and tectonics in other cases the thickness of non karstic rock covers affects to the hydrodynamic responses of carbonate aquifers constituting an argument to expand classical characterization methodologies el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 the application of hydrogeological research methods serves to enhance a purely geological knowledge of such complex areas methodological feedback they include the geological and hydrogeological control of boreholes analysis of the natural responses of springs hydrodynamics hydrochemistry water temperature isotopic signatures δ13ctdic δ34sso4 δ18oh2o etc and especially the use of artificial tracers to infer the role of geological structure in groundwater flow patterns ford and williams 2007 drew and goldscheider 2007 goldscheider et al 2008 likewise the existence of springs with high average flow rates or unbalanced water budgets may signal hydrogeological connections between or among cartographically separate permeable outcrops this does not mean that the hydrogeological techniques are always in themselves enough to reduce uncertainty surrounding aquifer behavior therefore there is a need to carefully delineate the geological context of a research site before applying hydrogeological techniques if an adequate geological framework is not available inferences as to the hydrogeological functioning of aquifers will be inaccurate or partial the aim of this work is precisely to highlights the importance of understanding a geological context like in alpine carbonate massif before making related hydrogeological interpretations we underline the back and forth complementarity of geological plus hydrogeological feedback implementing diverse tools hydrodynamic hydrochemical hydrothermal and isotopic ones we show how their simultaneous use can reinforce an understanding of hydrogeological workings based on these intertwined results a more robust conceptual model of the aquifer and its behavior could be established furthermore the integration of geological hydrogeological and water budget data leads to a more precise estimation of the effective catchment area 2 site settings the test site the jarastepar mountain ridge is located roughly 70 km west of the city of malaga and 9 km south of ronda in southern spain fig 1 the relief in this zone is rugged occasionally steep with altitudes ranging from 500 to 1 427 m a s l the region has a temperate mediterranean climate with a marked seasonal pattern in the annual distribution of rainfall mainly in autumn and winter to a lesser extent

period involved in this work from october 2014 to september 2017 could be considered relatively dry and slightly warm average annual rainfall and air temperature values of 764 mm and 15 8 c were recorded in meteorological stations situated between 583 and 1 317 m a s l over the carbonate outcrops fig 1 the average annual rainfall recorded in this site during the four years prior to the research period 2010 11 to 2013 14 was 1085 mm 2 1 geological framework geologically the pilot site and surrounding areas lie within the western most sector of the betic cordillera martín algarra 1987 balanyá et al 2007 expósito et al 2012 it contains rocks from the three main tectonic bodies of the betic cordillera from bottom to top and n to s the external zone the flysch complex and the internal zone the latter domain is a nappe stack in turn involving up to three complexes in this sector of the cordillera from bottom to top and n to s the frontal units almola and nieves and the malaguide and alpujarride complexes the stratigraphic series of the external zone at the pilot site consists of 500 550 m thick jurassic dolostones and limestones which present late triassic clays dolomitic beds sandstones and evaporite rocks mainly gypsum at the bottom and early cretaceous tertiary marly limestones and marls at the top martín algarra 1987 meanwhile the frontal units are made up of a triassic to early miocene succession over than 1 200 m thick largely containing carbonate formations in the nieves unit late triassic dolostones and limestones jurassic limestones and cherty limestones and early miocene carbonate breccias are the prevailing lithologies the sequence of the almola unit includes 200 m thick jurassic limestones followed by early cretaceous and eocene marly limestones and marls martín algarra 1987 mazzoli et al 2013 the malaguide and alpujarride complexes comprise metamorphic rocks mainly schists of paleozoic age finally the flysch complex is broadly formed by tertiary brownish clays and sandstones structural associations involving these geological domains their geometry and limits have been described at a regional scale martín algarra 1987 expósito et al 2012 mazzoli et al 2013 the geological structure of the jarastepar area is particularly complex determined by an overlapping of all the tectonic units having a general vergence toward the nw fig 1 the external zone occupies the lowest tectonic position whereas paleozoic metapellitic rocks from the malaguide and alpujarride complexes occupy the upper part of the accretionary wedge and their outcrops are well represented south of the pilot site the frontal units appear in a lower tectonic position within the internal zone wedge just below a major hanging wall ramp defined by the overthrusting of the malaguide and alpujarride complexes imbricated between the internal and the external zones highly deformed and strongly thinned flysch type clays and sandstones discontinuously exist in a narrow and elongated ne sw outcrop whose trace reflects the suture between the two main zones of the betic cordillera the dip of the primary overthrust surfaces shifts from practically horizontal in the ne

fracturation network have given rise to a labyrinthic karstic landscape featuring small towers and corridors patchy soil cover up to 60 cm thick is found especially where the slope is low overall vegetation is scarce mainly consisting of mediterranean shrub growth on the patchy soils no sources of pollution exist in the recharge area of the aquifer except for some disperse livestock farming 2

natural drainage contributes to the environmental preservation of groundwater ecodependent systems downstream from the springs 3 methods the description of the different methodological procedures employed in this work are detailed in the following sections and they are schematized in the flowchart of fig 3 3 1 geological procedure advances in the knowledge of the geology of the pilot site comes from several field campaigns done in the framework of this scientific contribution and prior geological information martín algarra 1987 balanyá et al 2007 expósito et al 2012 mazzoli et al 2013 as well as a review of thematic cartography igme 1973 1980a b 1981 special attention was given to sectors of greater geological complexity such as the major tectonic contact between the external and internal zones due to their hydrogeological implications updated information stratigraphic contacts strike and dip of the strata faults etc was digitalized and georeferenced using gis software the corpus of geological knowledge was completed by considering data from four boreholes drilled in the area fig 1 in the framework of this study five geological hydrogeological cross sections were performed fig 4 to illustrate the general structure and geometry of the sierra de jarastepar and surrounding areas three of them at the southern border of the pilot site identified as a a b b and c c in fig 4 where the main springs are located another in the central parts of the sierra de jarastepar d d in fig 4 whose orientation is transversal to the general geological structure and the last one e e in fig 4 in the northeastern sector where there is a possible hydrogeological divide 3 2 field survey and monitoring strategy for hydrogeological control in situ measurements of electrical conductivity ec and water temperature wtw cond 315 i and ph hach hq40d were carried out in the five aforementioned springs from october 2014 to september 2017 the accuracy of the records was 1 µs cm for ec 0 1 c for temperature and 0 1 units for ph the average recording periodicity was weekly though in fact it was sometimes even daily in high flow conditions and fortnightly during depletion periods in the case of pozancón spring 52 measurements were taken at outflowing conditions while the rest up to 166 in total were directly performed on the water table inside the cave fig 2 similarly at the alfaguara spring where suitable monitoring of physico chemical parameters was only possible at high water conditions 71 records were obtained at the same time 676 spring water samples were manually collected in 150 ml amber glass bottles transported and stored at temperatures below 4 c for subsequent chemical and isotopic determinations in the laboratory along with field measurements the outlet points were continuously monitored using data logger devices wtw cond 3310 for la zúa hobo onset for huertos and charco springs ott ecolog 800 for pozancón providing 1 h time step records of ec and water temperature variations of water level were also hourly monitored in pozancón shaft extensive to the hydrodynamic response of alfaguara spring given its proximity and la zúa spring respectively using an ott ecolog 800 data logger probe accuracy of 0 05 with 40 m of cable length fig 2 and an odyssey capacitance water level logger 1 mm accuracy in both cases water level variation series were afterwards transformed into continuous records of discharge by applying the corresponding rating equations whose accuracy was checked against individual discharge flow measurements 129 in la zúa using an ott c2 flow meter and 28 joint discharge measurements of pozancón alfaguara with an etrelec salinomadd the correlation coefficient between single measurements and continuous record of water stage was 0 97 for la zúa spring in the case of pozancón alfaguara its rating curve was composed by two equations one derived from situations in which only alfaguara was active and another more when alfaguara and pozancón springs were draining groundwater simultaneously with correlation coefficients values of 0 92 and 0 99 discharge from huertos charco and other secondary springs was punctually controlled by means of an ott c2 flow meter 3 3 analytical procedures chemical and δ13ctdic isotopic analyses were carried out at the laboratory of the center of hydrogeology of the university of malaga cehiuma alkalinity alk as hco3 was determined by volumetric titration using 0 02 n h2so4 to ph 4 45 chemical analyses of the major components ca2 mg2 na k f cl so4 2 no3 were performed through high pressure ionic chromatography hpic metrohm compact 930 ic flex and metrohm compact 881 ic pro with 0 01 mg l accuracy total organic carbon toc was measured with a shimadzu v toc carbon analyzer with an accuracy of 0 05 mg l all these analytical procedures were applied before 24 h since sampling in the field isotopic signature of total dissolved inorganic carbon δ13ctdic was performed with a picarro g1111 i analyzer for isotopic co2 coupled to an oi a aurora 1030 toc analyzer values of δ13ctdic are given in per mil relative to pdb the standard deviations are 0 5 based on replicate measurements of internal standards additionally one sampling campaign was conducted to analyze the sulphur isotope δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 for sampling so4 2 enriched groundwater these determinations were carried out in the technology and science centre of the university of barcelona using an isotope mass ratio spectrometer irms thermofisher delta plus xp water samples were originally pretreated by precipitating so4 2 in the form baso4 through the addition of a concentrated solution of bacl2 50 g l finally the values of partial pressure of co2 logpco2 and the mineral saturation indexes of calcite sical dolomite sidol and gypsum sigyp were calculated using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 1999 3 4 water balance estimation to assess the water budget of the sierra de jarastepar autogenic recharge and total discharge spring outflows and pumping abstractions were independently evaluated for the study period the aplis method andreo et al 2008 2018 marín 2009 was applied for recharge estimation this gis based approach was developed to estimate the mean annual recharge that take places in carbonate aquifers expressed as a percentage of precipitation recharge rate input parameters are average annual precipitation its spatial distribution and a combination of the physical variables found to be the most influential altitude a slope p lithology l infiltration landforms i and soil type s to obtain a map of the average recharge rates previous information is transformed following rating criteria and then corrected by means of a factor fhj ranging between 0 1 and 1 depending on the permeability of the exposed lithologies marín 2009 1 r j a j p j 3 l j 2 i j s j 0 9 f h j multiplying annual rainfall spatially distributed by the infiltration coefficient map eq 1 and by the surface of carbonate outcrops also using spatial analysis tools from gis the total annual recharge for each year and the mean during the study period was calculated the aplis approach has been successfully applied to other carbonate aquifers worldwide representing a range of climatic and geological contexts zagana et al 2011 gerner et al 2012 hartmann et al 2016 the inferred inputs were compared with the water resources drained at the discharge points in all cases mean annual discharge of the springs was calculated through a mathematical integration of hydrographs plotted from single measurements of discharge and continuous records the water budget assessment allowed the effective autogenic recharge area of the pilot site to be estimated 4 results 4 1 geological observations the geological map of fig 1 and the geological cross sections of fig 4 show the structure of the south and southeast borders of pilot site according to background information and specially field observations the cross sections present the lithologies and the main tectonic features around the contact between the external and the internal zones according to the updated information compiled and analyzed in the framework of current research the geostructural features define the hydraulic relationship between the different rocks and ultimately the aquifer s geometry note the overthrust ramps of the alpujarride complex over the frontal units and of the latter over the external zone the presence of imbricated flysch type clays and sandstones between the internal and the external zones and the existence of more recent strike slip faults and normal faults which affect the pre existing compressive structures the geological structure of the external zone within the study area features the normal limb with moderate dip 25 35 of a ne sw anticlinorium fold from which an overthrust develops with vergence toward nw affecting triassic clays expósito et al 2012 the general dip of the bedding planes towards the se determines the presence of cretaceous tertiary marl and marly limestones on the jurassic calcareous rocks near the tectonic suture and consequently under the flysch clays and the internal zone rocks even several kilometers southward from the suture the external zone series appear in a lower tectonic position with respect to the internal zone wedge these deductions were confirmed by data provided from the boreholes drilled on the northeastern edge of the pilot site cross section e e in fig 4 for instance early cretaceous tertiary marls were detected at 82 m depth in a borehole near parauta fig 1 southeast of the tectonic suture the superposition of the nieves unit upon the external zone outcrops is not continuous over the entire internal zone front a tectonic slice of the almola unit whose stratified layers plunge 40 50 toward the se appears imbricated between the external zone and the flysch complex at the bottom and the nieves unit atop cross section e e in fig 4 the outcrops of the almola unit are limited to the vicinity of the almola massif they sharply disappear towards the sw as it was noted by changes of the plane dip of the primary overthrust surfaces from practically horizontal in the ne sector of the site to 30 40 se at the sw border likewise stretch of the nieves unit outcrops whose internal structure corresponds to the normal limb of a large ene wsw trending north verging synform martín algarra 1987 gradually reduced following the same direction as the transpressive regime ne sw dextral strike slip displacements acquires greater weight in the general structure of the pilot site affecting especially to the geometry of the suture plane still the thickness of the brecciated dolostones is the same or somewhat greater towards the sw as revealed by the lithological columns collected in this study in two boreholes up to 200 m depth near cartajima fig 1 and cross section d d in fig 4 the triassic calcareous outcrops cartographically disappear south of alpandeire due to other dextral and normal strike slip faults but having a nw se direction affecting the entire previous structure these strike slip faults are easily visible in places where they separate different lithologies presumably towards the se under the alpujarride and malaguide nappes the permeable rocks belonging to the nieves unit would be found several klippes in the eastern part of the site as well as in other location along the western sector of betic cordillera involving alpujarride complex materials that overlap the triassic carbonate formations are coherent with this hypothesis fig 1 and cross section e e in fig 4 later an extensional deformation phase provoked more recent normal fractures in a ne sw direction jointly affecting the set of geological units this deformation can involve a large part of the lithologic sequences for instance locally affecting the whole thickness of the external zone then generally shifting down along the se blocks as can be seen to the north and northwest of cartajima town fig 1 near the tectonic suture the propagation of extensional deformation was directed throughout the preexisting compressive structures as a result a hydraulic connection between diverse rocks from the external zone jurassic dolostones and limestones and the internal zone triassic dolostones and limestones is feasible cross sections a a b b and c c in fig 4 the magnitude of the fault block displacements and the stratigraphic sequences involved determine the degree of connection and or the establishment of preferential zones for groundwater flows thus a major vertical displacement is inferred near júzcar at least 200 m c c in fig 4 and a minor one in alpandeire a a in fig 4 4 2 hydrodynamic data and water balance table 1 presents the most significant statistical parameters regarding the hydrodynamic response of the springs monitored in this work as well as the results from the water budget estimation made for jarastepar area during the period 2014 15 2016 17 la zúa is the spring with the greatest flow rate 204 l s of average value whereas the lowest flow rates without taking into account the overflow springs alfaguara and pozancón were registered at huertos and charco springs ranging from 25 to 23 l s of average values respectively on the other hand alfaguara and pozancón springs showed a mean annual joint flow rate value of 85 l s if only effective drainage situations are considered the average discharge value is 1 961 l s 1 9 m3 s fig 5 with a maximum flow peak of 21 433 l s 664 8 m a s l november 2014 the spring hydrographs fig 5 indicate various periods when discharge increased in response to the principal recharge periods autumn 2014 winter spring and autumn 2015 spring and autumn 2016 winter spring 2017 significant differences in the shape in the magnitude of the fluctuations of discharge rates also in water level variations in the case of pozancón and in the response to precipitation events are found between the springs located in the internal zone and those in the external zone thus the hydrographs of la zúa charco and huertos springs fig 5 display similar global shapes despite the fact that la zúa spring shows an order of magnitude in discharge values higher than the other two with one or two increases in flow rate per year in response to the main recharge periods it takes several weeks or even a few months to record its maximum flood peak depending on the amount and magnitude of rainfall these variations took place gradually reflecting a buffered hydrodynamic response of the springs located in the internal zone to precipitation events in the external zone in contrast the continuous records of piezometric variations within fig 5 show that during each recharge event there were sharp rises in the water level in pozancón shaft from 0 5 up to 21 8 m approximately between 643 and 664 m a s l the mean response time lag between the rainfall input signal and the hydrodynamic response output signal was about 30 h very quick variations in the mutual outflow dynamic of pozancón and alfaguara springs were likewise detected in response to the main recharge events the corresponding decreases in the water table in pozancón shaft also occurred very rapidly fig 5 whereas very slow variations were recorded at depletion conditions piezometric variations registered in the pozancón shaft fig 5 can be considered representative of the hydrodynamic behavior of the southwestern border of the carbonate formations belonging to the external zone of the aquifer considering the hydrodynamic information the average natural discharge measured from all springs located in the internal zone la zúa charco and huertos amounted to 7 8 hm3 year during the control period table 1a in the case of the external zone 2 7 hm3 year corresponded to the average annual discharge drained by the pozancón alfaguara overflow springs in addition 1 8 hm3 year was estimated for all the secondary springs some of them overflow type located along the northern edge of the aquifer fig 1 finally the mean rate of groundwater extracted by pumping was around 0 1 hm3 year as derived from one active borehole located at the southern border of the external zone fig 1 the mean total discharge measurement in the pilot site was therefore 12 4 hm3 year table 1a mean annual values of recharge indirectly assessed using the aplis method for the study period are summarized in table 1b recharge rates between 24 and 80 of the annual rainfall were obtained from eq 1 equivalent to an average value of 44 for the pilot site as a whole the lowest recharge rates occur in tertiary flysch clays cretaceous tertiary marls and marly limestones and triassic clay outcrops in fig 1 while quaternary deposits show moderate recharge rates an average value of 38 was detected in the triassic and jurassic carbonate outcrops of the internal zone increasing up to 50 on the average in the case of the permeable outcrops of the external zone according to the results obtained using the aplis method the average value of recharge 1 2 hm3 year occurring over the 3 km2 of triassic dolomitic outcrops nieves unit southern sector the aquifer fig 1 was clearly lower than the mean annual volume of water resources drained by the springs located in the internal zone 7 8 hm3 year table 1a similarly the recharge amount estimated for the external zone outcrops 9 7 hm3 year is not coherent with the discharge measured in this sector of the aquifer 4 6 hm3 year table 1a even the combined contribution of the autogenic infiltration occurring in the aforementioned sectors of the aquifer 1 2 9 7 hm3 year is inferior to the total value of the discharge measured for the pilot site 12 4hm3 year table1a a consistent approximation to the water budget 12 8 hm3 year table1b is only reached when the surface considered in the aplis routine is extended towards the e so that the catchment area of the aquifer includes the carbonate formations belonging to the almola and nieves units fig 1 hence a maximum apparent contributing area of 38 km2 to recharge the jarastepar aquifer can be invoked in view of geological field evidences and considering the aplis method as a suitable way to obtain realistic results as in other karst aquifers worldwide zagana et al 2011 gerner et al 2012 hartmann et al 2016 4 3 spatial variability of hydrochemical and isotopic composition of groundwater table 2 presents the most significant statistical parameters concerning the results of the in situ measurements and selected chemical and isotopic determinations performed in the framework of this work results in table 2 and fig 6 show that the mean mineralization and temperature values in the water from pozancón are slightly lower when this outlet is active average contents of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 respectively vary from 56 1 4 6 and 5 5 mg l alfaguara to 71 5 5 4 and 10 2 mg l pozancón cave whereas a higher mean value for alkalinity was recorded in the water samples collected in the shaft 218 5 mg l and a lower one at alfaguara spring 179 4 mg l in contrast the groundwater drained by the springs located in the internal zone shows clearly higher mineralization and temperature values fig 6 with a progressive increase of ec and temperature from 1 564 μs cm and 15 7 c la zúa to 1 866 μs cm and 16 6 c huertos as the altitude of the outflow points falls in general terms ca2 and so4 2 are by far the most abundant ions in the water samples collected in these springs followed by hco3 and mg2 the highest mean concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 were always found in the water drained by huertos spring table 2 followed by charco and la zúa springs average concentrations of cl and na are similar or slightly higher than those obtained for the water drained by the overflow springs situated in the external zone all the spring waters showed low or very low toc and no3 contents table 2 fig 6 though they are somewhat higher in the outlets along the external zone outcrops with mean values ranging from 0 3 la zúa charco and huertos to 0 8 mg l pozancón cave and from 3 5 charco to 7 6 mg l pozancón outflowing respectively only single determinations of both parameters recorded in alfaguara and pozancón springs reveal an incipient degree of contamination affecting the aquifer all analyzed water samples were undersaturated with respect to gypsum table 2 although the more mineralized waters internal zone were close to equilibrium sigyp 0 groundwater samples from the external zone were clearly undersaturated in dolomite while those of the internal zone presented positive average values for sidol table 2 fig 6 the mean maximum value being that of huertos spring most samples had a positive calcite saturation index sical reflecting equilibrium or an oversaturation in this mineral phase higher mean values were again reached in la zúa charco and huertos springs table 2 fig 6 yet the greatest variability for this parameter corresponds to pozancón both under outflowing and non outflowing conditions partial pressure of co2 for alfaguara spring is the lowest of the whole set of outlets and its mean value logpco2 2 5 best approximates the atmospheric equilibrium value higher mean values were calculated for the springs located in the internal zone table 2 which indicates a greater co2 enrichment with respect to the atmospheric air table 2 and the box plots of fig 6 also present stable isotopic values for the inorganic carbon δ13ctdic dissolved in groundwater from the pilot site the mean δ13ctdic values range considerably from the most depleted samples taken in alfaguara and pozancón 12 4 and 12 9 to the most enriched ones from huertos and charco springs 5 9 and 6 0 in the case of groundwater from the external zone the obtained values of δ13ctdic are similar to the theoretical δ13ctdic equilibrium mean value 13 2 pozancón cave calculated following previous studies in karst system emblanch 1997 batiot 2002 and assuming a δ13cco2 g signal of 17 from a gibraltar cave mattey et al 2010 in general the springs hosted in the internal zone of the aquifer drain water having enriched values of δ13ctdic as well as higher mean mineralization and temperature finally fig 7 shows results of the isotopic composition of the dissolved sulphate in groundwater δ34s so4 and δ18o so4 from the three water samples taken at depletion conditions in the outlets located in the internal zone the values of the two stable isotopes are very similar varying from 12 4 huertos to 12 5 charco and zúa for δ18o so4 and from 15 1 zúa to 15 3 charco for δ34s so4 the biplot diagram of δ34s so4 vs δ18o so4 points to the dissolution of triassic evaporite rocks gypsum as the most plausible explanation of sulphate in the groundwater of the entire study area δ18o so4 from 12 to 14 garcía veigas et al 2013 the two main factors of the principal component analysis pca provide 83 16 of explained variance fig 8 a the positive value of factor 1 explaining 60 73 is determined by ec so4 2 ca2 mg2 f and water temperature fig 8a these variables would be related to the dissolution of evaporite rocks gypsum associated with the drainage of more mineralized water with longer residence time within the aquifer and flowing mainly in the saturated zone toc and no 3 tracers of infiltration from the soil appear among the negative part of f1 and positive part of f2 in turn cl na and alkalinity variables are situated towards the positive parts of f1 and f2 the last variable comes from the dissolution of carbonates mainly calcite whereas cl and na values could derive predominantly from the concentration by evaporation of rain water in the soil therefore factor 2 with 22 43 of the variability distinguishes the hydrochemical signature of the variables related to low mineralization primarily due to the dissolution of calcite and to shorter residence time of groundwater flowing through the soil epikarst unsaturated zone fig 8a the data set 634 samples from the springs of jarastepar aquifer differs into two main groups fig 8b alfaguara and pozancón waters plot to the left of the diagram negative side of the f1 axis showing minor values of water mineralization on the contrary samples collected at huertos charco and la zúa springs appear at the positive side of f1 the samples from the less mineralized spring waters are more disperse fig 8b especially in the case of pozancón overflow where we find samples enriched in toc and no3 together with higher values of alkalinity cl and na than in the samples with little mineralization 4 4 time series figs 9 10 11 and 12 show the temporal evolutions of discharge also water level in the case of pozancón ec temperature and the main hydrochemical and isotopic parameters listed in table 2 from each of the springs monitored in this work the figures also display the daily rainfall recorded in the pilot site during the study period see location of the weather station in fig 1 the springs located in the internal zone figs 10 11 and 12 presented markedly diverse hydrochemical and hydrothermal responses to precipitation events especially when compared to those recorded at pozancón spring fig 9 the latter referred figure includes hydrochemical information from samples collected within pozancón cave directly from the water table light colored dots in fig 9 and in outflowing conditions dark colored dots data for alfaguara spring are not represented in fig 9 due to the similarity of their hydrochemical behavior a general seasonal fluctuation in temperature ec and chemical composition of pozancón water can be seen in fig 9 the values of all these parameters were higher during the autumn coinciding with the first rainfall events of the hydrological year and lower in spring and summer more specifically each recharge episode commonly provoked different magnitude increases in mineralization and temperature as the piezometric level inside pozancón rose however this pattern was suddenly interrupted during the most significant recharge events when the water table went up above the threshold defined by alfaguaras altitude 658 m a s l the magnitude of these dilutions up to 45 with respect to the maximum value of ec depends on the previous hydrodynamic conditions of the aquifer and on the volume of new recharge water changes in ec and temperature were followed by fast rises of equal magnitude as the flow rate and especially water level decreased until reaching similar values prior to dilution once the drainage from alfaguara spring ceased the variations in ec in pozancón waters were clearly influenced by changes in alkalinity and ca2 content and to a lesser extent in so4 2 fig 9 likewise small drops in mg2 contents were recorded when alfaguara and pozancón springs were active mg2 values tend to decrease during high water conditions and to increase progressively with falling water levels inside the spring until the next recharge meanwhile the contents of toc and no3 follow the general pattern of mineralization they tend to be greater during recharge events especially at the beginning of the hydrogeological year fig 9 and diminish as the aquifer underwent to low water conditions the temporal evolutions of both natural markers of recently infiltrated water also reflect sudden decreases even the lowest yearly values coinciding with the aerial outflowing stages whereas the subsequent quick and progressive rises of the toc and no3 content are seen whenever superficial drainage finished in terms of δ13ctdic the values tend to be more negative during high water conditions and progressively but slightly rise in the absence of recharge in summer months reaching a maximum at the beginning of the hydrogeological year in autumn the most negative values were recorded in the water samples gathered in the pozancón shaft before or just after the outflowing periods and frequently coinciding with the highest toc and no3 contents fig 9 in general terms a decrease in pco2 values immediately follows recharge and then it gradually increases during low water conditions in some of the most significant recharge events i e october 2015 the water drained by pozancón spring even reached the atmospheric equilibrium value of logpco2 3 5 regarding the time series of the hydrochemical parameters measured in the water drained by the springs sited in the internal zone figs 10 11 and 12 some differences in the magnitude and the response times to precipitation events can be observed the magnitude of dilutions in huertos spring following seasonal rainfall generally coinciding with flow peaks fig 10 depends on the degree of mixing between the recently infiltrated rainwater and the groundwater stored in the aquifer the higher the volume of infiltrated rain with respect to stored water the greater the dilution e g autumn 2016 winter 2017 fig 10 after each dilution when the rain ceased mineralization progressively rose although this recovery could be interrupted by subsequent precipitations causing new dilutions a marked rising trend in ec values under depletion conditions was observed in charco spring during the study period fig 11 from values around 1650 µs cm at the end of 2014 to approximately 1700 µs cm in summer 2017 this hydrochemical trend was disrupted in the most significant recharge periods when sharp falls in water mineralization up to 159 µs cm occurred in 13 days dilutions were followed by quick increases of similar magnitudes or even greater in ec when the influence of recharge water ceased finally la zúa is the outlet presenting the smallest hydrochemical variations during the study period fig 12 there are only buffered and lagged dilutions of up to 87 μs cm in the course of 15 days after precipitation water from the springs located in the internal zone displays virtually no hydrothermal variations recharge has little or no influence on groundwater temperature general changes in the water mineralization of huertos charco and la zúa springs are mainly due to variations in so4 2 contents and to a lesser extent in ca2 and mg2 figs 10 11 and 12 which evolved similarly to ec values on occasion significant recharge events provoked decreases in these parameters followed by increases whose minimum values coincide with the flood peaks on the other hand toc and no3 contents tend to be higher particularly toc in the three springs at high water situations still increases in both these natural tracers of infiltration after rainfall were preceded by accentuated decreases if significant rainfall occurred i e november 2015 figs 10 11 and 12 as well as drops in the values of so4 2 mg2 and ca2 such behavior was always more clearly observed in huertos spring fig 10 than in charco fig 11 or la zúa springs fig 12 in fact slight and gradual rises of toc and no3 contents rather than falls were seen for huertos spring where the maximum values coincide with the minima for ec with a time lag of several weeks after the last rainfall episode the springs located in the internal zone of the aquifer presented remarkable variations in δ13ctdic values during the control period showing clear similarities with the temporal evolutions of ec in the three cases the most negative values were recorded during recharge periods whereas δ13ctdic values tend towards enrichment at recession stages relatively sharp variations in δ13c occurred simultaneously in the three outlets during the recharge event of may 2016 this is especially observable in la zúa spring fig 12 where the least negative values of the time series up to 5 03 were recorded possibly caused by a piston flow effect as a consequence of 78 mm of precipitation in two days finally during recharge periods groundwater drained by the springs located in the internal zone showed an initial decline in logpco2 values followed by rises as the flow rate approached depletion conditions figs 10 11 and 12 5 discussion and interpretation 5 1 geological structure and related hydrodynamic and hydrogeochemical processes in view of the geological characteristics of the pilot site and surrounding areas illustrated in the cross sections of fig 4 the spatial distribution and geometry of the different geological formations involved in the aquifer functioning can be inferred the permeable jurassic carbonate rocks belonging to the external zone must be hydraulically connected with the triassic rocks located in the internal zone having an inner geometry defined mainly by the accretionary overthrust surfaces and subsequent normal faults results from the water budget implemented in this study table 1 are coherent with transferences of water resources among the calcareous formations involved from the external zone nw towards the nieves unit se and also with the geological position and lower altitude of the permanent springs la zúa charco and huertos situated at the southern border of the aquifer furthermore no permanent karst springs drain the jurassic limestones indeed alfaguara and pozancón shaft are overflow springs however the presence of flysch type clays and sandstones discontinuously imbricated between the internal and external permeable rocks and even the cretaceous tertiary marly limestones and marls could restrict the hydraulic continuity thus provoking strong heterogeneities in groundwater flow patterns hydraulic connections would moreover be affected by local structural features primarily the magnitude of the vertical displacement related to the normal faults near the tectonic suture or fault displacement exceeding or not the thickness of the intervening aquicludes the geological cross sections fig 4 also reflect the thickness reached in the study area 500 600 m by the carbonate rocks which could be greater by juxtaposition of the different permeable units for instance considering the tectonic nappe of almola ridge as a part of the aquifer following the water balance criteria and the aplis method results table 1 the hydrostratigraphic sequence in this sector would extend up to 700 m cross section e e in fig 4 there is a noteworthy absence of outlet points related to almola ridge despite the fact that its limestone outcrops are almost completely surrounded by low permeability material fig 1 hence substantial development of the unsaturated and saturated zones could concur in some sectors of the aquifer especially at the vertical of the tectonic contact among the external and internal zones given the structural configuration of the pilot site accordingly the storage capacity of the aquifer could be a significant factor bearing a strong influence on the hydrodynamic response of the permanent springs fig 5 as occurs in some karst systems el hakim and bakalowicz 2007 the role of the geological structure in the hydrogeological behavior of the sierra de jarastepar aquifer is also evidenced by the marked heterogeneity found in the hydrochemical hydrothermal and isotopic characteristics of groundwater and in related processes fig 6 groundwater flows with an initial chemical composition reflecting the dissolution of limestone rocks table 2 figs 6 8 and 13 a gradually acquire higher temperature and mineralization values this is consistent with the existence of longer and deeper flows through the aquifer towards the springs located at lower altitudes the rising contents in all chemical components particularly so4 2 ca2 and mg2 together with the data reported for δ34sso4 δ18oso4 fig 7 garcía veigas et al 2013 ortí et al 2014 would denote dissolution processes mainly affecting gypsum dispersed within the late triassic clays of the external zone series or in contact with the gypsum bearing basement such processes have great implications for the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater as can be inferred from the molar relationships displayed in the biplots of fig 13 the situation slightly below the stoichiometric 1 1 line in the ca2 vs so4 2 plot gypsum dissolution of huertos charco and la zúa water samples fig 13b suggests calcite precipitation ca2 excesses fig 13a linked to a common ion effect wigley 1973 appelo and postma 2005 the fact that groundwater drained by the springs located in the internal zone was always saturated and oversaturated respect to calcite sical 0 table 2 fig 6 is coherent with the existence of progressively major travertine outcrops downstream from the three permanent outlets as its altitude falls fig 1 likewise the increasing mg2 contents observed in the springs located in the internal zone figs 6 and 13 is due to the progressively longer interaction of groundwater with dolostone rocks stratigraphically below limestones in the external zone series and forming the nieves unit in the saturated zone of the aquifer in addition to an evaporite origin lópez chicano et al 2001 martos rosillo et al 2013 the 3 1 stoichiometric line that defines ca2 vs mg2 in the groundwater from huertos spring fig 13c can be explained by the dedolomitization effect a geochemical process involving multi mineral phases such as gypsum calcite and dolomite wigley 1973 appelo and postma 2005 the presence of rich so4 2 and ca2 fluids in dissolution as the main product in the gypsum dissolution reaction could induce calcite precipitation due to ca2 excess the aforementioned common ion effect and a subsequent reduction of hco3 contents this combined effect accelerates the dolomite dissolution reaction kinetics as a consequence of the high capability of the water to dissolve more carbonate minerals if calcite and dolomite availability is sufficient resulting in a greater mg2 mass transference appelo and postma 2005 moral et al 2008 the slight deviation from the 3 1 line of charco spring and more pronounced in la zúa indicates their impoverishment in mg2 therefore although groundwater with significant mean residence time is drained through the outlets by the internal zone the waters that are less evolved geochemically would have undergone shorter water rock interactions particularly in deeper compartments featuring evaporite layers plummer et al 1990 capaccioni et al 2001 mcmahon et al 2004 carucci et al 2012 the δ13ctdic results fig 6 table 2 confirm previous deductions regarding the storage capacities and residence times of groundwater within the saturated zone as well as the water rock interactions the higher proportion of water coming from the unsaturated zone characterized by short residence times determines the real and theoretical δ13ctdic signal of groundwater in the external zone of the aquifer giving values closer to the carbon isotopic signature of the soil 22 deines 1980 drever 1982 clark and fritz 1997 in contrast the less negative values of δ13ctdic of the permanent springs at the southern border of the aquifer corroborate that they drain water of progressively longer residence time within the aquifer mainly in the saturated zone where the δ13ctdic signature tends to equilibrium with the carbonate rock matrix 0 clark and fritz 1997 in the highly complex geological context of the pilot site the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of la zúa spring denote 1 a geochemical stage less evolved than in the other springs located in the internal zone or 2 a possibly greater influence of short residence flows in groundwater mixing involving larger transferences of water resources from the external zone permeable rocks the second option would be in agreement with the markedly higher volume of groundwater annually drained by this outlet table1 fig 5 accordingly a preferential zone with better hydraulic properties can be envisaged north northeast of la zúa spring fig 1 in that sector jurassic and triassic calcareous outcrops are cartographically separated by just a few meters in a narrow band 1500 m long logically the hydrogeological uncertainty inherent to these deductions could be reduced by integrating further types of quantitative observations such as tracer test results subsurface hydraulic connections within the external zone of the aquifer from the central part of the sierra de jarastepar to pozancón and alfaguara springs were recently determined through a multi injection tracer test performed in 2016 at high water conditions de la torre et al 2017 barberá et al 2017 5 2 hydrogeological functioning the quick and substantial variations in piezometric level temperature ec and most hydrochemical parameters analyzed in the water from pozancón shaft fig 9 indicate a very low capacity of the carbonate rocks of the external zone to modulate the input signal rainfall recharge effects are almost instantaneously transmitted to the saturated zone due to the good development of karst conduits within the unsaturated zone this is consistent with the general variations observed in toc and no3 contents and with the δ13ctdic signal direct measurements and theoretical calculations suggesting a significant contribution of rapid flows of fresh recharge water from the soil and epikarst to the functioning of the aquifer in addition the inferred behavior is conditioned by groundwater stored in the saturated zone of this sector as can be discerned from the increases in water temperature ec and the most influential components alk and ca2 that took place systematically at the beginning of the hydrological year fig 9 the rises in water mineralization were simultaneous to those in no3 and toc contents hence autumn recharge events provoked a general mobilization of water previously stored in both the unsaturated and the saturated zones the latter with a notable thickness at the sw edge of the external zone close to the tectonic suture fig 1 and cross section a a in fig 4 the inferred karst network acquires particular relevance in the behavior pattern of the external zone of the aquifer after significant recharge events when the water level rises and exceeds the overflow altitudinal threshold a feature commonly found in karst aquifers with functional overflow springs barberá and andreo 2012 lauber and goldscheider 2014 brkic et al 2018 under these conditions increases in the hydraulic head proportional to the magnitude of recharge together with the high hydraulic conductivity found in this sector of the aquifer would induce a sudden modification of flow velocities into the conduits that begin to feed the overflow springs consequently a well defined groundwater flow path with great drainage capacity is established allowing the fast arrival of recently infiltrated water towards the temporary discharge zone and leading to increases in flow rates up to 20 m3 s as a result in the groundwater mixing drained through the outlets the fraction of freshwater directly coming from the surface abruptly grows the water shows lower mineralization and temperature values but also lower contents in natural tracers of infiltration due to soil leaching during previous recharge episodes and or because the recharge volume is such that its concentrations in groundwater are even diluted the lower soil water interaction moreover induces quick falls in pco2 values even reaching the atmospheric equilibrium value and slight rises in the δ13ctdic signal of groundwater as it tends to be in equilibrium with the δ13cco2 signal of the atmosphere 8 friedli et al 1986 cerling et al 1991 clark and fritz 1997 this is an uncommon process in karst systems but it was described by banks 2018 in vadu crişului karst basin in the apuseni mountains nw romania unlike the well established karst drainage network of the jurassic sector of the aquifer external zone a certain natural regulatory capacity for the triassic calcareous rocks of the internal zone may be inferred a priori according to the classical interpretation of the lagged and buffered responses to precipitation events recorded in the permanent springs figs 10 11 and 12 that is a typical fissured or diffuse flow behavior pattern for the southern sector of the aquifer could be deduced after analyzing results following conventional hydrogeological criteria perrin et al 2003 jeannin et al 2007 mudarra and andreo 2011 in this case however the specific responses of the outlets and their variability cannot be exclusively attributed to the intrinsic functioning of the carbonate rocks as a whole the geological complexity of the pilot site is always a factor to be considered imbricated flysch type clays and sandstones and cretaceous tertiary marly limestones and marls regulate groundwater transferences and attenuate the input signals coming from the external zone carbonate outcrops typified by pozancón spring water figs 6 and 9 hence strong heterogeneities in the hydraulic properties involving the different formations among the internal and external zones contribute to modulating the global response of each permanent spring the aquifer appears to have an inertial behavior pattern but in fact it shows global karst functioning to be taken into account in addition is the modulating role exerted by the thick saturated zone that exits in the vertical of the tectonic contact where triassic permeable rocks are possibly confined under the paleozoic metapellitic formations alpujárride and maláguide complexes therefore by applying a combined geological and hydrogeological approach a more realistic conceptual model for the pilot site can be adequately developed in accordance with its functioning fig 14 rainwater infiltrated over the carbonate outcrops of sierra de jarastepar flows in s and se directions and is finally drained by the permanent springs la zúa charco and huertos sited at the internal zone and punctually by the overflow springs alfaguara and pozancón located south of the carbonate outcrop of the external zone ultimately the proposed conceptual model entails a sole aquifer formed by rocks of different ages belonging to several geological domains but hydrogeologically connected where two basic types of flow behavior or regulatory capacities of water resources can be discerned fig 14 most of the discharge occurs naturally by means of the permanent springs located at lower altitudes in the internal zone through which warm and mineralized groundwater is drained the greater residence time of the groundwater component in the media thus lengthy water rock interaction means a greater content in solutes along its long and deep flowpaths in high water conditions the aquifer geometry and the strong hydraulic heterogeneities would impede full drainage of the recharge volume by the permanent outlets moreover good hydrogeological connections between the recharge area and the overflow outlets would exist given the hierarchically well developed drainage network established in the external zone sector of the aquifer as a result of the structural framework and the markedly karst behavior sharp rises in water level and the subsequent activation of overflow springs take place from which cooler and poorly mineralized waters are drained in a context of high geological complexity the lack of precise information on the geometry of the different permeable formations as well as on their hydraulic relationships hampers efforts addressed to accurately inferring the hydrogeological behavior of carbonate aquifers structural features that control groundwater movement can furthermore lead to imprecisions when the extent of the catchment area for water recharge is assessed by simultaneously applying as many experimental methods and characterizing techniques as possible a more reliable understanding of aquifer characteristics and a better appraisal of available water resources can be attained drew and goldscheider 2007 mudarra et al 2019 there is always a risk of drawing inaccurate conclusions about the functioning of aquifers not considering how prior geological knowledge is translated into the hydrogeological sphere the pilot site called for deeper geological insight since hydrogeological techniques in themselves did not suffice to reduce uncertainty surrounding the aquifer behavior for example attending exclusively to the hydrodynamic analysis of the permanent springs fig 5 a clear decomposition of recession curves could be carried out using mangin s methodology mangin 1975 nevertheless the changes in discharge rate at huertos charco and la zúa springs are not properly linked to flows through the unsaturated and saturated zones they reflect how the geological complexity and the saturated zone modulate the signal derived from the hydraulic head variations in the external zone of the aquifer likewise the application of hydrogeological research methods can help to resolve specific questions in areas where geological knowledge is not enough certain hydrogeological techniques prove especially useful for discerning the tectonic relationships between different geological domains or to validate hypotheses about a geological structure häuselmann et al 1999 sanz de galdeano et al 2019 hence transferring knowledge from geological to hydrogeological approaches and vice versa feedback leads researchers to an enhanced understanding of hydrogeological systems and ultimately serves to better manage water resources 6 conclusions in tectonically complex areas such as the peri mediterranean alpine orogenic belt an adequate comprehension of the geological framework is crucial for successfully addressing hydrogeological investigations knowledge of the hydrogeological functioning in these areas especially regarding the estimation of limits and geometry and the storage patterns and flow dynamics could be adequately inferred after applying a combined geological and hydrogeological approach the pilot site that acts as example in this work is formed by carbonate rocks of different ages belonging to several paleogeography domains of the betic cordillera external and internal zones that are hydrogeologically connected structural features overthrust surfaces and subsequent normal faults and different low permeable formations involving both domains imbricated within the tectonic suture induce strong heterogeneities in groundwater flow patterns resulting in very short to much longer water rock interactions along flow paths the geological complexity and the existence of a thick saturated zone at the southeast border of the aquifer jointly modulate the original hydrodynamic hydrochemical and isotopic signals they point to a typical karst functioning for the external zone which is attenuated before arriving at the permanent spring found in the internal zone during this process groundwater evolves geochemically and acquires gradually higher temperature and mineralization values owing to significant increases in the residence time within the aquifer the natural responses of the permanent springs studied could have easily been misinterpreted if the results were analyzed following conventional hydrogeological criteria without attention to the intrinsic geological characteristics of the area an inertial behavior pattern would have been deduced for the aquifer when it actually has a general karst functioning by combining conventional and cheap methods e g geological mapping and the estimation of groundwater budget components one can easily deduce reliable information about the hydrogeological workings of karst aquifers in tectonically complex areas accordingly feedback between geology and hydrogeology must be constantly conducted and compared so as to fine tune interpretations of an aquifer s behavior the results may prove crucial for enhanced protection and management of water resources since they have direct implications for spring protection and the environmental preservation of groundwater ecodependent systems this is especially important when dealing with complex mountainous areas declaration of competing interest the

8598,global and continental scale hydrological reanalysis datasets receive growing attention due to their increasing number of applications ranging from water resources management climate change studies water related hazards and policy support until recently their use was mostly limited to qualitative assessments due to their coarse spatial and temporal resolution large uncertainty and bias in the model output and limited extent of the dataset in space and time this research reports on the setup of a gridded hydrological model with quasi global coverage able to reproduce a seamless 39 year streamflow simulation in all world s medium to large river basins the model was calibrated at 1226 river sections with a total drainage area of 51 million km2 within 66 countries using ecmwf s latest atmospheric reanalysis era5 a performance assessment revealed large improvements in reproducing past discharge observations in comparison to the calibration used in the current operational setup of the hydrological model as part of the copernicus global flood awareness system glofas www globalfloods eu with median scores of kling gupta efficiency kge 0 67 and correlation r 0 8 the simulation bias was also dramatically reduced and narrowed around zero with more than 60 of stations showing percent bias within 20 pronounced regional differences in the simulation results remain pointing out the need for detailed investigation of the hydrological processes in specific regions including parts of africa and south asia in addition observed discharges with high data quality is key to achieving skillful model output the new calibrated model will become part of the operational runs of glofas in the next system release foreseen for spring 2020 together with a near real time

configurations of inputs models and parameterization among them several pointed out that relatively large gaps remain between output discharges and observations at gauged river sections mostly due to quality issues in the meteorological input dataset incorrect model parameterization missing or simplified processes and insufficient space time resolution of input and output which often limit model results to qualitative assessments or to selected rivers and regions where the modeling is acceptable coordinated multi model initiatives such as the watermip haddeland et al 2011 and the earth2observe schellekens et al 2017 projects aimed to characterize the variability of the simulated runoff in large rivers using ensembles of global hydrological simulations produced at the common grid resolution of 0 5 although both projects acknowledged the added value of an ensemble of simulations results showed large discrepancies due to different concepts and parameterization in modeling the runoff generation schellekens et al 2017 and the lack of a common protocol to calibrate and validate the participating models beck et al 2017 compared runoff estimates from 10 macro scale hydrological models with observations from 966 medium sized catchments around the globe they found large differences among the different model output and higher scores for regions with calibrated model parameterization the calibration always brings benefits in river sections where accurate observations are available though its effect is reduced as one moves away from the calibration points even if along the same river network xue et al 2016 as a consequence the performance of a calibrated hydrological model can vary substantially across different river basins hence pointing out the importance to calibrate as many river basins as possible this is often in contrast with the limited availability of observed data as well as with the considerable computing resources needed to perform each calibration run model calibration is an iterative process involving a large number of model runs where a set of parameters is perturbed so that differences between the model output and the observations at the corresponding location are minimized the number of iterations required and the corresponding computing time proportional to the computing resources increase with the size of the parameter set to optimize yet often enabling improved model skills however the size of the calibration parameter set should not be too large to avoid model overfitting and consequent loss of predictive skills outside the calibration period wi et al 2015 kouchi et al 2017 tested the sensitivity of calibration parameters to 1 different objective functions and 2 optimization algorithms they found that most combinations of the two considered sets can achieve skillful results though resulting in different configurations of the parameter values hence in large scale calibration exercises the optimal configuration should take into account also the efficiency of the optimization algorithms that is favoring those reaching a skillful parameter set with the minimum number of iterations in this

external forcing and has higher spatial 31 vs 79 km and vertical 137 vs 60 levels resolution in addition it includes uncertainty information by providing an ensemble of 10 reanalysis members at a coarser horizontal resolution the era5 dataset includes hourly output with near real time availability 2 to 5 day latency known as era5t which makes it particularly appealing for the daily updating of the global hydrological conditions used to initialize streamflow forecasting systems such as glofas era5t is used for the initialization of operational glofas forecasts since november 2018 the improvements introduced in era5 include features such as tropical cyclones better orography coastal process and related weather phenomena and medium range atmospheric forecasts initialized with era5 show an increase in skill of about one day in comparison to those initialized with era interim hersbach et al 2018 recent studies in the united states have shown that era5 performs substantially better than era interim in modeling precipitation beck et al 2019 as well as when used to force land surface albergel et al 2018 and hydrological tarek et al 2019 models in this study we used daily maps of precipitation daily mean surface air temperature and relative humidity incoming solar radiation net longwave radiation and mean wind speed extracted from era5 for 40 complete years between 1979 and 2018 this is one of the main changes in comparison with the previous calibration exercise based on the same variables yet extracted from the control run of ecmwf reforecasts in the period 1995 2015 some variables were processed to compute estimates of potential evapotranspiration using the penman monteith equation as described in supit at al 1994 this is one of the main dynamic input variables of the hydrological model lisflood together with daily mean surface air temperature and daily precipitation era5 input variables were aggregated from hourly to daily values and downscaled from the original resolution to the output resolution of 0 1 deg through a bilinear interpolation method 2 2 methods 2 2 1 hydrological model and calibration parameters hydrological simulations are performed with lisflood van der knijff et al 2010 a distributed semi physically based model developed at the joint research centre jrc of the european commission such model differs from the operational glofas setup i e calibration version v 2018 which is based on a combination of the hydrology tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchanges over land htessel balsamo et al 2011 ecmwf s land surface scheme and a simplified version of lisflood to simulate the groundwater processes and the river routing see alfieri et al 2013 the choice of a different modeling framework for the new glofas version is motivated by the need for better control on all the calibration parameters through the use of only one model as well as the need to maintain only one lisflood version to be used both in efas and glofas so that any model development benefits both early warning systems processes simulated by lisflood include soil freezing snowmelt surface runoff lakes and reservoirs water abstraction infiltration preferential flow redistribution of soil moisture within the soil profile drainage to the groundwater system groundwater storage and base flow surface runoff is produced at every grid cell and routed through the river network using a kinematic wave approach chow et al 1988 the current model version includes 463 lakes and 687 reservoirs zajac et al 2017 selected among the world s largest ones listed in the global lakes and wetlands database glwd lehner and döll 2004 and the global reservoir and dam database grand lehner et al 2011 the lake outflow is related to the lake level using the poleni weir equation bollrich 1992 for reservoirs the outflow is calculated with a set of rules depending on their filling level see burek et al 2013 zajac et al 2017 accurate and up to date spatial information in the hydrological modeling is important to avoid over parameterization and reduce the dimensionality of the calibration spatial datasets used in lisflood include topography maps i e digital elevation model local drainage direction slope gradient elevation range land use i e land use classes forest fraction fraction of urban area soil i e soil texture classes soil depth and channel geometry i e channel gradient roughness coefficient bankfull channel depth channel length bottom width and side slope most input datasets parameters and variables necessary for the model are estimated a priori from available global products such as the shuttle radar topography mission srtm jarvis et al 2008 dataset for elevation the globcover 2009 bontemps et al 2011 for land use the soilgrids1km database hengl et al 2014 for soil information the global river network database wu et al 2012 for river network and flow direction the global width database of large rivers yamazaki et al 2014 for river widths the spot vgt data http wdc dlr de data products surface lai for monthly maps of leaf area index lai among others water abstraction maps are representative of the year 2000 they are derived from the work by wada et al 2011 and modeled with 12 monthly maps for the domestic and livestock sector and with a constant pattern for the energy and industrial sector lisflood underpins a number of large scale applications particularly over europe where it is used in the context of the european flood awareness system efas see alfieri et al 2014a bartholmes et al 2009 thielen et al 2009 and in climate change impact assessment studies alfieri et al 2015 dankers and feyen 2009 rojas et al 2012 in this work we used a quasi global setup spanning latitudes 60 s to 90 n over a 0 1 grid and 1 day time step covering all the main earth s land areas except antarctica greenland and iceland a set of eight model parameters was selected for calibration see table 1 following recommendations from previous works beck et al 2017 hirpa et al 2018 who identified the most relevant model parameters for lisflood in terms of model sensitivity and uncertainty of the default values differently from those works no calibration parameter specific to lakes and reservoirs was included 1 to limit the dimensionality of the optimization process and the overall number of model runs and 2 so that all catchments ultimately have the same number of calibrated parameters i e including those with no lake or reservoirs the impact of such choice will be investigated in the evaluation phase particularly for reservoirs where the actual operation rules may differ from the modelled one further details on the modeling of reservoirs in lisflood are included in the supplement 2 2 2 station selection river stations selected for calibration stem from a global database of about 2100 stations maintained in house at the jrc resulting from the collection of discharge observations from around 30 data providers worldwide we performed a screening to identify the stations to calibrate following recommendations from previous calibration exercises the following procedure was thus implemented stations where the drainage area was not reported by the provider were initially removed the absolute relative difference between the drainage area derived from the model flow direction map and reported by each data provider had to be smaller than 20 e g xue et al 2016 the official drainage area had to be larger than 5 000 km2 following the recommendations by alfieri et al 2013 at least 4 years of observed daily data had to be available i e 4 365 values excluding gaps in the calibration period remaining data up to 8 years were used for model validation while in case of time series longer than 8 years the dataset was split equally between calibration and validation as suggested by klemeš 1986 when two stations fell in the same grid point the station with the longest observed time series was retained 14 stations were removed by this criterion some stations which were close to each other along the same river were removed the idea behind this criterion is to avoid calibrating clusters of stations where the downstream ones bring little benefit and often generate anomalous calibrated parameter values as they are constrained by the simulated inflow of the upstream station and by the discharge rating curve at each station and their uncertainty to this end we numerically identified the upstream downstream relation among stations lying in the same river basin then a threshold value of 10 was imposed as minimum relative difference in drainage area of a downstream station to the closest one along the upstream river network and removed the stations with smaller relative difference a number of stations were then removed or added on the basis of a comparison and skill evaluation between the observed discharge time series and the corresponding model run with default i e uncalibrated parameters this step was necessary to remove data pairs with unexplained large differences possibly related to a combination of wrong station positioning large human influence and errors in the metadata in the reported discharge time series in unrepresented processes or in the model input e g hamilton and moore 2012 wang et al 2018 also it compensates for the absence of a dedicated data quality control system on the observations dataset as a result we removed all stations with a ratio larger than 11 between the average observed and simulated discharge time series as well as its inverse ratio i e pbias 91 or pbias greater than 1000 in addition stations previously excluded due to drainage area not reported by the provider were reinstated if the kge in the uncalibrated run was larger than zero hence proving some modeling skills knoben et al 2019 the selection procedure described above produced a list of 1226 calibration stations with a total drainage area of 51 million km2 corresponding to 38 of the simulated domain this results in a mean river basin size of 42 000 km2 a size range between 5 000 and 4 680 000 km2 and 62 of calibrated river basins having a drainage area ranging between 10 000 and 50 000 km2 see fig 1 the spatial distribution of the stations is shown in fig 2 together with the respective length of the calibration and validation period 2 2 3 calibration procedure the calibration exercise was performed through perturbation of the eight chosen parameters of the lisflood hydrological model within realistic ranges see table 1 to maximize the skills in the simulated discharge compared to the corresponding observed time series in the matching river station the tool used for the hydrological model calibration consists of a set of scripts written in python and developed in house at the jrc the version used in this work is an update of earlier versions from beck et al 2016 hirpa et al 2018 focusing on creating a semi automated tool able to run unsupervised and calibrate in sequence all selected catchments we used a multisite cascading calibration mscc approach xue et al 2016 where the calibrated discharge from upstream river basins is used as input for downstream ones the former ms windows based version was modified for running in a high performance computing hpc linux cluster the implemented version performs the following steps a filtering of stations on the basis of the length of the available data in the simulation period and optimal selection of calibration and validation period b hierarchical classification of the calibration stations along the river network and filtering of stations according to the criteria of proximity see sect 2 2 2 c subdivision of the stations into a user defined number of lists to be run in parallel each on a different cluster node every list retains hydrographic consistency so that all stations within the same river basin fall in the same list d preparation of input and static data for each catchment to calibrate all maps are cut out from the global domain in order to reduce the required storage and maximize the speed of execution inflows from upstream calibrated catchments are imported when existing e run of the simulations and parameter calibration until user defined improvement criteria are met to avoid unnecessary model runs the calibration tool evaluates the objective function i e kge at each generation from the 6th onwards and terminates the calibration process if the improvement compared to the previous generation is smaller than 0 001 the maximum number of generations was limited at ngmax 16 f when all catchments are calibrated the routine produces global parameter maps figures and tables of skill scores for evaluation and diagnostic and performs data cleaning to perturb the calibration parameters we used the μ λ evolutionary algorithm implemented in the distributed evolutionary algorithms in python deap toolkit fortin et al 2012 the population size μ was set to 16 and the recombination pool size λ to 32 thus generating a maximum number of model runs per sub catchment of μ λ ngmax 528 see fig 3 each generation produces λ offspring which are evaluated when the population of the next generation is selected from both offspring and population crossover and mutation probabilities were set to 0 6 and 0 4 respectively which we found to be an effective combination in terms of speed of convergence and avoidance of local minima each model run covers seamlessly all timesteps included in the calibration period including gaps in the time series of observed discharge data in addition each model run is initialized one year before the start of the calibration period to enable the model to warm up before evaluating its skill against the observations this was necessary to compensate for the large uncertainty in the initial model states model runs are composed of two simulations a pre run to estimate maps of average inflow to the lower groundwater zone and of average discharge which are used in a subsequent run to compare simulated with observed discharges 2 2 4 performance metrics we used a set of performance metrics to evaluate the model skills in representing observed discharges in the simulation period the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 was used both as objective function during the calibration and as performance metric to compare station results it is defined as kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 α 1 2 where r is the pearson product moment correlation coefficient β indicates the bias between observed and simulated flows and α is the variability ratio between observed and simulated standard deviations of the flow similarly to the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the kge provides a dimensionless decomposition of the mean squared error mse by explicitly accounting for correlation bias and variability of the flow to complement the model diagnostic and skill assessment the nse the pearson correlation coefficient r and the percent bias pbias were also analyzed individually the use of dimensionless metrics is key for large scale and global applications so that river sections with different climate flow regime and magnitude can be compared in the same analyses 3 results the calibration exercise took overall 2 months to complete on a intel xeon hpc cluster using 10 nodes with cpu e5 4620 2 20 ghz each node had 32 cores each which corresponds to the recombination pool size λ meaning that at any given time 10 sub catchments could run all 32 simulations of the same generation a total of 320 000 model runs 640 000 including the pre runs was performed to calibrate the 1226 stations hence an average of 261 runs per station in 85 of cases i e 1045 out of 1226 the calibration ended within 9 generations corresponding to 304 model runs fig 3 despite the additional model runs calibration performance are on average lower for the remaining stations suggesting that causes are to be sought in the mismatch between model and observations rather than in the search algorithm the geographic distribution of skill scores comparing simulated and observed discharges in calibration and validation is shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively as expected performance are higher in calibration than in validation with highest kge in the northern mid latitudes and in most of south america overestimation of discharges i e pbias greater than 0 causes reduction of the modeling skills in some areas in the central usa brazil colombia south east asia and most stations in africa negative bias is less frequent and very location specific suggesting the effect of human influence and possible issues with the observations and their geolocation on the modeled river network pooling results by continent confirms the poorer performance in africa median kge 0 02 especially due to large positive bias and to some extent in oceania median kge 0 53 due to limited correlation values fig 6 further analysis related the calibration skills to the average specific discharge to investigate trends over dry or wet regions interestingly the kge and correlation versus specific discharge take on a u shape with highest skills at the two side bins and poorest in the central bin see supplement figure s1 however differences among classes were not statistically significant in a kruskal wallis rank sum test kruskal and wallis 1952 also the calibration performance shows considerable differences when grouped by provider of discharge observations supplement figure s2 and s3 suggesting the need to further investigate quality control methods of collected hydrological data yet most station data were collected through the global runoff data centre grdc while several other data providers are associated with a small number of stations usually in the same area where the hydrological simulations may suffer from a common source of error figure s2 this is partly due to the spatial distribution and the density of data sources used to produce the meteorological forcing and the background maps used in the hydrological simulations which are abundant in some regions while they are sparse in others e g berry et al 2007 hengl et al 2014 overall median scores in calibration validation are kge 0 67 0 61 r 0 8 0 78 nse 0 42 0 35 and pbias 8 15 fig 7 gives a graphical example of observed versus simulated discharge time series in calibration and validation for one calibration point with kge and correlation close to the respective medians i e the 50th percentile of the entire stations set in fig 8 the cumulative distribution f of the four performance scores in calibration and validation resulting from this work in the figure referred to as v2019 are compared with those of the previous model calibration carried out in 2018 v2018 see hirpa et al 2018 and with those of the uncalibrated setup the kge curve of the calibrated stations shows a significant improvement compared to both the uncalibrated run and to the previous calibration work by defining as skillful those stations with positive kge kge the ideal case where all stations have perfect calibration skill i e kge 1 would generate an area a under the positive side of the kge curve i e the integral of kge over the y axis of a kge opt 1 where opt stands for optimum results from the calibration cal work produced a kge v2019 cal 0 56 which results in over twice the value of the uncalibrated def run a kge v2019 def 0 25 and significantly larger than the previous calibration work a kge v2018 cal 0 32 interestingly the correlation curve of the uncalibrated run is entirely more skillful than that of the calibration work v2018 hence supporting the choice of the new model setup used in this work the cumulative distribution of the pbias indicates substantial differences between the new and the previous calibration setup where hirpa et al 2018 reported large underestimation errors that could not be compensated with the model calibration differently results of the current calibration indicate positive bias in 74 of stations yet with a narrowing of the distribution of pbias values around zero this can be partly attributed to the change in meteorological forcing used in the calibration from the control run of ecmwf reforecasts 1995 2015 in ver 2018 i e glofas v2 1 to the current approach based on era5 for comparison 61 of calibration stations have pbias within 20 while in the previous calibration work it was true only in 28 of the cases in fig 9 the cumulative distribution of the kge of all calibrated stations is compared with two subsets including only lake and reservoir outlets respectively performance at 50 lake outlets are in line with those of the full stations set with an area a kge lakes cal 0 56 thus supporting the choice not to calibrate an additional parameter for lakes as done in the previous calibration work on the other hand performance in stations located downstream of 45 reservoirs res are on average poorer a kge res cal 0 41 this reflects the challenges to accurately represent the complex dynamics of water release and diversion from reservoirs driven by concurrent needs including hydropower irrigation flood protection environmental flows and recreation activities among others hanasaki et al 2006 shen et al 2012 4 discussion results indicate higher skills in data rich areas especially in europe and north america and in general in the northern mid latitudes where the station density is higher calibration performance are specific of each river station though they are not representative of neighboring uncalibrated river basins although the model parameters set in the uncalibrated regions were generated by expert judgement performance outside the calibrated basins are not monitored due to the lack of validation data results for the uncalibrated setup in figs 8 and 9 in grey are representative of the average model performance that one can expect outside the calibrated basins it is worth noting that the performance in simulating quantitative streamflows are not directly linked to the skills in flood early warning based on threshold exceedance analysis as in glofas alfieri et al 2013 continuous efforts are invested in expanding the coverage and the period of availability of the discharge observation dataset not only to improve the hydrological modeling skills but to quantify it too regionalization techniques of calibrated model parameters have already shown a number of successful applications to improve hydrological modeling in ungauged regions e g beck et al 2016 döll et al 2003 nijssen et al 2001 samaniego et al 2010 widén nilsson et al 2007 though their use in operational systems has been scarce to date this work pointed out the need for effective data quality control on discharge time series to use for model calibration calibration with poor quality data is to be avoided at all costs as it can compromise the modeling performance and lead to worse results as compared to the non calibration case poor quality data can manifest themselves in various ways e g boughton 2006 and are therefore particularly challenging to spot through automated procedures in this work the issue is complicated by the large number of data providers which increases the likelihood of errors in the data as well as issues in units conversion and data formatting the comparison of the calibration results versus the previous glofas setup highlights substantial upgrades which are likely to improve the general quality of glofas forecasts these improvements are related to different factors of the modelling chain 1 the use of a different hydrological model lisflood in place of the previous two model setup to compute land surface fluxes and river routing see alfieri et al 2013 the latter was recognized to be a sub optimal solution as the two models are not developed in an integrated way and no feedback between the two is implemented also the previous model calibration was performed only on the routing parameters so that errors in the land surface scheme were corrected in the wrong place 2 the new model setup makes use of the era5 meteorological reanalysis dataset based on the ecmwf s integrated forecasting system ifs cycle 41r2 it benefits from a decade of developments in model physics numerics and data assimilation compared to the previous reanalysis dataset era interim see sect 2 1 1 which was used in the previous glofas setup 3 an improved multi step approach to select stations to calibrate which minimizes incorrect station positioning on the model river network and removes those with poor data quality the list of calibration stations is the result of a continuous effort to include more data providers especially in underrepresented regions and of a more stringent selection criteria we ultimately generated a list with similar size i e 1226 stations to that of the previous calibration exercise i e 1287 stations though with better distribution and data quality for example the final list counts 66 world countries with at least one calibration stations while in the previous version it was only 56 the substantial and concomitant changes from the previous calibration exercise make it difficult to discern the contribution of specific changes to the overall model improvement changes were driven by different rationale ranging from technological updates need for model usability and flexibility data quality issues among others our ultimate goal is to produce the best possible global streamflow reanalysis which can be extended consistently in near real time and used to initialize medium range and seasonal forecasts in an operational system for streamflow forecasting and flood early detection 5 conclusions this article describes the procedure to generate a new global streamflow reanalysis for 1980 2018 with daily time step and 0 1 spatial resolution 11 km at the equator to be used within the copernicus ems global flood awareness system as well as in a wide range of global modeling frameworks it is based on the era5 meteorological dataset as input and calibrated at 1226 river sections the glofas reanalysis dataset v3 0 thus produced is freely available for download through the jrc data catalogue https data jrc ec europa eu collection id 00288 and near real time updates will be made available through the copernicus climate data store https cds climate copernicus eu once the operational version is released the model performance show a substantial improvement of the new calibrated setup in comparison both to the uncalibrated run and to the previous calibrated glofas setup this is likely to improve the operational flood forecasts in glofas through more realistic initial conditions and more consistent warning thresholds the calibrated model setup will be part of the next major glofas upgrade i e glofas v3 0 foreseen for early 2020 and will be preceded by an extensive testing and evaluation over a large number of past forecasts we are committed to a continuous improvement of the glofas reanalysis and ultimately of glofas forecasts which translate into better preparedness against large scale flooding and in the economic benefits of the related flood risk reduction pappenberger et al 2015 ongoing efforts and future research plans include an improved representation of the human influence to the global hydrological cycle through better estimates of the dominant water abstractions e g irrigation domestic livestock energy manufacturing mining see huang et al 2018 to improve the estimation of flood warning thresholds for different forecast ranges alfieri et al 2019 and to increase the use of remote sensing products for

8598,global and continental scale hydrological reanalysis datasets receive growing attention due to their increasing number of applications ranging from water resources management climate change studies water related hazards and policy support until recently their use was mostly limited to qualitative assessments due to their coarse spatial and temporal resolution large uncertainty and bias in the model output and limited extent of the dataset in space and time this research reports on the setup of a gridded hydrological model with quasi global coverage able to reproduce a seamless 39 year streamflow simulation in all world s medium to large river basins the model was calibrated at 1226 river sections with a total drainage area of 51 million km2 within 66 countries using ecmwf s latest atmospheric reanalysis era5 a performance assessment revealed large improvements in reproducing past discharge observations in comparison to the calibration used in the current operational setup of the hydrological model as part of the copernicus global flood awareness system glofas www globalfloods eu with median scores of kling gupta efficiency kge 0 67 and correlation r 0 8 the simulation bias was also dramatically reduced and narrowed around zero with more than 60 of stations showing percent bias within 20 pronounced regional differences in the simulation results remain pointing out the need for detailed investigation of the hydrological processes in specific regions including parts of africa and south asia in addition observed discharges with high data quality is key to achieving skillful model output the new calibrated model will become part of the operational runs of glofas in the next system release foreseen for spring 2020 together with a near real time

global hydrological models are effective tools to reconstruct seamlessly the various components of the water balance and reproduce a continuous dataset to be used for further applications

configurations of inputs models and parameterization among them several pointed out that relatively large gaps remain between output discharges and observations at gauged river sections mostly due to quality issues in the meteorological input dataset incorrect model parameterization missing or simplified processes and insufficient space time resolution of input and output which often limit model results to qualitative assessments or to selected rivers and regions where the modeling is acceptable coordinated multi model initiatives such as the watermip haddeland et al 2011 and the earth2observe schellekens et al 2017 projects aimed to characterize the variability of the simulated runoff in large rivers using ensembles of global hydrological simulations produced at the common grid resolution of 0 5 although both projects acknowledged the added value of an ensemble of simulations results showed large discrepancies due to different concepts and parameterization in modeling the runoff generation schellekens et al 2017 and the lack of a common protocol to calibrate and validate the participating models beck et al 2017 compared runoff estimates from 10 macro scale hydrological models with observations from 966 medium sized catchments around the globe they found large differences among the different model output and higher scores for regions with calibrated model parameterization the calibration always brings benefits in river sections where accurate observations are available though its effect is reduced as one moves away from the calibration points even if along the same river network xue et al 2016 as a consequence the performance of a calibrated hydrological model can vary substantially across different river basins hence pointing out the importance to calibrate as many river basins as possible this is often in contrast with the limited availability of observed data as well as with the considerable computing resources needed to perform each calibration run model calibration is an iterative process involving a large number of model runs where a set of parameters is perturbed so that differences between the model output and the observations at the corresponding location are minimized the number of iterations required and the corresponding computing time proportional to the computing resources increase with the size of the parameter set to optimize yet often enabling improved model skills however the size of the calibration parameter set should not be too large to avoid model overfitting and consequent loss of predictive skills outside the calibration period wi et al 2015 kouchi et al 2017 tested the sensitivity of calibration parameters to 1 different objective functions and 2 optimization algorithms they found that most combinations of the two considered sets can achieve skillful results though resulting in different configurations of the parameter values hence in large scale calibration exercises the optimal configuration should take into account also the efficiency of the optimization algorithms that is favoring those reaching a skillful parameter set with the minimum number of iterations in this work we report on the development of a semi automated calibration procedure of a large scale hydrological model that underpins the global flood awareness system glofas www globalfloods eu see alfieri et al 2013 hirpa et al 2018 to improve the simulated output discharge by tuning a set of model parameters glofas is an operational system for global ensemble streamflow modeling forecasting and early

component of the copernicus emergency management service 1 1 https emergency copernicus eu cems that provides complementary forecast information to relevant stakeholders and supports flood risk management at national regional and global level as of november 2019 the glofas reanalysis is based on the operational version 2 1 described in details by harrigan et al 2019 while this article presents recent research activities that will be included in future system versions the calibration tool presented in this work is implemented using a large database of more than 1200 discharge observations worldwide and era5 hersbach et al 2018 ecmwf s fifth generation atmospheric reanalysis dataset as forcing input the calibrated model is then rerun to produce a seamless 40 year dataset of daily streamflows with quasi global coverage in the operational glofas runs such reference simulation hereafter referred to as glofas reanalysis is updated in near real time with the latest era5 hydro meteorological input maps as soon as they become available similarly to efas the glofas reanalysis is used with regard to three key aspects i deriving climatological features of river streamflow in each section of the world river network e g average conditions extremes flood thresholds seasonality ii creating initial conditions to run hydrological forecasts driven by the latest weather predictions iii providing a reference simulation which is as realistic as possible to be used as a proxy to evaluate streamflow forecasts in every grid point of the simulation domain alfieri et al

external forcing and has higher spatial 31 vs 79 km and vertical 137 vs 60 levels resolution in addition it includes uncertainty information by providing an ensemble of 10 reanalysis members at a coarser horizontal resolution the era5 dataset includes hourly output with near real time availability 2 to 5 day latency known as era5t which makes it particularly appealing for the daily updating of the global hydrological conditions used to initialize streamflow forecasting systems such as glofas era5t is used for the initialization of operational glofas forecasts since november 2018 the improvements introduced in era5 include features such as tropical cyclones better orography coastal process and related weather phenomena and medium range atmospheric forecasts initialized with era5 show an increase in skill of about one day in comparison to those initialized with era interim hersbach et al 2018 recent studies in the united states have shown that era5 performs substantially better than era interim in modeling precipitation beck et al 2019 as well as when used to force land surface albergel et al 2018 and hydrological tarek et al 2019 models in this study we used daily maps of precipitation daily mean surface air temperature and relative humidity incoming solar radiation net longwave radiation and mean wind speed extracted from era5 for 40 complete years between 1979 and 2018 this is one of the main changes in comparison with the previous calibration exercise based on the same variables yet extracted from the control run of ecmwf reforecasts in the period 1995 2015 some variables were processed to compute estimates of potential evapotranspiration using the penman monteith equation as described in supit at al 1994 this is one of the main dynamic input variables of the hydrological model lisflood together with daily mean surface air temperature and daily precipitation era5 input variables were aggregated from hourly to daily values and downscaled from the original resolution to the output resolution of 0 1 deg through a bilinear interpolation method 2 2 methods 2 2 1 hydrological model and calibration parameters hydrological simulations are performed with lisflood van der knijff et al 2010 a distributed semi physically based model developed at the joint research centre jrc of the european commission such model differs from the operational glofas setup i e calibration version v 2018 which is based on a combination of the hydrology tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchanges over land htessel balsamo et al 2011 ecmwf s land surface scheme and a simplified version of lisflood to simulate the groundwater processes and the river routing see alfieri et al 2013 the choice of a different modeling framework for the new glofas version is motivated by the need for better control on all the calibration parameters through the use of only one model as well as the need to maintain only one lisflood version to be used both in efas and glofas so that any model development benefits both early warning systems processes simulated by lisflood include soil freezing snowmelt surface runoff lakes and reservoirs water abstraction infiltration preferential flow redistribution of soil moisture within the soil profile drainage to the groundwater system groundwater storage and base flow surface runoff is produced at every grid cell and routed through the river network using a kinematic wave approach chow et al 1988 the current model version includes 463 lakes and 687 reservoirs zajac et al 2017 selected among the world s largest ones listed in the global lakes and wetlands database glwd lehner and döll 2004 and the global reservoir and dam database grand lehner et al 2011 the lake outflow is related to the lake level using the poleni weir equation bollrich 1992 for reservoirs the outflow is calculated with a set of rules depending on their filling level see burek et al 2013 zajac et al 2017 accurate and up to date spatial information in the hydrological modeling is important to avoid over parameterization and reduce the dimensionality of the calibration spatial datasets used in lisflood include topography maps i e digital elevation model local drainage direction slope gradient elevation range land use i e land use classes forest fraction fraction of urban area soil i e soil texture classes soil depth and channel geometry i e channel gradient roughness coefficient bankfull channel depth channel length bottom width and side slope most input datasets parameters and variables necessary for the model are estimated a priori from available global products such as the shuttle radar topography mission srtm jarvis et al 2008 dataset for elevation the globcover 2009 bontemps et al 2011 for land use the soilgrids1km database hengl et al 2014 for soil information the global river network database wu et al 2012 for river network and flow direction the global width database of large rivers yamazaki et al 2014 for river widths the spot vgt data http wdc dlr de data products surface lai for monthly maps of leaf area index lai among others water abstraction maps are representative of the year 2000 they are derived from the work by wada et al 2011 and modeled with 12 monthly maps for the domestic and livestock sector and with a constant pattern for the energy and industrial sector lisflood underpins a number of large scale applications particularly over europe where it is used in the context of the european flood awareness system efas see alfieri et al 2014a bartholmes et al 2009 thielen et al 2009 and in climate change impact assessment studies alfieri et al 2015 dankers and feyen 2009 rojas et al 2012 in this work we used a quasi global setup spanning latitudes 60 s to 90 n over a 0 1 grid and 1 day time step covering all the main earth s land areas except antarctica greenland and iceland a set of eight model parameters was selected for calibration see table 1 following recommendations from previous works beck et al 2017 hirpa et al 2018 who identified the most relevant model parameters for lisflood in terms of model sensitivity and uncertainty of the default values differently from those works no calibration parameter specific to lakes and reservoirs was included 1 to limit the dimensionality of the optimization process and the overall number of model runs and 2 so that all catchments ultimately have the same number of calibrated parameters i e including those with no lake or reservoirs the impact of such choice will be investigated in the evaluation phase particularly for reservoirs where the actual operation rules may differ from the modelled one further details on the modeling of reservoirs in lisflood are included in the supplement 2 2 2 station selection river stations selected for calibration stem from a global database of about 2100 stations maintained in house at the jrc resulting from the collection of discharge observations from around 30 data providers worldwide we performed a screening to identify the stations to calibrate following recommendations from previous calibration exercises the following procedure was thus implemented stations where the drainage area was not reported by the provider were initially removed the absolute relative difference between the drainage area derived from the model flow direction map and reported by each data provider had to be smaller than 20 e g xue et al 2016 the official drainage area had to be larger than 5 000 km2 following the recommendations by alfieri et al 2013 at least 4 years of observed daily data had to be available i e 4 365 values excluding gaps in the calibration period remaining data up to 8 years were used for model validation while in case of time series longer than 8 years the dataset was split equally between calibration and validation as suggested by klemeš 1986 when two stations fell in the same grid point the station with the longest observed time series was retained 14 stations were removed by this criterion some stations which were close to each other along the same river were removed the idea behind this criterion is to avoid calibrating clusters of stations where the downstream ones bring little benefit and often generate anomalous calibrated parameter values as they are constrained by the simulated inflow of the upstream station and by the discharge rating curve at each station and their uncertainty to this end we numerically identified the upstream downstream relation among stations lying in the same river basin then a threshold value of 10 was imposed as minimum relative difference in drainage area of a downstream station to the closest one along the upstream river network and removed the stations with smaller relative difference a number of stations were then removed or added on the basis of a comparison and skill evaluation between the observed discharge time series and the corresponding model run with default i e uncalibrated parameters this step was necessary to remove data pairs with unexplained large differences possibly related to a combination of wrong station positioning large human influence and errors in the metadata in the reported discharge time series in unrepresented processes or in the model input e g hamilton and moore 2012 wang et al 2018 also it compensates for the absence of a dedicated data quality control system on the observations dataset as a result we removed all stations with a ratio larger than 11 between the average observed and simulated discharge time series as well as its inverse ratio i e pbias 91 or pbias greater than 1000 in addition stations previously excluded due to drainage area not reported by the provider were reinstated if the kge in the uncalibrated run was larger than zero hence proving some modeling skills knoben et al 2019 the selection procedure described above produced a list of 1226 calibration stations with a total drainage area of 51 million km2 corresponding to 38 of the simulated domain this results in a mean river basin size of 42 000 km2 a size range between 5 000 and 4 680 000 km2 and 62 of calibrated river basins having a drainage area ranging between 10 000 and 50 000 km2 see fig 1 the spatial distribution of the stations is shown in fig 2 together with the respective length of the calibration and validation period 2 2 3 calibration procedure the calibration exercise was performed through perturbation of the eight chosen parameters of the lisflood hydrological model within realistic ranges see table 1 to maximize the skills in the simulated discharge compared to the corresponding observed time series in the matching river station the tool used for the hydrological model calibration consists of a set of scripts written in python and developed in house at the jrc the version used in this work is an update of earlier versions from beck et al 2016 hirpa et al 2018 focusing on creating a semi automated tool able to run unsupervised and calibrate in sequence all selected catchments we used a multisite cascading calibration mscc approach xue et al 2016 where the calibrated discharge from upstream river basins is used as input for downstream ones the former ms windows based version was modified for running in a high performance computing hpc linux cluster the implemented version performs the following steps a filtering of stations on the basis of the length of the available data in the simulation period and optimal selection of calibration and validation period b hierarchical classification of the calibration stations along the river network and filtering of stations according to the criteria of proximity see sect 2 2 2 c subdivision of the stations into a user defined number of lists to be run in parallel each on a different cluster node every list retains hydrographic consistency so that all stations within the same river basin fall in the same list d preparation of input and static data for each catchment to calibrate all maps are cut out from the global domain in order to reduce the required storage and maximize the speed of execution inflows from upstream calibrated catchments are imported when existing e run of the simulations and parameter calibration until user defined improvement criteria are met to avoid unnecessary model runs the calibration tool evaluates the objective function i e kge at each generation from the 6th onwards and terminates the calibration process if the improvement compared to the previous generation is smaller than 0 001 the maximum number of generations was limited at ngmax 16 f when all catchments are calibrated the routine produces global parameter maps figures and tables of skill scores for evaluation and diagnostic and performs data cleaning to perturb the calibration parameters we used the μ λ evolutionary algorithm implemented in the distributed evolutionary algorithms in python deap toolkit fortin et al 2012 the population size μ was set to 16 and the recombination pool size λ to 32 thus generating a maximum number of model runs per sub catchment of μ λ ngmax 528 see fig 3 each generation produces λ offspring which are evaluated when the population of the next generation is selected from both offspring and population crossover and mutation probabilities were set to 0 6 and 0 4 respectively which we found to be an effective combination in terms of speed of convergence and avoidance of local minima each model run covers seamlessly all timesteps included in the calibration period including gaps in the time series of observed discharge data in addition each model run is initialized one year before the start of the calibration period to enable the model to warm up before evaluating its skill against the observations this was necessary to compensate for the large uncertainty in the initial model states model runs are composed of two simulations a pre run to estimate maps of average inflow to the lower groundwater zone and of average discharge which are used in a subsequent run to compare simulated with observed discharges 2 2 4 performance metrics we used a set of performance metrics to evaluate the model skills in representing observed discharges in the simulation period the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 was used both as objective function during the calibration and as performance metric to compare station results it is defined as kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 α 1 2 where r is the pearson product moment correlation coefficient β indicates the bias between observed and simulated flows and α is the variability ratio between observed and simulated standard deviations of the flow similarly to the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the kge provides a dimensionless decomposition of the mean squared error mse by explicitly accounting for correlation bias and variability of the flow to complement the model diagnostic and skill assessment the nse the pearson correlation coefficient r and the percent bias pbias were also analyzed individually the use of dimensionless metrics is key for large scale and global applications so that river sections with different climate flow regime and magnitude can be compared in the same analyses 3 results the calibration exercise took overall 2 months to complete on a intel xeon hpc cluster using 10 nodes with cpu e5 4620 2 20 ghz each node had 32 cores each which corresponds to the recombination pool size λ meaning that at any given time 10 sub catchments could run all 32 simulations of the same generation a total of 320 000 model runs 640 000 including the pre runs was performed to calibrate the 1226 stations hence an average of 261 runs per station in 85 of cases i e 1045 out of 1226 the calibration ended within 9 generations corresponding to 304 model runs fig 3 despite the additional model runs calibration performance are on average lower for the remaining stations suggesting that causes are to be sought in the mismatch between model and observations rather than in the search algorithm the geographic distribution of skill scores comparing simulated and observed discharges in calibration and validation is shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively as expected performance are higher in calibration than in validation with highest kge in the northern mid latitudes and in most of south america overestimation of discharges i e pbias greater than 0 causes reduction of the modeling skills in some areas in the central usa brazil colombia south east asia and most stations in africa negative bias is less frequent and very location specific suggesting the effect of human influence and possible issues with the observations and their geolocation on the modeled river network pooling results by continent confirms the poorer performance in africa median kge 0 02 especially due to large positive bias and to some extent in oceania median kge 0 53 due to limited correlation values fig 6 further analysis related the calibration skills to the average specific discharge to investigate trends over dry or wet regions interestingly the kge and correlation versus specific discharge take on a u shape with highest skills at the two side bins and poorest in the central bin see supplement figure s1 however differences among classes were not statistically significant in a kruskal wallis rank sum test kruskal and wallis 1952 also the calibration performance shows considerable differences when grouped by provider of discharge observations supplement figure s2 and s3 suggesting the need to further investigate quality control methods of collected hydrological data yet most station data were collected through the global runoff data centre grdc while several other data providers are associated with a small number of stations usually in the same area where the hydrological simulations may suffer from a common source of error figure s2 this is partly due to the spatial distribution and the density of data sources used to produce the meteorological forcing and the background maps used in the hydrological simulations which are abundant in some regions while they are sparse in others e g berry et al 2007 hengl et al 2014 overall median scores in calibration validation are kge 0 67 0 61 r 0 8 0 78 nse 0 42 0 35 and pbias 8 15 fig 7 gives a graphical example of observed versus simulated discharge time series in calibration and validation for one calibration point with kge and correlation close to the respective medians i e the 50th percentile of the entire stations set in fig 8 the cumulative distribution f of the four performance scores in calibration and validation resulting from this work in the figure referred to as v2019 are compared with those of the previous model calibration carried out in 2018 v2018 see hirpa et al 2018 and with those of the uncalibrated setup the kge curve of the calibrated stations shows a significant improvement compared to both the uncalibrated run and to the previous calibration work by defining as skillful those stations with positive kge kge the ideal case where all stations have perfect calibration skill i e kge 1 would generate an area a under the positive side of the kge curve i e the integral of kge over the y axis of a kge opt 1 where opt stands for optimum results from the calibration cal work produced a kge v2019 cal 0 56 which results in over twice the value of the uncalibrated def run a kge v2019 def 0 25 and significantly larger than the previous calibration work a kge v2018 cal 0 32 interestingly the correlation curve of the uncalibrated run is entirely more skillful than that of the calibration work v2018 hence supporting the choice of the new model setup used in this work the cumulative distribution of the pbias indicates substantial differences between the new and the previous calibration setup where hirpa et al 2018 reported large underestimation errors that could not be compensated with the model calibration differently results of the current calibration indicate positive bias in 74 of stations yet with a narrowing of the distribution of pbias values around zero this can be partly attributed to the change in meteorological forcing used in the calibration from the control run of ecmwf reforecasts 1995 2015 in ver 2018 i e glofas v2 1 to the current approach based on era5 for comparison 61 of calibration stations have pbias within 20 while in the previous calibration work it was true only in 28 of the cases in fig 9 the cumulative distribution of the kge of all calibrated stations is compared with two subsets including only lake and reservoir outlets respectively performance at 50 lake outlets are in line with those of the full stations set with an area a kge lakes cal 0 56 thus supporting the choice not to calibrate an additional parameter for lakes as done in the previous calibration work on the other hand performance in stations located downstream of 45 reservoirs res are on average poorer a kge res cal 0 41 this reflects the challenges to accurately represent the complex dynamics of water release and diversion from reservoirs driven by concurrent needs including hydropower irrigation flood protection environmental flows and recreation activities among others hanasaki et al 2006 shen et al 2012 4 discussion results indicate higher skills in data rich areas especially in europe and north america and in general in the northern mid latitudes where the station density is higher calibration performance are specific of each river station though they are not representative of neighboring uncalibrated river basins although the model parameters set in the uncalibrated regions were generated by expert judgement performance outside the calibrated basins are not monitored due to the lack of validation data results for the uncalibrated setup in figs 8 and 9 in grey are representative of the average model performance that one can expect outside the calibrated basins it is worth noting that the performance in simulating quantitative streamflows are not directly linked to the skills in flood early warning based on threshold exceedance analysis as in glofas alfieri et al 2013 continuous efforts are invested in expanding the coverage and the period of availability of the discharge observation dataset not only to improve the hydrological modeling skills but to quantify it too regionalization techniques of calibrated model parameters have already shown a number of successful applications to improve hydrological modeling in ungauged regions e g beck et al 2016 döll et al 2003 nijssen et al 2001 samaniego et al 2010 widén nilsson et al 2007 though their use in operational systems has been scarce to date this work pointed out the need for effective data quality control on discharge time series to use for model calibration calibration with poor quality data is to be avoided at all costs as it can compromise the modeling performance and lead to worse results as compared to the non calibration case poor quality data can manifest themselves in various ways e g boughton 2006 and are therefore particularly challenging to spot through automated procedures in this work the issue is complicated by the large number of data providers which increases the likelihood of errors in the data as well as issues in units conversion and data formatting the comparison of the calibration results versus the previous glofas setup highlights substantial upgrades which are likely to improve the general quality of glofas forecasts these improvements are related to different factors of the modelling chain 1 the use of a different hydrological model lisflood in place of the previous two model setup to compute land surface fluxes and river routing see alfieri et al 2013 the latter was recognized to be a sub optimal solution as the two models are not developed in an integrated way and no feedback between the two is implemented also the previous model calibration was performed only on the routing parameters so that errors in the land surface scheme were corrected in the wrong place 2 the new model setup makes use of the era5 meteorological reanalysis dataset based on the ecmwf s integrated forecasting system ifs cycle 41r2 it benefits from a decade of developments in model physics numerics and data assimilation compared to the previous reanalysis dataset era interim see sect 2 1 1 which was used in the previous glofas setup 3 an improved multi step approach to select stations to calibrate which minimizes incorrect station positioning on the model river network and removes those with poor data quality the list of calibration stations is the result of a continuous effort to include more data providers especially in underrepresented regions and of a more stringent selection criteria we ultimately generated a list with similar size i e 1226 stations to that of the previous calibration exercise i e 1287 stations though with better distribution and data quality for example the final list counts 66 world countries with at least one calibration stations while in the previous version it was only 56 the substantial and concomitant changes from the previous calibration exercise make it difficult to discern the contribution of specific changes to the overall model improvement changes were driven by different rationale ranging from technological updates need for model usability and flexibility data quality issues among others our ultimate goal is to produce the best possible global streamflow reanalysis which can be extended consistently in near real time and used to initialize medium range and seasonal forecasts in an operational system for streamflow forecasting and flood early detection 5 conclusions this article describes the procedure to generate a new global streamflow reanalysis for 1980 2018 with daily time step and 0 1 spatial resolution 11 km at the equator to be used within the copernicus ems global flood awareness system as well as in a wide range of global modeling frameworks it is based on the era5 meteorological dataset as input and calibrated at 1226 river sections the glofas reanalysis dataset v3 0 thus produced is freely available for download through the jrc data catalogue https data jrc ec europa eu collection id 00288 and near real time updates will be made available through the copernicus climate data store https cds climate copernicus eu once the operational version is released the model performance show a substantial improvement of the new calibrated setup in comparison both to the uncalibrated run and to the previous calibrated glofas setup this is likely to improve the operational flood forecasts in glofas through more realistic initial conditions and more consistent warning thresholds the calibrated model setup will be part of the next major glofas upgrade i e glofas v3 0 foreseen for early 2020 and will be preceded by an extensive testing and evaluation over a large number of past forecasts we are committed to a continuous improvement of the glofas reanalysis and ultimately of glofas forecasts which translate into better preparedness against large scale flooding and in the economic benefits of the related flood risk reduction pappenberger et al 2015 ongoing efforts and future research plans include an improved representation of the human influence to the global hydrological cycle through better estimates of the dominant water abstractions e g irrigation domestic livestock energy manufacturing mining see huang et al 2018 to improve the estimation of flood warning thresholds for different forecast ranges alfieri et al 2019 and to increase the use of remote sensing products for

8599,in southwestern bangladesh the large variation in groundwater salinity has only been elucidated in small scale study areas and along large regional scale gradients we aimed to assess the regional shallow 60 m groundwater salinity variation with a higher resolution as a function of landscape features and associated hydrological processes spatial variation in groundwater salinity was assessed using 442 ec measurements from previous studies and 1998 new ec measurements groundwater ec values were correlated with well location data latitude longitude and depth of the filter and landscape feature data elevation soil type land use and surface clay thickness additionally we performed a geomorphological analysis of landscape features to infer associated hydrological processes we interpret wide fluvial zones to be remnants of sandy deposits in large paleo channels which allow freshwater recharge resulting in groundwater that is mostly 75 fresh narrow fluvial zones tidal fluvial zones and fluvial zones next to tidal rivers are more susceptible to lateral saline water flow or saline water recharge by occasional tidal flooding and only contain some shallow fresh groundwater in high lying zones tidal flat or tidal fringe zones hardly contain any fresh groundwater this study is the first to demonstrate the relation between landscape features hydrological processes and regional groundwater salinity throughout southwestern bangladesh the main lines of our approach may be applicable in other coastal areas with available spatial landscape feature data enabling a first prediction of groundwater salinity variation keywords hydrogeology bangladesh salt water intrusion freshwater lens coastal zone hydrology 1 introduction coastal regions and deltas are among the most heavily populated areas in the world and their water resources are experiencing increasing stress creel 2003 ranjan et al 2006 nicholls and cazenave 2010 one of the largest and most densely populated deltas is the ganges brahmaputra meghna gbm delta here manifestations of this stress are arsenic contamination of shallow groundwater resources nickson et al 1998 harvey et al 2002 severe pollution of surface water resources alam et al 2006 bhuiyan et al 2011 and limited availability of the meteorological water resources due to pronounced seasonality chowdhury 2010 sharma et al 2010 in the coastal southwestern region of bangladesh available drinking water is further limited by the salinity of the surface and groundwater the groundwater salinity variation in the coastal area is large and therefore hard to predict george 2013 worland et al 2015 ayers et al 2016 rahman et al 2018 naus et al 2019 the stress of saline water intrusion on the groundwater is increasing due to natural changes in the form of natural land subsidence and sea level rise bhuiyan and dutta 2012 fakhruddin and rahman 2014 and due to anthropogenic changes in the form of man induced land subsidence decreased ganges outflow rahman et al 2000 and increased groundwater extraction chowdhury 2010 to determine occurrence of current drinking water problems and to mitigate future risk for the drinking water supply in southwestern bangladesh a proper understanding of the current groundwater salinity distribution and underlying controlling processes is required such general understanding can also aid in understanding groundwater salinity variation in other coastal regions around the world most previous studies in southwestern bangladesh focussed on understanding the groundwater salinity variation by identifying the controlling hydrological processes in small local study areas george 2013 worland et al 2015 ayers et al 2016 sarker et al 2018 naus et al 2019 these studies have found much of the groundwater to be connate groundwater due to the subsurface lithology being characterized by thick covering clay layers and the landscape being flat leading to a stagnant hydrological system the occurrence and thickness of surface clay layers with low infiltration capacity is described to explain how isolated the groundwater is and therefore whether the groundwater consists of solely connate water formed under paleo conditions or whether the groundwater salinity has also been influenced by active processes george 2013 worland et al 2015 ayers et al 2016 sarker et al 2018 naus et al 2019 previous studies proposed several active processes that vary depending on the present day landscape features freshwater recharge from rain or rain fed pond water has been described in areas of higher elevation in southwestern bangladesh naus et al 2019 as well as in other coastal regions stuyfzand 1993 walraevens et al 2007 goes et al 2009 de louw et al 2011 santos et al 2012 salinization in low lying areas has been attributed to three processes in southwestern bangladesh tidally influenced flooding naus et al 2019 recharge by rainwater that has dissolved evaporite salts in the soil sarker et al 2018 and recharge from aquaculture ponds paul and vogl 2011 rahman et al 2018 naus et al 2019 at a regional scale the relevance of these hydrological processes is unexplored and accordingly the regional groundwater salinity variation remains poorly understood only some rough regional salinity gradients have been delineated indicating a trend for salinity to increase from north to south bangladesh water development board 2013 zahid et al 2018 for assessing and overcoming water supply problems in the region a spatially more detailed understanding of the current groundwater salinity distribution and underlying controlling processes is required we therefore set out to elucidate the regional shallow 60 m deep groundwater salinity variation with a higher resolution and to determine the relevant controlling hydrological processes in a regional scale study we aimed to use our findings to construct guidelines for predicting the groundwater salinity throughout the region 2 study area the study region latitude 22 12 to 23 0 longitude 88 53 to 89 58 comprises the three southwesternmost districts of bangladesh satkhira khulna and bagerhat the southern parts of these districts contain the largest tidal mangrove forest in the world the sundarbans which was excluded from the study area the remaining area is predominantly rural with the main sources of income being agriculture and aquaculture the topography soil type and land use vary throughout the study area figs a 1 a 2 a 3 most of the area is low lying with an elevation a few meters above mean sea level auerbach et al 2015 increasing regionally towards the north and east fig a1 at a smaller scale the topography is more varied fig a1 with some high lying areas up to 2 m higher than the low lying areas naus et al 2019 the dominant land use types are treed villages one season rice aquaculture and irrigated rice with treed villages and irrigated rice being located more often towards the north and at higher elevations than aquaculture or one season rice naus et al 2019 fig a2 a soil map is available for the satkhira and khulna districts from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations 1959 fig a3 indicating a variety of fluvial tidal fluvial tidal flat and tidal fringe soils with fluvial soils occurring more in the north and in the west tidal fringe soils occurring more in the east and tidal flat soils occurring more in the south the fluvial soils often occur on higher land the other soil types also sometimes occur on relatively high lying areas the region experiences an annual rainfall of around 2500 mm with most of this precipitation falling in the monsoon from june to october the monsoon season is followed by a cool dry winter in october to march and a hot summer from march to june the tidal rivers and creeks become saline at the end of the summer in april and may bhuiyan and dutta 2012 in general three aquifer types are recognized in bangladesh mukherjee et al 2009 in the south of bangladesh the upper holocene aquifers are found to depths of approximately 60 m below are the main middle holocene aquifers which are found to approximately 150 m deep the late pleistocene early holocene aquifers extend deeper than 150 m this study focusses on the groundwater salinity in the upper holocene aquifers i e the first 60 m 3 methods 3 1 general approach we used a three way approach first we assessed how groundwater salinity throughout the region correlates with landscape features second we performed a geomorphological analysis of landscape features to infer associated hydrological processes and their effect on groundwater salinity third using landscape features we constructed practical guidelines to predict groundwater salinity throughout the region for our approach we required data already available or that could be rapidly collected at the scale of southwestern bangladesh we used three types of data 1 electrical conductivity ec data from previous studies and collected during this study to determine groundwater salinity 2 location data x y z of the ec measurements to analyse how ec varies with depth and throughout the region and 3 geomorphological landscape features from various existing large scale spatial data sources 3 2 data collection data mining and data processing the ec data was collected by the authors and msc students from dhaka university during multiple fieldwork campaigns from january 2014 to september 2018 using a low cost method that consisted of measuring the ec of shallow groundwater 60 m deep by pumping household tube wells along regional transects and detailed study areas throughout the region the protocol for measuring ec from the tube wells included the purging of the stagnant water from the tube well by pumping each tube well for at least a minute we expect the measurements collected over the span of several years to be comparable as seasonal and inter annual salinity variation is expected to be low because of the stagnancy of the connate groundwater dominated hydrological system george 2013 worland et al 2015 ayers et al 2016 sarker et al 2018 naus et al 2019 this low cost method made it possible to collect 1998 new ec groundwater measurements at tube wells three handheld field measurement devices were used for the ec measurements the hanna hi 9829 hanna 127 instruments usa the hanna hi 98 311 hanna 127 instruments usa and the 18 50 sa multimeter eijkelkamp the netherlands additional chemical analysis of the water samples was performed for a subset of sampling locations for this 221 groundwater samples were taken along 10 local scale transects in january 2017 and january 2018 the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and stored in 15 ml polyethylene tubes for analysis in the lab for cl so4 and no3 using ion chromatography alkalinity was measured within 36 h of sampling by titration hach company usa this data was augmented with data on shallow groundwater 60 m from previously published articles and projects and from a datafile obtained from vanderbilt university see table 1 for details in total our database consisted of 2440 ec measurements from the upper holocene aquifers table 1 the regional database on groundwater analyses was augmented with data from naus et al 2019 and ayers et al 2016 which provided an additional 136 samples leading to a total of 357 hydrochemical samples table 1 these samples were used to infer the salinity from ec measurements as explained in section 3 3 the database of groundwater ec chloride and alkalinity is available as supplementary data location datawas collected for each ec measurement point during the field campaigns and consisted of latitude longitude and depth of the filter the latitude and longitude of the measured tube wells were obtained by means of gps and the depth was estimated from details supplied by local residents on the filter depth and the number of pipes and filters used when installing the tube well when the users sporadically did not remember or were in doubt about the depth of their tubewell we did not include their tubewell for the landscape features we used the data sources available at the scale of southwestern bangladesh these yielded data on elevation land use soil type and surface clay thickness elevation was estimated using shuttle radar topography mission data srtm farr et al 2007 taking into account that the exact values are not accurate as they have been affected by vegetation auerbach et al 2015 land use was based on supervised classification of cloudless imagery from landsat 8 17th and 24th of march 2015 paths 137 and 138 row 44 calibrated with observations from aerial images and field observations soil type was derived from the fao soil map food and agriculture organization of the united nations 1959 since the soil map is approximately 70 years old we could expect the dynamic nature of the delta to have led to differences compared to present day circumstances certainly on a small scale however visual similarities of the soil map fig a3 with the srtm fig a1 and the land use map fig a2 give confidence in its present day validity the thickness of the surface clay layer was based on borehole logs from various previous studies and from 14 newly constructed tube wells see table 1 for details as the variation in surface clay thickness in southwest bangladesh is large ayers et al 2016 naus et al 2019 the interpolated clay thickness is only used for ec measurements less than 100 m from a borehole log there were 313 such ec measurements 3 3 definition of salinity most salinity classifications for drinking water are based on chloride concentration in the water custodio and bruggeman 1987 stuyfzand 1993 however salinity and ec are not only controlled by cl but also by other anions particularly so4 and no3 and by alkalinity therefore we first assessed to what extent chloride controls ec as well as salinity in the study region by comparing the available hydrochemical analyses against the ec values this revealed a large spread in combinations of chloride concentrations and ec which particularly affects the interpretation of the salinity in the lower ranges fig 1 at ec values lower than 5 ms cm alkalinity is prominent and can lead to an overestimated chloride concentration based on ec between 5 and 10 ms cm alkalinity is less prominent but may still be relevant when inferring salinity from the ec instead of from the chloride content this confirms that ec is not always a good estimator for the chloride concentration the large spread makes it impossible to perform chemical calculations based on the ec such as calculations of the fractions of seawater nevertheless the r2 of 0 84 between ec and chloride gives us confidence to use ec to judge the groundwater salinity to differentiate between fresh and brackish groundwater we used the drinking water guidelines of the bangladesh government ayers et al 2016 according to which groundwater with an ec of 2 ms cm or less is potable this definition is broader than the classification of stuyfzand 1993 as it results in some of the measurements interpreted as fresh having a chloride concentration above 300 mg l the other salinity classes were constructed based on the stuyfzand classification 1993 and the approximate correlation between ec and chloride fig 1 groundwater was classified as brackish if it had an ec of 2 3 5 ms cm largely corresponding with a chloride concentration of 300 1000 mg l it was classified as brackish saline if the ec was 3 5 5 ms cm corresponding with a chloride concentration 1000 2500 mg l it was classified as saline if the ec was 5 ms cm corresponding with a chloride concentration 2500 mg l 3 4 statistical analysis various statistical and geostatistical tests were used to assess regional trends and ec variation with landscape features variation of ec with the ordinal location and landscape feature data latitude longitude elevation depth and surface clay thickness was statistically analysed using pearson s statistical test with a significance threshold set at 0 05 variation of ec with the nominal data consisting of land use and soil type was assessed using boxplots of the different classes the distributions of the classes with 30 or more samples were tested for significant differences using kruskal wallis kruskal and wallis 1952 and dunn s tests dunn 1964 with the significance threshold value adjusted according to bonferroni correction dunn 1961 by dividing the original value of 0 05 by the number of simultaneously tested classes regional trends in ec were also visually assessed after ordinary kriging interpolation of the ec data which has been applied before for soil salinity bilgili 2013 lobell et al 2010 after trial and error we decided to use a spherical variogram model using the 8 nearest measurements to estimate the ec to prevent inclusion of data from too far away and to prevent oversensitivity to individual measurements to ascertain which variable controls the ec independently from possible cross correlation the ec data was split into classes according to latitude longitude elevation clay thickness depth land use and soil type the ordinal data was not assigned to these classes on the basis of cut off points instead expert judgement was used to obtain decently sized classes given the variable spread and number of measurements the ec data was split into four subregions northwest northeast southwest and southeast three srtm elevation classes low srtm 5 m moderately high 5 m srtm 8 m and high srtm 8 m two depth classes shallow depth 30 m deep depth 30 m and two clay thickness classes thin 10 m thick 10 m for the nominal data the ec data was split into the different land use and soil classes for each of these classes the variation between the ec and the ordinal data was statistically analysed using pearson s statistical test with a significance threshold set at 0 05 for the soil classes the patterns of ec with srtm elevation and filter depth were additionally analysed following local regression loess which constructs a moving window correlation using localized subsets of the data cleveland 1979 4 results 4 1 regional variation the kriging interpolation reveals large scale regional trends in groundwater ec fig 2 in general ec values increase from north to south towards the sea with most groundwater in the north being fresh and most groundwater in the south close to the sundarbans being saline between the predominately fresh north and the saline south the groundwater salinity variation is large in satkhira district west this variation is visible as alternating areas of saline and fresh groundwater in the khulna district centre small areas with fresher groundwater were detected between more saline areas and in the bagerhat district east the groundwater salinity varies the most in the eastern part in khulna district where the sundarbans extend furthest north the area with predominately saline water extends further north than in the satkhira and bagerhat districts the more saline nature of groundwater in khulna compared to that in satkhira and bagerhat is also indicated by the absence of an area with predominately fresh groundwater saline groundwater was detected up to the northern edge of khulna district fig 2 4 2 landscape feature data and ec table 2 shows the significant correlations between ec latitude longitude srtm elevation clay thickness and filter depth the pearson s correlation coefficients r are not high they vary between 0 05 and 0 44 ec correlates significantly with latitude longitude and srtm elevation but has no significant correlation with filter depth or clay thickness the correlations with latitude and longitude affirm the trends visible in the kriging interpolation ec increases southwards and eastwards the negative correlation with srtm elevation indicates that groundwater is fresher under higher areas than under lower areas the ec boxplots of the land use classes fig 3 and the soil classes fig 4 reveal that there are significant differences in the salinity of the groundwater below the different land use and soil classes for the land use classes it should be noted that the sampling method has a bias in the number of measurements per land use class most samples were taken in the treed villages but the smallest group still contains 57 samples even so significant differences are visible groundwater under irrigated rice is significantly fresher than groundwater under the other land use classes additionally the one season rice class contains significantly more saline groundwater than the treed villages class the ec values for the irrigated rice class show rather limited salinity variation while the salinity variation in the other land use classes is large fig 3 the ec variance in each soil class is high for each soil class the interquartile range is in two or more salinity classes six soil classes were excluded from the significance testing because they had 30 observations the kobadak and kodla fluvial soil classes a b contain significantly fresher groundwater than the other soil classes fig 4 while the tidal fringe flow soil class contains significantly more saline groundwater than the following four soil classes fluvial bhairab c tidal flat flow d tidal flat amd e and tidal fluvial f lastly groundwater under fluvial bhairab soils is significantly fresher than under tidal fringe soils 4 3 other correlations significant correlations are visible between the location and landscape feature data of the measurements table 2 some of these correlations are similar to the trends described above in section 2 srtm elevation is relatively high in the north in the east and for fluvial soils treed villages and irrigated rice the correlations with depth and clay thickness were not described in section 2 the clay thickness srtm elevation and filter depth are all intercorrelated measurements in wells with a deeper filter tend to be from locations with a thicker clay cap r 0 44 and a lower srtm elevation r 0 21 and consequently clay caps are thicker in areas with a lower srtm elevation 0 3 there is also a trend for filters to be deeper towards the north r 0 23 the filter depths for the soil classes fluvial bhairab tidal flat flow and tidal flat amd are significantly deeper than those for the other soil classes while the filter depths are shallowest for irrigated rice and the deepest for aquaculture 4 4 ec correlations of the split data the correlations between ec and the ordinal data for each subclass of location or landscape feature data are presented in table 3 in general the correlation coefficients are higher within the subclasses of the independent variables than for the entire dataset the ec correlations in the different subregions differ only slightly there are differences in correlations with latitude and longitude among the subregions but they reflect the trends visible in the kriging map fig 2 there are no large differences in the ec correlations with srtm elevation even in the northwest where the groundwater under high and low areas is fresh ec still varies with srtm this emphasizes the importance of this parameter on the groundwater ec ec does however correlate differently with filter depth between the regions with the southwest showing a slightly positive correlation r 0 11 and the northeast showing a slightly negative correlation r 0 11 while the northwest and southeast show no correlation between the high moderately high and low lying areas there are differences in the correlation of ec with latitude longitude srtm elevation and filter depth table 3 in low lying areas srtm elevation 5 m ec increases more strongly southwards and with filter depth indicating that groundwater in low lying areas in the south is more saline and that shallow groundwater is more saline than deeper groundwater moderately high srtm elevation 5 8 m and high areas srtm elevation 8 m show a stronger increase in groundwater salinity towards the east indicating that at higher elevations groundwater is more saline in the east than in the west only moderately high areas have a correlation with srtm elevation indicating that the change from fresher to more saline groundwater occurs gradually for the areas at intermediate elevations when split according to filter depth and clay thickness clear differences in correlation are visible the ec of the shallow groundwater and groundwater under a thin clay layer is controlled more strongly by elevation table 2 suggesting that the salinity of shallow or less isolated groundwater salinity is mostly controlled by elevation and not by regional scale trends in turn deeper groundwater or groundwater under a thick clay layer correlates more strongly with latitude and longitude table 2 which indicates that the salinity of the more isolated groundwater is more related to regional salinity gradients there are differences in ec correlations between the different land use classes when interpreting these differences the uneven distribution of measurements across the land use classes must be taken into account as most measurements are available for the treed village the ec correlations are similar to those for the full dataset table 2 the correlations with ec for the land use classes aquaculture and one season rice are similar to those for the low lying areas ec decreases with filter depth and also southwards suggesting that saline water recharge from the surface occurs more often in the south and that it mostly affects the shallow groundwater among the soil classes there are different correlations with ec for latitude elevation depth and clay thickness table 2 the ec correlates more strongly with latitude in the tidal flat and tidal fringe soils than in the fluvial soils the weaker correlation with latitude for the fluvial soils indicates that the fluvial kodla and kobadak soil classes contain fresh groundwater relatively independently from how far south the soils are located the explanation for the absence of a regional ec gradient for the fluvial bhairab soil class is that this soil type is present in only one location in the region the north of khulna district fig a 3 longitude correlates more strongly with ec for the tidal fringe and tidal flat flow soils than for the other soil types srtm elevation is relevant for the groundwater salinity in the three fluvial soil classes and in the tidal flat on fluvial soil class and to a lesser extent in the tidal fluvial and the tidal fringe flow soil classes table 3 fig 5 a in the fluvial kobadak and kodla soils the groundwater ec is mostly fresh in areas with a srtm elevation above 6 m fig 5a while in the tidal fluvial and fluvial bhairab classes measurements start to be mostly fresh at srtm elevations above 10 m in the tidal flat on fluvial soil class a correlation with high salinities is found for the low srtm elevations srtm elevation 5 m fig 5a ec does not correlate much with srtm elevation for the tidal fringe the tidal flat flow or the tidal flat amd soil classes which do not have many measurements at srtm elevations above 10 m for most soil classes the salinity decreases with depth fig 5b it decreases until approximately 30 m depth in the soil classes tidal fringe tidal fringe flow tidal flat on fluvial and tidal flat amd and it continues to drop until a depth of 60 m in the soil classes tidal flat flow fluvial kodla and fluvial bhairab table 3 fig 5b conversely the salinity of the shallow groundwater is fresher than the salinity of the deeper groundwater in the fluvial kobadak and tidal fluvial soil classes table 3 fig 5b 5 discussion the results indicate that the groundwater ec varies regionally with srtm elevation and between soil classes and land use classes however the correlations are not definite and do not explain all the variation nevertheless general trends are revealed which we discuss below subsequently we present a geomorphological analysis of landscape features and we use the general trends as a basis to infer the associated hydrological processes to shed more light on what controls the groundwater salinity the landscape features and their affiliated hydrological processes are then used to construct practical guidelines for predicting groundwater salinity throughout the region 5 1 general trends the correlation analysis and boxplots show some general trends between the landscape feature data and groundwater salinity the groundwater under low lying areas one season rice and tidal fringe soils is generally saline the negative correlation of ec with filter depth in low lying areas srtm elevation 5 m in areas with aquaculture and in areas with one season rice suggests the higher salinity there is caused by saline water recharge from the surface as described in previous studies sarker et al 2018 paul and vogl 2011 rahman et al 2018 naus et al 2019 additionally the negative correlation of ec with clay thickness for the low lying areas also suggests saline water recharge from the surface under high lying areas srtm elevation 8 m under irrigated rice and under fluvial kodla and kodabak soils groundwater is generally fresh the high srtm elevation contributes to recharge by precipitation that results in fresh groundwater as described in previous studies in bangladesh and elsewhere naus et al 2019 stuyfzand 1993 walraevens et al 2007 goes et al 2009 de louw et al 2011 santos et al 2012 the kobadak and kodla soil classes reveal the occurrence of fresh groundwater most clearly with the groundwater being significantly fresher than in the other soil classes fig 4 a high srtm elevation however provides less guarantee for fresh groundwater as there are also many measurements that indicate brackish brackish saline or saline groundwater at high srtm elevations fig 5a in the next section we will discuss the relation between groundwater ec and landscape features in more detail 5 2 geomorphological analysis of landscape features we used soil class as a primary indicator for landscape features and the geomorphological analysis as it is a reflection of sedimentology elevation and operational hydrological processes we clustered the soil classes in three landscape feature groups 1 fluvial soils present in prominent large scale meandering patterns 2 tidal fluvial soils which surround the fluvial soils or are present in prominent smaller scale meandering patterns and 3 tidal flat and tidal fringe soils located in the low lying flats or as moderately high to high narrow ridges srtm elevation 5 10 m next to channels creeks or roads 5 2 1 fluvial soils the spatial occurrences of the fluvial kodla fluvial kobadak and fluvial bhairab soils resemble large scale fossil meanders oriented from northwest to southeast throughout the region fig a 3 fig 6 a b a detailed hydrogeological study of one of the fluvial kobadak soils indicated that they consist of the sandy remnants of paleo channel deposits naus et al 2019 with the elevation difference being caused by differences in autocompaction between the sandy sediments of the paleo channel and the clayey sediments of the surrounding paleo flats vlam 1942 van der sluijs et al 1965 naus et al 2019 the high lying areas with fluvial soils are expected to have formed similarly throughout the region here the direction of the fluvial fossil meanders corresponds with the direction of meandering rivers during the progradation shamsudduha and uddin 2007 the large amounts of fresh groundwater found down to approximately 30 m under many of these fluvial soils could result from recharge of groundwater during the long period that the fossil meanders have been present enhanced by the presence of very permeable sandy deposits vacher 1988 and the absence of flooding with saline water from tides or tidal surges naus et al 2019 similar occurrence of fresh water recharge in higher elevated areas have been described in other brackish or saline coastal areas stuyfzand 1993 walraevens et al 2007 goes et al 2009 de louw et al 2011 santos et al 2012 it should be noted that the areas with fresh water recharge are also more sensitive to waste water influences such as from pit latrines in the treed villages which could pollute and contribute some salinity to the groundwater mcarthur et al 2012 brackish or saline groundwater was also detected under the fluvial soils looking at the soil map it seems that the areas of fluvial soils with brackish to saline groundwater are narrower than the areas of fluvial soils with fresh groundwater fig 6c d the narrowness could hamper the formation of fresh groundwater lenses possibly because they are more susceptible to lateral saline groundwater flow or to saline water recharge from occasional flooding additionally some of the fluvial soils with brackish or saline groundwater are adjacent to tidal channels fig 6c d so they might be influenced by flooding or infiltration of saline water from the tidal channel this could also explain the more saline groundwater in the bhairab fluvial soil which occurs next to the tidal rupsa river fig a 3 nevertheless a limited amount of shallow fresh groundwater was also detected under the narrow strips of fluvial soils 5 2 2 tidal fluvial soils the tidal fluvial soils are in low lying areas surrounding the fluvial soils or occur as high lying narrow fossil meanders fig a 3 fig 6e f this group sometimes contains shallow fresh groundwater but only when the soils are at srtm elevations above approximately 8 m fig 5a there are several possible explanations for the tidal fluvial soils having a higher salinity than the fluvial soils firstly as the name suggests these tidal fluvial soils are formed by tidally influenced rivers which were probably subjected to some marine influence during sediment deposition similar to the salinity in the present day tidal rivers bhuiyan and dutta 2012 secondly they are found in similarly narrow strips as the narrow fluvial soils suggesting more sensitivity to lateral salinization following saline water recharge in the surrounding low lying areas naus et al 2019 paul and vogl 2011 rahman et al 2018 sarker et al 2018 lastly it is possible that the relatively small tidal fluvial features were deposited more recently than the large scale paleo channels so have had less time to be recharged by fresh groundwater nevertheless some fresh groundwater is present in the shallow part of the aquifer under these tidal fluvial soils on high lying areas this is likely the result of recharge with fresh water 5 2 3 tidal flat and tidal fringe soils the various tidal flat or fringe soils are usually present as low lying flats or as very narrow ridges next to contemporary tidal creeks tidal rivers or roads fig a 3 fig 6e f for the soil classes tidal fringe and tidal flat flow and amd there is a lack of correlation between ec and srtm elevation table 2 this suggests that the high areas have a similar salinity to the low lying areas and that freshwater recharge is completely absent in the higher lying areas of these soils both the tidal flat on fluvial soil and tidal fringe flow soil have a negative correlation between ec and srtm elevation but the groundwater remains saline in the high areas the correlation with srtm elevation therefore does not necessarily indicate freshwater recharge in high areas but instead indicates possible saline water recharge in the low lying areas naus et al 2019 paul and vogl 2011 rahman et al 2018 sarker et al 2018 the narrow ridges are expected to be natural tidal creek levees or manmade embankments and roads both of which would result in the occurrence of mostly clayey material towards the top of the soil profile weinman et al 2008 the local lithology could hamper freshwater recharge in the higher parts of the various tidal flat or fringe soils additionally both the natural levees of the tidal creeks and the embankments have formed relatively recently which also limits how much influence freshwater recharge might have had in the tidal flat or fringe soils what gives guidance for predicting groundwater salinity is not the srtm elevation but regional trends table 2 the regional gradient of groundwater increasing in salinity eastwards is similar to the direction the coastline has accreted during the holocene shamsudduha and uddin 2007 and could also explain why the tidal fringe soils are more saline than the tidal flat soils the salinity in the tidal flat soils also correlates with the thickness of the clay layer and with depth which suggests that possible saline water recharge from the surface mostly affects the part of the groundwater that is less isolated as we will discuss in section 5 3 5 3 deeper connate groundwater not affected by landscape features the inconclusive correlations and large variation in salinity with landscape feature data is expected to be related to the prominent occurrence of connate groundwater worland et al 2015 ayers et al 2016 naus et al 2019 there are several indications that relatively deep groundwater is less controlled by landscape features than relatively shallow groundwater firstly the ec of deeper groundwater correlates less with srtm elevation than the ec of shallow groundwater table 3 secondly the shallow groundwater is fresher than the deep groundwater under the fluvial kobadak and tidal fluvial soils whereas the shallow groundwater is more saline than the deep groundwater under the tidal flat amd and tidal flat flow soils under one season rice and under aquaculture table 3 these differences suggest that the deep groundwater could mostly consist of connate water and that its salinity varies independently from landscape features and is controlled by the hydrological conditions prevailing when the aquifer became sealed off in bangladesh the salinity of the deeper paleo controlled groundwater correlates generally more strongly with the regional north south and west east gradients than does the salinity of the shallow groundwater as stated before these gradients are linked to the distance to the coastline and with the northwest to southeast direction in which the coastline accreted during the holocene shamsudduha and uddin 2007 as a consequence the deep groundwater in tidal flat flow soils in the northwest is fresh additionally in the southern part of the khulna district there are some fresh groundwater pockets deeper than 30 m which probably formed under slightly fresher conditions than the surrounding more saline groundwater to understand and predict the occurrence and the salinity of connate groundwater it is necessary to have detailed lithological data and detailed understanding of the paleo conditions naus et al 2019 the importance of paleo conditions to understand contemporary groundwater salinity in deeper groundwater has also been reported elsewhere for example in the mekong delta tran et al 2012 in suriname groen et al 2000 and in the netherlands delsman et al 2014 5 4 practical guidelines for predicting groundwater salinity in southwestern bangladesh the geomorphological analysis above must be seen as a first step towards presenting possible explanations for the regional groundwater salinity variation in southwestern bangladesh even though there remain uncertainties related to the paleo and present day hydrological processes caused by insufficient knowledge of the lithology recharge rates and groundwater flow and the occurrence and scale of tidal and marine intrusions we feel our analysis of relations between groundwater ec and landscape features and the associated controlling hydrological processes provides valuable information for practical applications related to groundwater exploration and for future geohydrological studies in the study area based on the above interpretation of the dominant hydrological processes for various landscape features we therefore constructed guidelines for the prediction of groundwater salinity throughout the region in the form of a flow chart fig 7 soil type lateral extent of the soil type elevation depth below surface and distance to tidal rivers were used as distinguishing factors the criterion for the width of the areas with fluvial soils was set at approximately 500 m with the final division being done by expert judgement following visual inspection of the landscape features the values for srtm and depth used in the flowchart were estimated based on the patterns revealed by the loess results fig 5 for each distinguished landscape features group percentages were calculated for the occurrence of the 4 ec salinity classes distinguished these percentages can be interpreted as the chance of finding each of the salinity classes in a landscape features group fig 7 illustrates that the best chance of finding fresh groundwater is under fluvial soils 59 especially under wide areas containing fluvial soils 69 and far away from tidal rivers 75 in the rest of the landscape features groups the chances of finding fresh groundwater are lower and depend on local conditions in tidal fluvial soils some fresh groundwater occurs in the high lying parts and in tidal flat areas there is a slight chance of finding connate fresh groundwater whose location cannot be determined based on landscape features the chance of finding saline water is highest under tidal flat or tidal fringe soils in wells 30 m deep 48 the occurrence of the wide fluvial soils could explain some of the regional groundwater salinity patterns in the khulna region hardly any fluvial soils are present except for the fluvial soils with some limited fresh groundwater that occur next to the rupsa river this lack of fluvial soils reflects the anomaly of more saline groundwater towards the north in khulna district and suggests that the reason for this increase in salinity is that for most of the holocene khulna district has consistently been a low lying area the lack of paleo channels has also been suggested by hoque et al 2014 who described the khulna region as having been part of the paleo interfluve during the pleistocene in contrast to satkhira and bagerhat which were interpreted to be part of the paleo channel areas the flow chart uses the fluvial soils with a large lateral extent as a landscape feature factor that indicates high chances for fresh groundwater the fao soil map used in this study however only covers the western and central parts of the study area fig a 3 the srtm elevation map shows areas with a high elevation in the northeastern part of the study area fig a 1 which resemble those of the fluvial fossil meanders with a large lateral extent in the northwest this suggests similar paleo channel structures in the northeast with high chances for fresh groundwater unfortunately we have too few ec measurements in the northeast to be able to verify this but our approach illustrates how landscape features in areas without ec measurements can be used to estimate groundwater salinity the main lines of the approach used here for southwestern bangladesh may be applied similarly in other coastal areas with available spatial data on elevation soil types and other landscape feature data to infer first order prediction of possible groundwater salinity variation 6 conclusions this study is the first to illustrate the relation between landscape features hydrological processes and the shallow 60 m groundwater salinity throughout southwestern bangladesh this knowledge is directly relevant for assessing and overcoming water supply problems in the region additionally the main lines of our approach may be applicable to predict groundwater salinity variation in other coastal areas with available spatial landscape feature data we conclude that geomorphologically analysed landscape features can be used to determine which controlling hydrological processes can be expected and to make a first prediction of the groundwater salinity the chance of fresh water recharge and subsequent occurrence of shallow fresh groundwater is highest 75 in wide occurrences of fluvial soils type kodabak and kodla that are not in the vicinity of tidal rivers these wide occurrences of fluvial soils are interpreted to be remnants of sandy deposits in large paleo channels high lying areas with other soil types are interpreted to be more susceptible to lateral saline water flow or saline water recharge by occasional tidal flooding and consequently have a lower chance of finding fresh groundwater the chance of saline water recharge and subsequent occurrence of saline water is highest 48 in

8599,in southwestern bangladesh the large variation in groundwater salinity has only been elucidated in small scale study areas and along large regional scale gradients we aimed to assess the regional shallow 60 m groundwater salinity variation with a higher resolution as a function of landscape features and associated hydrological processes spatial variation in groundwater salinity was assessed using 442 ec measurements from previous studies and 1998 new ec measurements groundwater ec values were correlated with well location data latitude longitude and depth of the filter and landscape feature data elevation soil type land use and surface clay thickness additionally we performed a geomorphological analysis of landscape features to infer associated hydrological processes we interpret wide fluvial zones to be remnants of sandy deposits in large paleo channels which allow freshwater recharge resulting in groundwater that is mostly 75 fresh narrow fluvial zones tidal fluvial zones and fluvial zones next to tidal rivers are more susceptible to lateral saline water flow or saline water recharge by occasional tidal flooding and only contain some shallow fresh groundwater in high lying zones tidal flat or tidal fringe zones hardly contain any fresh groundwater this study is the first to demonstrate the relation between landscape features hydrological processes and regional groundwater salinity throughout southwestern bangladesh the main lines of our approach may be applicable in other coastal areas with available spatial landscape feature data enabling a first

deltas is the ganges brahmaputra meghna gbm delta here manifestations of this stress are arsenic contamination of shallow groundwater resources nickson et al 1998 harvey et al 2002 severe pollution of surface water resources alam et al 2006 bhuiyan et al 2011 and limited availability of the meteorological water resources due to pronounced seasonality chowdhury 2010 sharma et al 2010 in the coastal

southwestern bangladesh a proper understanding of the current groundwater salinity distribution and underlying controlling processes is required such general understanding can also aid in understanding groundwater salinity variation in other coastal regions around the world most previous studies in southwestern bangladesh focussed on understanding the groundwater salinity variation by identifying the controlling hydrological processes in small local study areas george 2013 worland et al 2015 ayers et al 2016 sarker et al 2018 naus et al 2019 these studies have found much of the groundwater to be connate groundwater due to the subsurface lithology being characterized by thick covering clay layers and the landscape being flat leading to a stagnant hydrological system the occurrence and thickness of surface clay layers with low infiltration capacity is described to explain how isolated the groundwater is and therefore whether the groundwater consists of solely connate water formed under paleo conditions or whether the groundwater salinity has also been influenced by active processes george 2013 worland et al 2015 ayers et al 2016 sarker et al 2018 naus et al 2019 previous studies proposed several active processes that vary depending on the present day landscape features freshwater recharge from rain or rain fed pond water has been described in areas of higher elevation in southwestern bangladesh naus et al 2019 as well as in other coastal regions stuyfzand 1993 walraevens et al 2007 goes et al 2009 de louw et al 2011 santos et al 2012 salinization in low lying areas has been attributed to three processes in southwestern bangladesh tidally influenced flooding naus et al 2019 recharge by rainwater that has dissolved evaporite salts in the soil sarker et al 2018 and recharge from aquaculture ponds paul and vogl 2011 rahman et al 2018 naus et al 2019 at a regional scale the relevance of these hydrological processes is unexplored and accordingly the regional groundwater salinity variation remains poorly understood only some rough regional salinity gradients have been delineated indicating a trend for salinity to increase from north to south bangladesh water development board 2013 zahid et al 2018 for assessing and overcoming water supply problems in the region a spatially more detailed understanding of the current groundwater salinity distribution and underlying controlling processes is required we therefore set out to elucidate the regional shallow 60 m deep groundwater salinity variation with a higher resolution and to determine the relevant controlling hydrological processes in a regional scale study we aimed to use our findings to construct guidelines for predicting the groundwater salinity throughout the region 2 study area the study region latitude 22 12 to 23 0 longitude 88 53 to 89 58 comprises the three southwesternmost districts of bangladesh satkhira khulna and bagerhat the southern parts of these districts contain the largest tidal mangrove forest in the world the sundarbans which was excluded from the study area the remaining area is predominantly rural with the main sources of income being agriculture and aquaculture the topography soil type and land use vary throughout the study area figs a 1 a 2 a 3 most of the area is low lying with an elevation a few meters above mean sea level auerbach et al 2015 increasing regionally towards the north and east fig a1 at a smaller scale the topography is more varied fig a1 with some high lying areas up to 2 m higher than the low lying areas naus et al 2019 the dominant land use types are treed villages one season rice aquaculture and irrigated rice with treed villages and irrigated rice being located more often towards the north and at higher elevations than aquaculture or one season rice naus et al 2019 fig a2 a soil map is available for the satkhira and khulna districts from the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations 1959 fig a3 indicating a variety of fluvial tidal fluvial tidal flat and tidal fringe soils with fluvial soils occurring more in the north and in the west tidal fringe soils occurring more in the east and tidal flat soils occurring more in the south the fluvial soils often occur on higher land the other soil types also sometimes occur on relatively high lying areas the region experiences an annual rainfall of around 2500 mm with most of this precipitation falling in the monsoon from june to october the monsoon season is followed by a cool dry winter in october to march and a hot summer from march to june the tidal rivers and creeks become saline at the end of the summer in april and may bhuiyan and dutta 2012 in general three aquifer types are recognized in bangladesh mukherjee et al 2009 in the south of bangladesh the upper holocene aquifers are found to depths of approximately 60 m below are the main middle holocene aquifers which are found to approximately 150 m deep the late pleistocene early holocene aquifers extend deeper than 150 m this study focusses on the groundwater salinity in the upper holocene aquifers i e the first 60 m 3 methods 3 1 general approach we used a three way approach first we assessed how groundwater salinity throughout the region correlates with landscape features second we performed a geomorphological analysis of landscape features to infer associated hydrological processes and their effect on groundwater salinity third using landscape features we constructed practical guidelines to predict groundwater salinity throughout the region for our approach we required data already available or that could be rapidly collected at the scale of southwestern bangladesh we used three types of data 1 electrical conductivity ec data from previous studies and collected during this study to determine groundwater salinity 2 location data x y z of the ec measurements to analyse how ec varies with depth and throughout the region and 3 geomorphological landscape features from various existing large scale spatial data sources 3 2 data collection data mining and data processing the ec data was collected by the authors and msc students from dhaka university during multiple fieldwork campaigns from january 2014 to september 2018 using a low cost method that consisted of measuring the ec of shallow groundwater 60 m deep by pumping household tube wells along regional transects and detailed study areas throughout the region the protocol for measuring ec from the tube wells included the purging of the stagnant water from the tube well by pumping each tube well for at least a minute we expect the measurements collected over the span of several years to be comparable as seasonal and inter annual salinity variation is expected to be low because of the stagnancy of the connate groundwater dominated hydrological system george 2013 worland et al 2015 ayers et al 2016 sarker et al 2018 naus et al 2019 this low cost method made it possible to collect 1998 new ec groundwater measurements at tube wells three handheld field measurement devices were used for the ec measurements the hanna hi 9829 hanna 127 instruments usa the hanna hi 98 311 hanna 127 instruments usa and the 18 50 sa multimeter eijkelkamp the netherlands additional chemical analysis of the water samples was performed for a subset of sampling locations for this 221 groundwater samples were taken along 10 local scale transects in january 2017 and january 2018 the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and stored in 15 ml polyethylene tubes for analysis in the lab for cl so4 and no3 using ion chromatography alkalinity was measured within 36 h of sampling by titration hach company usa this data was augmented with data on shallow groundwater 60 m from previously published articles and projects and from a datafile obtained from vanderbilt university see table 1 for details in total our database consisted of 2440 ec measurements from the upper holocene aquifers table 1 the regional database on groundwater analyses was augmented with data from naus et al 2019 and ayers et al 2016 which provided an additional 136 samples leading to a total of 357 hydrochemical samples table 1 these samples were used to infer the salinity from ec measurements as explained in section 3 3 the database of groundwater ec chloride and alkalinity is available as supplementary data location datawas collected for each ec measurement point during the field campaigns and consisted of latitude longitude and depth of the filter the latitude and longitude of the measured tube wells were obtained by means of gps and the depth was estimated from details supplied by local residents on the filter depth and the number of pipes and filters used when installing the tube well when the users sporadically did not remember or were in doubt about the depth of their tubewell we did not include their tubewell for the landscape features we used the data sources available at the scale of southwestern bangladesh these yielded data on elevation land use soil type and surface clay thickness elevation was estimated using shuttle radar topography mission data srtm farr et al 2007 taking into account that the exact values are not accurate as they have been affected by vegetation auerbach et al 2015 land use was based on supervised classification of cloudless imagery from landsat 8 17th and 24th of march 2015 paths 137 and 138 row 44 calibrated with observations from aerial images and field observations soil type was derived from the fao soil map food and agriculture organization of the united nations 1959 since the soil map is approximately 70 years old we could expect the dynamic nature of the delta to have led to differences compared to present day circumstances certainly on a small scale however visual similarities of the soil map fig a3 with the srtm fig a1 and the land use map fig a2 give confidence in its present day validity the thickness of the surface clay layer was based on borehole logs from various previous studies and from 14 newly constructed tube wells see table 1 for details as the variation in surface clay thickness in southwest bangladesh is large ayers et al 2016 naus et al 2019 the interpolated clay thickness is only used for ec measurements less than 100 m from a borehole log there were 313 such ec measurements 3 3 definition of salinity most salinity classifications for drinking water are based on chloride concentration in the water custodio and bruggeman 1987 stuyfzand 1993 however salinity and ec are not only controlled by cl but also by other anions particularly so4 and no3 and by alkalinity therefore we first assessed to what extent chloride controls ec as well as salinity in the study region by comparing the available hydrochemical analyses against the ec values this revealed a large spread in combinations of chloride concentrations and ec which particularly affects the interpretation of the salinity in the lower ranges fig 1 at ec values lower than 5 ms cm alkalinity is prominent and can lead to an overestimated chloride concentration based on ec between 5 and 10 ms cm alkalinity is less prominent but may still be relevant when inferring salinity from the ec instead of from the chloride content this confirms that ec is not always a good estimator for the chloride concentration the large spread makes it impossible to perform chemical calculations based on the ec such as calculations of the fractions of seawater nevertheless the r2 of 0 84 between ec and chloride gives us confidence to use ec to judge the groundwater salinity to differentiate between fresh and brackish groundwater we used the drinking water guidelines of the bangladesh government ayers et al 2016 according to which groundwater with an ec of 2 ms cm or less is potable this definition is broader than the classification of stuyfzand 1993 as it results in some of the measurements interpreted as fresh having a chloride concentration above 300 mg l the other salinity classes were constructed based on the stuyfzand classification 1993 and the approximate correlation between ec and chloride fig 1 groundwater was classified as brackish if it had an ec of 2 3 5 ms cm largely corresponding with a chloride concentration of 300 1000 mg l it was classified as brackish saline if the ec was 3 5 5 ms cm corresponding with a chloride concentration 1000 2500 mg l it was classified as saline if the ec was 5 ms cm corresponding with a chloride concentration 2500 mg l 3 4 statistical analysis various statistical and geostatistical tests were used to assess regional trends and ec variation with landscape features variation of ec with the ordinal location and landscape feature data latitude longitude elevation depth and surface clay thickness was statistically analysed using pearson s statistical test with a significance threshold set at 0 05 variation of ec with the nominal data consisting of land use and soil type was assessed using boxplots of the different classes the distributions of the classes with 30 or more samples were tested for significant differences using kruskal wallis kruskal and wallis 1952 and dunn s tests dunn 1964 with the significance threshold value adjusted according to bonferroni correction dunn 1961 by dividing the original value of 0 05 by the number of simultaneously tested classes regional trends in ec were also visually assessed after ordinary kriging interpolation of the ec data which has been applied before for soil salinity bilgili 2013 lobell et al 2010 after trial and error we decided to use a spherical variogram model using the 8 nearest measurements to estimate the ec to prevent inclusion of data from too far away and to prevent oversensitivity to individual measurements to ascertain which variable controls the ec independently from possible cross correlation the ec data was split into classes according to latitude longitude elevation clay thickness depth land use and soil type the ordinal data was not assigned to these classes on the basis of cut off points instead expert judgement was used to obtain decently sized classes given the variable spread and number of measurements the ec data was split into four subregions northwest northeast southwest and southeast three srtm elevation classes low srtm 5 m moderately high 5 m srtm 8 m and high srtm 8 m two depth classes shallow depth 30 m deep depth 30 m and two clay thickness classes thin 10 m thick 10 m for the nominal data the ec data was split into the different land use and soil classes for each of these classes the variation between the ec and the ordinal data was statistically analysed using pearson s statistical test with a significance threshold set at 0 05 for the soil classes the patterns of ec with srtm elevation and filter depth were additionally analysed following local regression loess which constructs a moving window correlation using localized subsets of the data cleveland 1979 4 results 4 1 regional variation the kriging interpolation reveals large scale regional trends in groundwater ec fig 2 in general ec values increase from north to south towards the sea with most groundwater in the north being fresh and most groundwater in the south close to the sundarbans being saline between the predominately fresh north and the saline south the groundwater salinity variation is large in satkhira district west this variation is visible as alternating areas of saline and fresh groundwater in the khulna district centre small areas with fresher groundwater were detected between more saline areas and in the bagerhat district east the groundwater salinity varies the most in the eastern part in khulna district where the sundarbans extend furthest north the area with predominately saline water extends further north than in the satkhira and bagerhat districts the more saline nature of groundwater in khulna compared to that in satkhira and bagerhat is also indicated by the absence of an area with predominately fresh groundwater saline groundwater was detected up to the northern edge of khulna district fig 2 4 2 landscape feature data and ec table 2 shows the significant correlations between ec latitude longitude srtm elevation clay thickness and filter depth the pearson s correlation coefficients r are not high they vary between 0 05 and 0 44 ec correlates significantly with latitude longitude and srtm elevation but has no significant correlation with filter depth or clay thickness the correlations with latitude and longitude affirm the trends visible in the kriging interpolation ec increases southwards and eastwards the negative correlation with srtm elevation indicates that groundwater is fresher under higher areas than under lower areas the ec boxplots of the land use classes fig 3 and the soil classes fig 4 reveal that there are significant differences in the salinity of the groundwater below the different land use and soil classes for the land use classes it should be noted that the sampling method has a bias in the number of measurements per land use class most samples were taken in the treed villages but the smallest group still contains 57 samples even so significant differences are visible groundwater under irrigated rice is significantly fresher than groundwater under the other land use classes additionally the one season rice class contains significantly more saline groundwater than the treed villages class the ec values for the irrigated rice class show rather limited salinity variation while the salinity variation in the other land use classes is large fig 3 the ec variance in each soil class is high for each soil class the interquartile range is in two or more salinity classes six soil classes were excluded from the significance testing because they had 30 observations the kobadak and kodla fluvial soil classes a b contain significantly fresher groundwater than the other soil classes fig 4 while the tidal fringe flow soil class contains significantly more saline groundwater than the following four soil classes fluvial bhairab c tidal flat flow d tidal flat amd e and tidal fluvial f lastly groundwater under fluvial bhairab soils is significantly fresher than under tidal fringe soils 4 3 other correlations significant correlations are visible between the location and landscape feature data of the measurements table 2 some of these correlations are similar to the trends described above in section 2 srtm elevation is relatively high in the north in the east and for fluvial soils treed villages and irrigated rice the correlations with depth and clay thickness were not described in section 2 the clay thickness srtm elevation and filter depth are all intercorrelated measurements in wells with a deeper filter tend to be from locations with a thicker clay cap r 0 44 and a lower srtm elevation r 0 21 and consequently clay caps are thicker in areas with a lower srtm elevation 0 3 there is also a trend for filters to be deeper towards the north r 0 23 the filter depths for the soil classes fluvial bhairab tidal flat flow and tidal flat amd are significantly deeper than those for the other soil classes while the filter depths are shallowest for irrigated rice and the deepest for aquaculture 4 4 ec correlations of the split data the correlations between ec and the ordinal data for each subclass of location or landscape feature data are presented in table 3 in general the correlation coefficients are higher within the subclasses of the independent variables than for the entire dataset the ec correlations in the different subregions differ only slightly there are differences in correlations with latitude and longitude among the subregions but they reflect the trends visible in the kriging map fig 2 there are no large differences in the ec correlations with srtm elevation even in the northwest where the groundwater under high and low areas is fresh ec still varies with srtm this emphasizes the importance of this parameter on the groundwater ec ec does however correlate differently with filter depth between the regions with the southwest showing a slightly positive correlation r 0 11 and the northeast showing a slightly negative correlation r 0 11 while the northwest and southeast show no correlation between the high moderately high and low lying areas there are differences in the correlation of ec with latitude longitude srtm elevation and filter depth table 3 in low lying areas srtm elevation 5 m ec increases more strongly southwards and with filter depth indicating that groundwater in low lying areas in the south is more saline and that shallow groundwater is more saline than deeper groundwater moderately high srtm elevation 5 8 m and high areas srtm elevation 8 m show a stronger increase in groundwater salinity towards the east indicating that at higher elevations groundwater is more saline in the east than in the west only moderately high areas have a correlation with srtm elevation indicating that the change from fresher to more saline groundwater occurs gradually for the areas at intermediate elevations when split according to filter depth and clay thickness clear differences in correlation are visible the ec of the shallow groundwater and groundwater under a thin clay layer is controlled more strongly by elevation table 2 suggesting that the salinity of shallow or less isolated groundwater salinity is mostly controlled by elevation and not by regional scale trends in turn deeper groundwater or groundwater under a thick clay layer correlates more strongly with latitude and longitude table 2 which indicates that the salinity of the more isolated groundwater is more related to regional salinity gradients there are differences in ec correlations between the different land use classes when interpreting these differences the uneven distribution of measurements across the land use classes must be taken into account as most measurements are available for the treed village the ec correlations are similar to those for the full dataset table 2 the correlations with ec for the land use classes aquaculture and one season rice are similar to those for the low lying areas ec decreases with filter depth and also southwards suggesting that saline water recharge from the surface occurs more often in the south and that it mostly affects the shallow groundwater among the soil classes there are different correlations with ec for latitude elevation depth and clay thickness table 2 the ec correlates more strongly with latitude in the tidal flat and tidal fringe soils than in the fluvial soils the weaker correlation with latitude for the fluvial soils indicates that the fluvial kodla and kobadak soil classes contain fresh groundwater relatively independently from how far south the soils are located the explanation for the absence of a regional ec gradient for the fluvial bhairab soil class is that this soil type is present in only one location in the region the north of khulna district fig a 3 longitude correlates more strongly with ec for the tidal fringe and tidal flat flow soils than for the other soil types srtm elevation is relevant for the groundwater salinity in the three fluvial soil classes and in the tidal flat on fluvial soil class and to a lesser extent in the tidal fluvial and the tidal fringe flow soil classes table 3 fig 5 a in the fluvial kobadak and kodla soils the groundwater ec is mostly fresh in areas with a srtm elevation above 6 m fig 5a while in the tidal fluvial and fluvial bhairab classes measurements start to be mostly fresh at srtm elevations above 10 m in the tidal flat on fluvial soil class a correlation with high salinities is found for the low srtm elevations srtm elevation 5 m fig 5a ec does not correlate much with srtm elevation for the tidal fringe the tidal flat flow or the tidal flat amd soil classes which do not have many measurements at srtm elevations above 10 m for most soil classes the salinity decreases with depth fig 5b it decreases until approximately 30 m depth in the soil classes tidal fringe tidal fringe flow tidal flat on fluvial and tidal flat amd and it continues to drop until a depth of 60 m in the soil classes tidal flat flow fluvial kodla and fluvial bhairab table 3 fig 5b conversely the salinity of the shallow groundwater is fresher than the salinity of the deeper groundwater in the fluvial kobadak and tidal fluvial soil classes table 3 fig 5b 5 discussion the results indicate that the groundwater ec varies regionally with srtm elevation and between soil classes and land use classes however the correlations are not definite and do not explain all the variation nevertheless general trends are revealed which we discuss below subsequently we present a geomorphological analysis of landscape features and we use the general trends as a basis to infer the associated hydrological processes to shed more light on what controls the groundwater salinity the landscape features and their affiliated hydrological processes are then used to construct practical guidelines for predicting groundwater salinity throughout the region 5 1 general trends the correlation analysis and boxplots show some general trends between the landscape feature data and groundwater salinity the groundwater under low lying areas one season rice and tidal fringe soils is generally saline the negative correlation of ec with filter depth in low lying areas srtm elevation 5 m in areas with aquaculture and in areas with one season rice suggests the higher salinity there is caused by saline water recharge from the surface as described in previous studies sarker et al 2018 paul and vogl 2011 rahman et al 2018 naus et al 2019 additionally the negative correlation of ec with clay thickness for the low lying areas also suggests saline water recharge from the surface under high lying areas srtm elevation 8 m under irrigated rice and under fluvial kodla and kodabak soils groundwater is generally fresh the high srtm elevation contributes to recharge by precipitation that results in fresh groundwater as described in previous studies in bangladesh and elsewhere naus et al 2019 stuyfzand 1993 walraevens et al 2007 goes et al 2009 de louw et al 2011 santos et al 2012 the kobadak and kodla soil classes reveal the occurrence of fresh groundwater most clearly with the groundwater being significantly fresher than in the other soil classes fig 4 a high srtm elevation however provides less guarantee for fresh groundwater as there are also many measurements that indicate brackish brackish saline or saline groundwater at high srtm elevations fig 5a in the next section we will discuss the relation between groundwater ec and landscape features in more detail 5 2 geomorphological analysis of landscape features we used soil class as a primary indicator for landscape features and the geomorphological analysis as it is a reflection of sedimentology elevation and operational hydrological processes we clustered the soil classes in three landscape feature groups 1 fluvial soils present in prominent large scale meandering patterns 2 tidal fluvial soils which surround the fluvial soils or are present in prominent smaller scale meandering patterns and 3 tidal flat and tidal fringe soils located in the low lying flats or as moderately high to high narrow ridges srtm elevation 5 10 m next to channels creeks or roads 5 2 1 fluvial soils the spatial occurrences of the fluvial kodla fluvial kobadak and fluvial bhairab soils resemble large scale fossil meanders oriented from northwest to southeast throughout the region fig a 3 fig 6 a b a detailed hydrogeological study of one of the fluvial kobadak soils indicated that they consist of the sandy remnants of paleo channel deposits naus et al 2019 with the elevation difference being caused by differences in autocompaction between the sandy sediments of the paleo channel and the clayey sediments of the surrounding paleo flats vlam 1942 van der sluijs et al 1965 naus et al 2019 the high lying areas with fluvial soils are expected to have formed similarly throughout the region here the direction of the fluvial fossil meanders corresponds with the direction of meandering rivers during the progradation shamsudduha and uddin 2007 the large amounts of fresh groundwater found down to approximately 30 m under many of these fluvial soils could result from recharge of groundwater during the long period that the fossil meanders have been present enhanced by the presence of very permeable sandy deposits vacher 1988 and the absence of flooding with saline water from tides or tidal surges naus et al 2019 similar occurrence of fresh water recharge in higher elevated areas have been described in other brackish or saline coastal areas stuyfzand 1993 walraevens et al 2007 goes et al 2009 de louw et al 2011 santos et al 2012 it should be noted that the areas with fresh water recharge are also more sensitive to waste water influences such as from pit latrines in the treed villages which could pollute and contribute some salinity to the groundwater mcarthur et al 2012 brackish or saline groundwater was also detected under the fluvial soils looking at the soil map it seems that the areas of fluvial soils with brackish to saline groundwater are narrower than the areas of fluvial soils with fresh groundwater fig 6c d the narrowness could hamper the formation of fresh groundwater lenses possibly because they are more susceptible to lateral saline groundwater flow or to saline water recharge from occasional flooding additionally some of the fluvial soils with brackish or saline groundwater are adjacent to tidal channels fig 6c d so they might be influenced by flooding or infiltration of saline water from the tidal channel this could also explain the more saline groundwater in the bhairab fluvial soil which occurs next to the tidal rupsa river fig a 3 nevertheless a limited amount of shallow fresh groundwater was also detected under the narrow strips of fluvial soils 5 2 2 tidal fluvial soils the tidal fluvial soils are in low lying areas surrounding the fluvial soils or occur as high lying narrow fossil meanders fig a 3 fig 6e f this group sometimes contains shallow fresh groundwater but only when the soils are at srtm elevations above approximately 8 m fig 5a there are several possible explanations for the tidal fluvial soils having a higher salinity than the fluvial soils firstly as the name suggests these tidal fluvial soils are formed by tidally influenced rivers which were probably subjected to some marine influence during sediment deposition similar to the salinity in the present day tidal rivers bhuiyan and dutta 2012 secondly they are found in similarly narrow strips as the narrow fluvial soils suggesting more sensitivity to lateral salinization following saline water recharge in the surrounding low lying areas naus et al 2019 paul and vogl 2011 rahman et al 2018 sarker et al 2018 lastly it is possible that the relatively small tidal fluvial features were deposited more recently than the large scale paleo channels so have had less time to be recharged by fresh groundwater nevertheless some fresh groundwater is present in the shallow part of the aquifer under these tidal fluvial soils on high lying areas this is likely the result of recharge with fresh water 5 2 3 tidal flat and tidal fringe soils the various tidal flat or fringe soils are usually present as low lying flats or as very narrow ridges next to contemporary tidal creeks tidal rivers or roads fig a 3 fig 6e f for the soil classes tidal fringe and tidal flat flow and amd there is a lack of correlation between ec and srtm elevation table 2 this suggests that the high areas have a similar salinity to the low lying areas and that freshwater recharge is completely absent in the higher lying areas of these soils both the tidal flat on fluvial soil and tidal fringe flow soil have a negative correlation between ec and srtm elevation but the groundwater remains saline in the high areas the correlation with srtm elevation therefore does not necessarily indicate freshwater recharge in high areas but instead indicates possible saline water recharge in the low lying areas naus et al 2019 paul and vogl 2011 rahman et al 2018 sarker et al 2018 the narrow ridges are expected to be natural tidal creek levees or manmade embankments and roads both of which would result in the occurrence of mostly clayey material towards the top of the soil profile weinman et al 2008 the local lithology could hamper freshwater recharge in the higher parts of the various tidal flat or fringe soils additionally both the natural levees of the tidal creeks and the embankments have formed relatively recently which also limits how much influence freshwater recharge might have had in the tidal flat or fringe soils what gives guidance for predicting groundwater salinity is not the srtm elevation but regional trends table 2 the regional gradient of groundwater increasing in salinity eastwards is similar to the direction the coastline has accreted during the holocene shamsudduha and uddin 2007 and could also explain why the tidal fringe soils are more saline than the tidal flat soils the salinity in the tidal flat soils also correlates with the thickness of the clay layer and with depth which suggests that possible saline water recharge from the surface mostly affects the part of the groundwater that is less isolated as we will discuss in section 5 3 5 3 deeper connate groundwater not affected by landscape features the inconclusive correlations and large variation in salinity with landscape feature data is expected to be related to the prominent occurrence of connate groundwater worland et al 2015 ayers et al 2016 naus et al 2019 there are several indications that relatively deep groundwater is less controlled by landscape features than relatively shallow groundwater firstly the ec of deeper groundwater correlates less with srtm elevation than the ec of shallow groundwater table 3 secondly the shallow groundwater is fresher than the deep groundwater under the fluvial kobadak and tidal fluvial soils whereas the shallow groundwater is more saline than the deep groundwater under the tidal flat amd and tidal flat flow soils under one season rice and under aquaculture table 3 these differences suggest that the deep groundwater could mostly consist of connate water and that its salinity varies independently from landscape features and is controlled by the hydrological conditions prevailing when the aquifer became sealed off in bangladesh the salinity of the deeper paleo controlled groundwater correlates generally more strongly with the regional north south and west east gradients than does the salinity of the shallow groundwater as stated before these gradients are linked to the distance to the coastline and with the northwest to southeast direction in which the coastline accreted during the holocene shamsudduha and uddin 2007 as a consequence the deep groundwater in tidal flat flow soils in the northwest is fresh additionally in the southern part of the khulna district there are some fresh groundwater pockets deeper than 30 m which probably formed under slightly fresher conditions than the surrounding more saline groundwater to understand and predict the occurrence and the salinity of connate groundwater it is necessary to have detailed lithological data and detailed understanding of the paleo conditions naus et al 2019 the importance of paleo conditions to understand contemporary groundwater salinity in deeper groundwater has also been reported elsewhere for example in the mekong delta tran et al 2012 in suriname groen et al 2000 and in the netherlands delsman et al 2014 5 4 practical guidelines for predicting groundwater salinity in southwestern bangladesh the geomorphological analysis above must be seen as a first step towards presenting possible explanations for the regional groundwater salinity variation in southwestern bangladesh even though there remain uncertainties related to the paleo and present day hydrological processes caused by insufficient knowledge of the lithology recharge rates and groundwater flow and the occurrence and scale of tidal and marine intrusions we feel our analysis of relations between groundwater ec and landscape features and the associated controlling hydrological processes provides valuable information for practical applications related to groundwater exploration and for future geohydrological studies in the study area based on the above interpretation of the dominant hydrological processes for various landscape features we therefore constructed guidelines for the prediction of groundwater salinity throughout the region in the form of a flow chart fig 7 soil type lateral extent of the soil type elevation depth below surface and distance to tidal rivers were used as distinguishing factors the criterion for the width of the areas with fluvial soils was set at approximately 500 m with the final division being done by expert judgement following visual inspection of the landscape features the values for srtm and depth used in the flowchart were estimated based on the patterns revealed by the loess results fig 5 for each distinguished landscape features group percentages were calculated for the occurrence of the 4 ec salinity classes distinguished these percentages can be interpreted as the chance of finding each of the salinity classes in a landscape features group fig 7 illustrates that the best chance of finding fresh groundwater is under fluvial soils 59 especially under wide areas containing fluvial soils 69 and far away from tidal rivers 75 in the rest of the landscape features groups the chances of finding fresh groundwater are lower and depend on local conditions in tidal fluvial soils some fresh groundwater occurs in the high lying parts and in tidal flat areas there is a slight chance of finding connate fresh groundwater whose location cannot be determined based on landscape features the chance of finding saline water is highest under tidal flat or tidal fringe soils in wells 30 m deep 48 the occurrence of the wide fluvial soils could explain some of the regional groundwater salinity patterns in the khulna region hardly any fluvial soils are present except for the fluvial soils with some limited fresh groundwater that occur next to the rupsa river this lack of fluvial soils reflects the anomaly of more saline groundwater towards the north in khulna district and suggests that the reason for this increase in salinity is that for most of the holocene khulna district has consistently been a low lying area the lack of paleo channels has also been suggested by hoque et al 2014 who described the khulna region as having been part of the paleo interfluve during the pleistocene in contrast to satkhira and bagerhat which were interpreted to be part of the paleo channel areas the flow chart uses the fluvial soils with a large lateral extent as a landscape feature factor that indicates high chances for fresh groundwater the fao soil map used in this study however only covers the western and central parts of the study area fig a 3 the srtm elevation map shows areas with a high elevation in the northeastern part of the study area fig a 1 which resemble those of the fluvial fossil meanders with a large lateral extent in the northwest this suggests similar paleo channel structures in the northeast with high chances for fresh groundwater unfortunately we have too few ec measurements in the northeast to be able to verify this but our approach illustrates how landscape features in areas without ec measurements can be used to estimate groundwater salinity the main lines of the approach used here for southwestern bangladesh may be applied similarly in other coastal areas with available spatial data on elevation soil types and other landscape feature data to infer first order prediction of possible groundwater salinity variation 6 conclusions this study is the first to illustrate the relation between landscape features hydrological processes and the shallow 60 m groundwater salinity throughout southwestern bangladesh this knowledge is directly relevant for assessing and overcoming water supply problems in the region additionally the main lines of our approach may be applicable to predict groundwater salinity variation in other coastal areas with available spatial landscape feature data we conclude that geomorphologically analysed landscape features can be used to determine which controlling hydrological processes can be expected and to make a first prediction of the groundwater salinity the chance of fresh water recharge and subsequent occurrence of shallow fresh groundwater is highest 75 in wide occurrences of fluvial soils type kodabak and kodla that are not in the vicinity of tidal rivers these wide occurrences of fluvial soils are interpreted to be remnants of sandy deposits in large paleo channels high lying areas with other soil types are interpreted to be more susceptible to lateral saline water flow or saline water recharge by occasional tidal flooding and consequently have a lower chance of finding fresh groundwater the chance of saline water recharge and subsequent occurrence of saline water is highest 48 in
