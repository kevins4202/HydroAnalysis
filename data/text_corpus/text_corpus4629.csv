23145,fatigue assessment is a critical issue for marine structures which usually encounter a combination load of a low frequency and a high frequency component furthermore two components are commonly analyzed separately in a strict sense each of two components cannot be considered as narrowband processes recently the authors proposed a combination of fatigue damage method han ma method for predicting fatigue damage on the assumption of two well separated and narrowband gaussian components the method is extended to non narrowband and frequency overlapped cases in this paper in addition the application of existing combined spectrum method with dual narrow banded correction factor such as jiao moan method low s bimodal method low 2014 method and combination of fatigue damage method such as dnv method huang moan method is also investigated these methods are also compared with some general wide band spectral methods such as dirlik method single moment method benasciutti tovo method and park method the results show that jiao moan method low s bimodal method low 2014 method and han ma method can still provide very accurate fatigue damage estimation when two gaussian processes are separately non narrowband and have overlapped frequencies in particular the accuracy of low 2014 method and han ma method is very close to that from some general spectral methods in the case that two gaussian components have overlapped frequencies keywords combination of fatigue damage gaussian random process bimodal spectra rainflow counting 1 introduction fatigue is a main mode of failure in marine engineering most marine structures commonly experience complex environmental loads an example of such a situation is a wave frequency wf component due to the first order wave forces and a low frequency lf component excited by the second order wave forces for some deepwater mooring lines and risers dnv rp f204 2010b dnv os e301 2004 low 2011 another example may be stress response for large container ships which consists of a wf and a high frequency hf component hf component is generally produced by whipping springing andersen and jensen 2013 nielsen and jensen 2011 mao and rychlik 2012 in addition wind and wave loads are the main loads for offshore wind turbine support structures yeter et al 2016 in such situations the combination of two loads will greatly reduce the fatigue life of structures since it increases stress range more than that of the individual process park and choung 2014 therefore fatigue assessment under two gaussian loads needs more attention in engineering design during the past decade many techniques have been developed to perform a reliable fatigue damage estimation subjected to combined effect of two random loadings in general these evaluation techniques can be categorized into four dnv 2010a dnv 2004 low 2011 api 2005 iso 2005 fully coupled time domain analysis with rainflow counting rfc astm 2005 general wide band spectral method combined spectrum method with dual narrow banded correction factor combination of fatigue damage method the dynamic analysis of structures under two gaussian random loads is complex since it includes the effect of dynamic coupling and a various of non linearities low and langley 2008 thus a fully coupled time domain analysis is generally employed to obtain accurate stress time series consequently fatigue damage can be predicted with rainflow counting astm 2005 this approach is considered to be the most accurate and usually used in the detailed design stage or as a benchmark during the verification of other approaches abs 2003 li and ringsberg 2013 in contrast with the above frequency domain method becomes popular which is very practical and time saving the power spectral density function psd of stress can be established by a linear spectral analysis dnv rp f204 2010b abs 2012 in marine structures the psd of stress is not strictly narrow banded therefore general wide band spectral fatigue methods such as dirlik method dirlik 1985 single moment method lutes and larsen 1990 benasciutti tovo method benasciutti and tovo 2005 and park method park and choung 2014 park and song 2015 have been proposed for precise damage predictions for marine structures subjected to two gaussian random loads fully coupled time domain analysis method and frequency domain method exist some shortcomings the former will take high computational effort and the latter is only suitable for predicting wave induced fatigue damage due to the limitations of spectral analysis methods abs 2012 in the early stage of the design process it is convenient to calculate the individual dynamic response from two gaussian random processes separately low 2011 for example the lf response of mooring and risers can be simulated either in time domain or in frequency domain the wind response of offshore wind turbine is commonly calculated in time domain while the wf response is analyzed in frequency domain using a linear spectral analysis temple 2006 for the above situation the total fatigue damage can be estimated with combined spectrum method with dual narrow banded correction factor or combination of fatigue damage method dnv os e301 2004 api rp 2sk 2005 iso 19901 7 2005 dnv rp c203 2012 the combined spectrum method with dual narrow banded correction factor takes the result of the combined spectrum approach and multiplies it by a bandwidth correction factor which only need the mean zero up crossing frequency and the zero order spectral moment of two random processes as inputs dnv os e301 2004 api rp 2sk 2005 iso 19901 7 2005 dnv rp c203 2012 these input parameters can be extracted conveniently from a stress time series or a stress psd various dual narrow banded correction factor can be computed by jiao moan method jiao and moan 1990 sakai okamura method sakai and okamura 1995 fu cebon method fu and cebon 2000 low s bimodal method low 2010 and low 2014 method low 2014 jiao moan method low s bimodal method low 2014 method and han ma method have been verified to perform well in the combination of two narrowband and well separated gaussian components han and ma 2016 moreover jiao moan method has been widely used in many rules for estimating the combined fatigue damage due to wf and lf response dnv os e301 2004 api rp 2sk 2005 iso 19901 7 2005 dnv rp c203 2012 low s bimodal method has also been applied to calculate the fatigue damage produced by whipping springing andersen and jensen 2013 considering separation of two gaussian processes there are also some practical models for combination of fatigue damages damages from two dynamic processes are calculated independently and then are superposed this treatment takes only the individual damages and mean zero up crossing frequency as input lotsberg derived a simple explicit formula which has been applied in dnv s rule for evaluating the combined fatigue damage due to two random loads lotsberg 2005 dnv 2012a b however it has been proven that dnv formula gives too conservative damage results huang and moan 2006 to reduce the conservation of fatigue damage huang and moan proposed a formula similar with dnv formula which is expressed as an explicit function of individual damages and mean zero up crossing frequency huang and moan 2006 but this formula gives good predictions only in a small bandwidth range recently han and ma have developed a practical formula which is simple and provides accurate fatigue damage estimations han and ma 2016 in addition for combination of a stress time series and a stress response spectra the above methods can still predict the combined fatigue damage however in practice two individual components may not be narrowband and well separated in a strict sense for example the wind response of an offshore wind turbine support structure is generally wide band kuhn 2003 the wave response in marine structures may also be wide band the corresponding spectral width parameter may exceed 0 5 in some cases hu and li 2010 which should be not addressed as a narrowband process furthermore full scale measurements for some container ships have shown that the wf response and hf response induced by springing cannot generally be considered narrow banded andersen and jensen 2013 therefore the combination process becomes a combination of a wide band and a narrowband components or a combination of a wide band and a wide band components in addition if two stress responses are a time series and a psd respectively one cannot distinguish whether they are well separated i e two stress responses may have overlapped frequencies qin and ma 2017 considering these situations more work is needed to validate whether jiao moan method low s bimodal method low 2014 method and han ma method are suitable this paper investigates the applicability of jiao moan method low s bimodal method low 2014 method han ma method dnv method and huang moan method for the combination of a wide band component and a narrowband component or the combination of a wide band component and a wide band component rectangular bimodal spectra will be adopted for numerical simulations in four different bandwidth combination cases simulated results will be taken as a reference furthermore some general wide band spectral methods such as dirlik method single moment method benasciutti tovo method and park method will also be compared finally three cases concerning real stress spectra in ship and ocean engineering are performed 2 background characterization of fatigue analysis 2 1 basic fatigue analysis the fatigue analysis is commonly conducted by using the s n curve 1 n k s m where s represents the stress amplitude n is the number of cycles to fatigue failure in constant stress amplitude s and k and m are the fatigue strength coefficient and fatigue strength exponent respectively in general a linear accumulation hypothesis by palmgren and miner 1945 is used the total fatigue damage can then be calculated as 2 d n i n i 1 k n i s i m where n i is the number of cycles in the stress amplitude s i resulting from rainflow counting for a stochastic stress process lutes and corazao 1984 n i is the number of cycles corresponding to fatigue failure at the same stress amplitude s i when the stress amplitude is a continuum function and its probability density function pdf is f s s the fatigue damage in the duration t can be denoted as follows 3 d ν c t k 0 s m f s s d s where ν c is the frequency of rainflow cycles for an ideal narrowband process f s s can be approximately by the rayleigh distribution bendat and piersol 2000 the analytical expression is given as 4 f s s s σ 0 2 exp s 2 2 σ 0 2 where σ 0 is the standard deviations of the stress process furthermore the frequency of rainflow cycles ν c can be replaced by rate of mean zero up crossing ν 0 according to eq 3 an analytical solution of fatigue damage bendat 1964 for an ideal narrowband process can be written as 5 d n b ν 0 t k 2 λ 0 m γ m 2 1 where γ is the gamma function for general wide band stress process fatigue damage can be calculated by a narrowband approximation i e eq 5 first and bandwidth correction is made based on the following model wirsching and light 1980 6 d w b ρ d n b ρ is a damage correction factor it is reported that ρ falls in the range of 0 1 rychlik 1993 in general bimodal process is a wide band process thus the fatigue damage in bimodal process can be calculated through eq 6 2 2 combination of two random gaussian processes assuming a stress process x t is composed of a lf process x l t and a hf process x h t 7 x t x l t x h t where x l t and x h t are independent but not have bandwidth limitation the psd of x t can be derived from the summation of the psd of lf and hf process 8 s ω s l ω s h ω the i th order spectral moments of s ω are defined as 9 λ i 0 ω i s l ω s h ω d ω λ i l λ i h bandwidth is an important parameter that characterizes a random process a group of bandwidth parameters is defined as follows 10 α i λ i λ 0 λ 2 i the most commonly used bandwidth parameters are given as 11 α 1 λ 1 λ 0 λ 2 α 2 λ 2 λ 0 λ 4 where α 2 is the irregular factor and the range of the bandwidth parameters is 0 α 1 1 0 α 2 1 in eq 10 i can also take a non integral value park and choung 2014 park and song 2015 lutes and corazao 1984 for example α 0 75 α 0 97 and α 1 97 are used in the literature park and choung 2014 park and song 2015 two spectral parameters relating to α 1 and α 2 are defined as follows wirsching and light 1980 vanmarcke 1972 12 δ 1 α 1 2 1 λ 1 2 λ 0 λ 2 ε 1 α 2 2 1 λ 2 2 λ 0 λ 4 where δ is vanmarcke s spectral parameter with 0 δ 1 and ε is wirsching s spectral width parameter with 0 ε 1 the rate of mean zero up crossing corresponding to x l t and x h t are 13 ν 0 l 1 2 π λ 2 l λ 0 l ν 0 h 1 2 π λ 2 h λ 0 h the rate of mean zero up crossing of x t can then be expressed as 14 ν 0 1 2 π λ 2 l λ 2 h λ 0 l λ 0 h ν 0 l 2 λ 0 l ν 0 h 2 λ 0 h λ 0 l λ 0 h according to eqs 5 9 and 14 fatigue damage of combined stress process x t based on narrowband approximation can be given as 15 d n b ν 0 l 2 λ 0 l ν 0 h 2 λ 0 h λ 0 l λ 0 h t k 2 λ 0 l 2 λ 0 h m γ m 2 1 eq 15 is known as the combined spectrum method in offshore rules dnv 2004 api 2005 iso 2005 dnv 2012a b the combination process x t is generally a wide band and bimodal process fatigue damage can thus be calculated with two methods one method is the combined spectrum method with dual narrowband correction factor jiao and moan 1990 low 2010 2014 the other is the general wide band spectral methods dirlik 1985 lutes and larsen 1990 benasciutti and tovo 2005 park and song 2015 in addition two stress responses are computed separately in some cases the combination of fatigue damage method and the combined spectrum method with dual narrowband correction factor are a good choice for predicting the total fatigue damage jiao and moan 1990 low 2010 low 2014 lotsberg 2005 dnv 2012a b huang and moan 2006 han and ma 2016 3 fatigue damage model 3 1 spectral methods based on the dual narrowband assumption 3 1 1 jiao moan jm method jiao and moan derived a bandwidth correction factor to diminish the conservatism of the combined spectrum method for combination of two narrow banded gaussian high and low frequency processes with well separated spectra jiao and moan 1990 the expression of this factor is given in eq 16 16 ρ j m ν 0 p ν 0 λ 0 l m 2 2 1 λ 0 h λ 0 l π λ 0 l λ 0 h m γ m 2 1 2 γ m 2 1 ν 0 h ν 0 λ 0 h m 2 where λ 0 l and λ 0 h are normalized zero order spectral moments and ν 0 p is defined in eq 17 17 ν 0 p λ 0 l ν 0 l 1 λ 0 h λ 0 l ν 0 h ν 0 l 2 δ h where 18 δ h 1 λ 1 h 2 λ 0 h λ 2 h 3 1 2 low s bimodal lb method lb model was proposed based on that rainflow count extracts two types of cycles large cycles and small cycles consequently the total fatigue damage can be summed from the two contributions low 2010 19 d l b d s d l in which d s and d l are related to the small and large cycles respectively the fatigue damage due to the small cycles is formulated as 20 d s 2 m ν 0 h ν 0 l t k 0 π 4 β π 2 ε r l θ r h ε r l θ m f r h r h f θ θ f r l r l d r h d θ d r l where 21 ε r l θ π 2 β r l sin θ 22 f θ θ π 2 π 4 β 1 π 4 β θ π 2 r h represents stress amplitudes of the small cycles and hf cycles r l is stress amplitudes of the large cycles and lf cycles β describes the ratio of high and low average zero up crossing frequencies detailed parameter can be seen in the literature low 2010 the functions f r h r h and f r l r l are the rayleigh distributions of the lf and hf components respectively detailed formula can be seen in eq 4 the fatigue damage due to the large cycles can be expressed as 23 d l 2 m ν 0 l t k 0 0 0 π r l r l r h ψ m f ψ ψ f r h r h f r l r l d ψ d r h d r l where 24 f ψ ψ 1 π 0 ψ π 25 r l r l cos ψ β r h eq 20 and eq 23 must be calculated with numerical integral and the innermost integral can be obtained accord to low s derivation low 2010 3 1 3 low 2014 method low developed an expression of a bandwidth correction factor for evaluating the fatigue damage with bimodal spectra based on extensive numerical simulations the bandwidth correction factor is low 2014 26 ρ l o w 2014 l 1 λ h r 2 λ h where 27 l b 1 λ h b 2 λ h b 1 b 2 λ h 3 2 λ h m 2 r 1 1 28 b 1 1 111 0 7421 m 0 0724 m 2 r

by considering the combination of two equivalent damage constant amplitude stress histories lotsberg developed a simple explicit formula which is widely used in dnv rules for evaluating the combined fatigue damage subjected to high and low frequency loads lotsberg 2005 dnv 2012a b this formula is given in eq 30 30 d d n v d h 1 ν 0 l ν 0 h ν 0 l d h ν 0 h 1 m d l ν 0 l 1 m m where d l calculated fatigue damage for the lf response d l calculated fatigue damage for the hf response ν 0 l rate of mean zero up crossing for the lf response ν 0 h rate of mean zero up crossing for the hf response 3 2 2 huang moan method similarly to the form of dnv formula huang and moan derived a practical formula i e eq 31 for estimating the combined damage huang and moan 2006 31 d h u a n g d l ν 0 l 2 m d h ν

ma hm method for two independent narrowband gaussian processes by assuming that the combined response can be approximately the sum of two sine waves han and ma derived a simple and accurate formula for combination of fatigue damage subjected to subjected to lf and hf gaussian random processes han and ma 2016 as shown in eq 32 32 d h m d n b l 2 m d n b h 2 m m 2 where 33 d n b l ν 0 l t k 2 λ 0

spectral moment and the mean zero crossing frequency as well as parameter m which is similar with dual narrowband methods 3 3 general methods for a wide band random process 3 3 1 dirlik dk method dirlik method is a semi empirical formula for approximately charactering the pdf of rainflow amplitude which is currently considered as a quite accurate approach dirlik 1985 this formula is composed of an exponential distribution a rayleigh distribution and a standard rayleigh distribution as given in eq 37 37 p d i r l i k s 1 λ 0 1 2 g 1 q exp z q g 2 z γ 2 exp z 2 2 γ 2 g 3 z exp z 2 2 where 38 z s λ 0 is a standardized amplitude and 39 x m α 1 α 2 q 1 25 α 2 g 3 g 2 γ g 1 γ α 2 x m g 1 2 1 α 2 g 1 g 1 2 40 g 1 2 x m α 2 2 1 α 2 2 g 2 1 α 2 g 1 g 1 2 1 γ g 3 1 g 1 g 2 six variables x m g 1 g 2 g 3 γ q are functions of α 1 and α 2 which consist of λ 0 λ 1 λ 2 and λ 4 therefore the rainflow amplitude pdf only depend on just four moments fatigue damage based on dirlik model can be given in a closed form form of eq 41 41 d d i r l i k ν p t k λ 0 m 2 d 1 q m 1 π γ m 1 2 d 2 γ m γ 1 m 2 d 3 γ 1 m 2 3 3 2 single moment sm method the sm method is formulated on the basis of observation in extensive simulated data and rainflow analysis for bimodal psd lutes and larsen 1990 the formula is 42 d s m 2 m 2 t 2 π k γ m 2 1 λ 2 m m 2 the sm method improves the rayleigh approximation to some extent more importantly applying the sm method only involves calculating one spectral moment λ 2 m 3 3 3 benasciutti and tovo bt method bt model is put forward based on this idea for a stationary gaussian process the rainflow fatigue damage always has a lower and upper bound as given in the following relation 43 d r c d r f c d n b d r f c can thus be expressed as a weighted linear combination 44 d r f c b d n b 1 b d r c where d n b is the upper bound damage coinciding with the damage obtained from the famous narrow band approximation d r c is the lower bound damage from the range counting astm 2005 which has no exact analytical expression thus an approximation is adopted benasciutti and tovo 2005 45 d r c ν 0 α 2 t k 2 λ 0 m α 2 m γ 1 m 2 α 2 m 1 d n b eq 44 reduces to 46 d r f c b 1 b

generalization of dual narrowband methods derivation of jm method jiao and moan 1990 lb method low 2010 low 2014 method low 2014 hm method han and ma 2016 was based on an assumption that two gaussian loads are well separated narrowband processes the accuracy of four methods was validated in bimodal spectra which is modeled as two rectangular blocks the bandwidth of each block is restricted to a small scale as shown in table 1 ensuring that the narrowband condition is essentially satisfied for each of the component processes the bandwidth of each block only depends on parameter c the definition of c is similar to eqs 60 and 61 jm method has been applied in many offshore codes for evaluating lf and hf induced fatigue damage without considering a bandwidth limitation and furthermore this treatment does not consider whether lf process and hf process have the overlapped frequencies according to jiao moan s formula the bandwidth correction factor can be expressed as a function of the mean zero up crossing frequencies and the zero order spectral moments of the lf and hf components as well as the bandwidth parameter δ h and m as given in eq 54 54 ρ j m f λ 0 l λ 0 h ν 0 l ν 0 h δ h m it is always possible to extract the individual mean zero up crossing frequency ν 0 l ν 0 h and the zero order spectral moment λ 0 l λ 0 h no matter the lf and hf response are wide band or narrowband processes δ h represents the bandwidth parameter of the hf component in mooring or riser systems the hf component corresponds to wf response which is a wide band process according to some offshore codes δ h is set equal to 0 1 dnv rp f201 2010b dnv os e301 2004 api rp 2sk 2005 iso 19901 7 2005 dnv rp c206 2012 for wf and hf response from large container ships hf response is a narrowband process at this moment δ h is taken as equal to the actual bandwidth of hf component andersen and jensen 2013 the total damage can be obtained by using the result of the combined spectrum method and multiplying it by a bandwidth correction factor dnv os e301 2004 api rp 2sk 2005 iso 19901 7 2005 dnv rp c203 2012 similarly to jm method the bandwidth correction factor of lb method and low 2014 method can also be expressed as a function of λ 0 l λ 0 h ν 0 l ν 0 w and m as shown in eqs 55 and 56 55 ρ l b f λ 0 l λ 0 h ν 0 l ν 0 h m 56 ρ l o w 2014 f λ 0 l λ 0 h ν 0 l ν 0 h m as long as λ 0 l λ 0 h ν 0 l ν 0 w and m are given lb method and low 2014 method can be used to predict the combined fatigue damage due to two gaussian random processes therefore jm method lb method and low 2014 method can also estimate fatigue damage for combination of a time domain process and a frequency domain process 4 2 generalization of combination for fatigue damage method for dnv method huang moan method hm method the formula of combination for fatigue damage is mainly based on the information about individual damage and rate of mean zero up crossing 57 d d n v f d l d h ν 0 l ν 0 h m 58 d

narrowband and wide band processes or the combination of two wide band gaussian processes the narrowband approximation should be used i e d l and d h can be calculated through eq 33 and eq 34 5 numerical simulations based on ideal rectangular spectra in order to obtain a reference of fatigue damage time domain simulations with the rfc methods should be carried out based on separated and overlapped rectangular bimodal spectra different fatigue damage models will be compared with the time domain rainflow damage in rectangular bimodal spectra rfc fatigue damage is calculated through numerical technique proposed in the literature han and ma 2016 5 1 bimodal spectra 5 1 1 separated rectangular bimodal spectra separated rectangular bimodal spectra is adopted as defined by han and ma 2016 the schematic view of a separated rectangular bimodal spectrum is shown in fig 1 four variables for characterizing bimodal spectra are give in eqs 60 63 60 c 1 ω b ω a c 1 1 61 c 2 ω d ω c c 2 1 62 b a 2 a 1 63 r ν 0 2 ν 0 1 1 c 2 c 2 2 1 c 1 c 1 2 ω c ω a in which a 1 and a 2 are the areas of block 1 and block 2 it is assumed a 1 a 2 1 for all simulated bimodal spectra ν 0 1 and ν 0 2 are the individual rate of mean zero up crossing corresponding to spectral block 1 and 2 in addition to ensure that block 1 and block 2 are separated a limited condition should be met 64 r c 1 1 c 2 c 2 2 1 c 1 c 1 2 5 1 2 overlapped rectangular bimodal spectra overlapped rectangular bimodal spectra can be produced by adjusting the variable r of separated rectangular bimodal spectra the schematic view of an overlapped rectangular bimodal spectrum is shown in fig 2 all variables are defined as eq 60 63 to ensure that block 1 and block 2 are overlapped a limited condition should be met 65 1 r c 1 1 c 2 c 2 2 1 c 1 c 1 2 5 1 3 parameters of numerical simulations in practice the lf and hf processes are not always a narrow band process thus numerical simulations are divided into 15 combinations a lf narrow banded and a hf wide band component a lf wide band and a hf narrow banded component a lf wide band and a hf wide band component a lf moderate wide band and a hf moderate wide band component some parameters corresponding to 15 combinations are set as shown in table 2 5 1 4 bandwidth range of bimodal spectra the bandwidth of combined bimodal spectra can be expressed as 66 α 2 c λ 2 c λ 0 c λ 4 c α 2 2 m 1 b r 2 1 b 1 b r 4 m 2 where 67 m r r r ν p 2 ν p 1 where ν p 1 and ν p 2 is the peak frequency of two processes the combined bandwidth ε c exists a lower bound value and a upper bound value for separated bimodal rectangular spectra the lower bound value of ε c is 1 max α 2 1 α 2 2 2 the upper bound value of ε c is unity for overlapped bimodal rectangular spectra the lower bound value of ε c is also 1 max α 2 1 α 2 2 2 the upper bound value of ε c is 68 ε c 1 α 2 2 2 4 t 2 m 2 t 2 1 t 2 m 2 1 t 4 m 2 1 2 where t c 1 1 c 2 c 2 2 1 c 1 c 1 2 c 1 and c 2 determine the bandwidth parameter of each component the derivation of the lower bound value and the upper bound value can be seen in appendix a for two gaussian random process which is analyzed separately the total bandwidth range can be estimated conveniently 5 2 comparison of fatigue damage method based on separated rectangular bimodal spectra for each figure in this section wirsching spectral width parameter is used for the abscissa wirsching and light 1980 fatigue damage ratio between fatigue damage models and rfc is used for the ordinate the best fatigue damage model has the ratio are close to unity 5 2 1 comparison of dual narrowband fatigue damage methods the results of dual narrowband fatigue damage methods are displayed in fig 3 because of a limiting volume of this paper only four combination cases are shown in this part the rest combination cases can be seen in appendix b jm method provides reasonably good fatigue predictions with a maximum overestimation of about 35 for m 3 in the combination case of c 1 10 c 2 1 5 for m 5 it underestimates the total fatigue damage in most cases with a maximum negative error of about 22 in the combination case of c 1 1 5 c 2 10 lb method gives quite good fatigue damage estimations with an error ranging from 10 to 10 for m 3 in four combination cases for m 5 the damage is underestimated by as much as negative 30 when the spectral bandwidth parameter is approximately equal to 0 9 in the combination case of c 1 1 5 c 2 10 low 2014 method can also give quite accurate damage results fatigue damage errors range from 10 to 10 for m 3 in four combination cases for m 5 the fatigue damage is underestimated by as much as negative 24 in the combination case of c 1 10 c 2 1 5 hm method can also predict the fatigue damage quite accurately and the results are very close to that of lb method for m 3 for m 5 hm method provides improved fatigue damage than lb method when the spectral bandwidth parameter is less than 0 8 overall lb method low 2014 method and hm method have been shown to be in quite good agreement with simulation data for all the psd studied the accuracy of jm is slightly lower than that of lb method low 2014 method and hm method 5 2 2 combination for fatigue damage methods the results of combination of fatigue damage methods are shown in fig 4 as expected dnv method always overestimates the fatigue damage for all considered combinations cases herein the maximum error reaches about 250 in the combination of c 1 10 c 2 1 5 and c 1 2 5 c 2 2 5 for m 5 huang moan method is good with a maximum error of negative 15 when the total bandwidth parameters is less than 0 7 in other cases it exhibits more scatter and the maximum negative error exceeds 50 compared with the above two methods hm method gives quite accurate fatigue damage estimations 5 2 3 general wide band methods the results of general wide band fatigue damage methods are shown in fig 5 lb method low 2014 method and hm method have been proven to give accurate fatigue damage estimation therefore these two methods will be compared with general wide band fatigue damage methods sm method always underestimates the fatigue damage besides the errors become large as the spectral width parameter ε increases but the errors never exceed negative 17 for m 3 in all combination cases for m 5 the maximum error reaches about negative 35 in the combination case of c 1 1 5 c 2 10 and c 1 10 c 2 10 as famous general wide band methods bt method provides very accurate damage estimation the errors are always lower than 10 in most cases the worst case occurs in the combination case of c 1 1 5 c 2 10 and c 1 2 5 c 2 2 5 for m 5 with a maximum error of about negative 22 dk method gives good damage results when the bandwidth is lower than 0 8 when the bandwidth is larger than 0 8 it always underestimates fatigue damage with a maximum of about 30 in the combination case of c 1 1 5 c 2 10 and c 1 10 c 2 1 5 and c 1 2 5 c 2 2 5 for m 5 park method improves the accuracy of dk method to some extent the errors range from 7 to 8 for m 3 for m 5 it underestimates the fatigue damage by as much as 20 in the worst case compared with the general spectral methods lb method low 2014 method and hm method give conservative damage predictions when the bandwidth is lower than 0 8 when the bandwidth exceeds 0 8 the errors from lb method low 2014 method and hm method are very close to that from bt method in addition fatigue damage is insensitive to the geometric shapes of stress psd han and ma 2017 sarkani 1990 wang and chen 2016 thus it is reasonable to carry out numerical simulations by adopting rectangular bimodal spectra 5 3 comparison of fatigue damage models based on overlapped bimodal spectra the results of general wide band fatigue damage methods in overlapped rectangular bimodal spectra are shown in fig 6 as expected bt method dk method and park method in overlapped rectangular bimodal spectra give very accurate estimates the errors never exceed 20 in all combination cases hm method also provides very accurate fatigue damage predictions when the bandwidth is lower than 0 8 hm method always gives conservative results with a maximum error of less than 20 when the bandwidth is larger than 0 8 it slightly underestimates the fatigue damage lb method can also give good damage results in most cases however in some cases it may give some incorrect damage predictions e g in the combination of c 1 10 c 2 1 5 and in the combination of c 1 2 5 c 2 2 5 for lower value of r the fatigue damage ratio obtained from lb method is far less than 1 therefore when one can determine the frequency of bimodal spectrum is overlapped it is not recommended to use lb method to estimate fatigue damage low 2014 method predicts very accurate damage results for the cases studied in this paper for the combination of c 1 1 5 c 2 10 and the fatigue damage error never exceeds 10 for the combination of c 1 10 c 2 1 5 and the combination of c 1 2 5 c 2 2 5 the maximum error is about 15 for the combination of c 1 10 c 2 10 the maximum error reaches about 20 in addition according to the derivation in section 5 1 4 for the combination of c 1 10 c 2 1 5 the combined spectral width parameter ε c ranges from 0 22 to 0 69 for the combination of c 1 2 5 c 2 2 5 the combined spectral width parameter ε c ranges from 0 42 to 0 78 in these two cases the simulated combined spectral width parameter is lower thus bt method dk method park method lb method low 2014 method and hm method provide the best fatigue damage predictions 6 case study it has been proven that jm method lb method low 2014 method and hm method perform very well for predicting the combined fatigue damage in ideal rectangular bimodal spectra however it is still essential to validate the application of the above four methods in real environmental loading therefore some more realistic stress response spectra will be used they include spectra of spring whipping induced response for some larger container ships spectra produced by the wf response and the lf response for mooring and risers spectra of wave and wind response for offshore wind turbine support structures 6 1 case 1 fig 7 shows the real measured stress spectrum for the fotini l in ballast condition the spectrum was obtained using a fast fourier transform analyzer of a digitized record of 20 min length stiansen and mansour 1975 it is obvious that the stress spectrum is characterized by two distinct peaks one occurs at a frequency of about 0 75 rad s corresponding to wf and the other occurs at the 2 node mode frequency of the ship 4 58 rad s this real stress bimodal spectrum can be the sum of a low frequency and high frequency component when considering that the frequency is cut off in 3 14 rad s therefore the bandwidth parameters associated with two components can be calculated as ε l 0 4861 ε h 0 1441 the bandwidth correction factor as computed from different methods including jm method lb method low 2014 method hm method sm method bt method dk method park method are compared with the time domain rainflow counting results the errors are shown in table 3 for m 3 all comparative methods provides quite accuracy fatigue damage estimations the minimum error is about 0 18 by dirlik method the maximum error is about 8 25 given by lb method for m 5 the precision of all comparative methods decreases for example the error of lb method reaches 13 17 6 2 case 2 fig 8 plots a stress response spectrum defined by olagnon and guédé 2008 this spectrum is composed of a swell response which is modeled with a triangular spectrum and a wind sea response which is modeled with a jonswap two bandwidth parameters is ε l 0 1672 ε h 0 5695 the bandwidth correction factor and error results from jm method lb method low 2014 method hm method sm method bt method dk method park method are given in table 4 in this case good agreement between all comparative methods and rfc can be observed and the worst error never exceeds 10 for m 3 and m 5 6 3 case 3 fig 9 displays a stress spectrum which is calculated from k joints in jacket offshore wind turbine support structure qin and ma 2017 this spectrum is introduced by wave response and wind response which have some overlapped frequencies two bandwidth parameters corresponding to wave and wind are ε w a v e 0 5182 ε w i n d 0 9287 in this case two random processes are both broad especially for the wind response the bandwidth parameter reaches 0 9287 which is a quite wide process the results are displayed in table 5 only bt method dk method and park method give accurate fatigue damage estimations with a maximum error of 6 89 corresponding to park method for sm method the damage may be under estimated by as much as about 11 81 for m 3 and 20 11 for m 5 jm method lb method low 2014 method and hm method always provide positive errors which indicates they are conservative and safe for design 7 conclusion this paper studies the applicability of jm method lb method low 2014 method and hm method when considering the combination of a wide band component and a narrowband component or the combination of a wide band component and a wide band component as well as the combination of two overlapped frequency gaussian components rectangular bimodal spectra is constructed to validated the accuracy of the four methods some methods for combination of fatigue damage and some general spectral methods for wide band processes are compared finally three real cases in marine structures are studied to calculated the combined fatigue damage some interesting conclusions are as follows 1 jm method lb method low 2014 method and hm method provide very accurate fatigue damage estimations when two gaussian processes are separated the latter three methods exhibit more precise fatigue damage results than jm method 2 fatigue predictions from lb method low 2014 method and hm method are very close to that from some famous general wide band spectral method such as bt method and dk method 3 when two gaussian processes have overlapped frequencies hm method and low 2014 method can still provide accurate damage assessment 4 in overlapped bimodal spectra lb method may give non reasonable results in a few cases r 1 4 r 1 5 r 1 6 thus it is not recommended to use lb method for fatigue calculation when the frequencies of two random processes are too close 5 dnv method and huang moan method can give good fatigue damage results only when the total bandwidth parameters is less than 0 7 acknowledgement this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51409068 this work was also supported by china postdoctoral science foundation grant no 2015m571396 appendix a for separated bimodal rectangular spectra when keeping the parameter b fixed the bandwidth α 2 c decreases as r increases in the limit r c 1 1 c 2 c 2 2 1 c 1 c 1 2 α 2 c α 2 1 b 0 α 2 2 b therefore the maximum α 2 c can be obtained as α 2 m a x max α 2 1 α 2 2 in the limit r α 2 c α 2 2 b 1 b 0 b 0 α 2 2 b therefore the maximin α 2 c can be obtained as α 2 m i n 0 thus the bandwidth ε c of separated bimodal spectra

23145,fatigue assessment is a critical issue for marine structures which usually encounter a combination load of a low frequency and a high frequency component furthermore two components are commonly analyzed separately in a strict sense each of two components cannot be considered as narrowband processes recently the authors proposed a combination of fatigue damage method han ma method for predicting fatigue damage on the assumption of two well separated and narrowband gaussian components the method is extended to non narrowband and frequency overlapped cases in this paper in addition the application of existing combined spectrum method with dual narrow banded correction factor such as jiao moan method low s bimodal method low 2014 method and combination of fatigue damage method such as dnv method huang moan method is also investigated these methods are also compared with some general wide band spectral methods such as dirlik method single moment method benasciutti tovo method and park method the results show that jiao moan method low s bimodal method low 2014 method and han ma method can still provide very accurate fatigue damage estimation when two gaussian processes are separately non narrowband and have overlapped frequencies in particular the accuracy of low 2014 method and han ma method is very close to that from some general spectral methods in the case that two gaussian components have overlapped frequencies keywords combination of fatigue damage gaussian random process bimodal spectra rainflow counting 1 introduction fatigue is a main mode of failure in marine engineering most marine structures commonly experience complex environmental loads an example of such a situation is a wave frequency wf component due to the first order wave forces and a low frequency lf component excited by the second order wave forces for some deepwater mooring lines and risers dnv rp f204 2010b dnv os e301 2004 low 2011 another example may be stress response for large container ships which consists of a wf and a high frequency hf component hf component is generally produced by whipping springing andersen and jensen 2013 nielsen and jensen 2011 mao and rychlik 2012 in addition wind and wave loads are the main loads for offshore wind turbine support structures yeter et al 2016 in such situations the combination of two loads will greatly reduce the fatigue life of structures since it increases stress range more than that of the individual process park and choung 2014 therefore fatigue assessment under two gaussian loads needs more attention in engineering design during the past decade many techniques have been developed to perform a reliable fatigue damage estimation subjected to combined effect of two random loadings in general these evaluation techniques can be categorized into four dnv 2010a dnv 2004 low 2011 api 2005 iso 2005 fully coupled time domain analysis with rainflow counting rfc astm 2005 general wide band spectral method combined spectrum method with dual narrow banded correction factor combination of fatigue damage method the dynamic analysis of structures under two gaussian random loads is complex since it includes the effect of dynamic coupling and a various of non linearities low and langley 2008 thus a fully coupled time domain analysis is generally employed to obtain accurate stress time series consequently fatigue damage can be predicted with rainflow counting astm 2005 this approach is considered to be the most accurate and usually used in the detailed design stage or as a benchmark during the verification of other approaches abs 2003 li and ringsberg 2013 in contrast with the above frequency domain method becomes popular which is very practical and time saving the power spectral density function psd of stress can be established by a linear spectral analysis dnv rp f204 2010b abs 2012 in marine structures the psd of stress is not strictly narrow banded therefore general wide band spectral fatigue methods such as dirlik method dirlik 1985 single moment method lutes and larsen 1990 benasciutti tovo method benasciutti and tovo 2005 and park method park and choung 2014 park and song 2015 have been proposed for precise damage predictions for marine structures subjected to two gaussian random loads fully coupled time domain analysis method and frequency domain method exist some shortcomings the former will take high computational effort and the latter is only suitable for predicting wave induced fatigue damage due to the limitations of spectral analysis methods abs 2012 in the early stage of the design process it is convenient to calculate the individual dynamic response from two gaussian random processes separately low 2011 for example the lf response of mooring and risers can be simulated either in time domain or in frequency domain the wind response of offshore wind turbine is commonly calculated in time domain while the wf response is analyzed in frequency domain using a linear spectral analysis temple 2006 for the above situation the total fatigue damage can be estimated with combined spectrum method with dual narrow banded correction factor or combination of fatigue damage method dnv os e301 2004 api rp 2sk 2005 iso 19901 7 2005 dnv rp c203 2012 the combined spectrum method with dual narrow banded correction factor takes the result of the combined spectrum approach and multiplies it by a bandwidth correction factor which only need the mean zero up crossing frequency and the zero order spectral moment of two random processes as inputs dnv os e301 2004 api rp 2sk 2005 iso 19901 7 2005 dnv rp c203 2012 these input parameters can be extracted conveniently from a stress time series or a stress psd various dual narrow banded correction factor can be computed by jiao moan method jiao and moan 1990 sakai okamura method sakai and okamura 1995 fu cebon method fu and cebon 2000 low s bimodal method low 2010 and low 2014 method low 2014 jiao moan method low s bimodal method low 2014 method and han ma method have been verified to perform well in the combination of two narrowband and well separated gaussian components han and ma 2016 moreover jiao moan method has been widely used in many rules for estimating the combined fatigue damage due to wf and lf response dnv os e301 2004 api rp 2sk 2005 iso 19901 7 2005 dnv rp c203 2012 low s bimodal method has also been applied to calculate the fatigue damage produced by whipping springing andersen and jensen 2013 considering separation of two gaussian processes there are also some practical models for combination of fatigue damages damages from two dynamic processes are calculated independently and then are superposed this treatment takes only the individual damages and mean zero up crossing frequency as input lotsberg derived a simple explicit formula which has been applied in dnv s rule for evaluating the combined fatigue damage due to two random loads lotsberg 2005 dnv 2012a b however it has been proven that dnv formula gives too conservative damage results huang and moan 2006 to reduce the conservation of fatigue damage huang and moan proposed a formula similar with dnv formula which is expressed as an explicit function of individual damages and mean zero up crossing frequency huang and moan 2006 but this formula gives good predictions only in a small bandwidth range recently han and ma have developed a practical formula which is simple and provides accurate fatigue damage estimations han and ma 2016 in addition for combination of a stress time series and a stress response spectra the above methods can still predict the combined fatigue damage however in practice two individual components may not be narrowband and well separated in a strict sense for example the wind response of an offshore wind turbine support structure is generally wide band kuhn 2003 the wave response in marine structures may also be wide band the corresponding spectral width parameter may exceed 0 5 in some cases hu and li 2010 which should be not addressed as a narrowband process furthermore full scale measurements for some container ships have shown that the wf response and hf response induced by springing cannot generally be considered narrow banded andersen and jensen 2013 therefore the combination process becomes a combination of a wide band and a narrowband components or a combination of a wide band and a wide band components in addition if two stress responses are a time series and a psd respectively one cannot distinguish whether they are well separated i e two stress responses may have overlapped frequencies qin and ma 2017 considering these situations more work is needed to validate whether jiao moan method low s bimodal method low 2014 method and han ma method are suitable this paper investigates the applicability of jiao moan method low s bimodal method low 2014 method han ma method dnv method and huang moan method for the combination of a wide band component and a narrowband component or the combination of a wide band component and a wide band component rectangular bimodal spectra will be adopted for numerical simulations in four different bandwidth combination cases simulated results will be taken as a reference furthermore some general wide band spectral methods such as dirlik method single moment method benasciutti tovo method and park method will also be compared finally three cases concerning real stress spectra in ship and ocean engineering are performed 2 background characterization of fatigue analysis 2 1 basic fatigue analysis the fatigue analysis is commonly conducted by using the s n curve 1 n k s m where s represents the stress amplitude n is the number of cycles to fatigue failure in constant stress amplitude s and k and m are the fatigue strength coefficient and fatigue strength exponent respectively in general a linear accumulation hypothesis by palmgren and miner 1945 is used the total fatigue damage can then be calculated as 2 d n i n i 1 k n i s i m where n i is the number of cycles in the stress amplitude s i resulting from rainflow counting for a stochastic stress process lutes and corazao 1984 n i is the number of cycles corresponding to fatigue failure at the same stress amplitude s i when the stress amplitude is a continuum function and its probability density function pdf is f s s the fatigue damage in the duration t can be denoted as follows 3 d ν c t k 0 s m f s s d s where ν c is the frequency of rainflow cycles for an ideal narrowband process f s s can be approximately by the rayleigh distribution bendat and piersol 2000 the analytical expression is given as 4 f s s s σ 0 2 exp s 2 2 σ 0 2 where σ 0 is the standard deviations of the stress process furthermore the frequency of rainflow cycles ν c can be replaced by rate of mean zero up crossing ν 0 according to eq 3 an analytical solution of fatigue damage bendat 1964 for an ideal narrowband process can be written as 5 d n b ν 0 t k 2 λ 0 m γ m 2 1 where γ is the gamma function for general wide band stress process fatigue damage can be calculated by a narrowband approximation i e eq 5 first and bandwidth correction is made based on the following model wirsching and light 1980 6 d w b ρ d n b ρ is a damage correction factor it is reported that ρ falls in the range of 0 1 rychlik 1993 in general bimodal process is a wide band process thus the fatigue damage in bimodal process can be calculated through eq 6 2 2 combination of two random gaussian processes assuming a stress process x t is composed of a lf process x l t and a hf process x h t 7 x t x l t x h t where x l t and x h t are independent but not have bandwidth limitation the psd of x t can be derived from the summation of the psd of lf and hf process 8 s ω s l ω s h ω the i th order spectral moments of s ω are defined as 9 λ i 0 ω i s l ω s h ω d ω λ i l λ i h bandwidth is an important parameter that characterizes a random process a group of bandwidth parameters is defined as follows 10 α i λ i λ 0 λ 2 i the most commonly used bandwidth parameters are given as 11 α 1 λ 1 λ 0 λ 2 α 2 λ 2 λ 0 λ 4 where α 2 is the irregular factor and the range of the bandwidth parameters is 0 α 1 1 0 α 2 1 in eq 10 i can also take a non integral value park and choung 2014 park and song 2015 lutes and corazao 1984 for example α 0 75 α 0 97 and α 1 97 are used in the literature park and choung 2014 park and song 2015 two spectral parameters relating to α 1 and α 2 are defined as follows wirsching and light 1980 vanmarcke 1972 12 δ 1 α 1 2 1 λ 1 2 λ 0 λ 2 ε 1 α 2 2 1 λ 2 2 λ 0 λ 4 where δ is vanmarcke s spectral parameter with 0 δ 1 and ε is wirsching s spectral width parameter with 0 ε 1 the rate of mean zero up crossing corresponding to x l t and x h t are 13 ν 0 l 1 2 π λ 2 l λ 0 l ν 0 h 1 2 π λ 2 h λ 0 h the rate of mean zero up crossing of x t can then be expressed as 14 ν 0 1 2 π λ 2 l λ 2 h λ 0 l λ 0 h ν 0 l 2 λ 0 l ν 0 h 2 λ 0 h λ 0 l λ 0 h according to eqs 5 9 and 14 fatigue damage of combined stress process x t based on narrowband approximation can be given as 15 d n b ν 0 l 2 λ 0 l ν 0 h 2 λ 0 h λ 0 l λ 0 h t k 2 λ 0 l 2 λ 0 h m γ m 2 1 eq 15 is known as the combined spectrum method in offshore rules dnv 2004 api 2005 iso 2005 dnv 2012a b the combination process x t is generally a wide band and bimodal process fatigue damage can thus be calculated with two methods one method is the combined spectrum method with dual narrowband correction factor jiao and moan 1990 low 2010 2014 the other is the general wide band spectral methods dirlik 1985 lutes and larsen 1990 benasciutti and tovo 2005 park and song 2015 in addition two stress responses are computed separately in some cases the combination of fatigue damage method and the combined spectrum method with dual narrowband correction factor are a good choice for predicting the total fatigue damage jiao and moan 1990 low 2010 low 2014 lotsberg 2005 dnv 2012a b huang and moan 2006 han and ma 2016 3 fatigue damage model 3 1 spectral methods based on the dual narrowband assumption 3 1 1 jiao moan jm method jiao and moan derived a bandwidth correction factor to diminish the conservatism of the combined spectrum method for combination of two narrow banded gaussian high and low frequency processes with well separated spectra jiao and moan 1990 the expression of this factor is given in eq 16 16 ρ j m ν 0 p ν 0 λ 0 l m 2 2 1 λ 0 h λ 0 l π λ 0 l λ 0 h m γ m 2 1 2 γ m 2 1 ν 0 h ν 0 λ 0 h m 2 where λ 0 l and λ 0 h are

proposed based on that rainflow count extracts two types of cycles large cycles and small cycles consequently the total fatigue damage can be summed from the two contributions low 2010 19 d l b d s d

by considering the combination of two equivalent damage constant amplitude stress histories lotsberg developed a simple explicit formula which is widely used in dnv rules for evaluating the combined fatigue damage subjected to high and low frequency loads lotsberg 2005 dnv 2012a b this formula is given in eq 30 30 d d n v d h 1 ν 0 l ν 0 h ν 0 l d h ν 0 h 1 m d l ν 0 l 1 m m where d l calculated fatigue damage for the lf response d l calculated fatigue damage for the hf response ν 0 l rate of mean zero up crossing for the lf response ν 0 h rate of mean zero up crossing for the hf response 3 2 2 huang moan method similarly to the form of dnv formula huang and moan derived a practical formula i e eq 31 for estimating the combined damage huang and moan 2006 31 d h u a n g d l ν 0 l 2 m d h ν

ma hm method for two independent narrowband gaussian processes by assuming that the combined response can be approximately the sum of two sine waves han and ma derived a simple and accurate formula for combination of fatigue damage subjected to subjected to lf and hf gaussian random processes han and ma 2016 as shown in eq 32 32 d h m d n b l 2 m d n b h 2 m m 2 where 33 d n b l ν 0 l t k 2 λ 0

dirlik method is a semi empirical formula for approximately charactering the pdf of rainflow amplitude which is currently considered as a quite accurate approach dirlik 1985 this formula is composed of an exponential distribution a rayleigh distribution and a standard rayleigh distribution as given in eq 37 37 p d i r l i k s 1 λ 0 1 2 g 1 q exp z q g 2 z γ 2 exp z 2 2 γ 2 g 3 z exp z 2 2 where 38 z s λ 0 is a standardized amplitude and 39 x m α 1 α 2 q 1 25 α 2 g 3 g 2 γ g 1 γ α 2 x m g 1 2 1 α 2 g 1 g 1 2 40 g 1 2 x m α 2 2 1 α 2 2 g 2 1 α 2 g 1 g 1 2 1 γ g 3 1 g 1 g 2 six variables x m g 1 g 2 g 3 γ q are functions of α 1 and α 2 which consist of λ 0 λ 1 λ 2 and λ 4 therefore the rainflow amplitude pdf only depend on just four moments fatigue damage based on dirlik model can be given

gaussian process the rainflow fatigue damage always has a lower and upper bound as given in the following relation 43 d r c d r f c d n b d r f c can thus be expressed as a weighted linear combination 44 d r f c b d n b 1 b d r c where d n b is the upper bound damage coinciding with the damage obtained from the famous narrow band approximation d r c is the lower bound damage from the range counting

generalization of dual narrowband methods derivation of jm method jiao and moan 1990 lb method low 2010 low 2014 method low 2014 hm method han and ma 2016 was based on an assumption that two gaussian loads are well separated narrowband processes the accuracy of four methods was validated in bimodal spectra which is modeled as two rectangular blocks the bandwidth of each block is restricted to a small scale as shown in table 1 ensuring that the narrowband condition is essentially satisfied for each of the component processes the bandwidth of each block only depends on parameter c the definition of c is similar to eqs 60 and 61 jm method has been applied in many offshore codes for evaluating lf and hf induced fatigue damage without considering a bandwidth limitation and furthermore this treatment does not consider whether lf process and hf process have the overlapped frequencies according to jiao moan s formula the bandwidth correction factor can be expressed as a function of the mean zero up crossing frequencies and the zero order spectral moments of the lf and hf components as well as the bandwidth parameter δ h and m as given in eq 54 54 ρ j m f λ 0 l λ 0 h ν 0 l ν 0 h δ h m it is always possible to extract the individual mean zero up crossing frequency ν 0 l ν 0 h and the zero order spectral moment λ 0 l λ 0 h no matter the lf and hf response are wide band or narrowband processes δ h represents the bandwidth parameter of the hf component in mooring or riser systems the hf component corresponds to wf response which is a wide band process according to some offshore codes δ h is set equal to 0 1 dnv rp f201 2010b dnv os e301 2004 api rp 2sk 2005 iso 19901 7 2005 dnv rp c206 2012 for wf and hf response from large container ships hf response is a narrowband process at this moment δ h is taken as equal to the actual bandwidth of hf component andersen and jensen 2013 the total damage can be obtained by using the result of the combined spectrum method and multiplying it by a bandwidth correction factor dnv os e301 2004 api rp 2sk 2005 iso 19901 7 2005 dnv rp c203 2012 similarly to jm method the bandwidth correction factor of lb method and low 2014 method can also be expressed as a function of λ 0 l λ 0 h ν 0 l ν 0 w and m as shown in eqs 55 and 56 55 ρ l b f λ 0 l λ 0 h ν 0 l ν 0 h m 56 ρ l o w 2014 f λ 0 l λ 0 h ν 0 l ν 0 h m as long as λ 0 l λ 0 h ν 0 l ν 0 w and m are given lb method and low 2014 method can be used to predict the combined fatigue damage due to two gaussian random processes therefore jm method lb method and low 2014 method can also estimate fatigue damage for combination of a time domain process and a frequency domain process 4 2 generalization of combination for fatigue damage method for dnv method huang moan method hm method the formula of combination for fatigue damage is mainly based on the information about individual damage and rate of mean zero up crossing 57 d d n v f d l d h ν 0 l ν 0 h m 58 d h u a n g f d l d h ν 0 l ν 0 h m 59 d h m f d l d h m the above three methods are proposed based on two independent narrowband gaussian process when they are extended for the combination of a narrowband and wide band processes or the combination of two wide band gaussian processes the narrowband approximation should be used i e d l and d h can be calculated through eq 33 and eq 34 5 numerical simulations based on ideal rectangular spectra in order to obtain a reference of fatigue damage time domain simulations with the rfc methods should be carried out based on separated and overlapped rectangular bimodal spectra different fatigue damage models will be compared with the time domain rainflow damage in rectangular bimodal spectra rfc fatigue damage is calculated through numerical technique proposed in the literature han and ma 2016 5 1 bimodal spectra 5 1 1 separated rectangular bimodal spectra separated rectangular bimodal spectra is adopted as defined by han and ma 2016 the schematic view of a separated rectangular bimodal spectrum is shown in fig 1 four variables for characterizing bimodal spectra are give in eqs 60 63 60 c 1 ω b ω a c 1 1 61 c 2 ω d ω c c 2 1 62 b a 2 a 1 63 r ν 0 2 ν 0 1 1 c 2 c 2 2 1 c 1 c 1 2 ω c ω a in which a 1 and a 2 are the areas of block 1 and block 2 it is assumed a 1 a 2 1 for all simulated bimodal spectra ν 0 1 and ν 0 2 are the individual rate of mean zero up crossing corresponding to spectral block 1 and 2 in addition to ensure that block 1 and block 2 are separated a limited condition should be met 64 r c 1 1 c 2 c 2 2 1 c 1 c 1 2 5 1 2 overlapped rectangular bimodal spectra overlapped rectangular bimodal spectra can be produced by adjusting the variable r of separated rectangular bimodal spectra the schematic view of an overlapped rectangular bimodal spectrum is shown in fig 2 all variables are defined as eq 60 63 to ensure that block 1 and block 2 are overlapped a limited condition should be met 65 1 r c 1 1 c 2 c 2 2 1 c 1 c 1 2 5 1 3 parameters of numerical simulations in practice the lf and hf processes are not always a narrow band process thus numerical simulations are divided into 15 combinations a lf narrow banded and a hf wide band component a lf wide band and a hf narrow banded component a lf wide band and a hf wide band component a lf moderate wide band and a hf moderate wide band component some parameters corresponding to 15 combinations are set as shown in table 2 5 1 4 bandwidth range of bimodal spectra the bandwidth of combined bimodal spectra can be expressed as 66 α 2 c λ 2 c λ 0 c λ 4 c α 2 2 m 1 b r 2 1 b 1 b r 4 m 2 where 67 m r r r ν p 2 ν p 1 where ν p 1 and ν p 2 is the peak frequency of two processes the combined bandwidth ε c exists a lower bound value and a upper bound value for separated bimodal rectangular spectra the lower bound value of ε c is 1 max α 2 1 α 2 2 2 the upper bound value of ε c is unity for overlapped bimodal rectangular spectra the lower bound value of ε c is also 1 max α 2 1 α 2 2 2 the upper bound value of ε c is 68 ε c 1 α 2 2 2 4 t 2 m 2 t 2 1 t 2 m 2 1 t 4 m 2 1 2 where t c 1 1 c 2 c 2 2 1 c 1 c 1 2 c 1 and c 2 determine the bandwidth parameter of each component the derivation of the lower bound value and the upper bound value can be seen in appendix a for two gaussian random process which is analyzed separately the total bandwidth range can be estimated conveniently 5 2 comparison of fatigue damage method based on separated rectangular bimodal spectra for each figure in this section wirsching spectral width parameter is used for the abscissa wirsching and light 1980 fatigue damage ratio between fatigue damage models and rfc is used for the ordinate the best fatigue damage model has the ratio are close to unity 5 2 1 comparison of dual narrowband fatigue damage methods the results of dual narrowband fatigue damage methods are displayed in fig 3 because of a limiting volume of this paper only four combination cases are shown in this part the rest combination cases can be seen in appendix b jm method provides reasonably good fatigue predictions with a maximum overestimation of about 35 for m 3 in the combination case of c 1 10 c 2 1 5 for m 5 it underestimates the total fatigue damage in most cases with a maximum negative error of about 22 in the combination case of c 1 1 5 c 2 10 lb method gives quite good fatigue damage estimations with an error ranging from 10 to 10 for m 3 in four combination cases for m 5 the damage is underestimated by as much as negative 30 when the spectral bandwidth parameter is approximately equal to 0 9 in the combination case of c 1 1 5 c 2 10 low 2014 method can also give quite accurate damage results fatigue damage errors range from 10 to 10 for m 3 in four combination cases for m 5 the fatigue damage is underestimated by as much as negative 24 in the combination case of c 1 10 c 2 1 5 hm method can also predict the fatigue damage quite accurately and the results are very close to that of lb method for m 3 for m 5 hm method provides improved fatigue damage than lb method when the spectral bandwidth parameter is less than 0 8 overall lb method low 2014 method and hm method have been shown to be in quite good agreement with simulation data for all the psd studied the accuracy of jm is slightly lower than that of lb method low 2014 method and hm method 5 2 2 combination for fatigue damage methods the results of combination of fatigue damage methods are shown in fig 4 as expected dnv method always overestimates the fatigue damage for all considered combinations cases herein the maximum error reaches about 250 in the combination of c 1 10 c 2 1 5 and c 1 2 5 c 2 2 5 for m 5 huang moan method is good with a maximum error of negative 15 when the total bandwidth parameters is less than 0 7 in other cases it exhibits more scatter and the maximum negative error exceeds 50 compared with the above two methods hm method gives quite accurate fatigue damage estimations 5 2 3 general wide band methods the results of general wide band fatigue damage methods are shown in fig 5 lb method low 2014 method and hm method have been proven to give accurate fatigue damage estimation therefore these two methods will be compared with general wide band fatigue damage methods sm method always underestimates the fatigue damage besides the errors become large as the spectral width parameter ε increases but the errors never exceed negative 17 for m 3 in all combination cases for m 5 the maximum error reaches about negative 35 in the combination case of c 1 1 5 c 2 10 and c 1 10 c 2 10 as famous general wide band methods bt method provides very accurate damage estimation the errors are always lower than 10 in most cases the worst case occurs in the combination case of c 1 1 5 c 2 10 and c 1 2 5 c 2 2 5 for m 5 with a maximum error of about negative 22 dk method gives good damage results when the bandwidth is lower than 0 8 when the bandwidth is larger than 0 8 it always underestimates fatigue damage with a maximum of about 30 in the combination case of c 1 1 5 c 2 10 and c 1 10 c 2 1 5 and c 1 2 5 c 2 2 5 for m 5 park method improves the accuracy of dk method to some extent the errors range from 7 to 8 for m 3 for m 5 it underestimates the fatigue damage by as much as 20 in the worst case compared with the general spectral methods lb method low 2014 method and hm method give conservative damage predictions when the bandwidth is lower than 0 8 when the bandwidth exceeds 0 8 the errors from lb method low 2014 method and hm method are very close to that from bt method in addition fatigue damage is insensitive to the geometric shapes of stress psd han and ma 2017 sarkani 1990 wang and chen 2016 thus it is reasonable to carry out numerical simulations by adopting rectangular bimodal spectra 5 3 comparison of fatigue damage models based on overlapped bimodal spectra the results of general wide band fatigue damage methods in overlapped rectangular bimodal spectra are shown in fig 6 as expected bt method dk method and park method in overlapped rectangular bimodal spectra give very accurate estimates the errors never exceed 20 in all combination cases hm method also provides very accurate fatigue damage predictions when the bandwidth is lower than 0 8 hm method always gives conservative results with a maximum error of less than 20 when the bandwidth is larger than 0 8 it slightly underestimates the fatigue damage lb method can also give good damage results in most cases however in some cases it may give some incorrect damage predictions e g in the combination of c 1 10 c 2 1 5 and in the combination of c 1 2 5 c 2 2 5 for lower value of r the fatigue damage ratio obtained from lb method is far less than 1 therefore when one can determine the frequency of bimodal spectrum is overlapped it is not recommended to use lb method to estimate fatigue damage low 2014 method predicts very accurate damage results for the cases studied in this paper for the combination of c 1 1 5 c 2 10 and the fatigue damage error never exceeds 10 for the combination of c 1 10 c 2 1 5 and the combination of c 1 2 5 c 2 2 5 the maximum error is about 15 for the combination of c 1 10 c 2 10 the maximum error reaches about 20 in addition according to the derivation in section 5 1 4 for the combination of c 1 10 c 2 1 5 the combined spectral width parameter ε c ranges from 0 22 to 0 69 for the combination of c 1 2 5 c 2 2 5 the combined spectral width parameter ε c ranges from 0 42 to 0 78 in these two cases the simulated combined spectral width parameter is lower thus bt method dk method park method lb method low 2014 method and hm method provide the best fatigue damage predictions 6 case study it has been proven that jm method lb method low 2014 method and hm method perform very well for predicting the combined fatigue damage in ideal rectangular bimodal spectra however it is still essential to validate the application of the above four methods in real environmental loading therefore some more realistic stress response spectra will be used they include spectra of spring whipping induced response for some larger container ships spectra produced by the wf response and the lf response for mooring and risers spectra of wave and wind response for offshore wind turbine support structures 6 1 case 1 fig 7 shows the real measured stress spectrum for the fotini l in ballast condition the spectrum was obtained using a fast fourier transform analyzer of a digitized record of 20 min length stiansen and mansour 1975 it is obvious that the stress spectrum is characterized by two distinct peaks one occurs at a frequency of about 0 75 rad s corresponding to wf and the other occurs at the 2 node mode frequency of the ship 4 58 rad s this real stress bimodal spectrum can be the sum of a low frequency and high frequency component when considering that the frequency is cut off in 3 14 rad s therefore the bandwidth parameters associated with two components can be calculated as ε l 0 4861 ε h 0 1441 the bandwidth correction factor as computed from different methods including jm method lb method low 2014 method hm method sm method bt method dk method park method are compared with the time domain rainflow counting results the errors are shown in table 3 for m 3 all comparative methods provides quite accuracy fatigue damage estimations the minimum error is about 0 18 by dirlik method the maximum error is about 8 25 given by lb method for m 5 the precision of all comparative methods decreases for example the error of lb method reaches 13 17 6 2 case 2 fig 8 plots a stress response spectrum defined by olagnon and guédé 2008 this spectrum is composed of a swell response which is modeled with a triangular spectrum and a wind sea response which is modeled with a jonswap two bandwidth parameters is ε l 0 1672 ε h 0 5695 the bandwidth correction factor and error results from jm method lb method low 2014 method hm method sm method bt method dk method park method are given in table 4 in this case good agreement between all comparative methods and rfc can be observed and the worst error never exceeds 10 for m 3 and m 5 6 3 case 3 fig 9 displays a stress spectrum which is calculated from k joints in jacket offshore wind turbine support structure qin and ma 2017 this spectrum is introduced by wave response and wind response which have some overlapped frequencies two bandwidth parameters corresponding to wave and wind are ε w a v e 0 5182 ε w i n d 0 9287 in this case two random processes are both broad especially for the wind response the bandwidth parameter reaches 0 9287 which is a quite wide process the results are displayed in table 5 only bt method dk method and park method give accurate fatigue damage estimations with a maximum error of 6 89 corresponding to park method for sm method the damage may be under estimated by as much as about 11 81 for m 3 and 20 11 for m 5 jm method lb method low 2014 method and hm method always provide positive errors which indicates they are conservative and safe for design 7 conclusion this paper studies the applicability of jm method lb method low 2014 method and hm method when considering the combination of a wide band component and a narrowband component or the combination of a wide band component and a wide band component as well as the combination of two overlapped frequency gaussian components rectangular bimodal spectra is constructed to validated the accuracy of the four methods some methods for combination of fatigue damage and some general spectral methods for wide band processes are compared finally three real cases in marine structures are studied to calculated the combined fatigue damage some interesting conclusions are as follows 1 jm method lb method low 2014 method and hm method provide very accurate fatigue damage estimations when two gaussian processes are separated the latter three methods exhibit more precise fatigue damage results than jm method 2 fatigue predictions from lb method low 2014 method and hm method are very close to that from some famous general wide band spectral method such as bt method and dk method 3 when two gaussian processes have overlapped frequencies hm method and low 2014 method can still provide accurate damage assessment 4 in overlapped bimodal spectra lb method may give non reasonable results in a few cases r 1 4 r 1 5 r 1 6 thus it is not recommended to use lb method for fatigue calculation when the frequencies of two random processes are too close 5 dnv method and huang moan method can give good fatigue damage results only when the total bandwidth parameters is less than 0 7 acknowledgement this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51409068 this work was also supported by china postdoctoral science foundation grant no 2015m571396 appendix a for separated bimodal rectangular spectra when keeping the parameter b fixed the bandwidth α 2 c decreases as r increases in the limit r c 1 1 c 2 c 2 2 1 c 1 c 1 2 α 2 c α 2 1 b 0 α 2 2 b therefore the maximum α 2 c can be obtained as α 2 m a x max α 2 1 α 2 2 in the limit r α 2 c α 2 2 b 1 b 0 b 0 α 2 2 b therefore the maximin α 2 c can be obtained as α 2 m i n 0 thus the bandwidth ε c of separated bimodal spectra

23146,fatigue damage variation within a class of naval ships ian thompson defence research and development canada atlantic research centre 9 grove street dartmouth nova scotia b2y 3z7 canada defence research and development canada atlantic research centre 9 grove street dartmouth nova scotia b2y 3z7 canada fatigue damage variation due to operating area differences is assessed using spectral fatigue analysis of ten naval vessels in a class four structural locations are considered the fleet is divided into two groups one based on the east coast of canada operating primarily in the north atlantic the other on the west coast of canada sailing mainly in the north pacific unique operational profiles for each ship were developed from daily geographic locations global seasonal wave statistics and class wide operating probabilities wave loads calculated with a frequency domain seakeeping code were combined with linear finite element analysis to determine the corresponding stresses differences in fatigue damage estimates are small within each coastal fleet the east coast fleet experienced more severe wave conditions than their west coast counterparts resulting in east coast ships having higher fatigue damage estimates also fatigue damage estimates vary more in the east coast fleet than in the west coast fleet preferred speeds and headings in infrequent rough seas magnified the contributions of wave heights of 6 5 m and beyond to fatigue damage estimates keywords fatigue naval vessel spectral fatigue analysis operational history operational profile fatigue variability 1 introduction fatigue cracks in ships are primarily caused by the cyclic stresses arising from encounters with millions of sea waves over their service lives the desire to limit weight in naval vessels by reducing scantlings motivates the use of high strength steels use of high strength steels increases stresses but they are acceptable in comparison to the yield strength these higher stresses lead to fewer cycles for crack initiation since the fatigue properties of high strength steel do not increase in proportion to their yield or tensile strength kirkhope et al 1996 the operation of naval vessels in severe wave conditions and their high strength steel construction accelerate the initiation of fatigue cracks sailing with compromised structure risks fully achieving mission objectives so maintenance of naval fleets is a substantial issue involving frequent inspections and costly repairs variations in operating conditions between ships lead to different fatigue crack initiation periods for naval vessels the blend of missions consists of regularly visited waters close to home and a variety of global locations that are visited less frequently the variety of operational areas visited leads to variation in the wave environments each ship in a class experiences this variation increases when the class is divided among multiple home ports on different bodies of water this study uses the operational history from 1990 to 2009 for ten naval ships five based on the east coast of canada five based on the west coast of canada to examine the variations in experienced wave environments and corresponding fatigue damage estimates at four structural locations class wide operating probabilities were used they include speed and heading profiles dependent on wave height the contributions to fatigue damage accumulation of operating at different speeds or headings relative to the waves referred to afterwards as relative heading and at different significant wave heights are also assessed fatigue damage estimates were generated using spectral fatigue analysis sea loads calculated with a linear frequency domain seakeeping code were combined with linear finite element analysis to determine the resulting stress ranges although corrosion can accelerate fatigue crack initiation it is not considered in this study the ships assessed in this study have longitudinally stiffened displacement hulls built to canadian naval standards the global and local ship models used in this study were also used in thompson 2016 a comparison of calculated stress spectra and associated fatigue damage estimates with those derived from full scale measurements taken during a sea trial the assessed structural arrangements do not have stress concentrations or welds they are not known or expected to have fatigue cracking problems these simple structures are loaded predominantly by horizontal or vertical bending although the side shell structures also experience local stiffener bending due to the wave action the simple nature of the assessed structures provides insights that may be otherwise skewed by local stress concentrations in structures more prone to fatigue damage since vertical bending causes stress ranges greater than those from horizontal bending the locations close to the weather deck and keel are of greater interest than those near the side shell close to the waterline the two locations near the side shell are of less concern but are included because more fatigue prone structures may experience a combination of horizontal and vertical bending no assessments of the variation of fatigue damage within a class of ships were found in a review of the open literature however fatigue assessments of specific ship s components are common in one example mao et al 2010 performed spectral fatigue damage calculations of an amidships detail for a 2800 teu container ship they found the calculated damage had less than 10 bias compared to rainflow damage calculations using strain measurements for fourteen voyages in the north atlantic in another example andersen and jensen 2013 found that damage calculations using spectral methods for a 9400 teu container ship were in generally good agreement with calculations derived from long base strain gauges it is common in spectral fatigue analyses to assume that relative heading angles have equal probability this assumption is sensible in relatively benign conditions but modifications may be required for more severe conditions however identifying these changes accurately may be difficult as rough conditions do not occur frequently and there may be variation in tactics and risk mitigation strategies between operators ship classification societies vary in their recommended relative heading distributions american bureau of shipping 2016 and lloyd s register 2015 suggest using equal probability headings bureau veritas 2016 suggests equal heading probabilities in the absence of better information and det norske veritas 2014 does not mention the heading distribution to use kukkanen and mikkola 2004 calculated the fatigue damage of a hatch cover bearing pad using spectral fatigue analysis uniform heading angle probabilities were used and they found that waves between 4 and 5 m high contributed the most to the accumulated fatigue damage although it was not included in the study they speculated that avoidance of bad weather and high wave heights significantly affect the fatigue damage accumulation fatigue damage accumulated at individual wave heights was not assessed in a study of the distribution of a tanker s vertical bending moments but guedes soares 1990b mentioned that significant wave heights less than 6 m were of most concern for fatigue loading a fatigue assessment of a butt welded structural joint on the main deck of a tanker by garbatov and guedes soares 2012 used several different relative heading distributions none of which were dependent on wave height assuming continuous operations in head seas resulted in fatigue damage estimates about 20 greater than estimates using broader relative heading distributions another study by guedes soares 1990a recognized that wave induced loads are more sensitive to heading changes than to changes in speed he also mentioned that voluntary course changes made in heavy weather put ships in conditions with larger bending moments the intent of this study is to assess how fatigue damage accumulation varies in a class due to operating in different geographical locations maintenance records were reviewed for comparison with the study results conclusions on the accuracy of calculated results could not be drawn because of several known significant omissions and differences in the recording practices of each coastal fleet the methodology is explained in section 2 the results are presented and discussed in section 3 and conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methodology spectral fatigue analysis was used to calculate the fatigue damage accumulated at four structural arrangements for ten naval vessels fatigue damage is only considered from interactions with sea waves a linear hydrodynamic code was used which assumes the seaway can be represented sufficiently by wave superposition increasing wave steepness reduces the accuracy of linear hydrodynamics buckley 1988 suggests that waves with a steepness greater than 0 05 are not accurately modeled with linear hydrodynamic methods the hydrodynamic analysis did not include nonlinear aspects such as slamming or whipping including slamming and whipping would increase the fatigue damage estimates at high speeds and rough waves however stambaugh et al 2014 and drummen et al 2014 found their contributions were relatively small in an assessment of a hull form similar to a frigate especially for wave heights below 4 m the global and local finite element fe models used in this study were also used in thompson 2016 a validation study the structural locations assessed in this study are a sub set of those in the prior study including four areas near midship but excluding those near the bow where bending stresses are typically low a hull cross section sketch in fig 1 shows the approximate locations of the assessed structures stress spectra and corresponding fatigue damage estimates were calculated using software developed within cooperative research ships crs fig 2 shows the whole ship hydrodynamic model containing about 11 000 nodes and 10 000 panels the june 2014 version of precal r van daalen and sireta

seasonal wave statistics british maritime technology limited 1986 were used to calculate the amount of time spent in each combination of significant wave height and zero crossing period values the daily locations and wave statistics define the sea conditions the ships experienced but speed and relative heading profiles are also needed to define the operational profile the speed and relative heading profiles are based on speed measurements and a survey of operators perrault 2015 the survey considers time at sea to be divided into relatively calm conditions where normal operations are conducted conditions that are challenging but operators can withstand with modifications and conditions that are severe when safety is the first priority the operator survey established the conditions where operational changes would be made the measured speed profile was used for significant wave heights up to 4 m in significant wave heights of 4 6 m high speed operations are assumed to be limited a narrow range of speeds to ensure safety was used at significant wave heights beyond 6 m relative headings were uniformly distributed for waves up to 6 m beyond 6 m operators are assumed to limit their headings to within 45 of head seas periods of time with high operational imperative where operators are willing to accept waves from all directions and have less stringent speed restrictions were assumed to occur 5 of the time based on a workshop with operators the speed and heading may differ from actual profiles and the analysis does not include the possibility of variations between operators however changing the speed and heading profiles in rough conditions is thought to make them more realistic wave spectra from the operational profiles were modeled using a two parameter

veritas 2014 using this conservative curve assumes the coating has failed 3 results and discussion historical operations were used along with global seasonal wave statistics and class wide speed and heading profiles to develop unique operational profiles for ten ships in a class these profiles provide the distribution of operating conditions for each ship fatigue damage estimates at four structural locations are based on these profiles the wave statistics normalized fatigue damage and contributions of several operating parameters to fatigue damage accumulation are compared 3 1 wave environment variations in the experienced wave environments between the considered ships occurred because each ship operated in different combinations of locations and seasons the long term seasonal bmt statistics were used to calculate the experienced wave statistics based on the ships logs table 1 shows wave distribution statistics the distribution of significant wave heights for each ship is shown in fig 5 and the zero crossing periods are shown in fig 6 polylines are used in plots to represent east coast ships and polygons are used for west coast ships the north atlantic wave climate is generally considered as an extreme sea state within ocean going areas guedes soares et al 2003 so it was expected that the wave environments calculated from the bmt statistics for east coast ships would be more severe than those for west coast ships as shown in table 1 average significant wave heights are higher for all of the east coast ships than those experienced by the west coast ships the difference in significant wave height between the average ship on each coast is 26 cm fig 5 shows that west coast ships were generally exposed to more conditions with a significant wave height up to 2 5 m while east coast ships experienced more conditions with significant wave heights of 3 5 m and beyond the zero crossing period distributions derived from the bmt statistics shown in table 1 and fig 6 are not as straightforward as the significant wave height distributions four of the five highest average zero crossing periods are for east coast ships but the second highest is a west coast ship it was expected that west coast ships would experience waves with longer periods wave buoy measurements showed that off the atlantic coast waves tend to have shorter periods than those off the pacific coast buckley 1988 waves with high significant wave heights tend to have longer periods so this tendency may have contributed to east coast ships experiencing higher wave periods the average zero crossing period at each significant wave height was compared for each ship although omitted here for brevity the results show similar average periods up to 4 5 m for each ship for waves with significant heights of 5 5 m and beyond the periods are slightly longer for east coast ships suspected errors in the bmt zero crossing periods bitner gregersen and cramer 1994 bitner gregersen et al 1995 could lead to this unexpected result 3 2 fatigue damage estimates for assumed 20 year period each of the ships in the fleet was at sea for different amounts of time over the 1990 2009 period when operating information was available to assess the influence of operating in different areas on fatigue damage accumulation an assumed twenty year period with common sailing time was used the resulting fatigue damage estimates were normalized by dividing by the highest damage estimate overall fatigue damage at each of the assessed structures was calculated using equation 2 typically when damage values are equal to unity a crack is expected at a probability corresponding to the selected s n curve an expected crack could mean the failure of the considered local structure as assumed by some ship classification societies american bureau of shipping 2016 det norske veritas 2014 or that a detectable crack has initiated the difference is that assessments using the latter assumption may include crack growth analysis after initiation an approach not used in this study in this analysis the damage values were normalized so the listed values are a relative indication of the time for a crack to develop the results are shown in table 2 the damage estimates shown in table 2 can be separated into the structures on side shell longitudinal stiffeners s27 and s35 where the damage is relatively low and the structures close to the keel s26 or weather deck s37 where damage values are much higher damage estimates vary more for the structures with higher damage s26 and s37 four additional structural arrangements were assessed two from each group the results were omitted for brevity but they are consistent with those shown the average east coast ship accumulated about 40 50 more fatigue damage at the assessed structures than the average west coast ship the fatigue damage estimate at each structural location is greater for all the east coast ships than for any of the west coast ships the east coast ship that experienced the lowest average significant wave height ec1 2 39 m accumulated about 30 more damage than the west coast ship that experienced the highest average significant wave height wc4 2 38 m although more fatigue damage among east coast ships was expected because they were exposed to higher significant wave heights table 1 the ranking of significant wave heights did not align exactly with the rankings of fatigue damage estimates rankings of average significant wave height and damage accumulation for individual ships differ but the differences are due in part to how fatigue damage was calculated in equation 2 the term m 0 m estimates the root mean square stress raised to the power m in this case 3 so although the root mean square stress is proportional to the wave height fatigue damage correlates better with the average of the significant wave height cubed than it does with the average significant wave height also the heading restrictions in significant waves higher than 6 m result in higher stress ranges and corresponding higher fatigue damage rates discrepancies between the rank of damage and average significant wave height may also be due to differences in the distribution of zero crossing periods in the experienced wave conditions further if a wave spectrum contains energy at frequencies that do not induce a meaningful structural response there will not be a strong correlation between wave conditions and fatigue damage calculations the variation in estimated fatigue damage for the entire class of ten ships is much greater than the variation within either coastal fleet the coefficients of variation for the group of ten ships are from 18 to 22 for the four assessed structures much of the variation is due to differences between the two coastal fleets as the coefficients of variation for the individual coastal fleets are between 3 and 6 the slightly but consistently higher coefficients of variation for east coast ships may be due to them experiencing a broader range of significant wave heights more often than west coast ships a review of the maintenance logs found differences in the manner repairs were recorded between the two coastal fleets also a substantial number of repairs done by contractors were known to be missing from the available maintenance records these differences and omissions prevented use of the records for correlation analysis 3 3 influence of significant wave height on fatigue damage summing fatigue damage estimates for each significant wave height identifies the relative contribution of individual wave heights the distribution of damage versus significant wave height for s37 located near the weather deck is shown in fig 7 and the results for s27 on a side shell longitudinal stiffener are shown in fig 8 the results for s26 and s35 are not shown in the interests of brevity however the trends for the locations near the side shell are similar as are the trends for the structures near the keel and weather deck the solid lines in figs 7 12 represent the damage based on the average wave conditions the contribution of individual significant wave heights to fatigue damage accumulation for a simple structural arrangement near the weather deck s37 depends on where the ships are based as shown in fig 7 east coast ships were most affected by 6 5 m significant wave height conditions while west coast ships generally accumulated the most damage at 3 5 m significant wave heights and slightly less at 6 5 m the peaks at 6 5 m correspond to the lowest wave height where operators are assumed to limit their headings close to head seas to maintain seakeeping quality this restriction results in the ships experiencing conditions with high stress ranges more often the increase in time at high stress ranges led to the peaks in figs 7 and 8 despite experiencing 6 5 m significant wave heights only 1 2 and 2 0 of the time for the average west coast and average east coast ships respectively the east coast ships accumulated more damage in high waves because they are exposed to them more often for instance they experience 6 5 m significant wave height conditions 70 more often than west coast ships infrequent high significant wave heights did not influence the structural location near the side shell as strongly as shown in fig 8 there is a peak secondary for west coast ships in fatigue damage accumulation at 6 5 m but the increase is smaller than observed for s37 if the heading restriction used in this study is representative of operations in these conditions analyses that assume equal probability of all headings may generate fatigue damage estimates that are too low slamming and whipping contributions to fatigue damage were not included if they had been included damage estimates in rough conditions while sailing near head seas may have been even greater 3 4 influence of relative heading on fatigue damage relative heading greatly affects the bending moment a ship experiences in beam seas ships roll resulting in low stresses head seas result in vertical bending and corresponding high stress ranges the contribution of relative heading to fatigue damage accumulation was assessed in the same manner as for wave heights the damage estimates were summed for each heading division for each ship in the results for s37 shown in fig 9 and those for s27 in fig 10 head seas are at 180 and following seas are at 0 figs 9 and 10 show similar relationships between relative heading and fatigue damage accumulation through the fleet for s37 the structure near the weather deck almost all of the fatigue damage accumulates at bow quartering and head seas the stresses due to vertical bending that this structural location experiences are highest in these conditions also operators prefer these conditions in high seas to limit motions other locations near the keel and weather deck were examined and the relationships are essentially the same operations in bow quartering seas contributed to the majority of the fatigue damage accumulation at s27 located near the side shell since this structure is near the mean waterline the stresses from vertical bending are quite low the asymmetry in fig 10 shows more damage accumulating when the structure is exposed to oncoming waves the asymmetry is consistent with local bending at this location assessment of other structures near the opposite side shell exhibit similar responses but the asymmetry is reversed most of the fatigue damage accumulated at these two structures with relative headings between 90 and 270 operations at these relative headings tend to have higher stresses and encounter frequencies but the maxima depend on how the local structure is loaded refinement of the headings in future studies using similar speed and relative heading profiles would be most effective within 90 of head seas 3 5 influence of ship speed on fatigue damage increasing ship speed results in higher wave encounter frequencies which contribute to higher fatigue damage accumulation rates as with significant wave height and relative heading the fatigue damage estimates for each of the assessed ship speeds were summed figs 11 and 12 show the results for s37 and s27 respectively most of the fatigue damage accumulated at 10 and 15 knots for both structures as shown in figs 11 and 12 the ships spend most of their time sailing in these conditions in rough seas operators tend to reduce speed limiting the amount of damage accumulated at higher speeds the proportion of damage at 15 knots relative to that at 10 knots is slightly higher for s37 located near the weather deck otherwise the results are similar for both local structures the trends for all of the ships are similar suggesting the variations in geographical operations did not markedly change the role of ship speed in fatigue damage accumulation for these vessels 4 conclusions the accumulation of fatigue damage over an assumed 20 year period same usage for each ship is assessed at four structural locations near midship for ten naval vessels in the same class five of the ships are based on the atlantic coast five are based on the pacific coast variations in operational history enabled assessment of the scatter in calculated wave environments and corresponding accumulated fatigue damage within the class wave conditions were derived from global wave statistics and actual operating locations for each ship from 1990 to 2009 the fatigue assessments used these wave conditions and class wide ship speed and relative heading profiles that were dependent on wave height the resulting experienced wave conditions the influence of operating parameters and the distribution of fatigue damage are assessed the ships based on the east coast experienced conditions with higher calculated significant wave heights than their west coast counterparts as expected the average east coast ship was exposed to a mean significant wave height 26 cm higher than the average west coast ship the mean significant wave height for each of the east coast ships is higher than for any of the west coast ships the wave periods were compared but the variations do not appear to correspond to the home port the more severe conditions calculated for the east coast ships led to greater fatigue damage estimates and more variability between ships the analysis included a relative heading restriction in rough conditions this restriction limits ships to within 45 of head seas in significant wave heights beyond 6 m the operational limitation intended to maintain safety by limiting excessive motions results in higher vertical bending moments although including similar restrictions is not common in the open literature it appears to have had a significant influence the ships based on the east coast experience 6 5 m significant wave heights about 2 of the time at sea however this wave height had the greatest contribution to fatigue damage accumulation for all the assessed structures for each east coast ship wave conditions with a significant height of 6 5 m or greater contribute to fatigue damage accumulation for west coast ships but they occur less frequently so the more common significant wave height of 3 5 m generally contributes to the most fatigue damage accumulation these results especially for the east coast ships suggest that a realistic representation of the experienced relative headings may yield more conservative results than assuming an equal distribution in all conditions in this study fatigue damage varies little within each coastal fleet but the damage estimates for east coast ships are 40 50 greater than for west coast ships the results are contingent on the accuracy of several assumptions but they suggest that the relative damage of ships within each coastal fleet may depend more on the total time at sea than the mix of geographic locations that have been visited these results and those of following studies to assess several of the assumptions have many possible uses if the difference in fatigue damage between the coastal fleets is accurate there are opportunities to change platform maintenance to limit costs and increase availability potential changes could be as minor as modifying maintenance schedules or as major as changing where ships operate to balance the accumulated fatigue damage across the fleet these results could be used to inform hull monitoring if the fatigue damage variation within coastal fleets is indeed as small as this study suggests instrumenting a single ship on each coast may be sufficient to monitor damage accumulation the results also suggest that life extensions could be quantified using one ship from each coast and scaling the results based on time at sea before any actions are taken based on this study several of the underlying assumptions must be scrutinized further the assumption of linear hydrodynamics may be reasonable in relatively calm seas for instance drummen et al 2014 concluded that whipping loads have a limited contribution to fatigue damage in wave heights lower than about 4 m however this assumption should be re evaluated in rough conditions where large amounts of fatigue damage are accumulated waves with significant heights of 6 m and beyond do not occur frequently so small absolute errors in the bmt wave statistics could lead to large fatigue damage calculation errors the error in wave data should be addressed by examining the influence of using different wave data sources on calculated results also the influence of the operator on fatigue damage accumulation is uncertain a study with variations in the baseline speed and heading profiles representing different operator behavior should improve this understanding measurement of operator behavior over sufficient time to capture many conditions for several operators would be useful to understand the variation in behavior between operators a better understanding of operator behavior would contribute to better quantification of the uncertainty in fatigue damage assessments once these areas are better understood an assessment of more fatigue prone ship structure would provide insight that could inform better platform management practices funding this research did not receive any specific

research and development canada atlantic research centre 9 grove street dartmouth nova scotia b2y 3z7 canada fatigue damage variation due to operating area differences is assessed using spectral fatigue analysis of ten naval vessels in a class four structural locations are considered the fleet is divided into two groups one based on the east coast of canada operating primarily in the north atlantic the other on the west coast of canada sailing mainly in the north pacific unique operational profiles for each ship were developed from daily geographic locations global seasonal wave statistics and class wide operating probabilities wave loads calculated with a frequency domain seakeeping code were combined with linear finite element analysis to determine the corresponding stresses differences in fatigue damage estimates are small within each coastal fleet the east coast fleet experienced more severe wave conditions than their west coast counterparts resulting in east coast ships having higher fatigue damage estimates also fatigue damage estimates vary more in the east coast fleet than in the west coast fleet preferred speeds and headings in infrequent rough seas magnified the contributions of wave heights of 6 5 m and beyond to fatigue damage estimates keywords fatigue naval vessel spectral fatigue analysis operational history operational profile fatigue variability 1 introduction fatigue cracks in ships are primarily caused by the cyclic stresses arising from encounters with millions of sea waves over their service lives the desire to limit weight in naval vessels by reducing scantlings motivates the use of high strength steels use of high strength steels increases stresses but they are acceptable in comparison to the yield strength these higher stresses lead to fewer cycles for crack initiation since the fatigue properties of high strength steel do not increase in proportion to their yield or tensile strength kirkhope et al 1996 the operation of naval vessels in severe wave conditions and their high strength steel construction accelerate the initiation of fatigue cracks sailing with compromised structure risks fully achieving mission objectives so maintenance of naval fleets is a substantial issue involving frequent inspections and costly repairs variations in operating conditions between ships lead to different fatigue crack initiation periods for naval vessels the blend of missions consists of regularly visited waters close to home and a variety of global locations that are visited less frequently the variety of operational areas visited leads to variation in the wave environments each ship in a class experiences this variation increases when the class is divided among multiple home ports on different bodies of water this study uses the operational history from 1990 to 2009 for ten naval ships five based on the east coast of canada five based on the west coast of canada to examine the variations in experienced wave environments and corresponding fatigue damage estimates at four structural locations class wide operating probabilities were used they include speed and heading profiles dependent on wave height the contributions to fatigue damage accumulation of operating at different speeds or headings relative to the waves referred to afterwards as relative heading and at different significant wave heights are also assessed fatigue damage estimates were generated using spectral fatigue analysis sea loads calculated with a linear frequency domain seakeeping code were combined with linear finite element analysis to determine the resulting stress ranges although corrosion can accelerate fatigue crack initiation it is not considered in this study the ships assessed in this study have longitudinally stiffened displacement hulls built to canadian naval standards the global and local ship models used in this study were also used in thompson 2016 a comparison of calculated stress spectra and associated fatigue damage estimates with those derived from full scale measurements taken during a sea trial the assessed structural arrangements do not have stress concentrations or welds they are not known or expected to have fatigue cracking problems these simple structures are loaded predominantly by horizontal or vertical bending although the side shell structures also experience local stiffener bending due to the wave action the simple nature of the assessed structures provides insights that may be otherwise skewed by local stress concentrations in structures more prone to fatigue damage since vertical bending causes stress ranges greater than those from horizontal bending the locations close to the weather deck and keel are of greater interest than those near the side shell close to the waterline the two locations near the side shell are of less concern but are included because more fatigue prone structures may experience a combination of horizontal and vertical bending no assessments of the variation of fatigue damage within a class of ships were found in a review of the open literature however fatigue assessments of specific ship s components are common in one example mao et al 2010 performed spectral fatigue damage calculations of an amidships detail for a 2800 teu container ship they found the calculated damage had less than 10 bias compared to rainflow damage calculations using strain measurements for fourteen voyages in the north atlantic in another example andersen and jensen 2013 found that damage calculations using spectral methods for a 9400 teu container ship were in generally good agreement with calculations derived from long base strain gauges it is common in spectral fatigue analyses to assume that relative heading angles have equal probability this assumption is sensible in relatively benign conditions but modifications may be required for more severe conditions however identifying these changes accurately may be difficult as rough conditions do not occur frequently and there may be variation in tactics and risk mitigation strategies between operators ship classification societies vary in their recommended relative heading distributions american bureau of shipping 2016 and lloyd s register 2015 suggest using equal probability headings bureau veritas 2016 suggests equal heading probabilities in the absence of better information and det norske veritas 2014 does not mention the heading distribution to use kukkanen and mikkola 2004 calculated the fatigue damage of a hatch cover bearing pad using spectral fatigue analysis uniform heading angle probabilities were used and they found that waves between 4 and 5 m high contributed the most to the accumulated fatigue damage although it was not included in the study they speculated that avoidance of bad weather and high wave heights significantly affect the fatigue damage accumulation fatigue damage accumulated at individual wave heights was not assessed in a study of the distribution of a tanker s vertical bending moments but guedes soares 1990b mentioned that significant wave heights less than 6 m were of most concern for fatigue loading a fatigue assessment of a butt welded structural joint on the main deck of a tanker by garbatov and guedes soares 2012 used several different relative heading distributions none of which were dependent on wave height assuming continuous operations in head seas resulted in fatigue damage estimates about 20 greater than estimates using broader relative heading distributions another study by guedes soares 1990a recognized that wave induced loads are more sensitive to heading changes than to changes in speed he also mentioned that voluntary course changes made in heavy weather put ships in conditions with larger bending moments the intent of this study is to assess how fatigue damage accumulation varies in a class due to operating in different geographical locations maintenance records were reviewed for comparison with the study results conclusions on the accuracy of calculated results could not be drawn because of several known significant omissions and differences in the recording practices of each coastal fleet the methodology is explained in section 2 the results are presented and discussed in section 3 and conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methodology spectral fatigue analysis was used to calculate the fatigue damage accumulated at four structural arrangements for ten naval vessels fatigue damage is only considered from interactions with sea waves a linear hydrodynamic code was used which assumes the seaway can be represented sufficiently by wave superposition increasing wave steepness reduces the accuracy of linear hydrodynamics buckley 1988 suggests that waves with a steepness greater than 0 05 are not accurately modeled with linear hydrodynamic methods the hydrodynamic analysis did not include nonlinear aspects such as slamming or whipping including slamming and whipping would increase the fatigue damage estimates at high speeds and rough waves however stambaugh et al 2014 and drummen et al 2014 found their contributions were relatively small in an assessment of a hull form similar to a frigate especially for wave heights below 4 m the global and local finite element fe models used in this study were also used in thompson 2016 a validation study the structural locations assessed in this study are a sub set of those in the prior study including four areas near midship but excluding those near the bow where bending stresses are

generally considered as an extreme sea state within ocean going areas guedes soares et al 2003 so it was expected that the wave environments calculated from the bmt statistics for east coast ships would be more severe than those for west coast ships as shown in table 1 average significant wave heights are higher for all of the east coast ships than those experienced by the west coast ships the difference in significant wave height between the average ship on each coast is 26 cm fig 5 shows that west coast ships were generally exposed to more conditions with a significant wave height up to 2 5 m while east coast ships experienced more conditions with significant wave heights of 3 5 m and beyond the zero crossing period distributions derived from the bmt statistics shown in table 1 and fig 6 are not as straightforward as the significant wave height distributions four of the five highest average zero crossing periods are for east coast ships but the second highest is a west coast ship it was expected that west coast ships would experience waves with longer periods wave buoy measurements showed that off the atlantic coast waves tend to have shorter periods than those off the pacific coast buckley 1988 waves with high significant wave heights tend to have longer periods so this tendency may have contributed to east coast ships experiencing higher wave periods the average zero crossing period at each significant wave height was compared for each ship although omitted here for brevity the results show similar average periods up to 4 5 m for each ship for waves with significant heights of 5 5 m and beyond the periods are slightly longer for east coast ships suspected errors in the bmt zero crossing periods bitner gregersen and cramer 1994 bitner gregersen et al 1995 could lead to this unexpected result 3 2 fatigue damage estimates for assumed 20 year period each of the ships in the fleet was at sea for different amounts of time over the 1990 2009 period when operating information was available to assess the influence of operating in different areas on fatigue damage accumulation an assumed twenty year period with common sailing time was used the resulting fatigue damage estimates were normalized by dividing by the highest damage estimate overall fatigue damage at each of the assessed structures was calculated using equation 2 typically when damage values are equal to unity a crack is expected at a probability corresponding to the selected s n curve an expected crack could mean the failure of the considered local structure as assumed by some ship classification societies american bureau of shipping 2016 det norske veritas 2014 or that a detectable crack has initiated the difference is that assessments using the latter assumption may include crack growth analysis after initiation an approach not used in this study in this analysis the damage values were normalized so the listed values are a relative indication of the time for a crack to develop the results are shown in table 2 the damage estimates shown in table 2 can be separated into the structures on side shell longitudinal stiffeners s27 and s35 where the damage is relatively low and the structures close to the keel s26 or weather deck s37 where damage values are much higher damage estimates vary more for the structures with higher damage s26 and s37 four additional structural arrangements were assessed two from each group the results were omitted for brevity but they are consistent with those shown the average east coast ship accumulated about 40 50 more fatigue damage at the assessed structures than the average west coast ship the fatigue damage estimate at each structural location is greater for all the east coast ships than for any of the west coast ships the east coast ship that experienced the lowest average significant wave height ec1 2 39 m accumulated about 30 more damage than the west coast ship that experienced the highest average significant wave height wc4 2 38 m although more fatigue damage among east coast ships was expected because they were exposed to higher significant wave heights table 1 the ranking of significant wave heights did not align exactly with the rankings of fatigue damage estimates rankings of average significant wave height and damage accumulation for individual ships differ but the differences are due in part to how fatigue damage was calculated in equation 2 the term m 0 m estimates the root mean square stress raised to the power m in this case 3 so although the root mean square stress is proportional to the wave height fatigue damage correlates better with the average of the significant wave height cubed than it does with the average significant wave height also the heading restrictions in significant waves higher than 6 m result in higher stress ranges and corresponding higher fatigue damage rates discrepancies between the rank of damage and average significant wave height may also be due to differences in the distribution of zero crossing periods in the experienced wave conditions further if a wave spectrum contains energy at frequencies that do not induce a meaningful structural response there will not be a strong correlation between wave conditions and fatigue damage calculations the variation in estimated fatigue damage for the entire class of ten ships is much greater than the variation within either coastal fleet the coefficients of variation for the group of ten ships are from 18 to 22 for the four assessed structures much of the variation is due to differences between the two coastal fleets as the coefficients of variation for the individual coastal fleets are between 3 and 6 the slightly but consistently higher coefficients of variation for east coast ships may be due to them experiencing a broader range of significant wave heights more often than west coast ships a review of the maintenance logs found differences in the manner repairs were recorded between the two coastal fleets also a substantial number of repairs done by contractors were known to be missing from the available maintenance records these differences and omissions prevented use of the records for correlation analysis 3 3 influence of significant wave height on fatigue damage summing fatigue damage estimates for each significant wave height identifies the relative contribution of individual wave heights the distribution of damage versus significant wave height for s37 located near the weather deck is shown in fig 7 and the results for s27 on a side shell longitudinal stiffener are shown in fig 8 the results for s26 and s35 are not shown in the interests of brevity however the trends for the locations near the side shell are similar as are the trends for the structures near the keel and weather deck the solid lines in figs 7 12 represent the damage based on the average wave conditions the contribution of individual significant wave heights to fatigue damage accumulation for a simple structural arrangement near the weather deck s37 depends on where the ships are based as shown in fig 7 east coast ships were most affected by 6 5 m significant wave height conditions while west coast ships generally accumulated the most damage at 3 5 m significant wave heights and slightly less at 6 5 m the peaks at 6 5 m correspond to the lowest wave height where operators are assumed to limit their headings close to head seas to maintain seakeeping quality this restriction results in the ships experiencing conditions with high stress ranges more often the increase in time at high stress ranges led to the peaks in figs 7 and 8 despite experiencing 6 5 m significant wave heights only 1 2 and 2 0 of the time for the average west coast and average east coast ships respectively the east coast ships accumulated more damage in high waves because they are exposed to them more often for instance they experience 6 5 m significant wave height conditions 70 more often than west coast ships infrequent high significant wave heights did not influence the structural location near the side shell as strongly as shown in fig 8 there is a peak secondary for west coast ships in fatigue damage accumulation at 6 5 m but the increase is smaller than observed for s37 if the heading restriction used in this study is representative of operations in these conditions analyses that assume equal probability of all headings may generate fatigue damage estimates that are too low slamming and whipping contributions to fatigue damage were not included if they had been included damage estimates in rough conditions while sailing near head seas may have been even greater 3 4 influence of relative heading on fatigue damage relative heading greatly affects the bending moment a ship experiences in beam seas ships roll resulting in low stresses head seas result in vertical bending and corresponding high stress ranges the contribution of relative heading to fatigue damage accumulation was assessed in the same manner as for wave heights the damage estimates were summed for each heading division for each ship in the results for s37 shown in fig 9 and those for s27 in fig 10 head seas are at 180 and following seas are at 0 figs 9 and 10 show similar relationships between relative heading and fatigue damage accumulation through the fleet for s37 the structure near the weather deck almost all of the fatigue damage accumulates at bow quartering and head seas the stresses due to vertical bending that this structural location experiences are highest in these conditions also operators prefer these conditions in high seas to limit motions other locations near the keel and weather deck were examined and the relationships are essentially the same operations in bow quartering seas contributed to the majority of the fatigue damage accumulation at s27 located near the side shell since this structure is near the mean waterline the stresses from vertical bending are quite low the asymmetry in fig 10 shows more damage accumulating when the structure is exposed to oncoming waves the asymmetry is consistent with local bending at this location assessment of other structures near the opposite side shell exhibit similar responses but the asymmetry is reversed most of the fatigue damage accumulated at these two structures with relative headings between 90 and 270 operations at these relative headings tend to have higher stresses and encounter frequencies but the maxima depend on how the local structure is loaded refinement of the headings in future studies using similar speed and relative heading profiles would be most effective within 90 of head seas 3 5 influence of ship speed on fatigue damage increasing ship speed results in higher wave encounter frequencies which contribute to higher fatigue damage accumulation rates as with significant wave height and relative heading the fatigue damage estimates for each of the assessed ship speeds were summed figs 11 and 12 show the results for s37 and s27 respectively most of the fatigue damage accumulated at 10 and 15 knots for both structures as shown in figs 11 and 12 the ships spend most of their time sailing in these conditions in rough seas operators tend to reduce speed limiting the amount of damage accumulated at higher speeds the proportion of damage at 15 knots relative to that at 10 knots is slightly higher for s37 located near the weather deck otherwise the results are similar for both local structures the trends for all of the ships are similar suggesting the variations in geographical operations did not markedly change the role of ship speed in fatigue damage accumulation for these vessels 4 conclusions the accumulation of fatigue damage over an assumed 20 year period same usage for each ship is assessed at four structural locations near midship for ten naval vessels in the same class five of the ships are based on the atlantic coast five are based on the pacific coast variations in operational history enabled assessment of the scatter in calculated wave environments and corresponding accumulated fatigue damage within the class wave conditions were derived from global wave statistics and actual operating locations for each ship from 1990 to 2009 the fatigue assessments used these wave conditions and class wide ship speed and relative heading profiles that were dependent on wave height the resulting experienced wave conditions the influence of operating parameters and the distribution of fatigue damage are assessed the ships based on the east coast experienced conditions with higher calculated significant wave heights than their west coast counterparts as expected the average east coast ship was exposed to a mean significant wave height 26 cm higher than the average west coast ship the mean significant wave height for each of the east coast ships is higher than for any of the west coast ships the wave periods were compared but the variations do not appear to correspond to the home port the more severe conditions calculated for the east coast ships led to greater fatigue damage estimates and more variability between ships the analysis included a relative heading restriction in rough conditions this restriction limits ships to within 45 of head seas in significant wave heights beyond 6 m the operational limitation intended to maintain safety by limiting excessive motions results in higher vertical bending moments although including similar restrictions is not common in the open literature it appears to have had a significant influence the ships based on the east coast experience 6 5 m significant wave heights about 2 of the time at sea however this wave height had the greatest contribution to fatigue damage accumulation for all the assessed structures for each east coast ship wave conditions with a significant height of 6 5 m or greater contribute to fatigue damage accumulation for west coast ships but they occur less frequently so the more common significant wave height of 3 5 m generally contributes to the most fatigue damage accumulation these results especially for the east coast ships suggest that a realistic representation of the experienced relative headings may yield more conservative results than assuming an equal distribution in all conditions in this study fatigue damage varies little within each coastal fleet but the damage estimates for east coast ships are 40 50 greater than for west coast ships the results are contingent on the accuracy of several assumptions but they suggest that the relative damage of ships within each coastal fleet may depend more on the total time at sea than the mix of geographic locations that have been visited these results and those of following studies to assess several of the assumptions have many possible uses if the difference in fatigue damage between the coastal fleets is accurate there are opportunities to change platform maintenance to limit costs and increase availability potential changes could be as minor as modifying maintenance schedules or as major as changing where ships operate to balance the accumulated fatigue damage across the fleet these results could be used to inform hull monitoring if the fatigue damage variation within coastal fleets is indeed as small as this study suggests instrumenting a single ship on each coast may be sufficient to monitor damage accumulation the results also suggest that life extensions could be quantified using one ship from each coast and scaling the results based on time at sea before any actions are taken based on this study several of the underlying assumptions must be scrutinized further the assumption of linear hydrodynamics may be reasonable in relatively calm seas for instance drummen et al 2014 concluded that whipping loads have a limited contribution to fatigue damage in wave heights lower than about 4 m however this assumption should be re evaluated in rough conditions where large amounts of fatigue damage are accumulated waves with significant heights of 6 m and beyond do not occur frequently so small absolute errors in the bmt wave statistics could lead to large fatigue damage calculation errors the error in wave data should be addressed by examining the influence of using different wave data sources on calculated results also the influence of the operator on fatigue damage accumulation is uncertain a study with variations in the baseline speed and heading profiles representing different operator behavior should improve this understanding measurement of operator behavior over sufficient time to capture many conditions for several operators would be useful to understand the variation in behavior between operators a better understanding of operator behavior would contribute to better quantification of the uncertainty in fatigue damage assessments once these areas are better understood an assessment of more fatigue prone ship structure would provide insight that could inform better platform management practices funding this research did not receive any specific

23147,the propagation and transformation of water waves in the near shore region lead complicated wave current field which plays a significant role in the study of the mechanism of sediment transport and coastal evolution solitary wave is supposed as an initially incoming wave because of its widespread use in the near shore the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations were incorporated into a k ε turbulence model and applied to simulate the run up and hydrodynamic characteristics of solitary waves under the influences of different incident wave height and beach slope the simulation results were validated with theoretical and experimental results from the literature the effects of the non linear terms associated with the curl of the fluid reynolds stresses and viscous stresses in the governing equations of fluid as well as the turbulent production term convection term and diffusion term in the k ε model were analyzed the analysis shows that wave breaking is of great importance to the hydrodynamic characteristics of the wave current field in the near shore the run up heights of breaking solitary waves increase with beach slope and the velocity and vorticity reach the maximum after wave breaking the non linear curl and convection terms and turbulent production term contribute most to the nonlinearities of the near shore hydrodynamics and increase with beach slope under these conditions nevertheless under the conditions of wave non breaking the wave run up height the maximum of velocity and vorticity decrease with increasing beach slope meanwhile the effects of fluid diffusion and reynolds stresses increase gradually with increasing beach slope keywords wave run up hydrodynamic characteristics beach slope reynolds averaged navier stokes equations solitary wave 1 introduction in the process of wave propagation in the coastal region the wave surface steepens with increasing wave height and may eventually become unstable and broken it causes the wave current field in the near shore region to become more complicated which greatly affects the morphological changes of coastal areas and offshore structures choi et al 2015 kamath et al 2016 therefore it is required to accurately describe the run up and hydrodynamic characteristics of waves in the process of propagation in the near shore region wave run up is one of the important parts of the wave propagation in the near shore area extensive studies on the wave run up have been reported including the theories synolakis 1987 li and raichlen 2001 carrier et al 2003 kânoĝlu 2004 experiments hsiao et al 2008 chang et al 2009 sælevik et al 2013 drähne et al 2016 and numerical simulations ma et al 2007 fuhrman and madsen 2008 chio et al 2008 lara et al 2011 tsung et al 2012 which are appropriate for breaking ai and jin 2012 and non breaking kuiry et al 2012 waves synolakis 1987 proposed a formula to calculate wave run up height for non breaking solitary waves based on shallow water equations which indicates that the run up height decreases with increasing beach slope however the calculated results are larger than the measured values sriram et al 2016 li and raichlen 2001 proposed a nonlinear theoretical solution for wave run up using the carrier and greenspan 1958 transformation and the calculation results are better than that obtained by synolakis 1987 the run up height of the breaking wave is different from that of the non breaking wave synolakis 1987 hsiao et al 2008 indicated that the run up height increases with beach slope for breaking solitary waves the breaking criterion plays a significant role in the calculation of wave run up height many studies have attempted to define breaking criteria for solitary wave run up on plane slopes camfield and street 1969 synolakis 1986 grilli et al 1997 synolakis 1986 predicted much smaller wave height for breaking on a given slope grilli et al 1997 developed the breaking criteria based on the potential equations however some non linear terms are neglected which may be not appropriate in some certain conditions qi et al 2017 it is necessary to study the hydrodynamic characteristics before and after wave breaking in the process of wave propagation under different conditions chen et al 2011 peregrine and williamss 2001 pringle et al 2016 li and raichlen 2002 found that the energy dissipation is closely associated with wave breaking mo 2013 focused on the wave transformation and the characteristic of velocity field in the wave propagation hsieh 2016 studied the spatial variation of the hydrodynamic factors including vorticity convection term and turbulent production term however the influence of the beach slope on the wave transformation and hydrodynamic characteristics in the near shore area was not concerned this study presents the numerical investigations of the run up and hydrodynamic characteristics of solitary waves influenced by the incident wave height and beach slope the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations coupled with a k ε turbulence model are applied to simulate the wave run up on beach slopes then the evolution of the velocity field and vorticity in the wave propagation are studied furthermore the effects of the beach slope on the nonlinear terms in the rans equations and k ε model are analyzed 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equations wave deformation wave breaking and wave induced current in the near shore play important roles on the coastal topography evolution and offshore engineering on which a lot literature discussed using non potential flow models choi et al 2008 lara et al 2011 smit et al 2013 solitary wave in the near shore approaching to and climbing up the sloped beach the wave front becomes steeper and eventually the wave breaks in this process the velocity gradient becomes strong and the effects of viscosity and curl of the fluid play an important role in the near shore therefore the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations calculating the time averaged components of the flow are used to simulate the propagation of solitary waves on a uniform sloping beach in a two dimensional fluid domain the governing equations for an incompressible fluid are expressed as follows 1 continuty equation u i x i 0 2 momentum equation u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i g i x j υ u i x j u i u j where i and j are the cyclic coordinates in an orthogonal coordinate system whose values are 1 and 2 while u i are the time averaged velocity components ρ is the density of the fluid p is the pressure g i is the gravitational acceleration u i u j denotes the turbulent reynolds stresses which can be expressed as u i u j ν t u i x j u j x i 2 3 k δ i j where ν t is the turbulence eddy viscosity in this study ν

conditions 2 2 1 computational domain setting the computational domain for the propagation of solitary waves in the near shore area is shown in fig 1 in which the seabed is simplified to a uniform slope in the figure h is the incident wave height h is the still water depth at the plane bed l is the wave length α is the angle of beach slope x z are the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively 2 2 2 initial and boundary conditions in the computational domain the piston type wave maker is located on the left and the nonlinear algorithms developed by goring 1978 are used to generate solitary waves the origin of coordinates is located at the still water surface on the left and the wave propagates from left to right the boundaries of the computational domain include the free surface on the top a solid no slip wall at the bottom and on the right at the initial time the water velocities in the whole computational zone are set to zero 2 2 3 mesh description the quadrilateral grids are used in the simulation and are parallel to the bottom as shown in fig 2 the influence of grid size on the computational results was investigated we tested three different meshes with different uniform grid sizes which are defined as m1 m2 and m3 the detailed information on meshes and computational results are shown in table 1 in contrast to solitary waves on slopes chang et al 2009 the computed wave surface elevations with the coarsest grid m1 are generally smaller than the experimental results the numerical results of m2 and m3 are closer to the experimental results to balance the calculation precision and speed the mesh size of δ x l 290 and δ y h 17 m2 is adopted the optimization of the time step δt is subject to the courant number constraint c r g h δ t δ x 1 2 3 numerical schemes and model validation 2 3 1 numerical schemes eqs 1 and 2 are solved numerically by a two step projection method with finite volume spatial discretization issa 1986 the linear least square reconstruction method is adopted to evaluate gradients at cell centers barth 1992 time derivative is discretized by the forward time difference method first and second order accuracy is obtained for the temporal and spatial terms respectively the volume of fluid vof method is employed for tracing or capturing the free surface hirt and nichols 1981 the governing equation is as follows 5 f t u i f x i 0 where f is the volume fraction which is defined as 6 f x t 0 air 0 f 1 interface 1 water the piecewise linear interface calculation plic method is utilized to solve the vof governing equation youngs 1982 it assumes that the interface between the two fluids air and water has a linear slope within each cell and uses this linear shape for calculation of the advection of fluid through the cell faces 2 3 2 model validation the theoretical solution of a solitary wave profile and the experiments conducted by chang et al 2009 are used to validate the accuracy of the wave generation and the process of wave run up on the sloping beach a reference location to monitor the wave profiles is set up ahead of the sloping bottom with a finite distance of l shown in fig 1 which is the horizontal distance from solitary wave crest to a point where the amplitude is 5 of the wave height as suggested by synolakis 1986 to validate the modeling accuracy for solitary wave generation a reference gauge was placed to monitor the wave surface elevation at a distance from the beach toe based on the definition given by synolakis 1987 in this location the flow property is close to the potential flow and the nonlinear effects and viscosity have a little effect on wave propagation the comparison between the solitary wave profile obtained by the simulation and the first order theory of grimshaw 1971 is shown in fig 3 in which the wave surface elevation η is normalized by still water depth h and the time t is normalized by g h it shows that the computed solitary wave surface is a little smaller than the theoretical result because of energy dissipation in addition small variations at the tail are found which is due to the algorithm restriction of wave generation camfield 1998 overall fig 3 confirms that the solitary waves are well numerically generated the simulation results are also compared with the experimental data from chang et al 2009 in the experiment the relative wave height h h is 0 235 the still water depth h is 1 75 m and the beach slope is 1 20 four gauges were installed at x h 18 29 28 59 38 29 and 40 59 corresponding to x 1 x 4 shown in fig 1 to monitor the time histories of wave surface elevations in the process of propagation x 1 x h 18 29 and x 3 x h 38 29 are the locations of sloping beach toe and still water boundary respectively figs 4 and 5 show the comparisons between computed and experimental wave elevations it can be seen that the numerical results agree well with the experimental results which demonstrates that the present model is capable of accurately simulating the propagation and transformation of solitary waves in the near shore area 3 simulations and analysis of the wave propagation in the near shore 3 1 computational conditions solitary wave is widely used as an initial wave in the near shore to study the problems such as wave breaking hsiao et al 2008 adityawan et al 2013 sediment transport alsina et al 2009 sumer et al 2011 etc in our work we focused on the wave deformation and its hydrodynamics when the wave moves up to the sloped beach and solitary wave is supposed as an initially incoming wave the factors influencing the propagation of solitary wave in the near shore include the incident wave height h water depth h and the offshore bottom topography γ considering the influence of various factors a total of 37 runs have been simulated which are listed in table 2 herein the wave characteristic is expressed by the wave height to water depth ratio and the range of the values is h h 0 10 0 46 the seabed in the near shore is simplified to a uniform slope and the range of the values is γ 1 60 5 3 2 wave profiles the time histories of wave surface elevations at different locations under the conditions of h h 0 10 0 22 on γ 1 20 and γ 2 slopes are plotted in figs 6 and 7 respectively the locations to monitor the time histories of wave surface elevations are from the sloping beach toe to the positions above the still water boundary x h 20 γ 1 20 and γ 2 is the location of the slope toe and x h 40 γ 1 20 and x h 20 5 γ 2 are the locations of the still water boundary fig 6 shows that the incident wave keeps an almost symmetric form in the constant water depth region fig 6 a b as the wave shoals on the slope the wave gradually transforms in shape that approximates to a triangle fig 6 c f the wave elevation gradually increases and reaches the maximum at x h 36 with the value of η h 0 29 fig 6 f then the solitary wave height decreases significantly fig 6 g l it shows that the higher the incident wave leads the earlier the wave breaking by comparing the time histories of wave elevations for h h 0 10 and h h 0 22 fig 7 shows that the wave keeps an almost symmetric form in the whole process of propagation fig 7 b f which is different from the wave transformation for γ 1 20 due to the superposition of the incident wave and reflected wave the wave surface elevation increases and the maximum relative wave elevation is η h 0 45 for h h 0 22 which is larger than that in fig 6 additionally the wave crest occurs twice at x h 15 33 because of wave run down in fig 7 a figs 8 and 9 present the wave profiles at different times in the process of propagation under the conditions of the relative wave height h h 0 10 0 22 on γ 1 20 and γ 2 slopes respectively in fig 8 it illustrates that the wave crest is the same with that in the constant water depth region when the wave reaches the toe of the slope i e x h 20 at t g h 25 56 shown in fig 8 a afterwards the solitary wave shoals on the slope and the wave front becomes steeper and eventually the wave breaks at breaking the front face becomes vertical and then the wave height decreases significantly fig 8 g the breaking wave runs up continuously along the beach fig 8 h and reaches to the highest position because the beach slope is relatively steep in this condition the wave runs up on the slope without breaking fig 9 3 3 breaking criteria the maximum run up height of the wave r max is defined as the height from the still water level to the highest position where the wave arrives on the slope fig 10 shows the influence of the relative incident wave height h h and the beach slope γ on the maximum run up height of the solitary wave in fig 10 a it shows that r max h increases with the increasing incident wave height h h on a given beach slope when the beach slope is milder e g γ 1 60 1 20 the steeper the beach slope the greater the growth rate of the maximum run up height for the other cases the growth rate of the maximum run up height decreases slightly with increasing beach slope fig 10 b presents that r max h increases with γ for breaking wave conditions corresponding to mild beach slope e g γ 1 60 1 10 when the beach slope is steeper e g γ 1 4 7 5 breaking wave cannot occur on the slope and r max h decreases with the beach slope it illustrates that only γ 1 4 7 the solitary wave may break on the slope which is the same as the experimental results of camfield and street 1969 the breaking criteria the limit between wave breaking and non breaking conditions based on the calculation of this paper is described by eq 7 which is shown as a solid line in fig 10 b 7 h h 2 2 γ 10 9 many studies have attempted to define breaking criteria for solitary wave run up on plane slopes on the basis of nonlinear shallow water equations synolakis 1986 suggested that the waves would break during run up if 8 h h 0 8183 γ 10 9 grilli et al 1997 proposed breaking criteria for a solitary wave on a slope based on the potential flow equations which was determined as eq 9 9 h h 16 9 γ 2 the comparison of the different breaking criterions is shown in fig 11 it shows that the present computed results are a little different with the results from grilli et al 1997 for the same slope γ eq 7 predicts that smaller waves will break than eq 9 for most conditions this demonstrates the effects of fluid viscosity and curl term in the sloped beach where wave flow depth becomes shallow while the result from grilli et al 1997 is based on the fully nonlinear potential flow theory in which the viscosity and curl of the fluid are ignored and the slopes of grilli et al 1997 is from γ 1 100 to γ 1 8 which is in the range of γ 1 4 7 however our results based on the slopes from γ 1 60 to γ 5 in which both γ 1 4 7 and γ 1 4 7 are included it adds the applicability of the breaking criterion furthermore the wave breaks on a given slope predicted by synolakis 1986 is much smaller which could be expected as a result of the wave steepening occurring in the nondispersive nonlinear shallow water equations grilli et al 1997 4 the wave hydrodynamic characteristics in the wave propagation 4 1 the velocity and vorticity fields in the propagation of a solitary wave the maximum velocity and vorticity when the wave crest reaches different locations are defined as v 0m and w 0m respectively fig 12 presents the normalized maximum velocity v 0 m n v o m g h for the wave of h h 0 22 on different beach slopes it can be seen that under the conditions of wave breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 60 1 10 v 0 m n increases firstly and then decreases in the process of wave propagation in the process of wave breaking the wave steepens and the vertical fluid velocities in wave front increase rapidly which results in the increase of the maximum velocity correspondingly after wave breaks the wave rapidly collapses into a turbulent bore and the fluid velocities increase the maximum value can reach 3 5 times of the value in the flat bed then the wave runs up on the slope and the kinetic energy is converted to the potential energy with energy dissipation which leads to the fluid velocities decrease however under the conditions of wave non breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 4 7 5 there is no obvious change on the v 0 m n in the process of wave propagation because of the steep beach slope fig 13 presents the variation of the maximum vorticity w 0m in the wave propagation with the same conditions and locations as in fig 12 it shows similar trends as the v 0 m n due to the great variation of the maximum velocity and vorticity under the conditions of wave breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 60 1 10 the velocity and vorticity fields at different times for the wave of h h 0 22 on a γ 1 20 slope are extracted to analyze shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively each of them includes six moments t g h 26 58 t g h 35 68 t g h 41 94 t g h 42 96 t g h 43 99 and t g h 49 33 the first two moments correspond to the time before wave breaking and the last four moments correspond to the wave breaking process and wave run up on the slope respectively in fig 14 the crest of the solitary wave arrives at the toe of the slope when t g h 26 58 at the same time the wave keeps an almost symmetric form and the maximum velocity is at the wave crest see fig 14 a then the wave starts to climb up the slope and the wave amplitude increases significantly due to shoaling effect and the wave height reaches the largest at t g h 41 94 in the process of wave shoaling the vertical velocity increases greatly and the location of the maximum fluid velocity moves to the wave front e g fig 14 b c afterwards the wave breaks and collapses into a turbulent bore leading to the decrease of wave surface elevation the fluid velocity in vertical begins to decrease whereas the resultant velocity magnitude continues to increase due to the increase of horizontal velocity e g fig 14 d e finally the wave runs up on the slope herein the fluid velocities in the wave front are large and the direction of the resultant velocity is parallel to the slope as shown in fig 14 f fig 15 shows that the maximum vorticity is located near the seabed beneath the wave crest before wave breaking e g fig 15 a b as the wave shoals on the slope the value of vorticity increases and the vorticity in the wave front becomes larger e g fig 15 c then the maximum vorticity moves to wave front and the value increases continuously because of wave breaking e g fig 15 d e afterwards the value of vorticity decreases in the process of wave run up in this condition it can be seen that the wave surface becomes very steep and scrolls down like a tongue afterwards this phenomenon conforms to the characteristic of plunging breaker meanwhile the value of s 0 1 521 r h h is 0 162 belonging to the type of plunging breaking according to grill et al 1997 4 2 the influence of beach slope on hydrodynamic characteristic 4 2 1 the influence of beach slope on velocity and vorticity the maximum velocity and vorticity in the whole process of wave propagation for different beach slopes defined as v m v 0m max and w m w 0m max is extracted and plotted in the following fig 16 and fig 17 respectively fig 16 shows when the beach slope satisfies the conditions of wave breaking e g h h 0 10 γ 1 60 1 20 or h h 0 22 0 37 γ 1 60 1 10 the normalized maximum velocity v m n v m g h increases with increasing slope while the beach slope satisfies the conditions of wave non breaking e g h h 0 10 γ 1 10 5 or h h 0 22 0 37 γ 1 4 7 5 v m n decreases with increasing slope furthermore the value of v m n for the breaking wave condition is larger than that for non breaking wave condition and v m n increases with the incident wave height h h on the same beach slope with respect to the maximum vorticity w m the distribution and variation can be found in fig 17 which shows similar trends as v m n it illustrates that wave breaking has a significant influence on the velocity field and vorticity which plays an important role in the study of the mechanism of sediment transport and coastal evolution 4 2 2 the influence of beach slope on turbulence in the turbulent model of eq 3 the convective term u j k x j which is denoted herein by a k diffusion term x j υ t σ k υ k x j which is denoted herein by b and turbulent production term g are analyzed the maximum values of these terms when the wave crest reaches different locations are defined as a k0m b 0m and g 0m fig 18 presents the value of the convection a k0m diffusion b 0m and turbulence energy production g 0m for the condition of h h 0 22 and γ 1 20 it illustrates that all the values increase firstly and then decrease with x h in the wave propagation the maximum value in the whole process of wave propagation occurs near the still water boundary x h 40 when the solitary wave has broken afterwards the convection and turbulent kinetic energy of the fluid decrease until to a small value in order to quantitatively analyze the effects of the beach slope on the above three terms the maximum values of those terms in the whole process of wave propagation which are defined as a km a k0m max b m b 0m max and g m g 0m max are extracted the data of the three terms for the incident wave height h h 0 22 on different beach slopes are summarized and plotted in fig 19 it can been seen that if the beach slope satisfies the conditions for wave breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 60 1 10 the values of a km b m and g m increase with increasing beach slope otherwise the values of a km b m and g m decrease with increasing beach slope and are smaller than that for wave breaking fig 20 shows the ratio of turbulence energy production to diffusion g m b m and the ratio of the turbulent energy convection to the diffusion a km b m against the beach slope it is discovered that the convection and the production terms in the governing equations dominate the wave evolution for the conditions of wave breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 60 1 10 whereas for the conditions of wave non breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 4 7 5 the diffusion term becomes more and more dominant with increasing beach slope 4 2 3 the influence of beach slope on the terms in rans equations the breaking criterion proposed by grilli et al 1997 is based on the nonlinear potential flow equations in which the viscosity and curl of the fluid are ignored in order to quantitatively analyze the contribution of the terms neglected in the potential flow model the nonlinearity term associated with the curl c l u j u j x i u i x j and the viscous stresses τ ν ν u i x j x j are discussed the nonlinearity term cl is separated from the convective term in the rans equation i e u j u i x j in addition the reynolds stresses τ t u i u j x j is also analyzed to explore its influence on the turbulence simulation the maximum values of the three terms at the different locations for h h 0 22 and γ 1 20 are extracted and plotted in fig 21 it is discovered that the curl cl 0m contributes most to the wave evolution in the near shore for the cases of wave breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 60 1 10 and the value of cl 0m increases firstly and then decreases with x h obviously while the reynolds stress τ t 0 m becomes less important to a certain extent and the value of τ ν 0 m is the smallest o 10 4 o 10 3 after the solitary wave breaks on the beach slope x h 38 the velocity and the turbulent intensity will increase rapidly thus the value of cl 0m τ t 0 m and τ ν 0 m increase significantly fig 22 shows the effects of the beach slope on the maximum value of cl m τ t m and τ ν m in the whole process of wave propagation for the cases with h h 0 22 when the beach slope satisfies the conditions for wave breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 60 1 10 the values of cl m τ t m and τ ν m increase with beach slope when the beach slope satisfies the conditions for wave non breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 4 7 5 the values of cl m τ t m and τ ν m decrease with increasing beach slope and are smaller than that for wave breaking fig 23 shows that the ratio of curl to reynolds stresses c l m τ t m increases with beach slope for the conditions of wave breaking e g h h 0 10 γ 1 60 1 20 or h h 0 22 0 37 γ 1 60 1 10 and the value of c l m τ t m is larger than 2 in these conditions the cl m becomes more and more important with increasing beach slope under the conditions of wave non breaking e g h h 0 10 γ 1 10 5 or h h 0 22 0 37 γ 1 4 7 5 the value of c l m τ t m decreases with the increasing beach slope that is to say the effect of the reynolds stresses τ t m becomes more and more important with increasing beach slope therefore the influence of turbulent fluctuations i e the reynolds stresses in these conditions will become more significant 5 conclusion the run up and hydrodynamic characteristics of solitary waves with different beach slopes were numerically simulated based upon the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and k ε turbulence model this model is validated with experiment results from literature the effects of the beach slope and the relative incident wave height on the wave run up and hydrodynamic characteristics were discussed the following conclusions are drawn 1 it has been verified by the experiment that the rans equations used in this paper can simulate wave breaking well in the process of wave run up in the near shore 2 the breaking criteria of solitary wave based on the present numerical results is proposed which predicts that a little smaller waves will break than that obtained by grilli et al 1997 based on the nonlinear potential flow equations 3 the velocity and vorticity are influenced significantly by wave breaking in the near shore for the conditions of wave breaking the maximum velocity and vorticity can reach 3 5 times of the value in the flat bed while for the conditions of wave non breaking the variation of velocity and vorticity in wave propagation is not obvious 4 in the k ε model the turbulent production and convection terms contribute most to the wave evolution and increase with the beach slope and incident wave height for the conditions of wave breaking by contrast the turbulent production and convection terms decrease significantly with the beach slope for the conditions of wave non breaking 5 by comparison the nonlinearity term associated with the curl ignored by the potential flow equations contributes most to the wave evolution and the reynolds stress term comes second for the conditions of wave breaking however the reynolds stress gradually dominates the wave evolution with increasing beach slope for the conditions of wave non breaking the quantitative contributions of these terms are related to the parameters of beach slope and incident wave height acknowledgement this research was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51578062 
23147,the propagation and transformation of water waves in the near shore region lead complicated wave current field which plays a significant role in the study of the mechanism of sediment transport and coastal evolution solitary wave is supposed as an initially incoming wave because of its widespread use in the near shore the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations were incorporated into a k ε turbulence model and applied to simulate the run up and hydrodynamic characteristics of solitary waves under the influences of different incident wave height and beach slope the simulation results were validated with theoretical and experimental results from the literature the effects of the non linear terms associated with the curl of the fluid reynolds stresses and viscous stresses in the governing equations of fluid as well as the turbulent production term convection term and diffusion term in the k ε model were analyzed the analysis shows that wave breaking is of great importance to the hydrodynamic characteristics of the wave current field in the near shore the run up heights of breaking solitary waves increase with beach slope and the velocity and vorticity reach the maximum after wave breaking the non linear curl and convection terms and turbulent production term contribute most to the nonlinearities of the near shore hydrodynamics and increase with beach slope under these conditions nevertheless under the conditions of wave non breaking the wave run up height the maximum of velocity and vorticity decrease with increasing beach slope meanwhile the effects of fluid diffusion and reynolds stresses increase gradually with increasing beach slope keywords wave run up hydrodynamic characteristics beach slope reynolds averaged navier stokes equations solitary wave 1 introduction in the process of wave propagation in the coastal region the wave surface steepens with increasing wave height and may eventually become unstable and broken it causes the wave current field in the near shore region to become more complicated which greatly affects the morphological changes of coastal areas and offshore structures choi et al 2015 kamath et al 2016 therefore it is required to accurately describe the run up and hydrodynamic characteristics of waves in the process of propagation in the near shore region wave run up is one of the important parts of the wave propagation in the near shore area extensive studies on the wave run up have been reported including the theories synolakis 1987 li and raichlen 2001 carrier et al 2003 kânoĝlu 2004 experiments hsiao et al 2008 chang et al 2009 sælevik et al 2013 drähne et al 2016 and numerical simulations ma et al 2007 fuhrman and madsen 2008 chio et al 2008 lara et al 2011 tsung et al 2012 which are appropriate for breaking ai and jin 2012 and non breaking kuiry et al 2012 waves synolakis 1987 proposed a formula to calculate wave run up height for non breaking solitary waves based on shallow water equations which indicates that the run up height decreases with increasing beach slope however the calculated results are larger than the measured values sriram et al 2016 li and raichlen 2001 proposed a nonlinear theoretical solution for wave run up using the carrier and greenspan 1958 transformation and the calculation results are better than that obtained by synolakis 1987 the run up height of the breaking wave is different from that of the non breaking wave synolakis 1987 hsiao et al 2008 indicated that the run up height increases with beach slope for breaking solitary waves the breaking criterion plays a significant role in the calculation of wave run up height many studies have attempted to define breaking criteria for solitary wave run up on plane slopes camfield and street 1969 synolakis 1986 grilli et al 1997 synolakis 1986 predicted much smaller wave height for breaking on a given slope grilli et al 1997 developed the breaking criteria based on the potential equations however some non linear terms are neglected which may be not appropriate in some certain conditions qi et al 2017 it is necessary to study the hydrodynamic characteristics before and after wave breaking in the process of wave propagation under different conditions chen et al 2011 peregrine and williamss 2001 pringle et al 2016 li and raichlen 2002 found that the energy dissipation is closely associated with wave breaking mo 2013 focused on the wave transformation and the characteristic of velocity field in the wave propagation hsieh 2016 studied the spatial variation of the hydrodynamic factors including vorticity convection term and turbulent production term however the influence of the beach slope on the wave transformation and hydrodynamic characteristics in the near shore area was not concerned this study presents the numerical investigations of the run up and hydrodynamic characteristics of solitary waves influenced by the incident wave height and beach slope the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations coupled with a k ε turbulence model are applied to simulate the wave run up on beach slopes then the evolution of the velocity field and vorticity in the wave propagation are studied furthermore the effects of the beach slope on the nonlinear terms in the rans equations and k ε model are analyzed 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equations wave deformation wave breaking and wave induced current in the near shore play important roles on the coastal topography evolution and offshore engineering on which a lot literature discussed using non potential flow models choi et al 2008 lara et al 2011 smit et al 2013 solitary wave in the near shore approaching to and climbing up the sloped beach the wave front becomes steeper and eventually the wave breaks in this process the velocity gradient becomes strong and the effects of viscosity and curl of the fluid play an important role in the near shore therefore the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations calculating the time averaged components of the flow are used to simulate the propagation of solitary waves on a uniform sloping beach in a two dimensional fluid domain the governing equations for an incompressible fluid are expressed as follows 1 continuty equation u i x i 0 2 momentum equation u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i g i x j υ u i x j u i u j where i and j are the cyclic coordinates in an orthogonal coordinate system whose values are 1 and 2 while u i are the time averaged velocity components ρ is the density of the fluid p is the pressure g i is the gravitational acceleration u i u j denotes the turbulent reynolds stresses which can be expressed as u i u j ν t u i x j u j x i 2 3 k δ i j where ν t is the turbulence eddy viscosity in this study ν

conditions 2 2 1 computational domain setting the computational domain for the propagation of solitary waves in the near shore area is shown in fig 1 in which the seabed is simplified to a uniform slope in the figure h is the incident wave height h is the still water depth at the plane bed l is the wave length α is the angle of beach slope x z are the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively 2 2 2 initial and boundary conditions in the computational domain the piston type wave maker is located on the left and the nonlinear algorithms developed by goring 1978 are used to generate solitary waves the origin of coordinates is located at the still water surface on the left and the wave propagates from left to right the boundaries of the computational domain include the free surface on the top a solid no slip wall at the bottom and on the right at the initial time the water velocities in the whole computational zone are set to zero 2 2 3 mesh description the quadrilateral grids are used in the simulation and are parallel to the bottom as shown in fig 2 the influence of grid size on the computational results was investigated we tested three different meshes with different uniform grid sizes which are defined as m1 m2 and m3 the detailed information on meshes and computational results are shown in table 1 in contrast to solitary waves on slopes chang et al 2009 the computed wave surface elevations with the coarsest grid m1 are generally smaller than the experimental results the numerical results of m2 and m3 are closer to the experimental results to balance the calculation precision and speed the mesh size of δ x l 290 and δ y h 17 m2 is adopted the optimization of the time step δt is subject to the courant number constraint c r g h δ t δ x 1 2 3 numerical schemes and model validation 2 3 1 numerical schemes eqs 1 and 2 are solved numerically by a two step projection method with finite volume spatial discretization issa 1986 the linear least square reconstruction method is adopted to evaluate gradients at cell centers barth 1992 time derivative is discretized by the forward time difference method first and second order accuracy is obtained for the temporal and spatial terms respectively the volume of fluid vof method is employed for tracing or capturing the free surface hirt and nichols 1981 the governing equation is as follows 5 f t u i f x i 0 where f is the volume fraction which is defined as 6 f x t 0 air 0 f 1 interface 1 water the piecewise linear interface calculation plic method is utilized to solve the vof governing equation youngs 1982 it assumes that the interface between the two fluids air and water has a linear slope within each cell and uses this linear shape for calculation of the advection of fluid through the cell faces 2 3 2 model validation the theoretical solution of a solitary wave profile and the experiments conducted by chang et al 2009 are used to validate the accuracy of the wave generation and the process of wave run up on the sloping beach a reference location to monitor the wave profiles is set up ahead of the sloping bottom with a finite distance of l shown in fig 1 which is the horizontal distance from solitary wave crest to a point where the amplitude is 5 of the wave height as suggested by synolakis 1986 to validate the modeling accuracy for solitary wave generation a reference gauge was placed to monitor the wave surface elevation at a distance from the beach toe based on the definition given by synolakis 1987 in this location the flow property is close to the potential flow and the nonlinear effects and viscosity have a little effect on wave propagation the comparison between the solitary wave profile obtained by the simulation and the first order theory of grimshaw 1971 is shown in fig 3 in which the wave surface elevation η is normalized by still water depth h and the time t is normalized by g h it shows that the computed solitary wave surface is a little smaller than the theoretical result because of energy dissipation in addition small variations at the tail are found which is due to the algorithm restriction of wave generation camfield 1998 overall fig 3 confirms that the solitary waves are well numerically generated the simulation results are also compared with the experimental data from chang et al 2009 in the experiment the relative wave height h h is 0 235 the still water depth h is 1 75 m and the beach slope is 1 20 four gauges were installed at x h 18 29 28 59 38 29 and 40 59 corresponding to x 1 x 4 shown in fig 1 to monitor the time histories of wave surface elevations in the process of propagation x 1 x h 18 29 and x 3 x h 38 29 are the locations of sloping beach toe and still water boundary respectively figs 4 and 5 show the comparisons between computed and experimental wave elevations it can be seen that the numerical results agree well with the experimental results which demonstrates that the present model is capable of accurately simulating the propagation and transformation of solitary waves in the near shore area 3 simulations and analysis of the wave propagation in the near shore 3 1 computational conditions solitary wave is widely used as an initial wave in the near shore to study the problems such as wave breaking hsiao et al 2008 adityawan et al 2013 sediment transport alsina et al 2009 sumer et al 2011 etc in our work we focused on the wave deformation and its hydrodynamics when the wave moves up to the sloped beach and solitary wave is supposed as an initially incoming wave the factors influencing the propagation of solitary wave in the near shore include the incident wave height h water depth h and the offshore bottom topography γ considering the influence of various factors a total of 37 runs have been simulated which are listed in table 2 herein the wave characteristic is expressed by the wave height to water depth ratio and the range of the values is h h 0 10 0 46 the seabed in the near shore is simplified to a uniform slope and the range of the values is γ 1 60 5 3 2 wave profiles the time histories of wave surface elevations at different locations under the conditions of h h 0 10 0 22 on γ 1 20 and γ 2 slopes are plotted in figs 6 and 7 respectively the locations to monitor the time histories of wave surface elevations are from the sloping beach toe to the positions above the still water boundary x h 20 γ 1 20 and γ 2 is the location of the slope toe and x h 40 γ 1 20 and x h 20 5 γ 2 are the locations of the still water boundary fig 6 shows that the incident wave keeps an almost symmetric form in the constant water depth region fig 6 a b as the wave shoals on the slope the wave gradually transforms in shape that approximates to a triangle fig 6 c f the wave elevation gradually increases and reaches the maximum at x h 36 with the value of η h 0 29 fig 6 f then the solitary wave height decreases significantly fig 6 g l it shows that the higher the incident wave leads the earlier the wave breaking by comparing the time histories of wave elevations for h h 0 10 and h h 0 22 fig 7 shows that the wave keeps an almost symmetric form in the whole process of propagation fig 7 b f which is different from the wave transformation for γ 1 20 due to the superposition of the incident wave and reflected wave the wave surface elevation increases and the maximum relative wave elevation is η h 0 45 for h h 0 22 which is larger than that in fig 6 additionally the wave crest occurs twice at x h 15 33 because of wave run down in fig 7 a figs 8 and 9 present the wave profiles at different times in the process of propagation under the conditions of the relative wave height h h 0 10 0 22 on γ 1 20 and γ 2 slopes respectively in fig 8 it illustrates that the wave crest is the same with that in the constant water depth region when the wave reaches the toe of the slope i e x h 20 at t g h 25 56 shown in fig 8 a afterwards the solitary wave shoals on the slope and the wave front becomes steeper and eventually the wave breaks at breaking the front face becomes vertical and then the wave height decreases significantly fig 8 g the breaking wave runs up continuously along the beach fig 8 h and reaches to the highest position because the beach slope is relatively steep in this condition the wave runs up on the slope without breaking fig 9 3 3 breaking criteria the maximum run up height of the wave r max is defined as the height from the still water level to the highest position where the wave arrives on the slope fig 10 shows the influence of the relative incident wave height h h and the beach slope γ on the maximum run up height of the solitary wave in fig 10 a it shows that r max h increases with the increasing incident wave height h h on a given beach slope when the beach slope is milder e g γ 1 60 1 20 the steeper the beach slope the greater the growth rate of the maximum run up height for the other cases the growth rate of the maximum run up height decreases slightly with increasing beach slope fig 10 b presents that r max h increases with γ for breaking wave conditions corresponding to mild beach slope e g γ 1 60 1 10 when the beach slope is steeper e g γ 1 4 7 5 breaking wave cannot occur on the slope and r max h decreases with the beach slope it illustrates that only γ 1 4 7 the solitary wave may break on the slope which is the same as the experimental results of camfield and street 1969 the breaking criteria the limit between wave breaking and non breaking conditions based on the calculation of this paper is described by eq 7 which is shown as a solid line in fig 10 b 7 h h 2 2 γ 10 9 many studies have attempted to define breaking criteria for solitary wave run up on plane slopes on the basis of nonlinear shallow water equations synolakis 1986 suggested that the waves would break during run up if 8 h h 0 8183 γ 10 9 grilli et al 1997 proposed breaking criteria for a solitary wave on a slope based on the potential flow equations which was determined as eq 9 9 h h 16 9 γ 2 the comparison of the different breaking criterions is shown in fig 11 it shows that the present computed results are a little different with the results from grilli et al 1997 for the same slope γ eq 7 predicts that smaller waves will break than eq 9 for most conditions this demonstrates the effects of fluid viscosity and curl term in the sloped beach where wave flow depth becomes shallow while the result from grilli et al 1997 is based on the fully nonlinear potential flow theory in which the viscosity and curl of the fluid are ignored and the slopes of grilli et al 1997 is from γ 1 100 to γ 1 8 which is in the range of γ 1 4 7 however our results based on the slopes from γ 1 60 to γ 5 in which both γ 1 4 7 and γ 1 4 7 are included it adds the applicability of the breaking criterion furthermore the wave breaks on a given slope predicted by synolakis 1986 is much smaller which could be expected as a result of the wave steepening occurring in the nondispersive nonlinear shallow water equations grilli et al 1997 4 the wave hydrodynamic characteristics in the wave propagation 4 1 the velocity and vorticity fields in the propagation of a solitary wave the maximum velocity and vorticity when the wave crest reaches different locations are defined as v 0m and w 0m respectively fig 12 presents the normalized maximum velocity v 0 m n v o m g h for the wave of h h 0 22 on different beach slopes it can be seen that under the conditions of wave breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 60 1 10 v 0 m n increases firstly and then decreases in the process of wave propagation in the process of wave breaking the wave steepens and the vertical fluid velocities in wave front increase rapidly which results in the increase of the maximum velocity correspondingly after wave breaks the wave rapidly collapses into a turbulent bore and the fluid velocities increase the maximum value can reach 3 5 times of the value in the flat bed then the wave runs up on the slope and the kinetic energy is converted to the potential energy with energy dissipation which leads to the fluid velocities decrease however under the conditions of wave non breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 4 7 5 there is no obvious change on the v 0 m n in the process of wave propagation because of the steep beach slope fig 13 presents the variation of the maximum vorticity w 0m in the wave propagation with the same conditions and locations as in fig 12 it shows similar trends as the v 0 m n due to the great variation of the maximum velocity and vorticity under the conditions of wave breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 60 1 10 the velocity and vorticity fields at different times for the wave of h h 0 22 on a γ 1 20 slope are extracted to analyze shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively each of them includes six moments t g h 26 58 t g h 35 68 t g h 41 94 t g h 42 96 t g h 43 99 and t g h 49 33 the first two moments correspond to the time before wave breaking and the last four moments correspond to the wave breaking process and wave run up on the slope respectively in fig 14 the crest of the solitary wave arrives at the toe of the slope when t g h 26 58 at the same time the wave keeps an almost symmetric form and the maximum velocity is at the wave crest see fig 14 a then the wave starts to climb up the slope and the wave amplitude increases significantly due to shoaling effect and the wave height reaches the largest at t g h 41 94 in the process of wave shoaling the vertical velocity increases greatly and the location of the maximum fluid velocity moves to the wave front e g fig 14 b c afterwards the wave breaks and collapses into a turbulent bore leading to the decrease of wave surface elevation the fluid velocity in vertical begins to decrease whereas the resultant velocity magnitude continues to increase due to the increase of horizontal velocity e g fig 14 d e finally the wave runs up on the slope herein the fluid velocities in the wave front are large and the direction of the resultant velocity is parallel to the slope as shown in fig 14 f fig 15 shows that the maximum vorticity is located near the seabed beneath the wave crest before wave breaking e g fig 15 a b as the wave shoals on the slope the value of vorticity increases and the vorticity in the wave front becomes larger e g fig 15 c then the maximum vorticity moves to wave front and the value increases continuously because of wave breaking e g fig 15 d e afterwards the value of vorticity decreases in the process of wave run up in this condition it can be seen that the wave surface becomes very steep and scrolls down like a tongue afterwards this phenomenon conforms to the characteristic of plunging breaker meanwhile the value of s 0 1 521 r h h is 0 162 belonging to the type of plunging breaking according to grill et al 1997 4 2 the influence of beach slope on hydrodynamic characteristic 4 2 1 the influence of beach slope on velocity and vorticity the maximum velocity and vorticity in the whole process of wave propagation for different beach slopes defined as v m v 0m max and w m w 0m max is extracted and plotted in the following fig 16 and fig 17 respectively fig 16 shows when the beach slope satisfies the conditions of wave breaking e g h h 0 10 γ 1 60 1 20 or h h 0 22 0 37 γ 1 60 1 10 the normalized maximum velocity v m n v m g h increases with increasing slope while the beach slope satisfies the conditions of wave non breaking e g h h 0 10 γ 1 10 5 or h h 0 22 0 37 γ 1 4 7 5 v m n decreases with increasing slope furthermore the value of v m n for the breaking wave condition is larger than that for non breaking wave condition and v m n increases with the incident wave height h h on the same beach slope with respect to the maximum vorticity w m the distribution and variation can be found in fig 17 which shows similar trends as v m n it illustrates that wave breaking has a significant influence on the velocity field and vorticity which plays an important role in the study of the mechanism of sediment transport and coastal evolution 4 2 2 the influence of beach slope on turbulence in the turbulent model of eq 3 the convective term u j k x j which is denoted herein by a k diffusion term x j υ t σ k υ k x j which is denoted herein by b and turbulent production term g are analyzed the maximum values of these terms when the wave crest reaches different locations are defined as a k0m b 0m and g 0m fig 18 presents the value of the convection a k0m diffusion b 0m and turbulence energy production g 0m for the condition of h h 0 22 and γ 1 20 it illustrates that all the values increase firstly and then decrease with x h in the wave propagation the maximum value in the whole process of wave propagation occurs near the still water boundary x h 40 when the solitary wave has broken afterwards the convection and turbulent kinetic energy of the fluid decrease until to a small value in order to quantitatively analyze the effects of the beach slope on the above three terms the maximum values of those terms in the whole process of wave propagation which are defined as a km a k0m max b m b 0m max and g m g 0m max are extracted the data of the three terms for the incident wave height h h 0 22 on different beach slopes are summarized and plotted in fig 19 it can been seen that if the beach slope satisfies the conditions for wave breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 60 1 10 the values of a km b m and g m increase with increasing beach slope otherwise the values of a km b m and g m decrease with increasing beach slope and are smaller than that for wave breaking fig 20 shows the ratio of turbulence energy production to diffusion g m b m and the ratio of the turbulent energy convection to the diffusion a km b m against the beach slope it is discovered that the convection and the production terms in the governing equations dominate the wave evolution for the conditions of wave breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 60 1 10 whereas for the conditions of wave non breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 4 7 5 the diffusion term becomes more and more dominant with increasing beach slope 4 2 3 the influence of beach slope on the terms in rans equations the breaking criterion proposed by grilli et al 1997 is based on the nonlinear potential flow equations in which the viscosity and curl of the fluid are ignored in order to quantitatively analyze the contribution of the terms neglected in the potential flow model the nonlinearity term associated with the curl c l u j u j x i u i x j and the viscous stresses τ ν ν u i x j x j are discussed the nonlinearity term cl is separated from the convective term in the rans equation i e u j u i x j in addition the reynolds stresses τ t u i u j x j is also analyzed to explore its influence on the turbulence simulation the maximum values of the three terms at the different locations for h h 0 22 and γ 1 20 are extracted and plotted in fig 21 it is discovered that the curl cl 0m contributes most to the wave evolution in the near shore for the cases of wave breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 60 1 10 and the value of cl 0m increases firstly and then decreases with x h obviously while the reynolds stress τ t 0 m becomes less important to a certain extent and the value of τ ν 0 m is the smallest o 10 4 o 10 3 after the solitary wave breaks on the beach slope x h 38 the velocity and the turbulent intensity will increase rapidly thus the value of cl 0m τ t 0 m and τ ν 0 m increase significantly fig 22 shows the effects of the beach slope on the maximum value of cl m τ t m and τ ν m in the whole process of wave propagation for the cases with h h 0 22 when the beach slope satisfies the conditions for wave breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 60 1 10 the values of cl m τ t m and τ ν m increase with beach slope when the beach slope satisfies the conditions for wave non breaking e g h h 0 22 γ 1 4 7 5 the values of cl m τ t m and τ ν m decrease with increasing beach slope and are smaller than that for wave breaking fig 23 shows that the ratio of curl to reynolds stresses c l m τ t m increases with beach slope for the conditions of wave breaking e g h h 0 10 γ 1 60 1 20 or h h 0 22 0 37 γ 1 60 1 10 and the value of c l m τ t m is larger than 2 in these conditions the cl m becomes more and more important with increasing beach slope under the conditions of wave non breaking e g h h 0 10 γ 1 10 5 or h h 0 22 0 37 γ 1 4 7 5 the value of c l m τ t m decreases with the increasing beach slope that is to say the effect of the reynolds stresses τ t m becomes more and more important with increasing beach slope therefore the influence of turbulent fluctuations i e the reynolds stresses in these conditions will become more significant 5 conclusion the run up and hydrodynamic characteristics of solitary waves with different beach slopes were numerically simulated based upon the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and k ε turbulence model this model is validated with experiment results from literature the effects of the beach slope and the relative incident wave height on the wave run up and hydrodynamic characteristics were discussed the following conclusions are drawn 1 it has been verified by the experiment that the rans equations used in this paper can simulate wave breaking well in the process of wave run up in the near shore 2 the breaking criteria of solitary wave based on the present numerical results is proposed which predicts that a little smaller waves will break than that obtained by grilli et al 1997 based on the nonlinear potential flow equations 3 the velocity and vorticity are influenced significantly by wave breaking in the near shore for the conditions of wave breaking the maximum velocity and vorticity can reach 3 5 times of the value in the flat bed while for the conditions of wave non breaking the variation of velocity and vorticity in wave propagation is not obvious 4 in the k ε model the turbulent production and convection terms contribute most to the wave evolution and increase with the beach slope and incident wave height for the conditions of wave breaking by contrast the turbulent production and convection terms decrease significantly with the beach slope for the conditions of wave non breaking 5 by comparison the nonlinearity term associated with the curl ignored by the potential flow equations contributes most to the wave evolution and the reynolds stress term comes second for the conditions of wave breaking however the reynolds stress gradually dominates the wave evolution with increasing beach slope for the conditions of wave non breaking the quantitative contributions of these terms are related to the parameters of beach slope and incident

23148,this paper considers three types of method for calculating return periods of individual wave and crest heights the methods considered differ in the assumptions made about serial correlation in wave conditions the long term distribution of individual waves is formed under the assumption that either 1 individual waves 2 the maximum wave height in each sea state or 3 the maximum wave height in each storm are independent events the three types of method are compared using long time series of synthesised storms where the return periods of individual wave heights are known the methods which neglect serial correlation in sea states are shown to produce a positive bias in predicted return values of wave heights the size of the bias is dependent on the shape of the tail of the distribution of storm peak significant wave height with longer tailed distributions resulting in larger biases it is shown that storm based methods give accurate predictions of return periods of individual wave heights in particular a monte carlo storm based method is recommend for calculating return periods of individual wave and crest heights of all the models considered the monte carlo method requires the fewest assumptions about the data the fewest subjective judgements from the user and is simplest to implement keywords wave height crest height long term distribution return period serial correlation 1 introduction estimating the long term statistics of individual wave or crest heights is an important problem in the design of offshore and coastal structures the long term statistics of individual waves are dependent on both the long term distribution of sea states and the short term distribution of wave heights or crests heights conditional on sea state to produce an accurate estimate of the heights of extreme individual waves information from the long term and short term distributions must be combined in an appropriate manner the approaches that have been proposed for combining these distributions are equally applicable to both wave heights and crest heights so to avoid referring to both throughout the text the following discussion is presented in terms of wave heights the simplest approach for estimating extreme individual wave heights at a given exceedance probability e g once in 100 years is to estimate the significant wave height h s at a return period of 100 years then calculate the most probable maximum wave height in that sea state assuming a duration of somewhere between 3 and 6 h see e g hogben 1990 tucker and pitt 2001 there are several problems with this approach firstly the appropriate duration of sea state to use for calculating the most probable maximum wave height is not clear secondly this approach neglects the probability that the largest wave could occur in a sea state other than the 1 in 100 year h s this can lead to significant underestimates in predictions of extremes since there will be several sea states with h s close to the most severe value either within the same storm or in separate storms carter and challenor 1990 to overcome the problems of the simple approach various methods have been proposed to combine the long term and short term distributions that account for the probability of large waves occurring in any sea state battjes 1970 calculated the total number of waves exceeding a level in a given interval and divided this by the total number of waves in the interval to derive an estimate of the long term distribution of all individual wave heights krogstad 1985 proposed a method for calculating the long term distribution of the maximum wave height in an interval derived in terms of the distribution of the maximum wave height in each sea state during the interval see also prevosto et al 2000 krogstad and barstow 2004 various methods have also been proposed for calculating return periods of individual wave heights from the distribution of the maximum wave height in each storm jahns and wheeler 1973 ward et al 1979 haring and heideman 1980 boccotti 1986 2000 forristall et al 1991 tromans and vanderschuren 1995 arena and pavone 2006 fedele and arena 2010 laface and arena 2016 mackay and johanning 2018a b although the assumption is not always explicit in the derivations of each approach the various methods proposed all have the common feature of calculating the distribution of the maximum wave height in a random event where the event is either a storm a sea state or a single wave in the last case the maximum wave height in the event is just the individual wave height long term statistics of individual waves are then calculated from the random event distribution assuming that occurrences of events are independent the assumption of independence of these events is not true in general with records of wave measurements exhibiting serial correlation at multiple scales with correlation between successive individual wave heights sea states and storms in the statistical literature the effect of serial correlation on estimates of extreme values is often quantified using the extremal index which can be introduced as follows suppose that x 1 x n are a sequence of n independent variables with common distribution function f in this case the distribution of the maximum observation is given by pr max x 1 x n x f n x if instead y 1 y n are a stationary process also with common distribution function f but with some level of serial correlation then subject to certain regularity conditions it can be shown that pr max y 1 y n x f θ n x where θ 0 1 is known as the extremal index see e g coles 2001 serial correlation effectively reduces the probability of large observations in a sequence of a given length therefore for processes with θ 1 assuming that observations are independent will lead to a positive bias in the estimates of extreme values some studies have proposed estimating θ explicitly and using this in the estimation of extremes e g fawcett and walshaw 2012 however obtaining a reliable estimate of θ is difficult in practice and subject to considerable uncertainties davis et al 2013 for oceanographic data it is more common to adopt the peaks over threshold scheme which selects events that are approximately independent ensuring that θ 1 jonathan and ewans 2013 the methods proposed by battjes 1970 and krogstad 1985 referred to as the all wave aw and sea state maxima ssm methods respectively from here onwards and the various storm based methods make implicit assumptions about independence between events the aw method assumes that all wave heights are independent the ssm method assumes that sea state maxima are independent and storm based methods assumes that the maximum wave heights in separate storms are independent given the serial correlation in wave height time series the three methods would be expected to give different results with the aw method producing the highest estimates and storm based methods producing the lowest estimates forristall 2008 compared estimates of the long term distribution of individual wave heights from the aw ssm and storm based methods forristall conducted monte carlo simulations of 100 000 years of individual wave heights from synthetic storms assuming that the time series of h s in a storm follows a triangular shape with a fixed relationship between the peak h s and duration of the storm the duration d of the storm was defined to be the time for which h s 0 and a value of d 8 h s p e a k was used where d is in hours the zero crossing period t z was assumed to be constant at 10s and wave heights were assumed to follow a rayleigh distribution it was shown that aw and ssm methods produce a positive bias in estimates of the 100 year wave height consistent with both models neglecting serial correlation effects forristall showed that the storm based method of tromans and vanderschuren 1995 gave the correct return values of individual wave heights when applied to the synthetic triangular storm data with rayleigh distributed wave heights forristall s study provides a useful insight into the differences between various methods for calculating return periods of individual waves however due to the assumptions about the fixed shape of the storms and constant wave period it is difficult to draw conclusions about the accuracy of storm based methods when applied to real data the purpose of this paper is to compare methods for estimating return periods of individual wave heights based on more realistic simulations of synthetic storms where the wave period varies throughout the storm and the temporal evolution of sea state parameters is based on measured data in the current work a block resampling method is used generate random time series of realistic storm histories which are used to compare various methods of estimating return periods of individual wave heights the block resampling method divides a time series of measured wave data into discrete blocks consisting of storms where the peak wave heights can be considered approximately independent the problem of determining time scales over which storm peak wave heights can be considered independent is also discussed in some detail the results presented in this paper also have implications for the estimation of extreme load values on marine structures the full long term response analysis method advocated by some authors e g sagrilo et al 2011 naess and moan 2012 giske et al 2017 is essentially a method for forming the long term distribution of the maximum load in each sea state analogous to the ssm method for wave and crest heights this method is therefore likely to be subject to the same problems associated with neglecting serial correlation in sea states methods for calculating extreme loads which account for serial correlation in sea states have been proposed by other authors e g forristall et al 1991 tromans and vanderschuren 1995 however the focus of this work is on wave and crest heights and the effect of serial correlation on extreme load values is beyond the scope of the paper the paper starts in section 2 with a brief review of how return periods and return values are defined in the context of the various types of long term distributions considered section 3 presents a short discussion of models for the short term distribution of wave and crest heights conditional on sea state section 4 presents the mathematical derivation of the methods for combining the long term and short term distributions and highlights where various assumptions about independence are made either implicitly or explicitly the methods are compared in a simplified example in section 5 which isolates the effects of serial correlation in sea states the methods are then applied to measured data in section 6 providing a quantitative comparison of the effect the various assumptions made in each method in a real situation the accuracy of the methods is compared in section 7 using monte carlo simulations of synthetic storms finally conclusions are presented in section 8 2 return periods return values the methods for estimating the long term distribution of individual wave heights considered in this paper are used to define return periods and return values in slightly different ways it is therefore useful to review how return periods and return values are defined in each context return values are defined in terms of the distribution of the maximum wave height in a year we denote the probability that the maximum individual wave height h m a x does not exceed h in any year selected at random as pr h m a x h 1 year the t year return value of individual wave height h t is then defined as the value which has an exceedance probability 1 t in any year 1 pr h m a x h t 1 year 1 t t 1 the duration t is referred to as the return period and is the average period between exceedances of h t over the last few decades the peaks over threshold pot method has gained popularity over the annual maxima method see jonathan and ewans 2013 for a review of the use of pot in an oceanographic context in this method the distribution of the annual maximum is not estimated explicitly instead the distribution of independent threshold exceedances is estimated if each independent threshold exceedance is described as an event then return values of wave heights can be defined in terms of the distribution of the maximum wave height in a random event as the solution of 2 pr h m a x h t event 1 t m t 1 m where m is the expected number of events per year see e g coles 2001 in the present context the event is either a storm sea state or individual wave the definitions 1 and 2 lead to slightly different return values for low return periods but the differences become negligible at larger return periods this can be seen as follows the distribution of the maximum wave height in a year can be calculated by assuming independence of maxima in each event as 3 pr h m a x h 1 year pr h m a x h event m substituting 3 into 1 and using a taylor series expansion gives 4 pr h m a x h t event 1 1 t 1 m 1 1 t m o 1 t 2 so the two definitions are equivalent for large t in practice the difference is negligible for t 10 so both definitions will be used in the following discussions depending on which is more appropriate 3 short term distribution of wave heights conditional on sea state a sea state σ is defined to be a period of time in which the wave conditions can be considered approximately stationary with the duration normally defined in the range 30 min to 3 h a sea state is defined in terms of the wave spectrum and summarised in terms of spectral parameters such as significant wave height h s 4 m 0 zero up crossing period t z m 0 m 2 mean period t m m 0 m 1 where m n 0 f n s f d f is the n t h moment of the wave frequency spectrum s f the short term distribution of wave heights h conditional on sea state is denoted 5 pr h h σ models for 5 in terms of sea state parameters and water depth is the subject of ongoing research and it is beyond the scope of this work to provide a review of the extensive literature on this topic the focus of this work is on how to combine the short term distribution 5 with the long term distribution of sea states the methods described are applicable to any model for the short term distribution the short term distribution is primarily dependent on h s but is also affected by the water depth wave steepness spectral bandwidth directional spread and currents in the following it is assumed that the model for the short term distribution adequately captures these effects 4 long term distributions 4 1 long term distribution of all wave heights battjes 1970 proposed a method for calculating return values of individual wave heights in terms of the long term distribution of all wave heights the probability that any wave selected at random exceeds height h is calculated as the ratio of the expected number of waves exceeding h per year to the expected number of waves per year the expected number of waves exceeding h in a sea state is 6 m σ h n t z pr h h σ where n t z d σ t z is the expected number of waves in a sea state d σ is the duration of the sea state normally assumed to be somewhere in the region 1 6 h and t z is the zero up crossing period the expected number of waves exceeding h in a year denoted m y r h is calculated by integrating m σ h over the probability of occurrence of sea states and multiplying by the number of sea states per year n p y 7 m y r h n p y 0 0 p h s t z n t z pr h h σ d h s d t z the occurrence of sea states is specified in terms of p h s t z the joint probability density function of h s and t z this implicitly assumes that the short term distribution is only influenced by h s and t z which as discussed in section 3 is not necessarily true the effect of other sea state parameters on the short term distribution could be captured by using the joint density function of multiple parameters however this quickly becomes very complicated as the number of variables is increased in some applications of the aw method the joint density function is used e g hagen et al 2017 however in most applications 7 is simplified as follows to avoid having to model joint distribution the joint density function is written as p h s t z p h s p t z h s and the mean number of waves for a given h s is defined as 8 n h s 0 p t z h s n t z d t z substituting this back into 7 gives 9 m y r h n p y 0 p h s n h s pr h h σ h s d h s in this approach all the sea state variables that influence the short term distribution must be modelled as functions of h s in the original aw method proposed by battjes the expected number of waves in any sea state selected at random is calculated as 10 n r 0 p h s n h s d h s the expected number of waves per year is therefore n r n p y and the probability that any wave selected at random exceeds height h is 11 pr h h any wave m y r h n r n p y 1 n r 0 p h s n h s pr h h σ h s d h s the distribution of the annual maximum wave height is then calculated as 12 pr h m a x h 1 year pr h h any wave n r n p y this calculation makes the implicit assumption that individual wave heights are independent which as discussed in the introduction is not true tucker 1989 pointed out that n r is sensitive to the number of waves in low sea states and that it seems counter intuitive that this should influence the extreme values tucker noted that the t year return value of individual wave height is the value of h for which the expected number of waves exceeding h per year is m y r h 1 t the annual distribution can therefore be calculated directly from 1 and 9 as 13 pr h m a x h 1 year 1 m y r h 1 n p y 0 pr h h σ h s p h s n h s d h s note that this definition is only valid for m y r h 1 although it is not immediately obvious from 13 tucker s expression for the annual distribution implicitly assumes that individual wave heights are uncorrelated expanding the original battjes expression 11 as a taylor series we have 14 pr h m a x h 1 year pr h h any wave n r n p y 1 m y r h n r n p y n r n p y 1 m y r h o m y r h 2 in tucker s definition m y r h 1 t so for large t the terms of order m y r h 2 are negligible and the two expressions are equivalent therefore both battjes and tucker s expressions for the distribution of the maximum wave height in a year can be thought of as being formed under the assumption that there is no serial correlation in individual wave heights this assumption is discussed further in the following section 4 2 long term distribution of sea state maxima the long term distribution of the maximum wave height in a sea state can be calculated in two ways with one approach based on an average over time and the other based on an average over the probability of occurrence of sea states both methods give equivalent results but it is not immediately obvious to see this from looking at the expressions the temporal average method will be presented first and it will then be shown how it is equivalent to the probabilistic method the distribution of the maximum wave in a sea state is usually calculated by assuming that successive wave heights are independent so that 15 pr h m a x h σ pr h h σ n where n d σ t z is the expected number of waves in the sea state as defined in the previous section in reality consecutive wave and crest heights are correlated with the largest waves occurring in groups naess 1985 showed that for linear waves from a jonswap spectrum the effect of ignoring correlation between successive waves has a negligible influence on the distribution of the maximum wave height fedele 2016 considered the effect of correlation between successive wave crests using the linear model of fedele 2005 and also concluded that correlation could be neglected for typical broadbanded waves from a jonswap spectrum fedele 2016 also noted that for the case of nonlinear waves since the nonlinear harmonics are phase locked to the linear components the dependence between successive crests is unlikely to be affected by nonlinearities janssen 2015 suggested that it is more appropriate to characterise n as a function of the number of wave groups in the record as it is more plausible that the maximum wave height in each group is independent than it is that successive wave heights are independent however this idea has not been pursued in this work the maximum wave heights in successive sea states can be considered independent in the sense that the maximum height is dependent only on the sea state parameters and not the maximum height in adjacent sea states the distribution of the maximum wave height in the time interval 0 a can therefore be written as 16 pr h m a x h 0 a i 1 k pr h m a x h σ τ i i 1 k pr h h σ τ i d σ t z τ i exp i 1 k d σ t z τ i ln pr h h σ τ i where τ i 0 a as the duration of each sea state d σ tends to zero the summation in 16 can be expressed as an integral borgman 1973 17 pr h m a x h 0 a exp 0 a 1 t z t ln pr h h σ t d t equations 16 and 17 give expressions for the distribution of the maximum wave height in an interval 0 a if the time series of sea states is known buy they contain no information about the long term distribution of sea states by applying the ergodic assumption naess 1984 that on average the length of time that sea states are in the interval h s h s d h s during time 0 a is d t a p h s d h s the distribution 17 can be rewritten as krogstad 1985 18 pr h m a x h 0 a exp a 0 1 t z h s p h s ln pr h h σ h s d h s note that in moving from the integral over time to the integral over h s it must be assumed that t z and other sea state parameters can be modelled as taking a mean value conditional on h s without affecting the calculation the application of the ergodic assumption in passing from 17 to 18 effectively counts the proportion of sea states which exceed a threshold level but does not account for temporal clustering of sea states in storms to make this explicit if a d σ then recalling n h s d σ t z h s and using 15 gives 19 pr h m a x h any sea state exp 0 p h s ln pr h m a x h σ h s d h s putting a n p y d σ 1 year gives 20 pr h m a x h 1 year exp n p y 0 p h s ln pr h m a x h σ h s d h s pr h m a x h any sea state n p y so in krogstad s formulation 18 the annual distribution is identical to that formed under the assumption that the maxima in each sea state are independent a distinction should be made between the type of independence assumed to derive 16 and the type of independence assumed in 18 in the derivation of 16 it is assumed that the maximum wave height in each sea state is dependent only on the sea state parameters and not on the maximum height in adjacent sea states in this expression the values of the sea state parameters are assumed to be known such as would be the case for a measured time series of sea states in a storm in 18 the sequence of sea states over the year are not known only their marginal distribution is known by replacing the integral over a known time series of sea states 17 with an integral over the marginal distribution of sea states 18 the implicit assumption is made that there is no serial correlation in sea states this implicit assumption is made clear by equations 19 and 20 as noted in the introduction serial correlation reduces the probability of large observations in a sequence of a given length this effect is not accounted for in the model of krogstad 1985 4 2 1 connection to other formulations krogstad s model can be shown to be equivalent to other expressions for the long term distribution of sea state maxima sagrilo et al 2011 noted that by using taylor series expansions for the exponential and logarithm terms krogstad s expression 18 can be shown to be approximately equal to the probabilistic average using the taylor series expansion for the logarithm ln x x 1 o x 2 and noting that 0 p h s d h s 1 gives 21 pr h m a x h any sea state exp 0 p h s pr h m a x h σ h s d h s 1 note that the approximation ln x x 1 is an identity when x 1 and for the values of h relevant to extremes pr h m a x h σ h s 1 so this approximation of the logarithm term is accurate for this purpose similarly using the taylor series expansion exp x 1 x which is an identity for x 0 and a good approximation in this case gives 22 pr h m a x h any sea state 0 p h s pr h m a x h σ h s d h s this expression given by tucker and pitt 2001 section 6 4 2 is the population mean whereas krogstad s expression 18 is the ergodic mean these two expressions differ slightly for lower values of h but are almost identical for the higher values of h relevant to extremes however krogstad s expression is more accurate to compute as it uses the logarithm of pr h m a x h σ h s krogstad s model can also be related to the aw model as follows taking a n p y d σ 1 year in 18 and using the same linear expansions for the exponential and logarithm terms gives 23 pr h m a x h 1 year 1 n p y 0 p h s n h s pr h h h s 1 d h s which is identical to 13 it is somewhat surprising that the aw and ssm methods result in approximately equivalent expressions for the distribution of the annual maximum wave height however if we consider that both models assume that there is no serial correlation between individual wave heights or sea states then the reason for the equivalence becomes apparent in the examples considered in sections 5 7 the aw and ssm methods show differences for return periods less than 10 years but give nearly identical results for higher return periods 4 3 long term distribution of storm maxima a storm can be thought of as a sequence of sea states where wave heights increase to a peak value and then decrease again the distribution of the maximum wave height in a storm can be calculated using 16 where the time interval 0 a is defined to be the duration of the storm the process of partitioning a time series into separate storms is analogous to defining declustering criteria in the peaks over threshold pot method see coles 2001 the criteria used to define separate storms typically state that the time between the peak h s of two adjacent storms must be larger than some minimum value in some models an additional criterion is used requiring that the minimum h s between two adjacent peaks must be less than some multiple of the lower of the peak the criteria for defining what constitutes separate storms can be defined more rigorously by considering the correlation between successive storm peak wave heights this will be discussed in more detail in section 6 2 for now it is assumed that the time series has been partitioned into discrete blocks constituting storms where the peak wave heights can be considered independent the distribution of the maximum wave height in any storm selected at random denoted pr h m a x h any storm can be estimated in two ways in the first method the distributions of the maximum wave height in the measured storms can be parameterised in some way in terms of a statistically equivalent storm and the long term distribution of storm parameters can be combined with the short term distribution for the storm in a manner that is analogous to the ssm and aw methods alternatively pr h m a x h any storm can be estimated directly from the data using a monte carlo method the two methods are described in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 4 3 1 the equivalent storm method the distribution of the maximum wave height in a measured storm will be denoted pr h m a x h ms and the distribution for the equivalent storm will be denoted pr h m a x h es two types of approach for parameterising pr h m a x h ms have been proposed one approach is to model the temporal evolution of sea states in a storm using some simplified geometric form such as a triangle boccotti 1986 2000 arena and pavone 2006 laface et al 2017 trapezoid martin soldevilla et al 2015 parabola tucker and pitt 2001 section 6 5 4 power law fedele and arena 2010 fedele 2012 arena et al 2014 or exponential law laface and arena 2016 in most of the approaches the parameters of the equivalent storm are fitted using an iterative procedure so that the distribution of the maximum wave height in the equivalent storm is matched as closely as possible to the measured storm although fedele 2012 provided an explicit formula for the duration of the equivalent storm this approach is reasonably effective because the order of sea states in the storm does not affect the distribution of the maximum wave height therefore the product in 16 can be re ordered into a monotonically increasing series of sea states in terms of the values of h s for which a linear power or exponential law is a reasonable fit the drawback of this approach is that only the temporal evolution of h s is modelled it is therefore necessary to establish models for the mean values of t z and other sea state parameters as a function of h s in the same way as for the aw and ssm models the other approach is to model pr h m a x h ms directly and define the equivalent storm as a statistical distribution rather than a time series of h s this approach was adopted by tromans and vanderschuren 1995 who assumed that the square of the maximum wave height in the storm followed a gumbel distribution mackay and johanning 2018a developed this idea and used the generalised extreme value distribution gev to model the distribution of the maximum wave height in a storm they demonstrated that using the gev to model pr h m a x h ms improves the goodness of fit by an order of magnitude compared to both temporal evolution methods and the tromans and vanderschuren tv method moreover the gev model was shown to be more robust than both the tv and temporal evolution methods to uncertainties in the models for the distribution of storm parameters the gev model also results in a much simpler form for pr h m a x h es than temporal evolution methods the tv method is recommend in several metocean design standards iso 2015 dnv gl 2017 and will therefore be considered as a reference model in comparison to the gev model the temporal evolution methods will not be considered further in the tv method the distribution of the maximum wave height in the equivalent storm is defined as 24 pr h m a x h e s exp exp ln n h h m p 2 1 where n is the number of waves in the storm and h m p is the most probable maximum wave height in the storm i e the mode of pr h m a x h ms tromans and vanderschuren 1995 noted that ln n 8 for northern european winter storms but did not state explicitly how they estimated ln n mackay and johanning 2018a considered two options for calculating ln n in the first method ln n was calculated in terms of the moments of pr h m a x h ms as ln n π h m p 2 std h m a x 2 6 in the second method the value of ln n was determined numerically by finding the value that minimises the difference between pr h m a x h ms and pr h m a x h es quantified in terms of the cramér von mises goodness of fit parameter ω 25 ω 2 0 pr h m a x h ms pr h m a x h es 2 d h it was demonstrated that the second method gave a better fit to the data however the moment based estimators are recommended in dnv gl 2017 and will therefore be used here mackay and johanning 2018a defined the distribution of the maximum wave height in the equivalent storm in terms of the gev as 26 pr h m a x h es exp 1 k h a b 1 k for k 0 exp exp h a b for k 0 where a b and k are the location scale and shape parameters respectively the gev can be fitted to 16 by finding the parameters that minimise ω the first guess for the parameters of the gev is defined by assuming k 0 which from the properties of the gev then implies a h m p and b 6 std h m a x ms π the parameters that minimise ω are then found using a simplex search technique lagarias et al 1998 mackay and johanning 2018a demonstrated that the gev provides an excellent fit to pr h m a x h ms with a bias of less than 0 2 in quantiles up to an exceedance probability of 10 3 meaning that there is very little inaccuracy introduced by parameterising the storm using the gev compared to modelling all sea state variables as directly related to h s once each measured storm has been fitted with an equivalent storm the distribution of the maximum wave height in a random storm can be calculated using the law of total probability by integrating pr h m a x h es over the long term joint density function of storm parameters in a manner analogous to the ssm model 22 in the case of the tv model ln n is assumed to be constant and the mean value over all storms is used for the gev model mackay and johanning 2018a showed that the triple integral over the joint density function p a b k could be reduced to a single integral over p a using the mean value of k and a linear model b a b a established using regression it was also shown that the gev location parameter a is almost identical to h m p since the mean value of k was close to zero therefore the distribution of the maximum wave height in a random storm can be written in the same way for both the tv and gev models as 27 pr h m a x h any storm p h m p pr h m a x h es d h m p the similarity between 27 the ssm model 22 is clear however one advantage of this form is that no model is required for how other sea state parameters vary with h s the density function p h m p is modelled using the pot method with the generalised pareto distribution gpd fitted to exceedances of h m p above some high threshold the fitting of the gpd and the selection of the threshold is discussed in section 6 3 4 3 2 the monte carlo method monte carlo methods have been applied to the estimation of extreme load statistics for various offshore structures a monte carlo method for estimating the short term mean upcrossing rate of high levels which can be used in place of the short term distribution was presented by naess et al 2007a b this short term mean upcrossing rate was then used in combination with a model for the long term extremes that is equivalent to the ssm method see e g sagrilo et al 2011 which ignores the effects of serial correlation in sea states brown et al 2017 used a monte carlo approach to estimate the extreme response of an fpso in squall conditions brown et al 2017 conducted numerical simulations to create a database of the short term extreme response in squall conditions which was then resampled in order to estimate the long term extreme response mackay and johanning 2018b proposed a storm based monte carlo mc method for calculating return periods of individual wave and crest heights the motivating idea for the method is that if a long time series of individual wave heights were available then pr h m a x h any storm could be estimated directly from the data using a standard pot approach without the need to calculate pr h m a x h ms or fit equivalent storms in the mc method a random realisation of the maximum wave height in each sea state is simulated from the metocean parameter time series and the gpd is fitted to storm peak wave heights exceeding some threshold this gives an estimate of pr h m a x h any storm but subject to a high sampling variability due to the random variability in the storm peak wave heights to account for the random variability in the simulated wave heights this process is repeated n times and the parameters of the fitted gpds are averaged over the n trials to obtain a stable estimate of pr h m a x h any storm mackay and johanning 2018b showed that using n 1000 is sufficient to obtain a stable estimate and noted that the computational time for a 30 year dataset is around 1 min on a standard contemporary laptop the random maxima in each sea state are simulated by generating a sequence of uniformly distributed random variables p i 0 1 i 1 m where m is the number of sea states in the metocean dataset the random maximum wave height in each sea state h m a x i is then obtained from 15 as the solution of 28 p i 1 n i pr h h m a x i σ i where n i d σ t z i as before many models for pr h h σ can be inverted analytically to obtain a closed form solution for the random maximum wave heights however even if this is not possible interpolation of pr h h σ to the desired probability gives a simple means of for calculating the random maximum wave heights the difference between the mc method of brown et al 2017 and that of mackay and johanning 2018b is that in the latter study a new set of random maximum wave heights are generated on each trial via 28 whereas in the former study a pre determined set of load maxima are resampled a threshold must be selected for fitting the gpd to storm peak wave heights selecting a threshold for each iteration of the mc method would be impractical mackay and johanning 2018b recommended that the threshold is selected prior to the mc simulations using the median value of the maximum wave height in each sea state denoted h m e d which is calculated from 28 by setting p i 0 5 in each sea state the median values can then be declustered to select the peak values in each storm and the threshold can be selected following the procedures outlined in section 6 3 the choice of declustering criteria is discussed in section 6 2 the mc method could also be applied to estimate the ssm and aw distributions directly from the data removing the need to model the variation of the short term distribution parameters with h s however for the aw method simulating all waves for each sea state would be very computationally intensive and these ideas are not pursued further here 5 comparison in simplified example there are two main differences between the aw and ssm methods and storm based methods firstly both the aw and ssm methods make the implicit assumption that there is no serial correlation in sea states secondly the aw and ssm methods both require that models are established for the mean values of the short term distribution parameters as a function of h s before comparing the methods in a realistic setting where both of these differences become relevant it is useful to use a simplified example to isolate the effect of serial correlation in sea states in this simplified example it is assumed that individual wave heights follow a rayleigh distribution 29 pr h h h s 1 exp 2 h h s 2 it is also assumed that the wave period is constant at t z 10 s so that the distribution of the maximum wave height in a sea state is dependent only on h s suppose that the time series of h s is composed of discrete independent storms each comprising a fixed number n consecutive sea states the number of storms per year is m n p y n where n p y is the number of sea states per year we further assume that h s is constant during each storm so that the marginal distribution of h s is equal to the distribution of storm peak h s for the sea state based model the distribution of the maximum wave height in a year is calculated from 22 as 30 pr h m a x h 1 year 0 p h s pr h m a x h h s d h s n m for the storm based model the distribution of the maximum wave height in a year can be calculated by integrating the distribution of the maximum wave height in a storm conditional on storm peak h s over the distribution of storm peak h s which is equal to the marginal distribution of h s in this example which gives 31 pr h m a x h 1 year 0 p h s pr h m a x h h s n d h s m comparison of 30 and 31 shows that the assumptions about independence of sea states and storms lead to differing expressions for the distribution of the annual maximum wave height to quantify the difference between the two models we assume that sea states have a 1 h duration storms consist of n 100 sea states and there are n p y 8760 sea states per year we also assume that h s follows a weibull distribution 32 pr h s x 1 exp x α β where α β 2 fig 1 shows the distributions of the annual maximum wave heights from the sea state 30 and storm based models 31 for this simple example results from the aw model 13 are also included for comparison as expected from 23 the aw and ssm models give almost identical results for lower exceedance probabilities the aw and ssm method predicts larger wave heights than the storm method at a given exceedance level i e larger return values but the difference decreases at lower exceedance probabilities i e larger return periods in this example the difference is due only to the differing assumptions about independence of sea states and storms the results are consistent with the observation made in the introduction that neglecting serial correlation results in a positive bias in estimates of extreme values strictly speaking we have only shown that the sea state based model gives larger return values rather than a positive bias however the simulation studies presented in section 7 will show that it is in fact a positive bias the assumptions made in this example are clearly unrealistic in the following two sections it will be shown that biases observed in this artificial example also occur under realistic conditions 6 application to measured data in this section the methods used to fit the models to the data are discussed two sets of measured wave data are used to illustrate the procedures the datasets used are described in section 6 1 the selection of declustering criteria for the storm based methods is discussed in section 6 2 parameter estimation and threshold selection for the gpd are discussed in section 6 3 finally a comparison of return values of individual crest heights calculated using each method is presented in section 6 4 6 1 datasets the datasets used are long term records from wave buoys in two distinct wave climate regimes and are the same as those used in mackay and johanning 2018a the first dataset referred to as site a is from ndbc buoy number 44025 located off the coast of long island new york in a water depth of 36 m the dataset consists of 25 years of hourly records of wave spectra over the period april 1991 december 2016 the second dataset referred to as site b is from ndbc buoy number 46014 located off the coast of northern california in a water depth of 256 m the dataset consists of 35 years of hourly records of wave spectra over the period april 1981 december 2016 scatterplots of h s against t z for the two datasets are shown in fig 2 both datasets have similar maximum observed h s with a maximum h s at site a of 9 64 m and a maximum at site b of 10 34 m in the shallower water site the maximum values of h s occur for the steepest seas with 0 06 s z 0 07 where s z 2 π h s g t z 2 whilst at the deeper site the extreme values of h s occur for a wider range of steepness the range of t z observed at the californian site is also much larger than at the new york site in the examples presented in sections 6 4 and 7 the forristall 2000 model for the short term distribution of crest heights in directionally spread seas will be used to illustrate the application of the long term models the forristall model assumes that crest heights c follow a weibull distribution 33 pr c η σ 1 exp η α h s β the parameters α and β are defined in terms of the significant steepness s m and ursell number u r s defined as 34 s m 2 π h s g t m 2 35 u r s h s k m 2 d 3 where k m is the finite depth wave number corresponding to t m and d is the water depth the distribution parameters are given by 36 α 0 3536 0 2568 s m 0 0800 u r s 37 β 2 1 7912 s m 0 5302 u r s 0 2824 u r s 2 the aw and ssm methods both require models for the mean values of α β and t z as a functions of h s mackay and johanning 2018a fitted linear models for the variation of the mean values of these parameters as a function of h s which are used here as well the reader is referred to mackay and johanning 2018a for details 6 2 selection of declustering criteria the objective of this article is to establish the accuracy of storm based methods for estimating return periods of individual wave heights and contrast this to methods which neglect serial correlation in sea states it is therefore important to consider the correlation structure of sea state time series in some detail and to establish a rigorous method of estimating a minimum separation time between local maxima in the wave height time series for which adjacent maxima can be considered statistically independent most statistical methods developed to quantify dependence between extreme events assume that the time series is stationary time series of h s exhibit a clear seasonal variation in storm peak wave heights which introduces a long range dependence structure between extreme events and a non stationarity in the time series the long range dependence due to seasonal variability is deterministic in origin with the variation having a period of exactly one year the variation can therefore be filtered out and the normalised stationary time series can be examined for shorter range dependence of extreme events using established statistical methods the autocorrelation in storm peak h s is shown in fig 3 for both datasets in this example storm peaks are defined as the maxima within a 5 day moving window the lag shown is the number of storms separating adjacent peaks the median time between storm peaks is 9 79 days for site a and 9 86 days for site b the peaks in autocorrelation function occur around lags of 36 and 72 storms which corresponds to the annual signal the pattern in the autocorrelation in storm peak h s is very similar for these two locations which is due to both datasets being located at similar latitudes where the level of seasonal variability is similar the slight difference between the autocorrelation functions for the two buoys is likely to be due to differences in the distribution of storm lengths and the effects of missing data in time series which has not been accounted for in this simple analysis the seasonal variation in h s can be modelled as 38 h s t m t s t h s s t a t t where h s s t a t t is assumed to be a stationary time series and m t and s t are deterministic periodic functions with period one year representing the mean and standard deviation std of the distribution of h s at a given time in the year see monbet el al 2007 and references therein the functions m t and s t are estimated here using the method of athanassoulis and stefanakos 1995 with the mean and std of h s modelled using low order fourier expansions figs 4 and 5 show the mean and std calculated in 10 day bins throughout the year for each dataset together with a second order fourier expansion of the binned values the pattern in the seasonal variation differs between the two locations but the second order model appears adequate for both locations figs 4 and 5 also show the original data plotted against the day of year and the normalised data h s s t a t together with 90 95 and 99 quantiles calculated in 15 day windows the longer bin length has been used here for stability it appears that the normalised data is approximately stationary for site a but there is some residual trend in the extreme values at site b however as will be shown below the normalisation seems to be sufficient to examine the short range dependence i e on time scales less than seasonal variation in the extreme values fig 3 showed the autocorrelation function between storm peak h s for peaks separated by at least 5 days if we wish to assess the dependence structure in the extreme values without pre selecting a declustering criterion to identify storm peaks then the autocorrelation function is not appropriate since it measures the correlation between data at all levels davis and mikosch 2009 introduced the concept of the extremogram as an analogue of the autocorrelation function for sequences of extreme events in a time series the definition of the extremogram presented by davis and mikosch 2009 is used for assessing dependence between multivariate time series but the concept is also applicable to univariate time series to simplify the notation the definition will be presented here for univariate time series only for a stationary univariate process x t the extremogram is defined is defined as 39 ρ τ lim u pr x t τ u x t u in the univariate case the extremogram is the same as the tail dependence coefficient between x t and x t τ beirlant et al 2004 to test for correlation in exceedances at finite levels an estimate of the extremogram at level u can be defined as 40 ρ u τ t 1 n h i u x t i u x t τ t 1 n i u x t where i u is the indicator function 41 i u x 1 if x u 0 if x u two events a and b are independent if p a b p a therefore if exceedances of threshold u at separation τ are independent then ρ u τ pr x u 0 at extreme values pr x u 0 and davis and mikosch 2009 showed that in this limiting case ρ τ has the properties of a correlation function however at finite levels pr x u is non negligible and hence can be subtracted from ρ u τ to assess independence fig 6 shows ρ u τ and ρ u τ pr x u for the normalised h s data for both datasets values are shown for separation times between 0 and 10 days and a range of threshold levels a threshold of 0 corresponds to just over the 50th percentile for both datasets whilst the upper threshold level shown corresponds approximately the 99 9th percentile for both datasets obviously the threshold value of 0 does not represent extreme values but the range of thresholds is shown to illustrate the difference in the dependence structure between common and extreme values it is also interesting to note that even for lower sea states the correlation decays to zero after about 5 days for both datasets this means that selecting a declustering criteria that ensures independence at lower levels will also ensure independence at extreme levels for site a the dependence structure remains almost constant with threshold for most of the range with events separated by 4 days being effectively independent for the highest thresholds the correlation range decreases rapidly with events separated by 1 day being effectively independent for a threshold of 5 5 in contrast site b exhibits a more continuous gradual decrease in dependence with threshold but a similar pattern in dependence at the highest levels by applying a seasonal normalisation and examining the dependence structure of the normalised time series we are making the implicit assumption that the dependence structure of the smaller storms in the summer months is the same as that for the larger storms in the winter months except for a shift in mean and std of the time series it is conceivable that this is assumption is invalid and that the duration of high peaks differs in summer and winter however selecting a sufficiently large minimum separation time for declustering will ensure that the declustered events are effectively independent given these observations defining storms as local maxima in h s in a 5 day window appears to be sufficient to ensure independence this definition of storms will be used from here onwards a separation time of 5 days is also reasonable based on physical arguments since peaks separated by 5 days will correspond to waves generated from separate low pressure systems it is emphasised that the seasonal normalisation applied above has only been used to examine the dependence structure in the extreme values and define a declustering criterion no model of the seasonal variation is required for estimating the long term distribution of wave heights the effect of seasonal variability on the simulated time series and extreme values is discussed in section 7 1 6 3 fitting of distributions so far the method used to fit the long term distribution models to the data has not been discussed the aw and ssm methods both require a model for of p h s the equivalent storm method requires an estimate of p h m p and the mc method requires multiple estimates of pr h m a x h any storm for the storm based methods estimates of the distributions are only required for storms where the maximum wave height exceeds a threshold level and the occurrence rate of storms exceeding the threshold level is accounted for in the calculation of return periods 2 this means that the standard pot approach can be adopted for the storm based methods for the aw and ssm methods a model for p h s is only needed for the tail of the distribution as well since for high values of h and low values of h s pr h h σ h s 0 therefore the gpd can also be used to model p h s for the aw and ssm models and we can set the lower limit of integration in 13 and 18 as the threshold level used to fit the gpd this avoids the need to establish a model for the distribution of the entire range of values of h s which can be problematic since fitting a model for the entire range of h s does not guarantee a good fit to the highest values which have the strongest influence on the extreme wave heights ferreira and guedes soares 1999 showed that three models of p h s which all had a good fit over the bulk of the data gave estimates of 100 year h s which differed by over 5 m for a dataset from the portuguese coast just modelling the tail of the distribution avoids this problem there are conflicting requirements in selecting the threshold used for modelling p h s the threshold must be low enough that the integrals 13 and 18 are not affected but high enough to ensure a good fit of the gpd to the data for the datasets considered here it was found that the maximum percentile which could be used for the threshold level differed between the two datasets with the integrals for site a remaining invariant for thresholds up to the 99 5 quantile h s 8 m but the integrals for site b remaining invariant only up to the 95 quantile h s 7 m the difference in sensitivity is due to the different shapes of the tails of the distribution discussed below with the distribution for site a having a longer tail than for site b meaning that exceedance probabilities decrease with h s at a lower rate in the tail of the distribution for site a fortunately for both datasets it was found that the gpd provides a good fit to the data for lower threshold values than this as discussed below the gpd fitted to the tail of the distribution gives the conditional non exceedance probability pr h s h h s u where u is the threshold level the cdf of h s can then be calculated as 42 pr h s h 1 pr h s u 1 pr h s h h s u where pr h s u is the fraction of samples where h s exceeds the threshold the gpd is defined as 43 pr x h x u 1 1 ξ h u σ 1 ξ f o r ξ 0 a n d σ 0 1 exp h u σ f o r ξ 0 a n d σ 0 here the variable x denotes either h s h m p or h m a x depending on the application the parameters σ and ξ are the scale and shape parameters respectively when ξ 0 the distribution is unbounded from above and referred to as heavy tailed or long tailed when ξ 0 the distribution has a maximum value equal to u σ ξ and is referred to as short tailed the methods used to estimate the parameters of the gpd and select the threshold are discussed in the following two subsections it is worth noting that some practitioners opt to use the weibull distribution for modelling the tail of the long term distribution rather than the gpd jonathan and ewans 2013 discuss differences between the gpd and weibull approach and note that using a weibull distribution implicitly constrains the tail to be unbounded from above it is reasonable to expect an upper bound on storm peak h s or wave heights due to physical constraints such as fetch limitations or water depth the use of the gpd allows for the possibility of an upper bound on the tail of the distribution whereas the weibull distribution does not the use of the gpd for modelling the tail of the distribution is also justified by asymptotic arguments see e g coles 2001 for these reasons the gpd has been used to model the tails of the long term distributions in this work 6 3 1 gpd parameter estimation the method used to estimate the parameters of the gpd can have a significant influence on results especially with relatively small sample sizes mackay et al 2011 the metocean time series available for estimating extreme values are typically quite short in relation to the return periods of interest resulting in small samples sizes this means that using accurate estimators is important the maximum likelihood ml method is commonly used in metocean applications e g jonathan and ewans 2013 due to its asymptotic properties of being unbiased and having the lowest possible variance however the ml estimators do not achieve these asymptotic properties until large sample sizes hosking and wallis 1987 showed that the ml estimators are non optimal for sample sizes up to 500 with higher bias and variance than other estimators such as the moments and probability weighted moments estimators hosking and wallis also noted that sometimes solutions to the ml equations do not exist and that at other times when a solution does exist there can be convergence problems with the algorithm they used to find them estimation of the gpd parameters is the subject of ongoing research a quantitative comparison of recent methods for estimating the parameters was presented by kang and song 2017 they concluded that the empirical bayesian likelihood method ebm of zhang 2010 has one of the best performances in a wide range of cases the ebm method is both computationally efficient and has low bias and variance compared to other methods which is especially important for the mc method where the fitting is performed for each random trial the ebm method has therefore been used in this work an algorithm for calculating the ebm estimators of the gpd parameters was provided by zhang 2010 using the r statistical language which can easily be translated into other codes the reader is referred there for details 6 3 2 threshold selection the selection of the threshold for fitting the gpd is a compromise between having a sufficient number of observations and violating the asymptotic arguments which justify the use of the gpd various methods have been proposed for selecting an appropriate threshold an overview of graphical methods is presented by coles 2001 and jonathan and ewans 2013 discuss some more recent studies in this work the threshold has been selected by fitting the gpd for a range of thresholds and selecting the threshold as the lowest value for which the shape parameter ξ and estimates of high quantiles of the distribution reach an approximately stable value for each threshold value a bootstrap technique is used to establish confidence bounds on the estimates at each trial of the bootstrap procedure a random error is added to each resampled data point corresponding to the sampling uncertainty in the measurement this addition of a random error helps smooth the threshold plots making trends easier to identify the sampling distribution of h s is approximately guassian with a coefficient of variation of cov h s α t m d σ where α 0 48 for a pierson moskowitz spectrum and α 0 61 for a jonswap spectrum with peak enhancement factor of 3 3 forristall et al 1996 in our datasets d σ 1200 s and the mean value of t m d σ was 0 067 for site a and 0 082 for site b a value of cov h s 0 04 has been used for both datasets as a representative value given the range of spectral shapes and values of t m threshold selection plots for the fit of the gpd to measured h s for each dataset are shown in fig 7 note that for the aw and ssm methods the gpd is fitted to all values of h s exceeding the threshold and no declustering is applied for site b the threshold has been selected as 7 5 m since both the gpd shape parameter and 50 year return value of h s tend to approximately constant values above this threshold there are 44 storms where the peak h s exceeds 7 5 m or 1 4 storms per year for site a the shape parameter and 50 year return values also appear approximately constant for thresholds above 7 5 m however in this case there are only two storms where the peak h s exceeds 7 5 m which is insufficient to establish a reliable fit to the tail of the distribution instead the threshold has been set at 5 m where there is also a period of stability in the gpd shape parameter and for which there are 54 storms where the peak h s exceeds the threshold 2 4 storms per year the fit of the gpd to the data at the selected thresholds is shown in fig 8 in both cases the gpd provides a good visual fit to the data note that at site a for the two storms where the peak h s exceeds 7 5 m there are 17 hourly records with h s exceeding 7 5 m the fitting of equivalent storms defined in terms of the gumbel and gev distributions to the two datasets was discussed in detail by mackay and johanning 2018a and is not repeated here the threshold selection plots for the fit of the gpd to the most probable maximum crest height in each storm c m p are shown in fig 9 in this case there is a clear choice of threshold for both datasets for site a both the shape parameter and 50 year return value of c m p are approximately stable for thresholds above 5 m and for site b stability is reached at 5 5 m the fit of the gpd to each dataset at the selected threshold level is shown in fig 10 and appears satisfactory in both cases for site a the distribution is long tailed due to the occurrence of two large storms with c m p 2 m higher than all other storms in contrast the distribution for site b is short tailed and there is a relatively close grouping in the values of c m p for the largest storms for the mc method the threshold is selected by fitting to the declustered values of c m e d the median value of the maximum crest height in each storm defined in section 4 3 2 fig 11 shows the maximum value of c m e d in each storm compared to c m p for both datasets the value of c m p is slightly larger than max c m e d on average but the two variables are strongly correlated with a pearson correlation coefficient in excess of 0 99 given the very strong correlation in the two variables the choice of threshold for the equivalent storm method will also be appropriate for the mc method and has been applied here 6 4 comparison of return values of individual crest heights fig 12 shows the return values of maximum crest heights calculated using each method for both datasets the aw method gives the highest predicted crest heights at return periods of 1 year but converges with the predicted crest heights from the ssm method for return periods of greater than 10 years as expected from the theoretical considerations presented in section 4 the storm based methods agree well for both datasets for site a the gumbel and gev methods are in close agreement over the entire range of return periods whereas for site b the gumbel method produces slightly lower estimates at higher return periods mackay and johanning 2018a showed that for this dataset the gumbel and gev methods agreed better if ln n is modelled as linearly dependent on c m p rather than constant the difference in the estimate of c m a x at the 100 year level between the gumbel and gev methods is around 0 2 m and remains similar at the 1000 year level given the uncertainty in the estimates due to the finite length of the metocean dataset discussed further in section 7 2 2 the difference between the two methods is not significant for site a the aw and ssm methods result in significantly higher predictions at lower return periods than the storm based methods with a difference of 1 5 m at a return period of 10years and 1 1 m at a return period of 100years for site b the aw and ssm methods agree better with the storm based methods and give slightly lower predictions at return periods above 50 years given that the aw and ssm methods neglect serial correlation in sea states it would be reasonable to expect that they would give higher estimates of return values than the storm based methods for both datasets however the difference between the return values calculated using aw and ssm methods and storm based methods will depend both on the level of serial correlation in the extreme values and also any differences in the fitted distributions of h s and c m p given the uncertainty in the fitted distributions it is not possible to conclude from this example whether the differences in the return values observed for site a are due to serial correlation or uncertainty in the fitted distributions the simulations presented in the following section remove the influence of the uncertainty in the fitted distributions to illustrate the differences that arise from serial correlation only 7 application to synthesised data in this section synthesised time series of sea states are used to investigate the accuracy of each method the synthetic time series are not intended to be precise representations of the wave climates at either of the locations considered in the previous section but are intended to capture realistic features of wave climates in order to assess the accuracy of the models for the long term distributions of individual crest heights section 7 1 describes the method used to synthesise the time series and the application of the models to the synthetic data is described in section 7 2 7 1 creation of synthetic time series numerous methods have been proposed for generating synthetic time series of sea states see monbet et al 2007 for a review the challenge here is to generate a synthetic time series where the extreme characteristics are representative of a real situation and the joint evolution of sea state parameters during storms follows realistic patterns matching the observed dependence structures both in terms of serial correlation and the joint distribution of parameters a block resampling method härdle et al 2003 has been applied here where the measured time series of sea states is divided into discrete blocks and these blocks are resampled with replacement the blocks correspond to storms where the peak h s can be considered independent independent values of storm peak h s are defined in the same way as before as maxima within a 5 day moving window the dividing points between blocks are defined to be the minimum value of h s between adjacent storm peaks blocks with more than 10 missing data have been discarded dividing the time series in this way ensures that the maximum crest heights in each block are independent and that storm histories are realistic if the time series was resampled without modification this would mean that the maximum h s over any time period would be the maximum observed h s to overcome this a distribution is fitted to the observed values of storm peak h s which can be used to extrapolate to extreme values described below to generate a storm with a random peak h s a random variable is generated from the fitted distribution and a block is selected at random from the 20 measured storms with the closest peak h s the values of h s in the randomly selected measured storm are then linearly rescaled so that the peak h s matches the randomly generated value the values of t m and t z are scaled to maintain the observed steepness if we denote the ratio of the random storm peak h s to the measured storm peak h s as r h s p e a k r h s p e a k m where the superscripts denote the random and measured values then the rescaled values of t m and t z in the random storm are given by t m r t m m r and t z r t z m r the reason for selecting the random storm from only the measured storms with the closest values of peak h s is that the characteristics of the storms change with h s so sampling from the nearest neighbours preserves this relation from fig 2 it is clear that the distribution of t z is dependent on h s the distribution of h s within a storm is also conditional on the value of the storm peak h s fig 13 shows the distribution of h s h s p e a k binned by the value of storm peak h s it is evident that the distribution changes with the value of storm peak h s and that the patterns differ between the two datasets with the largest storms at site a having a more peaked shape than the largest storms at site b to avoid the problems with associated with initial distribution methods discussed in section 6 3 the distribution of storm peak h s is fitted with a two part model using a lognormal model for the body of the data and a gpd model for the tail a smooth transition between the models for the body and tail of the distribution is achieved using a mixing function defined as 44 m h 1 2 1 tanh h v d where v is the mixing point and d is the mixing distance the model for the cdf of storm peak h s is then given by 45 pr h s p e a k h 1 m h p b o d y h m h p t a i l h it was found that setting d 0 5 and v u d where u is the threshold at which the gpd is fitted gave a smooth transitions for both datasets the threshold for the gpd was selected as u 5 25 m for site a and u 5 75 m for site b the fit of the models to the data are shown in fig 14 the models provide a good visual fit both in the bodies and the tails of the distributions scatter plots of h s against t z for example 500 year simulations are shown in fig 15 together with the measured h s against t z the block resampling method provides a realistic looking joint distribution which replicates the observed shapes reasonably well and preserves the relationship between h s and significant steepness however as the method does not create new storm histories but simply rescales measured storms the storm with the largest value of t z at site a has been resampled several times exaggerating this part of the distribution it is reasonable to ask whether resampling of measured storms will give an adequate representation of the variability in storm characteristics mackay and johanning 2018a showed that the distribution of the maximum crest heights in storms can be very accurately represented in terms of the three parameter gev moreover the joint distribution of the fitted gev parameters exhibits remarkably regular characteristics with the scale parameter b being strongly correlated to the location parameter a c m p and the shape parameter k taking a narrow distribution of values approximately independent of a due to this regularity in the distribution of the maximum crest heights in measured storms the block resampling method should give an adequate representation of the variability in storm characteristics no attempt has been made to capture the seasonal variation in sea states in the synthetic time series the rationale for this is that sampling all storms at random will capture the distribution of storms throughout the year over a one year section of simulated time series the seasonal variation in storms should be captured on average moreover as we have assumed that the time series is composed of independent blocks it is only the distribution of storms within the year that determines the distribution of the maximum crest height in the year and not the order in which storms occur this argument is analogous to the argument that the order of sea states within a storm does not affect the distribution of the maximum crest height in the storm 7 2 results and discussion a 100 000 year synthetic time series of sea states was generated for each dataset for each sea state a random maximum crest height was simulated from the forristall 2000 distribution using the method described in section 4 3 2 the largest crest in each year of the synthetic time series was extracted and used to form an empirical estimate of pr c m a x h 1 year from which return values were calculated using 1 the return periods estimated from the 100 000 year simulation have approximately a 3 std at the 100 year level and a 10 std at the 1000 year level see appendix a the synthetic time series were used to assess the accuracy of the ssm es and mc methods in two ways as described in the following sections the aw method was not considered in this section as it gives identical results to the ssm method for return periods above 10years 7 2 1 example 1 distributions derived from 100 000 year simulation in the first example the long term distributions pr h s h and pr c m p h have been derived from the full 100 000 year simulated time series this effectively eliminates the uncertainty associated with fitting the distributions and isolates the effect of serial correlation on the estimated return values the values of c m p were calculated explicitly for each simulated storm since the variation of c m p with h s p e a k is nonlinear due to the dependence of the short term distribution parameters on the ursell number to reduce computational time the gumbel and gev distributions were not fitted to the distribution of the maximum crest height in the simulated storms instead the gumbel and gev parameters that were calculated from the measured data were applied in the simulations i e the mean value of ln n for the gumbel method and for the gev the mean value of k and linear model b h m p similarly the linear models for the variation of the short term distribution parameters α h s and β h s derived from the measured data were also used here for the calculations using the ssm method the mc method is not considered in this example as the long term distribution is assumed to be known there is no fitting stage involved for the mc method this means that the application of the mc method to the simulated sea states would be identical to the method used to derive the simulated crest heights the return values of c m a x calculated using the ssm and storm based methods are compared to the simulated values in fig 16 the estimates are very similar to those shown in fig 12 indicating that the models derived for pr h s h and pr c m p h for the measured data were reasonably accurate the return values from the gev method are very close to the simulated values for both datasets whereas the gumbel method produces slightly lower estimates than the simulated values as mentioned in section 6 4 this is likely to be due using a constant value of ln n in the gumbel model rather than a value that is linearly dependent on c m p see mackay and johanning 2018a the ssm method gives return values that are close to the simulated values for site b but significantly overestimates return values for site a in section 6 2 the serial dependence in sea states during high storms was shown to be similar for both datasets why then does neglecting serial correlation give reasonable results for one dataset but not the other the fitted distribution of storm peak h s for site b was short tailed with the gpd shape parameter ξ 0 2 3 whereas the distribution of storm peak h s for site a was marginally long tailed with ξ 0 03 this means that the difference between the 10 year and 100 year h s is larger for site a than for site b so when a storm occurs with h s h s 100 at site b there are only a few sea states with h s h s 10 whereas a storm with h s h s 100 for site a will contain many sea states with h s h s 10 therefore neglecting serial correlation will have a larger impact when the distribution of storm peak h s is long tailed to test this explanation the simulations for site a were repeated with gpd shape parameter set at values of ξ 0 2 0 1 0 and 0 05 all other variables were left unchanged in particular the same set of measured storms was resampled the assumed distributions of h s p e a k are shown in fig 17 a and the bias in the return values of c m a x calculated using the ssm method for each set of simulations are shown in fig 17 b as expected the bias increases with increasing shape parameter this confirms that the tail shape has the dominant influence on the level of bias caused by neglecting serial correlation 7 2 2 example 2 distributions derived from 20 year simulations the second example is designed to examine the robustness of the estimated return values when the long term distributions are fitted to the data the true return periods are calculated in the same way as in example 1 using 100 000 year simulations for each dataset the distributions pr h s h and pr c m p h are fitted to 20 year simulations which is representative of a real situation using measured or hindcast data analogous to that described in section 6 the thresholds identified in section 6 3 2 for fitting the gpd have also been used here the fitting process was repeated 1000 times on different 20 year simulations to establish the mean and std of the return periods calculated using each method the mean and std of the return values over the 1000 simulations are shown in figs 18 and 19 the storm based methods give very similar predictions for both datasets they produce a small positive bias in the predicted return values for both datasets this positive bias is a result of the estimators used for the gpd parameters which is a known feature of the ebm method kang and song 2017 however of the estimators considered the ebm method performed the best in terms of bias and std in particular using ml estimators results in larger bias and much slower computations the gumbel and gev methods have very similar stds for both datasets the std for the mc method is similar to that for the gumbel and gev methods at return periods up to 100 years but differs slightly at longer return periods with a slightly higher std for site a and slightly lower std for site b the ssm method performs similarly here to the previous examples with a significant positive bias for low return periods at site a and a negative bias at high return periods for site b the estimates from the ssm method are in close agreement with the simulated return values interestingly the ssm method gives a higher std in return value estimates than the storm based methods at return periods less than 200 years but lower std at longer return periods the higher std at low return periods is likely related to the ssm method neglecting serial correlation when a single large storm occurs which has multiple sea states above the 100 year level the inclusion of all these sea states in the long term distribution affects return values at low return periods in contrast the occurrence of such a storm only affects a single data point used in the inference for the storm based methods which results in greater stability in the estimates at lower return periods 8 conclusions this paper has considered three methods for combining the long term distribution of sea states with the short term distribution of wave or crest heights conditional on sea state it has been demonstrated both theoretically and numerically that methods which treat all waves as independent events give the same long term distributions as methods that treat the maximum wave height in each sea state as independent events both of these methods neglect the effects of serial correlation in sea states the numerical simulations presented in this work show that this can lead to significant positive bias in estimates of return values of individual wave and crest heights the size of the positive bias is dependent on the shape of the tail of the distribution of storm peak h s with longer tails larger values of the gpd shape parameter leading to larger bias it was shown that storm based methods give accurate predictions of return periods of individual wave heights the method of tromans and vanderschuren 1995 which models the distribution of the maximum wave height in a storm using a gumbel distribution gives very similar results to the gev method of mackay and johanning 2018a the gumbel method produces a slight underestimate of return values when the number of waves in the storm ln n is assumed to be constant the monte carlo method proposed by mackay and johanning 2018b was shown to compare well to the gumbel and gev storm based methods for both the measured and simulated data of all the models considered the monte carlo method requires the fewest assumptions and fitting stages with subjective judgements from the user it does not require calculating the distribution of the maximum wave height in measured storms fitting equivalent storms estimating joint distributions of storm parameters or combining distributions via integration also in comparison to the all wave and sea state maxima methods there is no requirement to form models of for the mean values of the short term distribution parameters as a function of h s it is therefore recommended that the monte carlo method should be used for calculating return periods of individual wave and crest heights declarations of interest none acknowledgement this work was partly funded through epsrc grant ep r007519 1 appendix a sampling properties of return periods the sampling properties of the return periods estimated from the data can be derived as follows denote the ordered sample of annual maximum wave or crest heights as h 1 h 2 h n where n is the length of the dataset in years the empirical non exceedance probability for the k t h order statistic is defined as a 1 p k n 1 define a 2 p k pr h k h note that p k is a random variable but p is not for any sample p is always given by a 1 the empirical return period associated with the k t h order statistic is a 3 t 1 1 p which is also fixed for any sample however the true return period t 1 1 p k associated with the k t h order statistic is a random variable whose sampling properties can be derived in terms of the distribution of p k the variable p k follows a beta distribution david and nagaraja 2003 with density function given by a 4 f p k n k 1 n k p k k 1 1 p k n k the expected values of t and t 2 are a 5 e t n k 1 n k 0 1 p k 1 1 p n k 1 p d p n n k a 6 e t 2 n k 1 n k 0 1 p k 1 1 p n k 1 p 2 d p n n 1 n k n k 1 the variance of t is given by a 7 var t e t 2 e t 2 k n n k 2 n k 1 from a 1 and a 3 we have a 8 k n 1 t 1 t substituting this into a 7 we arrive at a 9 s t d t t 1 n t 1 n n 1 t 1 n 2 t 1 t n 1 2 the function in a 9 is plotted in fig 20 using a value of n 10 5 years the estimated return periods from the 100 000 year simulations have a 3 std at the 100 year level and a 10 std at the 1000 year level substituting a 8 into a 5 gives the expected value of the sample return periods as a 10 e t n n t 1 t when n is large and n t the term in brackets is close to unity but when t is close to n there can be a significant positive bias in the sample return periods for the 100 000 year simulations the bias is approximately 0 1 at the 100 year level and 1 at the 1000 year level the bias is therefore effectively negligible compared to the std 
23148,this paper considers three types of method for calculating return periods of individual wave and crest heights the methods considered differ in the assumptions made about serial correlation in wave conditions the long term distribution of individual waves is formed under the assumption that either 1 individual waves 2 the maximum wave height in each sea state or 3 the maximum wave height in each storm are independent events the three types of method are compared using long time series of synthesised storms where the return periods of individual wave heights are known the methods which neglect serial correlation in sea states are shown to produce a positive bias in predicted return values of wave heights the size of the bias is dependent on the shape of the tail of the distribution of storm peak significant wave height with longer tailed distributions resulting in larger biases it is shown that storm based methods give accurate predictions of return periods of individual wave heights in particular a monte carlo storm based method is recommend for calculating return periods of individual wave and crest heights of all the models considered the monte carlo method requires the fewest assumptions about the data the fewest subjective judgements from the user and is simplest to implement keywords wave height crest height long term distribution return period serial correlation 1 introduction estimating the long term statistics of individual wave or crest heights is an important problem in the design of offshore and coastal structures the long term statistics of individual waves are dependent on both the long term distribution of sea states and the short term distribution of wave heights or crests heights conditional on sea state to produce an accurate estimate of the heights of extreme individual waves information from the long term and short term distributions must be combined in an appropriate manner the approaches that have been proposed for combining these distributions are equally applicable to both wave heights and crest heights so to avoid referring to both throughout the text the following discussion is presented in terms of wave heights the simplest approach for estimating extreme individual wave heights at a given exceedance probability e g once in 100 years is to estimate the significant wave height h s at a return period of 100 years then calculate the most probable maximum wave height in that sea state assuming a duration of somewhere between 3 and 6 h see e g hogben 1990 tucker and pitt 2001 there are several problems with this approach firstly the appropriate duration of sea state to use for calculating the most probable maximum wave height is not clear secondly this approach neglects the probability that the largest wave could occur in a sea state other than the 1 in 100 year h s this can lead to significant underestimates in predictions of extremes since there will be several sea states with h s close to the most severe value either within the same storm or in separate storms carter and challenor 1990 to overcome the problems of the simple approach various methods have been proposed to combine the long term and short term distributions that account for the probability of large waves occurring in any sea state battjes 1970 calculated the total number of waves exceeding a level in a given interval and divided this by the total number of waves in the interval to derive an estimate of the long term distribution of all individual wave heights krogstad 1985 proposed a method for calculating the long term distribution of the maximum wave height in an interval derived in terms of the distribution of the maximum wave height in each sea state during the interval see also prevosto et al 2000 krogstad and barstow 2004 various methods have also been proposed for calculating return periods of individual wave heights from the distribution of the maximum wave height in each storm jahns and wheeler 1973 ward et al 1979 haring and heideman 1980 boccotti 1986 2000 forristall et al 1991 tromans and vanderschuren 1995 arena and pavone 2006 fedele and arena 2010 laface and arena 2016 mackay and johanning 2018a b although the assumption is not always explicit in the derivations of each approach the various methods proposed all have the common feature of calculating the distribution of the maximum wave height in a random event where the event is either a storm a sea state or a single wave in the last case the maximum wave height in the event is just the individual wave height long term statistics of individual waves are then calculated from the random event distribution assuming that occurrences of events are independent the assumption of independence of these events is not true in general with records of wave measurements exhibiting serial correlation at multiple scales with correlation between successive individual wave heights sea states and storms in the statistical literature the effect of serial correlation on estimates of extreme values is often quantified using the extremal index which can be introduced as follows suppose that x 1 x n are a sequence of n independent variables with common distribution function f in this case the distribution of the maximum observation is given by pr max x 1 x n x f n x if instead y 1 y n are a stationary process also with common distribution function f but with some level of serial correlation then subject to certain regularity conditions it can be shown that pr max y 1 y n x f θ n x where θ 0 1 is known as the extremal index see e g coles 2001 serial correlation effectively reduces the probability of large observations in a sequence of a given length therefore for processes with θ 1 assuming that observations are independent will lead to a positive bias in the estimates of extreme values some studies have proposed estimating θ explicitly and using this in the estimation of extremes e g fawcett and walshaw 2012 however obtaining a reliable estimate of θ is difficult in practice and subject to considerable uncertainties davis et al 2013 for oceanographic data it is more common to adopt the peaks over threshold scheme which selects events that are approximately independent ensuring that θ 1 jonathan and ewans 2013 the methods proposed by battjes 1970 and krogstad 1985 referred to as the all wave aw and sea state maxima ssm methods respectively from here onwards and the various storm based methods make implicit assumptions about independence between events the aw method assumes that all wave heights are independent the ssm method assumes that sea state maxima are independent and storm based methods assumes that the maximum wave heights in separate storms are independent given the serial correlation in wave height time series the three methods would be expected to give different results with the aw method producing the highest estimates and storm based methods producing the lowest estimates forristall 2008 compared estimates of the long term distribution of individual wave heights from the aw ssm and storm based methods forristall conducted monte carlo simulations of 100 000 years of individual wave heights from synthetic storms assuming that the time series of h s in a storm follows a triangular shape with a fixed relationship between the peak h s and duration of the storm the duration d of the storm was defined to be the time for which h s 0 and a value of d 8 h s p e a k was used where d is in hours the zero crossing period t z was assumed to be constant at 10s and wave heights were assumed to follow a rayleigh distribution it was shown that aw and ssm methods produce a positive bias in estimates of the 100 year wave height consistent with both models neglecting serial correlation effects forristall showed that the storm based method of tromans and vanderschuren 1995 gave the correct return values of individual wave heights when applied to the synthetic triangular storm data with rayleigh distributed wave heights forristall s study provides a useful insight into the differences between various methods for calculating return periods of individual waves however due to the assumptions about the fixed shape of the storms and constant wave period it is difficult to draw conclusions about the accuracy of storm based methods when applied to real data the purpose of this paper is to compare methods for estimating return periods of individual wave heights based on more realistic simulations of synthetic storms where the wave period varies throughout the storm and the temporal evolution of sea state parameters is based on measured data in the current work a block resampling method is used generate random time series of realistic storm histories which are used to compare various methods of estimating return periods of individual wave heights the block resampling method divides a time series of measured wave data into discrete blocks consisting of storms where the peak wave heights can be considered approximately independent the problem of determining time scales over which storm peak wave heights can be considered independent is also discussed in some detail the results presented in this paper also have implications for the estimation of extreme load values on marine structures the full long term response analysis method advocated by some authors e g sagrilo et al 2011 naess and moan 2012 giske et al 2017 is essentially a method for forming the long term distribution of the maximum load in each sea state analogous to the ssm method for wave and crest heights this method is therefore likely to be subject to the same problems associated with neglecting serial correlation in sea states methods for calculating extreme loads which account for serial correlation in sea states have been proposed by other authors e g forristall et al 1991 tromans and vanderschuren 1995 however the focus of this work is on wave and crest heights and the effect of serial correlation on extreme load values is beyond the scope of the paper the paper starts in section 2 with a brief review of how return periods and return values are defined in the context of the various types of long term distributions considered section 3 presents a short discussion of models for the short term distribution of wave and crest heights conditional on sea state section 4 presents the mathematical derivation of the methods for combining the long term and short term distributions and highlights where various assumptions about independence are made either implicitly or explicitly the methods are compared in a simplified example in section 5 which isolates the effects of serial correlation in sea states the methods are then applied to measured data in section 6 providing a quantitative comparison of the effect the various assumptions made in each method in a real situation the accuracy of the methods is compared in section 7 using monte carlo simulations of synthetic storms finally conclusions are presented in section 8 2 return periods return values the methods for estimating the long term distribution of individual wave heights considered in this paper are used to define return periods and return values in slightly different ways it is therefore useful to review how return periods and return values are defined in each context return values are defined in terms of the distribution of the maximum wave height in a year we denote the probability that the maximum individual wave height h m a x does not exceed h in any year selected at random as pr h m a x h 1 year the t year return value of individual wave height h t is then defined as the value which has an exceedance probability 1 t in any year 1 pr h m a x h t 1 year 1 t t 1 the duration t is referred to as the return period and is the average period between exceedances of h t over the last few decades the peaks over threshold pot method has gained popularity over the annual maxima method see jonathan and ewans 2013 for a review of the use of pot in an oceanographic context in this method the distribution of the annual maximum is not estimated explicitly instead the distribution of independent threshold exceedances is estimated if each independent threshold exceedance is described as an event then return values of wave heights can be defined in terms of the distribution of the maximum wave height in a random event as the solution of 2 pr h m a x h t event 1 t m t 1 m where m is the expected number of events per year see e g coles 2001 in the present context the event is either a storm sea state or individual wave the definitions 1 and 2 lead to slightly different return values for low return periods but the differences become negligible at larger return periods this can be seen as follows the distribution of the maximum wave height in a year can be calculated by assuming independence of maxima in each event as 3 pr h m a x h 1 year pr h m a x h event m substituting 3 into 1 and using a taylor series expansion gives 4 pr h m a x h t event 1 1 t 1 m 1 1 t m o 1 t 2 so the two definitions are equivalent for large t in practice the difference is negligible for t 10 so both definitions will be used in the following discussions depending on which is more appropriate 3 short term distribution of wave heights conditional on sea state a sea state σ is defined to be a period of time in which the wave conditions can be considered approximately stationary with the duration normally defined in the range 30 min to 3 h a sea state is defined in terms of the wave spectrum and summarised in terms of spectral parameters such as significant wave height h s 4 m 0 zero up crossing period t z m 0 m 2 mean period t m m 0 m 1 where m n 0 f n s f d f is the n t h moment of the wave frequency spectrum s f the short term distribution of wave heights h conditional on sea state is denoted 5 pr h h σ models for 5 in terms of sea state parameters and water depth is the subject of ongoing research and it is beyond the scope of this work to provide a review of the extensive literature on this topic the focus of this work is on how to combine the short term distribution 5 with the long term distribution of sea states the methods described are applicable to any model for the short term distribution the short term distribution is primarily dependent on h s but is also affected by the water depth wave steepness spectral bandwidth directional spread and currents in the following it is assumed that the model for the short term distribution adequately captures these effects 4 long term distributions 4 1 long term distribution of all wave heights battjes 1970 proposed a method for calculating return values of individual wave heights in terms of the long term distribution of all wave heights the probability that any wave selected at random exceeds height h is calculated as the ratio of the expected number of waves exceeding h per year to the expected number of waves per year the expected number of waves exceeding h in a sea state is 6 m σ h n t z pr h h σ where n t z d σ t z is the expected number of waves in a sea state d σ is the duration of the sea state normally assumed to be somewhere in the region 1 6 h and t z is the zero up crossing period the expected number of waves exceeding h in a year denoted m y r h is calculated by integrating m σ h over the probability of occurrence of sea states and multiplying by the number of sea states per year n p y 7 m y r h n p y 0 0 p h s t z n t z pr h h σ d h s d t z the occurrence of sea states is specified in terms of p h s t z the joint probability density function of h s and t z this implicitly assumes that the short term distribution is only influenced by h s and t z which as discussed in section 3 is not necessarily true the effect of other sea state parameters on the short term distribution could be captured by using the joint density function of multiple parameters however this quickly becomes very complicated as the number of variables is increased in some applications of the aw method the joint density function is used e g hagen et al 2017 however in most applications 7 is simplified as follows to avoid having to model joint distribution the joint density function is written as p h s t z p h s p t z h s and the mean number of waves for a given h s is defined as 8 n h s 0 p t z h s n t z d t z substituting this back into 7 gives 9 m y r h n p y 0 p h s n h s pr h h σ h s d h s in this approach all the sea state variables that influence the short term distribution must be modelled as functions of h s in the original aw method proposed by battjes the expected number of waves in any sea state selected at random is calculated as 10 n r 0 p h s n h s d h s the expected number of waves per year is therefore n r n p y and the probability that any wave selected at random exceeds height h is 11 pr h h any wave m y r h n r n p y 1 n r 0 p h s n h s pr h h σ h s d h s the distribution of the annual maximum wave height is then calculated as 12 pr h m a x h 1 year pr h h any wave n r n p y this calculation makes the implicit assumption that individual wave heights are independent which as discussed in the introduction is not true tucker 1989 pointed out that n r is sensitive to the number of waves in low sea states and that it seems counter intuitive that this should influence the extreme values tucker noted that the t year return value of individual wave height is the value of h for which the expected number of waves exceeding h per year is m y r h 1 t the annual distribution can therefore be calculated directly from 1 and 9 as 13 pr h m a x h 1 year 1 m y r h 1 n p y 0 pr h h σ h s p h s n h s d h s note that this definition is only valid for m y r h 1 although it is not immediately obvious from 13 tucker s expression for the annual distribution implicitly assumes that individual wave heights are uncorrelated expanding the original battjes expression 11 as a taylor series we have 14 pr h m a x h 1 year pr h h any wave n r n p y 1 m y r h n r n p y n r n p y 1 m y r h o m y r h 2 in tucker s definition m y r h 1 t so for large t the terms of order m y r h 2 are negligible and the two expressions are equivalent therefore both battjes and tucker s expressions for the distribution of the maximum wave height in a year can be thought of as being formed under the assumption that there is no serial correlation in individual wave heights this assumption is discussed further in the following section 4 2 long term distribution of sea state maxima the long term distribution of the maximum wave height in a sea state can be calculated in two ways with one approach based on an average over time and the other based on an average over the probability of occurrence of sea states both methods give equivalent results but it is not immediately obvious to see this from looking at the expressions the temporal average method will be presented first and it will then be shown how it is equivalent to the probabilistic method the distribution of the maximum wave in a sea state is usually calculated by assuming that successive wave heights are independent so that 15 pr h m a x h σ pr h h σ n where n d σ t z is the expected number of waves in the sea state as defined in the previous section in reality consecutive wave and crest heights are correlated with the largest waves occurring in groups naess 1985 showed that for linear waves from a jonswap spectrum the effect of ignoring correlation between successive waves has a negligible influence on the distribution of the maximum wave height fedele 2016 considered the effect of correlation between successive wave crests using the linear model of fedele 2005 and also concluded that correlation could be neglected for typical broadbanded waves from a jonswap spectrum fedele 2016 also noted that for the case of nonlinear waves since the nonlinear harmonics are phase locked to the linear components the dependence between successive crests is unlikely to be affected by nonlinearities janssen 2015 suggested that it is more appropriate to characterise n as a function of the number of wave groups in the record as it is more plausible that the maximum wave height in each group is independent than it is that successive wave heights are independent however this idea has not been pursued in this work the maximum wave heights in successive sea states can be considered independent in the sense that the maximum height is dependent only on the sea state parameters and not the maximum height in adjacent sea states the distribution of the maximum wave height in the time interval 0 a can therefore be written as 16 pr h m a x h 0 a i 1 k pr h m a x h σ τ i i 1 k pr h h σ τ i d σ t z τ i exp i 1 k d σ t z τ i ln pr h h σ τ i where τ i 0 a as the duration of each sea state d σ tends to zero the summation in 16 can be expressed as an integral borgman 1973 17 pr h m a x h 0 a exp 0 a 1 t z t ln pr h h σ t d t equations 16 and 17 give expressions for the distribution of the maximum wave height in an interval 0 a if the time series of sea states is known buy they contain no information about the long term distribution of sea states by applying the ergodic assumption naess 1984 that on average the length of time that sea states are in the interval h s h s d h s during time 0 a is d t a p h s d h s the distribution 17 can be rewritten as krogstad 1985 18 pr h m a x h 0 a exp a 0 1 t z h s p h s ln pr h h σ h s d h s note that in moving from the integral over time to the integral over h s it must be assumed that t z and other sea state parameters can be modelled as taking a mean value conditional on h s without affecting the calculation the application of the ergodic assumption in passing from 17 to 18 effectively counts the proportion of sea states which exceed a threshold level but does not account for temporal clustering of sea states in storms to make this explicit if a d σ then recalling n h s d σ t z h s and using 15 gives 19 pr h m a x h any sea state exp 0 p h s ln pr h m a x h σ h s d h s putting a n p y d σ 1 year gives 20 pr h m a x h 1 year exp n p y 0 p h s ln pr h m a x h σ h s d h s pr h m a x h any sea state n p y so in krogstad s formulation 18 the annual distribution is identical to that formed under the assumption that the maxima in each sea state are independent a distinction should be made between the type of independence assumed to derive 16 and the type of independence assumed in 18 in the derivation of 16 it is assumed that the maximum wave height in each sea state is dependent only on the sea state parameters and not on the maximum height in adjacent sea states in this expression the values of the sea state parameters are assumed to be known such as would be the case for a measured time series of sea states in a storm in 18 the sequence of sea states over the year are not known only their marginal distribution is known by replacing the integral over a known time series of sea states 17 with an integral over the marginal distribution of sea states 18 the implicit assumption is made that there is no serial correlation in sea states this implicit assumption is made clear by equations 19 and 20 as noted in the introduction serial correlation reduces the probability of large observations in a sequence of a given length this effect is not accounted for in the model of krogstad 1985 4 2 1 connection to other formulations krogstad s model can be shown to be equivalent to other expressions for the long term distribution of sea state maxima sagrilo et al 2011 noted that by using taylor series expansions for the exponential and logarithm terms krogstad s expression 18 can be shown to be approximately equal to the probabilistic average using the taylor series expansion for the logarithm ln x x 1 o x 2 and noting that 0 p h s d h s 1 gives 21 pr h m a x h any sea state exp 0 p h s pr h m a x h σ h s d h s 1 note that the approximation ln x x 1 is an identity when x 1 and for the values of h relevant to extremes pr h m a x h σ h s 1 so this approximation of the logarithm term is accurate for this purpose similarly using the taylor series expansion exp x 1 x which is an identity for x 0 and a good approximation in this case gives 22 pr h m a x h any sea state 0 p h s pr h m a x h σ h s d h s this expression given by tucker and pitt 2001 section 6 4 2 is the population mean whereas krogstad s expression 18 is the ergodic mean these two expressions differ slightly for lower values of h but are almost identical for the higher values of h relevant to extremes however krogstad s expression is more accurate to compute as it uses the logarithm of pr h m a x h σ h s krogstad s model can also be related to the aw model as follows taking a n p y d σ 1 year in 18 and using the same linear expansions for the exponential and logarithm terms gives 23 pr h m a x h 1 year 1 n p y 0 p h s n h s pr h h h s 1 d h s which is identical to 13 it is somewhat surprising that the aw and ssm methods result in approximately equivalent expressions for the distribution of the annual maximum wave height however if we consider that both models assume that there is no serial correlation between individual wave heights or sea states then the reason for the equivalence becomes apparent in the examples considered in sections 5 7 the aw and ssm methods show differences for return periods less than 10 years but give nearly identical results for higher return periods 4 3 long term distribution of storm maxima a storm can be thought of as a sequence of sea states where wave heights increase to a peak value and then decrease again the distribution of the maximum wave height in a storm can be calculated using 16 where the time interval 0 a is defined to be the duration of the storm the process of partitioning a time series into separate storms is analogous to defining declustering criteria in the peaks over threshold pot method see coles 2001 the criteria used to define separate storms typically state that the time between the peak h s of two adjacent storms must be larger than some minimum value in some models an additional criterion is used requiring that the minimum h s between two adjacent peaks must be less than some multiple of the lower of the peak the criteria for defining what constitutes separate storms can be defined more rigorously by considering the correlation between successive storm peak wave heights this will be discussed in more detail in section 6 2 for now it is assumed that the time series has been partitioned into discrete blocks constituting storms where the peak wave heights can be considered independent the distribution of the maximum wave height in any storm selected at random denoted pr h m a x h any storm can be estimated in two ways in the first method the distributions of the maximum wave height in the measured storms can be parameterised in some way in terms of a statistically equivalent storm and the long term distribution of storm parameters can be combined with the short term distribution for the storm in a manner that is analogous to the ssm and aw methods alternatively pr h m a x h any storm can be estimated directly from the data using a monte carlo method the two methods are described in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 4 3 1 the equivalent storm method the distribution of the maximum wave height in a measured storm will be denoted pr h m a x h ms and the distribution for the equivalent storm will be denoted pr h m a x h es two types of approach for parameterising pr h m a x h ms have been proposed one approach is to model the temporal evolution of sea states in a storm using some simplified geometric form such as a triangle boccotti 1986 2000 arena and pavone 2006 laface et al 2017 trapezoid martin soldevilla et al 2015 parabola tucker and pitt 2001 section 6 5 4 power law fedele and arena 2010 fedele 2012 arena et al 2014 or exponential law laface and arena 2016 in most of the approaches the parameters of the equivalent storm are fitted using an iterative procedure so that the distribution of the maximum wave height in the equivalent storm is matched as closely as possible to the measured storm although fedele 2012 provided an explicit formula for the duration of the equivalent storm this approach is reasonably effective because the order of sea states in the storm does not affect the distribution of the maximum wave height therefore the product in 16 can be re ordered into a monotonically increasing series of sea states in terms of the values of h s for which a linear power or exponential law is a reasonable fit the drawback of this approach is that only the temporal evolution of h s is modelled it is therefore necessary to establish models for the mean values of t z and other sea state parameters as a function of h s in the same way as for the aw and ssm models the other approach is to model pr h m a x h ms directly and define the equivalent storm as a statistical distribution rather than a time series of h s this approach was adopted by tromans and vanderschuren 1995 who assumed that the square of the maximum wave height in the storm followed a gumbel distribution mackay and johanning 2018a developed this idea and used the generalised extreme value distribution gev to model the distribution of the maximum wave height in a storm they demonstrated that using the gev to model pr h m a x h ms improves the goodness of fit by an order of magnitude compared to both temporal evolution methods and the tromans and vanderschuren tv method moreover the gev model was shown to be more robust than both the tv and temporal evolution methods to uncertainties in the models for the distribution of storm parameters the gev model also results in a much simpler form for pr h m a x h es than temporal evolution methods the tv method is recommend in several metocean design standards iso 2015 dnv gl 2017 and will therefore be considered as a reference model in comparison to the gev model the temporal evolution methods will not be considered further in the tv method the distribution of the maximum wave height in the equivalent storm is defined as 24 pr h m a x h e s exp exp ln n h h m p 2 1 where n is the number of waves in the storm and h m p is the most probable maximum wave height in the storm i e the mode of pr h m a x h ms tromans and vanderschuren 1995 noted that ln n 8 for northern european winter storms but did not state explicitly how they estimated ln n mackay and johanning 2018a considered two options for calculating ln n in the first method ln n was calculated in terms of the moments of pr h m a x h ms as ln n π h m p 2 std h m a x 2 6 in the second method the value of ln n was determined numerically by finding the value that minimises the difference between pr h m a x h ms and pr h m a x h es quantified in terms of the cramér von mises goodness of fit parameter ω 25 ω 2 0 pr h m a x h ms pr h m a x h es 2 d h it was demonstrated that the second method gave a better fit to the data however the moment based estimators are recommended in dnv gl 2017 and will therefore be used here mackay and johanning 2018a defined the distribution of the maximum wave height in the equivalent storm in terms of the gev as 26 pr h m a x h es exp 1 k h a b 1 k for k 0 exp exp h a b for k 0 where a b and k are the location scale and shape parameters respectively the gev can be fitted to 16 by finding the parameters that minimise ω the first guess for the parameters of the gev is defined by assuming k 0 which from the properties of the gev then implies a h m p and b 6 std h m a x ms π the parameters that minimise ω are then found using a simplex search technique lagarias et al 1998 mackay and johanning 2018a demonstrated that the gev provides an excellent fit to pr h m a x h ms with a bias of less than 0 2 in quantiles up to an exceedance probability of 10 3 meaning that there is very little inaccuracy introduced by parameterising the storm using the gev compared to modelling all sea state variables as directly related to h s once each measured storm has been fitted with an equivalent storm the distribution of the maximum wave height in a random storm can be calculated using the law of total probability by integrating pr h m a x h es over the long term joint density function of storm parameters in a manner analogous to the ssm model 22 in the case of the tv model ln n is assumed to be constant and the mean value over all storms is used for the gev model mackay and johanning 2018a showed that the triple integral over the joint density function p a b k could be reduced to a single integral over p a using the mean value of k and a linear model b a b a established using regression it was also shown that the gev location parameter a is almost identical to h m p since the mean value of k was close to zero therefore the distribution of the maximum wave height in a random storm can be written in the same way for both the tv and gev models as 27 pr h m a x h any storm p h m p pr h m a x h es d h m p the similarity between 27 the ssm model 22 is clear however one advantage of this form is that no model is required for how other sea state parameters vary with h s the density function p h m p is modelled using the pot method with the generalised pareto distribution gpd fitted to exceedances of h m p above some high threshold the fitting of the gpd and the selection of the threshold is discussed in section 6 3 4 3 2 the monte carlo method monte carlo methods have been applied to the estimation of extreme load statistics for various offshore structures a monte carlo method for estimating the short term mean upcrossing rate of high levels which can be used in place of the short term distribution was presented by naess et al 2007a b this short term mean upcrossing rate was then used in combination with a model for the long term extremes that is equivalent to the ssm method see e g sagrilo et al 2011 which ignores the effects of serial correlation in sea states brown et al 2017 used a monte carlo approach to estimate the extreme response of an fpso in squall conditions brown et al 2017 conducted numerical simulations to create a database of the short term extreme response in squall conditions which was then resampled in order to estimate the long term extreme response mackay and johanning 2018b proposed a storm based monte carlo mc method for calculating return periods of individual wave and crest heights the motivating idea for the method is that if a long time series of individual wave heights were available then pr h m a x h any storm could be estimated directly from the data using a standard pot approach without the need to calculate pr h m a x h ms or fit equivalent storms in the mc method a random realisation of the maximum wave height in each sea state is simulated from the metocean parameter time series and the gpd is fitted to storm peak wave heights exceeding some threshold this gives an estimate of pr h m a x h any storm but subject to a high sampling variability due to the random variability in the storm peak wave heights to account for the random variability in the simulated wave heights this process is repeated n times and the parameters of the fitted gpds are averaged over the n trials to obtain a stable estimate of pr h m a x h any storm mackay and johanning 2018b showed that using n 1000 is sufficient to obtain a stable estimate and noted that the computational time for a 30 year dataset is around 1 min on a standard contemporary laptop the random maxima in each sea state are simulated by generating a sequence of uniformly distributed random variables p i 0 1 i 1 m where m is the number of sea states in the metocean dataset the random maximum wave height in each sea state h m a x i is then obtained from 15 as the solution of 28 p i 1 n i pr h h m a x i σ i where n i d σ t z i as before many models for pr h h σ can be inverted analytically to obtain a closed form solution for the random maximum wave heights however even if this is not possible interpolation of pr h h σ to the desired probability gives a simple means of for calculating the random maximum wave heights the difference between the mc method of brown et al 2017 and that of mackay and johanning 2018b is that in the latter study a new set of random maximum wave heights are generated on each trial via 28 whereas in the former study a pre determined set of load maxima are resampled a threshold must be selected for fitting the gpd to storm peak wave heights selecting a threshold for each iteration of the mc method would be impractical mackay and johanning 2018b recommended that the threshold is selected prior to the mc simulations using the median value of the maximum wave height in each sea state denoted h m e d which is calculated from 28 by setting p i 0 5 in each sea state the median values can then be declustered to select the peak values in each storm and the threshold can be selected following the procedures outlined in section 6 3 the choice of declustering criteria is discussed in section 6 2 the mc method could also be applied to estimate the ssm and aw distributions directly from the data removing the need to model the variation of the short term distribution parameters with h s however for the aw method simulating all waves for each sea state would be very computationally intensive and these ideas are not pursued further here 5 comparison in simplified example there are two main differences between the aw and ssm methods and storm based methods firstly both the aw and ssm methods make the implicit assumption that there is no serial correlation in sea states secondly the aw and ssm methods both require that models are established for the mean values of the short term distribution parameters as a function of h s before comparing the methods in a realistic setting where both of these differences become relevant it is useful to use a simplified example to isolate the effect of serial correlation in sea states in this simplified example it is assumed that individual wave heights follow a rayleigh distribution 29 pr h h h s 1 exp 2 h h s 2 it is also assumed that the wave period is constant at t z 10 s so that the distribution of the maximum wave height in a sea state is dependent only on h s suppose that the time series of h s is composed of discrete independent storms each comprising a fixed number n consecutive sea states the number of storms per year is m n p y n where n p y is the number of sea states per year we further assume that h s is constant during each storm so that the marginal distribution of h s is equal to the distribution of storm peak h s for the sea state based model the distribution of the maximum wave height in a year is calculated from 22 as 30 pr h m a x h 1 year 0 p h s pr h m a x h h s d h s n m for the storm based model the distribution of the maximum wave height in a year can be calculated by integrating the distribution of the maximum wave height in a storm conditional on storm peak h s over the distribution of storm peak h s which is equal to the marginal distribution of h s in this example which gives 31 pr h m a x h 1 year 0 p h s pr h m a x h h s n d h s m comparison of 30 and 31 shows that the assumptions about independence of sea states and storms lead to differing expressions for the distribution of the annual maximum wave height to quantify the difference between the two models we assume that sea states have a 1 h duration storms consist of n 100 sea states and there are n p y 8760 sea states per year we also assume that h s follows a weibull distribution 32 pr h s x 1 exp x α β where α β 2 fig 1 shows the distributions of the annual maximum wave heights from the sea state 30 and storm based models 31 for this simple example results from the aw model 13 are also included for comparison as expected from 23 the aw and ssm models give almost identical results for lower exceedance probabilities the aw and ssm method predicts larger wave heights than the storm method at a given exceedance level i e larger return values but the difference decreases at lower exceedance probabilities i e larger return periods in this example the difference is due only to the differing assumptions about independence of sea states and storms the results are consistent with the observation made in the introduction that neglecting serial correlation results in a positive bias in estimates of extreme values strictly speaking we have only shown that the sea state based model gives larger return values rather than a positive bias however the simulation studies presented in section 7 will show that it is in fact a positive bias the assumptions made in this example are clearly unrealistic in the following two sections it will be shown that biases observed in this artificial example also occur under realistic conditions 6 application to measured data in this section the methods used to fit the models to the data are discussed two sets of measured wave data are used to illustrate the procedures the datasets used are described in section 6 1 the selection of declustering criteria for the storm based methods is discussed in section 6 2 parameter estimation and threshold selection for the gpd are discussed in section 6 3 finally a comparison of return values of individual crest heights calculated using each method is presented in section 6 4 6 1 datasets the datasets used are long term records from wave buoys in two distinct wave climate regimes and are the same as those used in mackay and johanning 2018a the first dataset referred to as site a is from ndbc buoy number 44025 located off the coast of long island new york in a water depth of 36 m the dataset consists of 25 years of hourly records of wave spectra over the period april 1991 december 2016 the second dataset referred to as site b is from ndbc buoy number 46014 located off the coast of northern california in a water depth of 256 m the dataset consists of 35 years of hourly records of wave spectra over the period april 1981 december 2016 scatterplots of h s against t z for the two datasets are shown in fig 2 both datasets have similar maximum observed h s with a maximum h s at site a of 9 64 m and a maximum at site b of 10 34 m in the shallower water site the maximum values of h s occur for the steepest seas with 0 06 s z 0 07 where s z 2 π h s g t z 2 whilst at the deeper site the extreme values of h s occur for a wider range of steepness the range of t z observed at the californian site is also much larger than at the new york site in the examples presented in sections 6 4 and 7 the forristall 2000 model for the short term distribution of crest heights in directionally spread seas will be used to illustrate the application of the long term models the forristall model assumes that crest heights c follow a weibull distribution 33 pr c η σ 1 exp η α h s β the parameters α and β are defined in terms of the significant steepness s m and ursell number u r s defined as 34 s m 2 π h s g t m 2 35 u r s h s k m 2 d 3 where k m is the finite depth wave number corresponding to t m and d is the water depth the distribution parameters are given by 36 α 0 3536 0 2568 s m 0 0800 u r s 37 β 2 1 7912 s m 0 5302 u r s 0 2824 u r s 2 the aw and ssm methods both require models for the mean values of α β and t z as a functions of h s mackay and johanning 2018a fitted linear models for the variation of the mean values of these parameters as a function of h s which are used here as well the reader is referred to mackay and johanning 2018a for details 6 2 selection of declustering criteria the objective of this article is to establish the accuracy of storm based methods for estimating return periods of individual wave heights and contrast this to methods which neglect serial correlation in sea states it is therefore important to consider the correlation structure of sea state time series in some detail and to establish a rigorous method of estimating a minimum separation time between local maxima in the wave height time series for which adjacent maxima can be considered statistically independent most statistical methods developed to quantify dependence between extreme events assume that the time series is stationary time series of h s exhibit a clear seasonal variation in storm peak wave heights which introduces a long range dependence structure between extreme events and a non stationarity in the time series the long range dependence due to seasonal variability is deterministic in origin with the variation having a period of exactly one year the variation can therefore be filtered out and the normalised stationary time series can be examined for shorter range dependence of extreme events using established statistical methods the autocorrelation in storm peak h s is shown in fig 3 for both datasets in this example storm peaks are defined as the maxima within a 5 day moving window the lag shown is the number of storms separating adjacent peaks the median time between storm peaks is 9 79 days for site a and 9 86 days for site b the peaks in autocorrelation function occur around lags of 36 and 72 storms which corresponds to the annual signal the pattern in the autocorrelation in storm peak h s is very similar for these two locations which is due to both datasets being located at similar latitudes where the level of seasonal variability is similar the slight difference between the autocorrelation functions for the two buoys is likely to be due to differences in the distribution of storm lengths and the effects of missing data in time series which has not been accounted for in this simple analysis the seasonal variation in h s can be modelled as 38 h s t m t s t h s s t a t t where h s s t a t t is assumed to be a stationary time series and m t and s t are deterministic periodic functions with period one year representing the mean and standard deviation std of the distribution of h s at a given time in the year see monbet el al 2007 and references therein the functions m t and s t are estimated here using the method of athanassoulis and stefanakos 1995 with the mean and std of h s modelled using low order fourier expansions figs 4 and 5 show the mean and std calculated in 10 day bins throughout the year for each dataset together with a second order fourier expansion of the binned values the pattern in the seasonal variation differs between the two locations but the second order model appears adequate for both locations figs 4 and 5 also show the original data plotted against the day of year and the normalised data h s s t a t together with 90 95 and 99 quantiles calculated in 15 day windows the longer bin length has been used here for stability it appears that the normalised data is approximately stationary for site a but there is some residual trend in the extreme values at site b however as will be shown below the normalisation seems to be sufficient to examine the short range dependence i e on time scales less than seasonal variation in the extreme values fig 3 showed the autocorrelation function between storm peak h s for peaks separated by at least 5 days if we wish to assess the dependence structure in the extreme values without pre selecting a declustering criterion to identify storm peaks then the autocorrelation function is not appropriate since it measures the correlation between data at all levels davis and mikosch 2009 introduced the concept of the extremogram as an analogue of the autocorrelation function for sequences of extreme events in a time series the definition of the extremogram presented by davis and mikosch 2009 is used for assessing dependence between multivariate time series but the concept is also applicable to univariate time series to simplify the notation the definition will be presented here for univariate time series only for a stationary univariate process x t the extremogram is defined is defined as 39 ρ τ lim u pr x t τ u x t u in the univariate case the extremogram is the same as the tail dependence coefficient between x t and x t τ beirlant et al 2004 to test for correlation in exceedances at finite levels an estimate of the extremogram at level u can be defined as 40 ρ u τ t 1 n h i u x t i u x t τ t 1 n i u x t where i u is the indicator function 41 i u x 1 if x u 0 if x u two events a and b are independent if p a b p a therefore if exceedances of threshold u at separation τ are independent then ρ u τ pr x u 0 at extreme values pr x u 0 and davis and mikosch 2009 showed that in this limiting case ρ τ has the properties of a correlation function however at finite levels pr x u is non negligible and hence can be subtracted from ρ u τ to assess independence fig 6 shows ρ u τ and ρ u τ pr x u for the normalised h s data for both datasets values are shown for separation times between 0 and 10 days and a range of threshold levels a threshold of 0 corresponds to just over the 50th percentile for both datasets whilst the upper threshold level shown corresponds approximately the 99 9th percentile for both datasets obviously the threshold value of 0 does not represent extreme values but the range of thresholds is shown to illustrate the difference in the dependence structure between common and extreme values it is also interesting to note that even for lower sea states the correlation decays to zero after about 5 days for both datasets this means that selecting a declustering criteria that ensures independence at lower levels will also ensure independence at extreme levels for site a the dependence structure remains almost constant with threshold for most of the range with events separated by 4 days being effectively independent for the highest thresholds the correlation range decreases rapidly with events separated by 1 day being effectively independent for a threshold of 5 5 in contrast site b exhibits a more continuous gradual decrease in dependence with threshold but a similar pattern in dependence at the highest levels by applying a seasonal normalisation and examining the dependence structure of the normalised time series we are making the implicit assumption that the dependence structure of the smaller storms in the summer months is the same as that for the larger storms in the winter months except for a shift in mean and std of the time series it is conceivable that this is assumption is invalid and that the duration of high peaks differs in summer and winter however selecting a sufficiently large minimum separation time for declustering will ensure that the declustered events are effectively independent given these observations defining storms as local maxima in h s in a 5 day window appears to be sufficient to ensure independence this definition of storms will be used from here onwards a separation time of 5 days is also reasonable based on physical arguments since peaks separated by 5 days will correspond to waves generated from separate low pressure systems it is emphasised that the seasonal normalisation applied above has only been used to examine the dependence structure in the extreme values and define a declustering criterion no model of the seasonal variation is required for estimating the long term distribution of wave heights the effect of seasonal variability on the simulated time series and extreme values is discussed in section 7 1 6 3 fitting of distributions so far the method used to fit the long term distribution models to the data has not been discussed the aw and ssm methods both require a model for of p h s the equivalent storm method requires an estimate of p h m p and the mc method requires multiple estimates of pr h m a x h any storm for the storm based methods estimates of the distributions are only required for storms where the maximum wave height exceeds a threshold level and the occurrence rate of storms exceeding the threshold level is accounted for in the calculation of return periods 2 this means that the standard pot approach can be adopted for the storm based methods for the aw and ssm methods a model for p h s is only needed for the tail of the distribution as well since for high values of h and low values of h s pr h h σ h s 0 therefore the gpd can also be used to model p h s for the aw and ssm models and we can set the lower limit of integration in 13 and 18 as the threshold level used to fit the gpd this avoids the need to establish a model for the distribution of the entire range of values of h s which can be problematic since fitting a model for the entire range of h s does not guarantee a good fit to the highest values which have the strongest influence on the extreme wave heights ferreira and guedes soares 1999 showed that three models of p h s which all had a good fit over the bulk of the data gave estimates of 100 year h s which differed by over 5 m for a dataset from the portuguese coast just modelling the tail of the distribution avoids this problem there are conflicting requirements in selecting the threshold used for modelling p h s the threshold must be low enough that the integrals 13 and 18 are not affected but high enough to ensure a good fit of the gpd to the data for the datasets considered here it was found that the maximum percentile which could be used for the threshold level differed between the two datasets with the integrals for site a remaining invariant for thresholds up to the 99 5 quantile h s 8 m but the integrals for site b remaining invariant only up to the 95 quantile h s 7 m the difference in sensitivity is due to the different shapes of the tails of the distribution discussed below with the distribution for site a having a longer tail than for site b meaning that exceedance probabilities decrease with h s at a lower rate in the tail of the distribution for site a fortunately for both datasets it was found that the gpd provides a good fit to the data for lower threshold values than this as discussed below the gpd fitted to the tail of the distribution gives the conditional non exceedance probability pr h s h h s u where u is the threshold level the cdf of h s can then be calculated as 42 pr h s h 1 pr h s u 1 pr h s h h s u where pr h s u is the fraction of samples where h s exceeds the threshold the gpd is defined as 43 pr x h x u 1 1 ξ h u σ 1 ξ f o r ξ 0 a n d σ 0 1 exp h u σ f o r ξ 0 a n d σ 0 here the variable x denotes either h s h m p or h m a x depending on the application the parameters σ and ξ are the scale and shape parameters respectively when ξ 0 the distribution is unbounded from above and referred to as heavy tailed or long tailed when ξ 0 the distribution has a maximum value equal to u σ ξ and is referred to as short tailed the methods used to estimate the parameters of the gpd and select the threshold are discussed in the following two subsections it is worth noting that some practitioners opt to use the weibull distribution for modelling the tail of the long term distribution rather than the gpd jonathan and ewans 2013 discuss differences between the gpd and weibull approach and note that using a weibull distribution implicitly constrains the tail to be unbounded from above it is reasonable to expect an upper bound on storm peak h s or wave heights due to physical constraints such as fetch limitations or water depth the use of the gpd allows for the possibility of an upper bound on the tail of the distribution whereas the weibull distribution does not the use of the gpd for modelling the tail of the distribution is also justified by asymptotic arguments see e g coles 2001 for these reasons the gpd has been used to model the tails of the long term distributions in this work 6 3 1 gpd parameter estimation the method used to estimate the parameters of the gpd can have a significant influence on results especially with relatively small sample sizes mackay et al 2011 the metocean time series available for estimating extreme values are typically quite short in relation to the return periods of interest resulting in small samples sizes this means that using accurate estimators is important the maximum likelihood ml method is commonly used in metocean applications e g jonathan and ewans 2013 due to its asymptotic properties of being unbiased and having the lowest possible variance however the ml estimators do not achieve these asymptotic properties until large sample sizes hosking and wallis 1987 showed that the ml estimators are non optimal for sample sizes up to 500 with higher bias and variance than other estimators such as the moments and probability weighted moments estimators hosking and wallis also noted that sometimes solutions to the ml equations do not exist and that at other times when a solution does exist there can be convergence problems with the algorithm they used to find them estimation of the gpd parameters is the subject of ongoing research a quantitative comparison of recent methods for estimating the parameters was presented by kang and song 2017 they concluded that the empirical bayesian likelihood method ebm of zhang 2010 has one of the best performances in a wide range of cases the ebm method is both computationally efficient and has low bias and variance compared to other methods which is especially important for the mc method where the fitting is performed for each random trial the ebm method has therefore been used in this work an algorithm for calculating the ebm estimators of the gpd parameters was provided by zhang 2010 using the r statistical language which can easily be

observations and violating the asymptotic arguments which justify the use of the gpd various methods have been proposed for selecting an appropriate threshold an overview of graphical methods is presented by coles 2001 and jonathan and ewans 2013 discuss some more recent studies in this work the threshold has been selected by fitting the gpd for a range of thresholds and selecting the threshold as the lowest value for which the shape parameter ξ and estimates of high quantiles of the distribution reach an approximately stable value for each threshold value a bootstrap technique is used to establish confidence bounds on the estimates at each trial of the bootstrap procedure a random error is added to each resampled data point corresponding to the sampling uncertainty in the measurement this addition of a random error helps smooth the threshold plots making trends easier to identify the sampling distribution of h s is approximately guassian with a coefficient of variation of cov h s α t m d σ where α 0 48 for a pierson moskowitz spectrum and α 0 61 for a jonswap spectrum with peak enhancement factor of 3 3 forristall et al 1996 in our datasets d σ 1200 s and the mean value of t m d σ was 0 067 for site a and 0 082 for site b a value of cov h s 0 04 has been used for both datasets as a representative value given the range of spectral shapes and values of t m threshold selection plots for the fit of the gpd to measured h s for each dataset are shown in fig 7 note that for the aw and ssm methods the gpd is fitted to all values of h s exceeding the threshold and no declustering is applied for site b the threshold has been selected as 7 5 m since both the gpd shape parameter and 50 year return value of h s tend to approximately constant values above this threshold there are 44 storms where the peak h s exceeds 7 5 m or 1 4 storms per year for site a the shape parameter and 50 year return values also appear approximately constant for thresholds above 7 5 m however in this case there are only two storms where the peak h s exceeds 7 5 m which is insufficient to establish a reliable fit to the tail of the distribution instead the threshold has been set at 5 m where there is also a period of stability in the gpd shape parameter and for which there are 54 storms where the peak h s exceeds the threshold 2 4 storms per year the fit of the gpd to the data at the selected thresholds is shown in fig 8 in both cases the gpd provides a good visual fit to the data note that at site a for the two storms where the peak h s exceeds 7 5 m there are 17 hourly records with h s exceeding 7 5 m the fitting of equivalent storms defined in terms of the gumbel and gev distributions to the two datasets was discussed in detail by mackay and johanning 2018a and is not repeated here the threshold selection plots for the fit of the gpd to the most probable maximum crest height in each storm c m p are shown in fig 9 in this case there is a clear choice of threshold for both datasets for site a both the shape parameter and 50 year return value of c m p are approximately stable for thresholds above 5 m and for site b stability is reached at 5 5 m the fit of the gpd to each dataset at the selected threshold level is shown in fig 10 and appears satisfactory in both cases for site a the distribution is long tailed due to the occurrence of two large storms with c m p 2 m higher than all other storms in contrast the distribution for site b is short tailed and there is a relatively close grouping in the values of c m p for the largest storms for the mc method the threshold is selected by fitting to the declustered values of c m e d the median value of the maximum crest height in each storm defined in section 4 3 2 fig 11 shows the maximum value of c m e d in each storm compared to c m p for both datasets the value of c m p is slightly larger than max c m e d on average but the two variables are strongly correlated with a pearson correlation coefficient in excess of 0 99 given the very strong correlation in the two variables the choice of threshold for the equivalent storm method will also be appropriate for the mc method and has been applied here 6 4 comparison of return values of individual crest heights fig 12 shows the return values of maximum crest heights calculated using each method for both datasets the aw method gives the highest predicted crest heights at return periods of 1 year but converges with the predicted crest heights from the ssm method for return periods of greater than 10 years as expected from the theoretical considerations presented in section 4 the storm based methods agree well for both datasets for site a the gumbel and gev methods are in close agreement over the entire range of return periods whereas for site b the gumbel method produces slightly lower estimates at higher return periods mackay and johanning 2018a showed that for this dataset the gumbel and gev methods agreed better if ln n is modelled as linearly dependent on c m p rather than constant the difference in the estimate of c m a x at the 100 year level between the gumbel and gev methods is around 0 2 m and remains similar at the 1000 year level given the uncertainty in the estimates due to the finite length of the metocean dataset discussed further in section 7 2 2 the difference between the two methods is not significant for site a the aw and ssm methods result in significantly higher predictions at lower return periods than the storm based methods with a difference of 1 5 m at a return period of 10years and 1 1 m at a return period of 100years for site b the aw and ssm methods agree better with the storm based methods and give slightly lower predictions at return periods above 50 years given that the aw and ssm methods neglect serial correlation in sea states it would be reasonable to expect that they would give higher estimates of return values than the storm based methods for both datasets however the difference between the return values calculated using aw and ssm methods and storm based methods will depend both on the level of serial correlation in the extreme values and also any differences in the fitted distributions of h s and c m p given the uncertainty in the fitted distributions it is not possible to conclude from this example whether the differences in the return values observed for site a are due to serial correlation or uncertainty in the fitted distributions the simulations presented in the following section remove the influence of the uncertainty in the fitted distributions to illustrate the differences that arise from serial correlation only 7 application to synthesised data in this section synthesised time series of sea states are used to investigate the accuracy of each method the synthetic time series are not intended to be precise representations of the wave climates at either of the locations considered in the previous section but are intended to capture realistic features of wave climates in order to assess the accuracy of the models for the long term distributions of individual crest heights section 7 1 describes the method used to synthesise the time series and the application of the models to the synthetic data is described in section 7 2 7 1 creation of synthetic time series numerous methods have been proposed for generating synthetic time series of sea states see monbet et al 2007 for a review the challenge here is to generate a synthetic time series where the extreme characteristics are representative of a real situation and the joint evolution of sea state parameters during storms follows realistic patterns matching the observed dependence structures both in terms of serial correlation and the joint distribution of parameters a block resampling method härdle et al 2003 has been applied here where the measured time series of sea states is divided into discrete blocks and these blocks are resampled with replacement the blocks correspond to storms where the peak h s can be considered independent independent values of storm peak h s are defined in the same way as before as maxima within a 5 day moving window the dividing points between blocks are defined to be the minimum value of h s between adjacent storm peaks blocks with more than 10 missing data have been discarded dividing the time series in this way ensures that the maximum crest heights in each block are independent and that storm histories are realistic if the time series was resampled without modification this would mean that the maximum h s over any time period would be the maximum observed h s to overcome this a distribution is fitted to the observed values of storm peak h s which can be used to extrapolate to extreme values described below to generate a storm with a random peak h s a random variable is generated from the fitted distribution and a block is selected at random from the 20 measured storms with the closest peak h s the values of h s in the randomly selected measured storm are then linearly rescaled so that the peak h s matches the randomly generated value the values of t m and t z are scaled to maintain the observed steepness if we denote the ratio of the random storm peak h s to the measured storm peak h s as r h s p e a k r h s p e a k m where the superscripts denote the random and measured values then the rescaled values of t m and t z in the random storm are given by t m r t m m r and t z r t z m r the reason for selecting the random storm from only the measured storms with the closest values of peak h s is that the characteristics of the storms change with h s so sampling from the nearest neighbours preserves this relation from fig 2 it is clear that the distribution of t z is dependent on h s the distribution of h s within a storm is also conditional on the value of the storm peak h s fig 13 shows the distribution of h s h s p e a k binned by the value of storm peak h s it is evident that the distribution changes with the value of storm peak h s and that the patterns differ between the two datasets with the largest storms at site a having a more peaked shape than the largest storms at site b to avoid the problems with associated with initial distribution methods discussed in section 6 3 the distribution of storm peak h s is fitted with a two part model using a lognormal model for the body of the data and a gpd model for the tail a smooth transition between the models for the body and tail of the distribution is achieved using a mixing function defined as 44 m h 1 2 1 tanh h v d where v is the mixing point and d is the mixing distance the model for the cdf of storm peak h s is then given by 45 pr h s p e a k h 1 m h p b o d y h m h p t a i l h it was found that setting d 0 5 and v u d where u is the threshold at which the gpd is fitted gave a smooth transitions for both datasets the threshold for the gpd was selected as u 5 25 m for site a and u 5 75 m for site b the fit of the models to the data are shown in fig 14 the models provide a good visual fit both in the bodies and the tails of the distributions scatter plots of h s against t z for example 500 year simulations are shown in fig 15 together with the measured h s against t z the block resampling method provides a realistic looking joint distribution which replicates the observed shapes reasonably well and preserves the relationship between h s and significant steepness however as the method does not create new storm histories but simply rescales measured storms the storm with the largest value of t z at site a has been resampled several times exaggerating this part of the distribution it is reasonable to ask whether resampling of measured storms will give an adequate representation of the variability in storm characteristics mackay and johanning 2018a showed that the distribution of the maximum crest heights in storms can be very accurately represented in terms of the three parameter gev moreover the joint distribution of the fitted gev parameters exhibits remarkably regular characteristics with the scale parameter b being strongly correlated to the location parameter a c m p and the shape parameter k taking a narrow distribution of values approximately independent of a due to this regularity in the distribution of the maximum crest heights in measured storms the block resampling method should give an adequate representation of the variability in storm characteristics no attempt has been made to capture the seasonal variation in sea states in the synthetic time series the rationale for this is that sampling all storms at random will capture the distribution of storms throughout the year over a one year section of simulated time series the seasonal variation in storms should be captured on average moreover as we have assumed that the time series is composed of independent blocks it is only the distribution of storms within the year that determines the distribution of the maximum crest height in the year and not the order in which storms occur this argument is analogous to the argument that the order of sea states within a storm does not affect the distribution of the maximum crest height in the storm 7 2 results and discussion a 100 000 year synthetic time series of sea states was generated for each dataset for each sea state a random maximum crest height was simulated from the forristall 2000 distribution using the method described in section 4 3 2 the largest crest in each year of the synthetic time series was extracted and used to form an empirical estimate of pr c m a x h 1 year from which return values were calculated using 1 the return periods estimated from the 100 000 year simulation have approximately a 3 std at the 100 year level and a 10 std at the 1000 year level see appendix a the synthetic time series were used to assess the accuracy of the ssm es and mc methods in two ways as described in the following sections the aw method was not considered in this section as it gives identical results to the ssm method for return periods above 10years 7 2 1 example 1 distributions derived from 100 000 year simulation in the first example the long term distributions pr h s h and pr c m p h have been derived from the full 100 000 year simulated time series this effectively eliminates the uncertainty associated with fitting the distributions and isolates the effect of serial correlation on the estimated return values the values of c m p were calculated explicitly for each simulated storm since the variation of c m p with h s p e a k is nonlinear due to the dependence of the short term distribution parameters on the ursell number to reduce computational time the gumbel and gev distributions were not fitted to the distribution of the maximum crest height in the simulated storms instead the gumbel and gev parameters that were calculated from the measured data were applied in the simulations i e the mean value of ln n for the gumbel method and for the gev the mean value of k and linear model b h m p similarly the linear models for the variation of the short term distribution parameters α h s and β h s derived from the measured data were also used here for the calculations using the ssm method the mc method is not considered in this example as the long term distribution is assumed to be known there is no fitting stage involved for the mc method this means that the application of the mc method to the simulated sea states would be identical to the method used to derive the simulated crest heights the return values of c m a x calculated using the ssm and storm based methods are compared to the simulated values in fig 16 the estimates are very similar to those shown in fig 12 indicating that the models derived for pr h s h and pr c m p h for the measured data were reasonably accurate the return values from the gev method are very close to the simulated values for both datasets whereas the gumbel method produces slightly lower estimates than the simulated values as mentioned in section 6 4 this is likely to be due using a constant value of ln n in the gumbel model rather than a value that is linearly dependent on c m p see mackay and johanning 2018a the ssm method gives return values that are close to the simulated values for site b but significantly overestimates return values for site a in section 6 2 the serial dependence in sea states during high storms was shown to be similar for both datasets why then does neglecting serial correlation give reasonable results for one dataset but not the other the fitted distribution of storm peak h s for site b was short tailed with the gpd shape parameter ξ 0 2 3 whereas the distribution of storm peak h s for site a was marginally long tailed with ξ 0 03 this means that the difference between the 10 year and 100 year h s is larger for site a than for site b so when a storm occurs with h s h s 100 at site b there are only a few sea states with h s h s 10 whereas a storm with h s h s 100 for site a will contain many sea states with h s h s 10 therefore neglecting serial correlation will have a larger impact when the distribution of storm peak h s is long tailed to test this explanation the simulations for site a were repeated with gpd shape parameter set at values of ξ 0 2 0 1 0 and 0 05 all other variables were left unchanged in particular the same set of measured storms was resampled the assumed distributions of h s p e a k are shown in fig 17 a and the bias in the return values of c m a x calculated using the ssm method for each set of simulations are shown in fig 17 b as expected the bias increases with increasing shape parameter this confirms that the tail shape has the dominant influence on the level of bias caused by neglecting serial correlation 7 2 2 example 2 distributions derived from 20 year simulations the second example is designed to examine the robustness of the estimated return values when the long term distributions are fitted to the data the true return periods are calculated in the same way as in example 1 using 100 000 year simulations for each dataset the distributions pr h s h and pr c m p h are fitted to 20 year simulations which is representative of a real situation using measured or hindcast data analogous to that described in section 6 the thresholds identified in section 6 3 2 for fitting the gpd have also been used here the fitting process was repeated 1000 times on different 20 year simulations to establish the mean and std of the return periods calculated using each method the mean and std of the return values over the 1000 simulations are shown in figs 18 and 19 the storm based methods give very similar predictions for both datasets they produce a small positive bias in the predicted return values for both datasets this positive bias is a result of the estimators used for the gpd parameters which is a known feature of the ebm method kang and song 2017 however of the estimators considered the ebm method performed the best in terms of bias and std in particular using ml estimators results in larger bias and much slower computations the gumbel and gev methods have very similar stds for both datasets the std for the mc method is similar to that for the gumbel and gev methods at return periods up to 100 years but differs slightly at longer return periods with a slightly higher std for site a and slightly lower std for site b the ssm method performs similarly here to the previous examples with a significant positive bias for low return periods at site a and a negative bias at high return periods for site b the estimates from the ssm method are in close agreement with the simulated return values interestingly the ssm method gives a higher std in return value estimates than the storm based methods at return periods less than 200 years but lower std at longer return periods the higher std at low return periods is likely related to the ssm method neglecting serial correlation when a single large storm occurs which has multiple sea states above the 100 year level the inclusion of all these sea states in the long term distribution affects return values at low return periods in contrast the occurrence of such a storm only affects a single data point used in the inference for the storm based methods which results in greater stability in the estimates at lower return periods 8 conclusions this paper has considered three methods for combining the long term distribution of sea states with the short term distribution of wave or crest heights conditional on sea state it has been demonstrated both theoretically and numerically that methods which treat all waves as independent events give the same long term distributions as methods that treat the maximum wave height in each sea state as independent events both of these methods neglect the effects of serial correlation in sea states the numerical simulations presented in this work show that this can lead to significant positive bias in estimates of return values of individual wave and crest heights the size of the positive bias is dependent on the shape of the tail of the distribution of storm peak h s with longer tails larger values of the gpd shape parameter leading to larger bias it was shown that storm based methods give accurate predictions of return periods of individual wave heights the method of tromans and vanderschuren 1995 which models the distribution of the maximum wave height in a storm using a gumbel distribution gives very similar results to the gev method of mackay and johanning 2018a the gumbel method produces a slight underestimate of return values when the number of waves in the storm ln n is assumed to be constant the monte carlo method proposed by mackay and johanning 2018b was shown to compare well to the gumbel and gev storm based methods for both the measured and simulated data of all the models considered the monte carlo method requires the fewest assumptions and fitting stages with subjective judgements from the user it does not require calculating the distribution of the maximum wave height in measured storms fitting equivalent storms estimating joint distributions of storm parameters or combining distributions via integration also in comparison to the all wave and sea state maxima methods there is no requirement to form models of for the mean values of the short term distribution parameters as a function of h s it is therefore recommended that the monte carlo method should be used for calculating return periods of individual wave and crest heights declarations of interest none acknowledgement this work was partly funded through epsrc grant ep r007519 1 appendix a sampling properties of return periods the sampling properties of the return periods estimated from the data can be derived as follows denote the ordered sample of annual maximum wave or crest heights as h 1 h 2 h n where n is the length of the dataset in years the empirical non exceedance probability for the k t h order statistic is defined as a 1 p k n 1 define a 2 p k pr h k h note that p k is a random variable but p is not for any sample p is always given by a 1 the empirical return period associated with the k t h order statistic is a 3 t 1 1 p which is also fixed for any sample however the true return period t 1 1 p k associated with the k t h order statistic is a random variable whose sampling properties can be derived in terms of the distribution of p k the variable p k follows a beta distribution david and nagaraja 2003 with density function given by a 4 f p k n k 1 n k p k k 1 1 p k n k the expected values of t and t 2 are a 5 e t n k 1 n k 0 1 p k 1 1 p n k 1 p d p n n k a 6 e t 2 n k 1 n k 0 1 p k 1 1 p n k 1 p 2 d p n n 1 n k n k 1 the variance of t is given by a 7 var t e t 2 e t 2 k n n k 2 n k 1 from a 1 and a 3 we have a 8 k n 1 t 1 t substituting this into a 7 we arrive at a 9 s t d t t 1 n t 1 n n 1 t 1 n 2 t 1 t n 1 2 the function in a 9 is plotted in fig 20 using a value of n 10 5 years the estimated return periods from the 100 000 year simulations have a 3 std at the 100 year level and a 10 std at the 1000 year level substituting a 8 into a 5 gives the expected value of the sample return periods as a 10 e t n n t 1 t when n is large and n t the term in brackets is close to unity but when t is close to n there can be a significant positive bias in the sample return periods for the 100 000 year simulations the bias is approximately 0 1 at the 100 year level and 1 at the 1000 year level the bias is therefore effectively negligible compared to the std 
23149,marine operations need to be executed in a cost effective and safe manner safety depends on safety margins that are included in the operational limits these operational limits are normally given in terms of sea state parameters i e significant wave height hs and peak period tp here denoted as hs tp safety margins on hs tp should account for various sources of uncertainties in weather forecasts wave spectral shape numerical models etc wave spectra at an offshore site may be multi modal and not necessarily resemble analytical spectra such as joint north sea wave project jonswap or pierson moskowitz pm models since floating vessels are sensitive to wave spectral energy distribution hs tp operational limits should account for this source of uncertainty this paper provides a general methodology to assess the uncertainty in hs tp limits due to variability in wave spectral energy distribution this is important for safe execution of marine operations the methodology uses response based operational limits directional 2d hindcast wave spectra and dynamic coupled models of marine operation activities a case study of an offshore wind turbine transition piece installation is shown to illustrate the proposed methodology keywords operational limits marine operations allowable sea states wave spectra uncertainty 1 introduction marine operations such as towing heavy lifting and float over are normally executed following operational procedures in which the duration and operational limits for each activity are provided these operational limits are given in terms of environmental parameters such as significant wave height hs peak period tp and wind speed vw and in terms of dynamic vessel responses this is because these parameters are practical and can be measured on board however these operational limits are often set based on experience of marine installation contractors and thus they are not derived systematically using a validated numerical model peace et al 1985 clauss and riekert 1990 for operations dominated by waves operational limits expressed in terms of hs and tp which are commonly denoted as hs tp should be derived systematically and provide the same safety level as the allowable limit of a dynamic response or a structural capacity for example a crane or lifting wire capacity is the operational limit of a heavy lifting operation for pipelaying operations clauss et al 1998 developed a numerical method to transform the allowable stresses in the pipe into hs tp limits moreover guachamin acero et al 2016b proposed a general methodology to express allowable structural or motion responses in terms of allowable limits of sea states hs tp these limits are response based and practical and they provide the same safety levels as the structural capacity of structural components this general methodology has already been applied in analyses of various marine operations li et al 2016a b guachamin acero et al 2017b to date state of the art offshore standards for planning and execution of marine operations such as dnv 2011a dnv gl 2015 and iso 2015 recommend that the operational limits should be expressed in terms of hs however tp is not taken into consideration which is a relevant parameter for floating vessels operational limits described above are deterministic and thus these limits do not account for various sources of uncertainties in forecasted wave parameters numerical models human decisions etc an assessment of these sources of uncertainties is necessary for safe execution of marine operations the hs operational limits recommended by dnv 2011a dnv gl 2015 and iso 2015 are reduced by alpha factors that account for uncertainties in weather forecast these alpha factors depend on the duration of operations the threshold levels of these limits and whether or not meteorologists or measurement equipment are available on site alternatively instead of alpha factors uncertainties in forecasted hs and tp parameters can be assessed statistically from the error distributions between the forecasted and the hindcast or measured wave parameters natskår et al 2015 de girolamo et al 2017 operational limits together with weather forecasts can be used to find workable weather windows for safe execution of marine operations to reduce uncertainties in weather forecast gintautas and sørensen 2017 proposed a methodology that combines ensembles of weather forecast with on board time domain simulations workable weather windows are obtained by directly comparing the structural capacity or allowable responses of structures with the predicted dynamic responses using weather forecasts although this approach reduces uncertainties in forecasted hs and tp the wave spectra used for the dynamic analyses are the analytical joint north sea wave project jonswap or the pierson moskowitz pm wave spectral models the wave spectra at sea may be multi modal and not necessarily resemble the analytical spectra and thus both spectra may predict different responses to reduce uncertainties in dynamic responses of vessels investigations were carried out by the european commission eu project safe offloading from floating lng platforms safe offload in this project dynamic responses were assessed by considering wind sea and swell components separately this is done to develop strategies for heading selection when planning the operations hagen et al 2015 ewans and jameson 2015 bitner gregersen 2015 moreover an interactive simulator was developed for training of personnel and for testing critical operations varela and guedes soares 2015 simulators are necessary to set operational limits on motion responses or environmental parameters and to reduce the risk of failure during execution of marine operations from the information given above it is observed that both environmental parameters and allowable dynamic responses of structures can be used as operational limits these limits can be modified to account for uncertainties in forecasted wave parameters however even if the forecasted hs tp wave parameters are accurate there will be differences between the measured and calculated dynamic responses of offshore structures this is because the wave energy distribution or the spectral shape of the analytical and the hindcast or forecasted wave spectra are different in fact measured wave spectra can be multi modal with several peak periods and directional components operational limits in terms of hs tp are normally established during the planning phase they depend on the dynamic responses of the floating structures under action of short crested seas which are generally modeled using analytical jonswap or pm formulations thus hs tp limits depend on these input wave spectra since analytical wave spectra may not resemble the actual forecasted or measured directional 2d spectra in open seas unexpected responses of floating vessels during execution of a marine operation can occur this also implies that the safety level in structural components can be lower than expected hs tp limits should be simple and practical to be used on boar vessels but they need to account for uncertainties in wave spectral energy distribution this paper aims at providing a general methodology to express operational limits in terms of hs tp that include uncertainties in wave spectral energy distribution this is necessary for planning and safe execution of marine operations other environmental parameters such as current and wind speed are not considered this paper firstly provides an introduction to the state of the art techniques for assessment of operational limits then a methodology for systematic derivation of hs tp limits is discussed this methodology is the basis for the development of the new general methodology that includes uncertainties in wave spectral energy distribution the new methodology is applied to a case study of an offshore wind turbine transition piece installation 2 response based operational limits and directional wave spectra this section provides a brief introduction to a state of the art method for systematic derivation of response based operational limits and the basis for assessment of uncertainties in operational limits using analytical formulations of directional wave spectra such as jonswap or pm this is necessary for development of a new methodology introduced in the sec 3 2 1 response based operational limits guachamin acero et al 2016b proposed a methodology for systematic assessment of response based operational limits of marine operations based on this methodology a response parameter such as motion or structural capacity can be expressed in terms of allowable limits of sea states hs tp the authors recommended a procedure to assess the dynamic responses of an operation and to identify a response that limit an operation take as an example the installation of a topside module onto a jacket structure fig 1 shows three loading conditions for the operation loading condition lc 1 corresponds to a monitoring phase where the structure responses are monitored prior to lifting the module loading condition lc 2 refers to the actual non stationary lowering of the module onto the jacket and the winch of the crane is running with a certain speed in this condition loading condition lc 3 is a stationary condition and is similar to lc 2 but does not include a running winch for these loading conditions fig 2 shows the allowable limits of environmental and dynamic response parameters that can be used for safe execution of such operation for the load condition lc 2 shown in fig 1 b the parameter that limits the operation limiting parameter is the impact force between the module and the jacket structure see fig 2 b by conducting repetitive simulations of the module lowering operation a characteristic value of the impact force can be calculated note that the stochastic impact force can only be obtained by numerically modeling the actual non stationary lowering operations sandvik 2012 this characteristic value needs to be compared with the corresponding allowable limit which is obtained from structural analysis of the mechanical components then the allowable limits of sea states hs tp can be determined see fig 2 a these hs tp limits are practical information for making a decision at lc 1 monitoring phase shown in fig 1 a prior to the execution of a marine operation by comparing the forecasted and the hs tp limits a decision on whether to start or not an operation is made these hs tp limits provide the same safety levels as the allowable impact force on the structural components more details on this method are given by guachamin acero et al 2016b in fig 1 c a new lc 3 is defined this loading condition is similar to lc 2 the non stationary condition shown in 1 b but the winch speed is not modeled load condition lc 3 is defined with the aim of replacing lc 2 this is because the dynamic system for lc 3 can be analyzed using the frequency domain or the steady state time domain method load condition lc 3 is necessary for the development of the new methodology in sec 3 the first non linear impact force resulting from the contact between the module and the jacket in lc 2 see fig 1 b depends on the impact velocity see eq 1 dnv 2011b hamilton and ramzan 1991 in this equation f i m p is the impact force v i m p is the impact velocity k is the contact stiffness and m is the mass of the payload thus the impact velocity is a parameter that can be used to predict impact forces in fact eq 1 can also be used to predict snap loads on wire ropes during lift off operations a limitation of this equation is that it can only be used to predict the first impact and thus what happens after the first impact cannot be predicted 1 f i m p v i m p k m landing lift off and mating operations are normally critical operations where the winch speed is very low because of that it is reasonable to assume that an impact velocity will be mainly governed by the vessel responses due to wave actions thus it is expected that a constant value of an allowable limit of an impact force will be equivalent to a constant value of an allowable limit of an impact velocity this is a key assumption for the development of the method that is introduced in the sec 3 in this paper the impact force or corresponding impact velocity which correspond to lc 2 are referred as basic limiting parameters because they limit the lifting operation for other marine operations such as transportation position keeping or float over the limiting parameters would be motions of specific parts of the structures these are particular cases with loading conditions that can be treated in a similar manner it is important to recognize that the hs tp operational limits shown in fig 2 a are practical but they are dependent on the wave spectra used to compute the dynamic responses however the basic limiting parameters are independent of the wave spectra since the wave spectra at sea are generally multi modal and cannot be represented using analytical spectral formulations it is necessary to include the effects of the wave energy distribution on the operational limits this will be addressed in the methodology developed in sec 3 2 2 analytical and hindcast directional wave spectra in marine operations it is important to model the environmental parameters in a realistic and accurate manner this is because the allowable motion responses of structures during operations are normally small and structural components can work at high demand offshore standards such as dnv 2011b provide guidelines for modeling of wave spectra analytical spectral models such as jonswap or pm models together with spreading functions are commonly used for modeling wave actions although these models were developed for the north sea for steady unidirectional wind conditions they are used worldwide it is well known that in several offshore sites including the north sea there are combined actions of wind seas and swells the energy distribution of the resulting multi modal wave spectra can result in unexpected vessel responses if the wave information is not adequately described this fact was experienced by the heavy lift vessel hlv svane which experienced large motions in swells causing delays and extra costs in the sheringham shoal offshore wind farm project sandelson 2011 although there exist formulations for combined wind seas and swells such as the bi modal torsethaugen spectrum which was derived for the norwegian continental shelf the hs and tp parameters for the wave components can be a result of inaccurate partitioning bitner gregersen and toffoli 2009 the partition is done to simplify the information provided by meteorologists to marine contractors in the partitioning process more uncertainties are introduced this is because the hs and tp parameters obtained from the partitioning process cannot be used to reconstruct the real 2d wave spectra using analytical spectral formulations thus these uncertainties need to be included in the operational limits hs tp when used on board vessels fig 3 shows examples of reconstructed using jonswap model and 2d hindcast wave spectra it is observed that although the total hs is the same the energy distribution or spectral shape is different these spectra have been applied to a numerical model of a crane vessel with a natural roll period of 10 s the resulting 2d roll response spectra are different see fig 4 for the 2d reconstructed jonswap spectrum a single amplitude significant roll response of 0 69 deg is obtained while for the 2d hindcast spectrum the result is much lower i e 0 01 deg therefore an improper representation of the actual wave spectra can introduce large uncertainties in the dynamic responses these uncertainties should be accounted for by including safety margins on the hs tp operational limits in principle historical data of 2d measured wave spectra should be used for assessment of dynamic responses of a vessel when planning a marine operation unfortunately this information is generally not available and instead 2d hindcast spectra can be used feld et al 2004 have shown that hs from measurements and hindcast models are well correlated however other wave parameters such as tp and the peakness factor show more scatter and in general hindcast spectra are less peaked than measured spectra thus if the wave energy is close to the natural frequencies of a dynamic system some differences in the responses can be expected in this paper only 2d hindcast wave spectra are considered and they are compared with the 2d reconstructed wave spectra for assessment of uncertainties associated with their differences 3 methodology for assessment of operational limits including uncertainties in wave spectral energy distribution the detailed procedure for assessment of the operational limits hs tp including uncertainties in wave spectral energy distribution is given in this section fig 5 shows an overview of the proposed general methodology according to a previous study carried out by guachamin acero et al 2016b and briefly described in subsection 2 1 steps 1 3 are required to systematically assess the operational limits in terms of hs tp in step 1 the dynamic system for lc 2 is used to simulate the actual non stationary lowering operation using as input analytical 2d wave spectral models step 2 shows the dynamic responses and corresponding allowable limits which are compared with each other to identify the hs tp limits shown in step 3 note that these hs tp limits will provide the same safety levels as the basic limiting parameter e g impact force or impact velocity shown in step 2 however the hs tp limits in step 3 do not include uncertainties from wave spectral energy distribution in step 4 lc 3 is used see also fig 1 c unlike lc 2 corresponding to a non stationary lowering process the dynamic system for lc 3 is weakly non linear and the stochastic process from which a dynamic response is assessed is stationary because the winch speed in this loading condition is not modeled the operational limits hs tp obtained in step 3 are applied on the dynamic system of lc 3 step 4 and dynamic responses such as crane tip or module velocity can be calculated see step 5 these dynamic responses resulting from the dynamic system of lc 3 are referred as auxiliary limiting parameters since this auxiliary limiting parameter is equivalent to the basic limiting parameter impact force or impact velocity with constant allowable limit the new allowable limit of the auxiliary limiting parameter e g the crane tip velocity will have an approximate constant value as well see allowable limits in steps 2 and 5 note that an allowable limit in step 5 cannot be added to the winch velocity to obtain the allowable limit of impact velocity in step 2 because the response statistics in each condition are different sandvik 2012 step 6 shows statistical parameters significant responses of the auxiliary limiting parameter for lc 3 which are computed using 2d hindcast wave spectra and response amplitude operators raos see eq 2 2 m 0 0 2 π ω 1 ω 2 r a o 2 ω θ s ω θ d ω d θ where m 0 is the zeroth order spectral moment variance of a dynamic response r a o ω θ is the 2d response amplitude operator and s ω θ is the 2d wave spectra as it is shown above frequency domain fd methods can be used to compute the responses of dynamic system for lc 3 using hindcast data because lc3 is stationary and the system is weakly non linear this approach is much more computationally efficient than to compute non stationary dynamic responses of lc 2 using the time domain td method to assess the uncertainties of the allowable sea states 2d hindcast wave spectra data of several years or seasons can be used in step 6 and vessel responses at different headings can be calculated the resulting hindcast dynamic responses are compared with the allowable limit of the auxiliary limiting parameter obtained in step 5 the points of intersection of the hindcast dynamic responses are selected which provide the new allowable hs tp limits the values collected for hs are grouped for intervals of tp and a histogram for hs tp can be obtained alternatively for a given tp hs values can be fitted to a probability distribution function see step 7 a percentile q for the distribution of every hs tp should be established this is done to select a characteristic hs tp value the magnitude of q depends on the required safety levels and risks associated with the marine operation for example a value of q 0 95 means that 95 of hs values for a specific tp range will be lower than the characteristic value of hs thus characteristic values of hs tp for each tp range can be plotted see step 8 the allowable limits of sea states provided in step 8 include uncertainties in wave spectra energy distribution these limits are independent of the input wave spectra used in analyses of lc 2 step 2 because a new auxiliary limiting parameter with constant value is used for the most risky marine operations such as lift off mating and lowering the auxiliary limiting parameter can be a velocity of a relevant part of the structure e g crane tip velocity this is because this velocity is equivalent to the basic limiting parameter such as impact force or velocity for other stationary operations there is no necessity of an auxiliary limiting parameter and thus the basic limiting parameters can be used these are particular cases of the general methodology proposed in this paper finally the hs tp operational limits derived with the proposed methodology can be compared with the forecasted hs and tp parameters and on board decisions can be made in a safer manner 4 case study on owt transition piece installation the general methodology proposed in sec 3 is applied to the installation of an offshore wind turbine owt transition piece tp using a floating heavy lift vessel hlv see fig 6 within the entire installation the landing phase of the tp onto the monopile mp is normally a critical activity because structural failure of a bracket support can occur if the impact loads or velocities exceed their allowable limits fig 7 detail x shows the bracket support of the tp landing onto the monopile tip this phase is selected for the case study 4 1 numerical modeling in this subsection the main particulars of the structures numerical methods and numerical modeling parameters are briefly described they are necessary for assessment of the dynamic responses and thus the operational limits the main particulars of the hlv tp and mp are shown in table 1 these are typical values for a mp structure installed in 20 30 m water depth the main particulars are used to build a numerical model in the state of the art ansys aqwa suit of programs century dynamics ansys inc 2011 a physical model for the mp tp mating operation is shown in fig 7 a and the corresponding spring damper model is shown in fig 7 b mechanical properties for the spring damper elements and other modeling parameters are shown in table 2 the mating operation is normally carried out at low values of winch speed e g 2 m min which is applied in this paper more details of the modeling parameters chosen for this marine operation are given by guachamin acero et al 2017a since the dynamic system is non linear and the stochastic responses are result of a non stationary process the problem is solved using the time domain method a schematic view of the dynamic coupled model is shown in fig 8 4 2 assessment of operational limits the operational limits in terms of hs tp are assessed by following the general methodology proposed by guachamin acero et al 2016b according to fig 5 step 2 the characteristic value and the allowable limit of the impact force or impact velocity basic limiting parameters are needed in this case study the impact velocity is considered to assess the allowable limit of the impact velocity the allowable stress of the bracket supports need to be known this value depends on the yield strength of the material e g assume σ a l l o w n 500 20 mpa where n stands for normal random variable with corresponding mean value and standard deviation for a typical bracket support with 50 cm height and a plate with 3 5 cm thickness see fillet weld in fig 7 detail x the allowable impact force can be determined similarly due to uncertainties in the construction and soil properties a contact spring coefficient of k n 5 0 5 10 8 n m is assumed and based on eq 1 the impact velocity is obtained monte carlo simulation with 2000 samples is applied and for an assumed non exceedance probability of 0 99 the allowable impact velocity is approximately v a l l o w 0 20 m s a characteristic value of the impact velocity for each hs tp combination using jonswap spectra is calculated from time domain simulations of the non stationary tp lowering operation lc 2 for a non stationary lift off operation it was found that the statistical parameters maximum and standard deviation of a snap force in a cable converged after at approximately 45 random seeds guachamin acero et al 2016a in this study forty simulations each of them with an approximate duration of 2 min excluding transients are conducted for each sea state and the first impact velocities are selected the impact velocities are fitted into a probability distribution function the characteristic values were calculated for an assumed non exceedance probability of 0 997 of a gaussian distribution the non exceedance probability should be selected based on the desired reliability of the marine operation the characteristic values of impact velocities are compared with the allowable limit and the corresponding hs tp limits are identified fig 9 shows the results for allowable impact velocity of 0 2 m s in addition and for sake of comparison the results for an allowable limit of 0 15 m s are shown as well these operational limits correspond to step 3 in fig 5 similar results can be obtained for other headings of the installation vessel 4 3 operational limits including uncertainties in wave spectrum energy distribution operational limits obtained in fig 9 are semi probabilistic and they depend on the input wave spectra used to compute the dynamic responses and corresponding characteristic values as it was discussed earlier it is desired that these limits include safety margins due to uncertainties in wave spectral energy distribution the hs tp operational limits shown in fig 9 are applied into the dynamic system of lc 3 see fig 5 step 4 the dynamic responses which are allowable limits of the auxiliary limiting parameter are thus obtained in this case study the auxiliary parameter is chosen as the tp heave velocity v t p the results are shown in fig 10 where single amplitude significant velocities 2 rms are plotted rms stands for root mean squared value or m 0 note that other magnitudes rather than 2 rms for the allowable velocities can be selected and the reason is given at the end of this subsection because dynamic system of lc 3 is weakly non linear and the dynamic responses are results from a stationary process the steady state time domain method was applied the frequency domain method can also be applied in addition the surge and sway velocity components of the tp can be important for some structural components however they are not considered in this case study fig 10 shows that the allowable limits for tp heave velocities v t p as expected small variations over tp are observed for two allowable limits of impact velocities v a l l o w the allowable limits are also independent of the vessel heading for example the average tp heave velocity for v a l l o w 0 2 m s is v t p 0 12 m s and the average tp heave velocity for v a l l o w 0 15 m s is v t p 0 07 m s an averaged allowable tp heave velocity from fig 10 is further used in this case study the dynamic responses of lc 3 are obtained using the 2d response amplitude operators raos and 2d hindcast wave spectra the fd method was applied see eq 2 seven years 2d spectral wave data 2001 2007 sampled every hour were applied the data have been provided by li et al 2015 and correspond to the north sea site 15 time histories of hs are computed by integrating the energy density of the 2d hindcast wave spectra over all frequencies and directions and the tp refers to the highest peak of each 2d spectrum alternatively hs and tp time histories of combined wind sea and swell wave actions which are provided by meteorologic institutes can be used the averaged allowable tp heave velocities v t p of 0 12 and 0 07 m s from fig 10 are compared with 2 rms tp heave velocities computed using the 2d wave spectra as it was mentioned earlier other magnitudes rather than 2 rms could have been chosen as far as the allowable limits and dynamic responses are consistent with each other the hs tp for which the tp heave velocities are close to the corresponding allowable limits are selected the responses and the allowable limits do not need to be exactly equal see subsec 4 4 each hs value is classified according to a peak period tp range for each tp range a percentile or probability of non exceedance is chosen e g 0 8 20 can exceed the hs tp limits thus new hs tp operational limits are obtained see figs 11 and 12 similar figures can be obtained for other probabilities of non exceedance that will depend on the risks associated with the marine operations this procedure can be applied for any potential installation season heading and offshore site moreover these operational limits can directly be used to find weather windows during planning and execution of marine operations 4 4 discussions operational limits obtained in fig 9 are convenient for planning and execution of marine operations however these limits depend on the wave spectra at the offshore site this fact can result in unexpected vessel dynamic responses during execution of marine operations thus it is necessary to consider the associated uncertainties to these operational limits a parameter that resembles the impact force was assumed to be the tp impact velocity basic limiting parameters of lc 2 see eq 1 this equation is empirical and has been obtained by equating the potential and kinetic energies during impact in a quasi static condition considering that impact velocities during offshore installation occur at low values and that we are only interested in the first impact the assumption is valid the allowable limits of sea states hs tp were applied to the dynamic system of lc 3 from which fairly constant allowable limits of the tp heave velocity v t p were obtained see fig 10 these limits are equivalent to the allowable impact velocities v a l l o w of 0 20 and 0 15 m s see subsec 4 2 note that instead of the tp heave velocity crane tip velocity can also be used because both velocities are related to the impact force new v t p limits are computed as 2 rms but instead 1 3 or 4 rms can be used the averaged allowable limits of v t p are compared with the values obtained using 2d hindcast wave spectra for a proper assessment of the uncertainties in hs tp limits a significant sample size of hs and tp is required this is done by selecting a proper range for v t p for example a value of 0 11 m s can be represented by a range between 0 11 0 12 m s the hs tp limits shown in figs 11 and 12 were obtained using all year wave spectral data and such information is necessary on board hlvs when executing tp installations in practice installation campaigns are normally carried out during the summer season figs 13 and 14 correspond to hs tp limits for the period may september the results are different from those from figs 11 and 12 because local wind and swell direction can change during the year and thus wave energy distribution varies from season to season allowable limits of sea states can be monthly based but there is a risk that the number of data used to assess hs for every tp range is very limited or simply null figs 13 and 14 show that the available number of hs points for tp 12 s is very limited this is because these hs and tp combinations in this specific offshore site do not occur often or because the selection range is too narrow thus hs tp limits for these cases may not be applicable or they are not reliable fig 15 a shows the allowable h tp for a v t p range between 0 11 0 12 m s to obtain more data for hs and tp a practical solution is to increase the range for v t p e g 0 105 0 125 m s and thus the new hs tp limits shown in fig 15 b are more reliable that the hs tp limits shown in fig 15 a the operational limits obtained in figs 11 13 can be compared with the ones shown in fig 9 it is observed that there are significant differences in fact hs tp limits that include uncertainties in wave spectral energy distribution are fairly constant for this case study moreovoer these hs tp limits are derived systematically and this is important for safe execution of marine operations similar curves can be obtained for other marine operational phases and the combination from all these curves can be used to find weather windows for the execution of the entire operation 5 conclusions and recommendations marine operations need to be executed in a safe manner and safety depends on the safety margins that are included in the operational limits operational limits can be expressed in terms of environmental parameters such as significant wave height hs and peak period tp these hs tp limits depend on the 2d wave spectra used to compute dynamic responses because wave spectra at an offshore site may be multi modal and not necessarily resemble the typical jonswap or pm models the operational limits will vary for every offshore site a general methodology to assess hs tp operational including uncertainties in wave spectral energy distribution was developed the methodology uses the response based operational limits the 2d directional hindcast wave spectra and the dynamic coupled models of a marine operation the developed methodology transforms an allowable limit of a basic parameter that limits an operation i e impact force into an equivalent allowable limit of an auxiliary parameter such as the crane tip heave velocity for an equivalent loading condition of the coupled dynamic system and under certain assumptions 2d hindcast wave spectra were used to compute dynamic responses of this auxiliary parameter these responses were compared with the corresponding allowable limit and as a result hs tp limits that include uncertainties due to wave spectral energy distribution were obtained the methodology was applied on a case study of an offshore wind turbine transition piece installation significant differences in hs tp operational limits were observed when considering the uncertainties in the wave spectral shape this methodology can be used for several marine operations such as heavy lifting float over and subsea installation and can be applied to any offshore site and season the hs tp operational limits resulting from this methodology can be used to identify workable weather windows during planning or execution of marine operations based on these weather windows safer decisions on whether to start stop or not an operation can be made the proposed methodology has also some limitations it addresses uncertainties in hs tp limits by considering that the 2d hindcast wave spectra gives a true representation of the ocean surface this is not true since the 2d hindcast spectra may deviate from the measured wave spectra moreover the hs tp operational limits are derived for a combined sea of wind sea and swells in future the methodology should consider wind sea and swell components separately in addition other environmental parameters such as current speed and wind speed that are important for planning and execution of marine operations are not included it is recommended that other sources of uncertainties which are present in numerical models environmental parameters such as wind current and human decisions are included in the safety margins of hs tp limits this is important for reliability analysis of marine operations acknowledgments the first author acknowledges the financial support from project pij 15 03 elaboración de un

23149,marine operations need to be executed in a cost effective and safe manner safety depends on safety margins that are included in the operational limits these operational limits are normally given in terms of sea state parameters i e significant wave height hs and peak period tp here denoted as hs tp safety margins on hs tp should account for various sources of uncertainties in weather forecasts wave spectral shape numerical models etc wave spectra at an offshore site may be multi modal and not necessarily resemble analytical spectra such as joint north sea wave project jonswap or pierson moskowitz pm models since floating vessels are sensitive to wave spectral energy distribution hs tp operational limits should account for this source of uncertainty this paper provides a general methodology to assess the uncertainty in hs tp limits due to variability in wave spectral energy distribution this is important for safe execution of marine operations the methodology uses response based operational limits directional 2d hindcast wave spectra and dynamic coupled models of marine operation activities a case study of an offshore wind turbine transition piece installation is shown to illustrate the proposed methodology keywords operational limits marine operations allowable sea states wave spectra uncertainty 1 introduction marine operations such as towing heavy lifting and float over are normally executed following operational procedures in which the duration and operational limits for each activity are provided these operational limits are given in terms of environmental parameters such as significant wave height hs peak period tp and wind speed vw and in terms of dynamic vessel responses this is because these parameters are practical and can be measured on board however these operational limits are often set based on experience of marine installation contractors and thus they are not derived systematically using a validated numerical model peace et al 1985 clauss and riekert 1990 for operations dominated by waves operational limits expressed in terms of hs and tp which are commonly denoted as hs tp should be derived systematically and provide the same safety level as the allowable limit of a dynamic response or a structural capacity for example a crane or lifting wire capacity is the operational limit of a heavy lifting operation for pipelaying operations clauss et al 1998 developed a numerical method to transform the allowable stresses in the pipe into hs tp limits moreover guachamin acero et al 2016b proposed a general methodology to express allowable structural or motion responses in terms of allowable limits of sea states hs tp these limits are response based and practical and they provide the same safety levels as the structural capacity of structural components this general methodology has already been applied in analyses of various marine operations li et al 2016a b guachamin acero et al 2017b to date state of the art offshore standards for planning and execution of marine operations such as dnv 2011a dnv gl 2015 and iso 2015 recommend that the operational limits should be expressed in terms of hs however tp is not taken into consideration which is a relevant parameter for floating vessels operational limits described above are deterministic and thus these limits do not account for various sources of uncertainties in forecasted wave parameters numerical models human decisions etc an assessment of these sources of uncertainties is necessary for safe execution of marine operations the hs operational limits recommended by dnv 2011a dnv gl 2015 and iso 2015 are reduced by alpha factors that account for uncertainties in weather forecast these alpha factors depend on the duration of operations the threshold levels of these limits and whether or not meteorologists or measurement equipment are available on site alternatively instead of alpha factors uncertainties in forecasted hs and tp parameters can be assessed statistically from the error distributions between the forecasted and the hindcast or measured wave parameters natskår et al 2015 de girolamo et al 2017 operational limits together with weather forecasts can be used to find workable weather windows for safe execution of marine operations to reduce uncertainties in weather forecast gintautas and sørensen 2017 proposed a methodology that combines ensembles of weather forecast with on board time domain simulations workable weather windows are obtained by directly comparing the structural capacity or allowable responses of structures with the predicted dynamic responses using weather forecasts although this approach reduces uncertainties in forecasted hs and tp the wave spectra used for the dynamic analyses are the analytical joint north sea wave project jonswap or the pierson moskowitz pm wave spectral models the wave spectra at sea may be multi modal and not necessarily resemble the analytical spectra and thus both spectra may predict different responses to reduce uncertainties in dynamic responses of vessels investigations were carried out by the european commission eu project safe offloading from floating lng platforms safe offload in this project dynamic responses were assessed by considering wind sea and swell components separately this is done to develop strategies for heading selection when planning the operations hagen et al 2015 ewans and jameson 2015 bitner gregersen 2015 moreover an interactive simulator was developed for training of personnel and for testing critical operations varela and guedes soares 2015 simulators are necessary to set operational limits on motion responses or environmental parameters and to reduce the risk of failure during execution of marine operations from the information given above it is observed that both environmental parameters and allowable dynamic responses of structures can be used as operational limits these limits can be modified to account for uncertainties in forecasted wave parameters however even if the forecasted hs tp wave parameters are accurate there will be differences between the measured and calculated dynamic responses of offshore structures this is because the wave energy distribution or the spectral shape of the analytical and the hindcast or forecasted wave spectra are different in fact measured wave spectra can be multi modal with several peak periods and directional components operational limits in terms of hs tp are normally established during the planning phase they depend on the dynamic responses of the floating structures under action of short crested seas which are generally modeled using analytical jonswap or pm formulations thus hs tp limits depend on these input wave spectra since analytical wave spectra may not resemble the actual forecasted or measured directional 2d spectra in open seas unexpected responses of floating vessels during execution of a marine operation can occur this also implies that the safety level in structural components can be lower than expected hs tp limits should be simple and practical to be used on boar vessels but they need to account for uncertainties in wave spectral energy distribution this paper aims at providing a general methodology to express operational limits in terms of hs tp that include uncertainties in wave spectral energy distribution this is necessary for planning and safe execution of marine operations other environmental parameters such as current and wind speed are not considered this paper firstly provides an introduction to the state of the art techniques for assessment of operational limits then a methodology for systematic derivation of hs tp limits is discussed this methodology is the basis for the development of the new general methodology that includes uncertainties in wave spectral energy distribution the new methodology is applied to a case study of an offshore wind turbine transition piece installation 2 response based operational limits and directional wave spectra this section provides a brief introduction to a state of the art method for systematic derivation of response based operational limits and the basis for assessment of uncertainties in operational limits using analytical formulations of directional wave spectra such as jonswap or pm this is necessary for development of a new methodology introduced in the sec 3 2 1 response based operational limits guachamin acero et al 2016b proposed a methodology for systematic assessment of response based operational limits of marine operations based on this methodology a response parameter such as motion or structural capacity can be expressed in terms of allowable limits of sea states hs tp the authors recommended a procedure to assess the dynamic responses of an operation and to identify a response that limit an operation take as an example the installation of a topside module onto a jacket structure fig 1 shows three loading conditions for the operation loading condition lc 1 corresponds to a monitoring phase where the structure responses are monitored prior to lifting the module loading condition lc 2 refers to the actual non stationary lowering of the module onto the jacket and the winch of the crane is running with a certain speed in this condition loading condition lc 3 is a stationary condition and is similar to lc 2 but does not include a running winch for these loading conditions fig 2 shows the allowable limits of environmental and dynamic response parameters that can be used for safe execution of such operation for the load condition lc 2 shown in fig 1 b the parameter that limits the operation limiting parameter is the impact force between the module and the jacket structure see fig 2 b by conducting repetitive simulations of the module lowering operation a characteristic value of the impact force can be calculated note that the stochastic impact force can only be obtained by numerically modeling the actual non stationary lowering operations sandvik 2012 this characteristic value needs to be compared with the corresponding allowable limit which is obtained from structural analysis of the mechanical components then the allowable limits of sea states hs tp can be determined see fig 2 a these hs tp limits are practical information for making a decision at lc 1 monitoring phase shown in fig 1 a prior to the execution of a marine operation by comparing the forecasted and the hs tp limits a decision on whether to start or not an operation is made these hs tp limits provide the same safety levels as the allowable impact force on the structural components more details on this method are given by guachamin acero et al 2016b in fig 1 c a new lc 3 is defined this loading condition is similar to lc 2 the non stationary condition shown in 1 b but the winch speed is not modeled load condition lc 3 is defined with the aim of replacing lc 2 this is because the dynamic system for lc 3 can be analyzed using the frequency domain or the steady state time domain method load condition lc 3 is necessary for the development of the new methodology in sec 3 the first non linear impact force resulting from the contact between the module and the jacket in lc 2 see fig 1 b depends on the impact velocity see eq 1 dnv 2011b hamilton and ramzan 1991 in this equation f i m p is the impact force v i m p is the impact velocity k is the contact stiffness and m is the mass of the payload thus the impact velocity is a parameter that can be used to predict impact forces in fact eq 1 can also be used to predict snap loads on wire ropes during lift off operations a limitation of this equation is that it can only be used to predict the first impact and thus what happens after the first impact cannot be predicted 1 f i m p v i m p k m landing lift off and mating operations are normally critical operations where the winch speed is very low because of that it is reasonable to assume that an impact velocity will be mainly governed by the vessel responses due to wave actions thus it is expected that a constant value of an allowable limit of an impact force will be equivalent to a constant value of an allowable limit of an impact velocity this is a key assumption for the development of the method that is introduced in the sec 3 in this paper the impact force or corresponding impact velocity which correspond to lc 2 are referred as basic limiting parameters because they limit the lifting operation for other marine operations such as transportation position keeping or float over the limiting parameters would be motions of specific parts of the structures these are particular cases with loading conditions that can be treated in a similar manner it is important to recognize that the hs tp operational limits shown in fig 2 a are practical but they are dependent on the wave spectra used to compute the dynamic responses however the basic limiting parameters are independent of the wave spectra since the wave spectra at sea are generally multi modal and cannot be represented using analytical spectral formulations it is necessary to include the effects of the wave energy distribution on the operational limits this will be addressed in the methodology developed in sec 3 2 2 analytical and hindcast directional wave spectra in marine operations it is important to model the environmental parameters in a realistic and accurate manner this is because the allowable motion responses of structures during operations are normally small and structural components can work at high demand offshore standards such as dnv 2011b provide guidelines for modeling of wave spectra analytical spectral models such as jonswap or pm models together with spreading functions are commonly used for modeling wave actions although these models were developed for the north sea for steady unidirectional wind conditions they are used worldwide it is well known that in several offshore sites including the north sea there are combined actions of wind seas and swells the energy distribution of the resulting multi modal wave spectra can result in unexpected vessel responses if the wave information is not adequately described this fact was experienced by the heavy lift vessel hlv svane which experienced large motions in swells causing delays and extra costs in the sheringham shoal offshore wind farm project sandelson 2011 although there exist formulations for combined wind seas and swells such as the bi modal torsethaugen spectrum which was derived for the norwegian continental shelf the hs and tp parameters for the wave components can be a result of inaccurate partitioning bitner gregersen and toffoli 2009 the partition is done to simplify the information provided by meteorologists to marine contractors in the partitioning process more uncertainties are introduced this is because the hs and tp parameters obtained from the partitioning process cannot be used to reconstruct the real 2d wave spectra using analytical spectral formulations thus these uncertainties need to be included in the operational limits hs tp when used on board vessels fig 3 shows examples of reconstructed using jonswap model and 2d hindcast wave spectra it is observed that although the total hs is the same the energy distribution or spectral shape is different these spectra have been applied to a numerical model of a crane vessel with a natural roll period of 10 s the resulting 2d roll response spectra are different see fig 4 for the 2d reconstructed jonswap spectrum a single amplitude significant roll response of 0 69 deg is obtained while for the 2d hindcast spectrum the result is much lower i e 0 01 deg therefore an improper representation of the actual wave spectra can introduce large uncertainties in the dynamic responses these uncertainties should be accounted for by including safety margins on the hs tp operational limits in principle historical data of 2d measured wave spectra should be used for assessment of dynamic responses of a vessel when planning a marine operation unfortunately this information is generally not available and instead 2d hindcast spectra can be used feld et al 2004 have shown that hs from measurements and hindcast models are well correlated however other wave parameters such as tp and the peakness factor show more scatter and in general hindcast spectra are less peaked than measured spectra thus if the wave energy is close to the natural frequencies of a dynamic system some differences in the responses can be expected in this paper only 2d hindcast wave spectra are considered and they are compared with the 2d reconstructed wave spectra for assessment of uncertainties associated with their differences 3 methodology for assessment of operational limits including uncertainties in wave spectral energy distribution the detailed procedure for assessment of the operational limits hs tp including uncertainties in wave spectral energy distribution is given in this section fig 5 shows an overview of the proposed general methodology according to a previous study carried out by guachamin acero et al 2016b and briefly described in subsection 2 1 steps 1 3 are required to systematically assess the operational limits in terms of hs tp in step 1 the dynamic system for lc 2 is used to simulate the actual non stationary lowering operation using as input analytical 2d wave spectral models step 2 shows the dynamic responses and corresponding allowable limits which are compared with each other to identify the hs tp limits shown in step 3 note that these hs tp limits will provide the same safety levels as the basic limiting parameter e g impact force or impact velocity shown in step 2 however the hs tp limits in step 3 do not include uncertainties from wave spectral energy distribution in step 4 lc 3 is used see also fig 1 c unlike lc 2 corresponding to a non stationary lowering process the dynamic system for lc 3 is weakly non linear and the stochastic process from which a dynamic response is assessed is stationary because the winch speed in this loading condition is not modeled the operational limits hs tp obtained in step 3 are applied on the dynamic system of lc 3 step 4 and dynamic responses such as crane tip or module velocity can be calculated see step 5 these dynamic responses resulting from the dynamic system of lc 3 are referred as auxiliary limiting parameters since this auxiliary limiting parameter is equivalent to the basic limiting parameter impact force or impact velocity with constant allowable limit the new allowable limit of the auxiliary limiting parameter e g the crane tip velocity will have an approximate constant value as well see allowable limits in steps 2 and 5 note that an allowable limit in step 5 cannot be added to the winch velocity to obtain the allowable limit of impact velocity in step 2 because the response statistics in each condition are different sandvik 2012 step 6 shows statistical parameters significant responses of the auxiliary limiting parameter for lc 3 which are computed using 2d hindcast wave spectra and response amplitude operators raos see eq 2 2 m 0 0 2 π ω 1 ω 2 r a o 2 ω θ s ω θ d ω d θ where m 0 is the zeroth order spectral moment variance of a dynamic response r a o ω θ is the 2d response amplitude operator and s ω θ is the 2d wave spectra as it is shown above frequency domain fd methods can be used to compute the responses of dynamic system for lc 3 using hindcast data because lc3 is stationary and the system is weakly non linear this approach is much more computationally efficient than to compute non stationary dynamic responses of lc 2 using the time domain td method to assess the uncertainties of the allowable sea states 2d hindcast wave spectra data of several years or seasons can be used in step 6 and vessel responses at different headings can be calculated the resulting hindcast dynamic responses are compared with the allowable limit of the auxiliary limiting parameter obtained in step 5 the points of intersection of the hindcast dynamic responses are selected which provide the new allowable hs tp limits the values collected for hs are grouped for intervals of tp and a histogram for hs tp can be obtained alternatively for a given tp hs values can be fitted to a probability distribution function see step 7 a percentile q for the distribution of every hs tp should be established this is done to select a characteristic hs tp value the magnitude of q depends on the required safety levels and risks associated with the marine operation for example a value of q 0 95 means that 95 of hs values for a specific tp range will be lower than the characteristic value of hs thus characteristic values of hs tp for each tp range can be plotted see step 8 the allowable limits of sea states provided in step 8 include uncertainties in wave spectra energy distribution these limits are independent of the input wave spectra used in analyses of lc 2 step 2 because a new auxiliary limiting parameter with constant value is used for the most risky marine operations such as lift off mating and lowering the auxiliary limiting parameter can be a velocity of a relevant part of the structure e g crane tip velocity this is because this velocity is equivalent to the basic limiting parameter such as impact force or velocity for other stationary operations there is no necessity of an auxiliary limiting parameter and thus the basic limiting parameters can be used these are particular cases of the general methodology proposed in this paper finally the hs tp operational limits derived with the proposed methodology can be compared with the forecasted hs and tp parameters and on board decisions can be made in a safer manner 4 case study on owt transition piece installation the general methodology proposed in sec 3 is applied to the installation of an offshore wind turbine owt transition piece tp using a floating heavy lift vessel hlv see fig 6 within the entire installation the landing phase of the tp onto the monopile mp is normally a critical activity because structural failure of a bracket support can occur if the impact loads or velocities exceed their allowable limits fig 7 detail x shows the bracket support of the tp landing onto the monopile tip this phase is selected for the case study 4 1 numerical modeling in this subsection the main particulars of the structures numerical methods and numerical modeling parameters are briefly described they are necessary for assessment of the dynamic responses and thus the operational limits the main particulars of the hlv tp and mp are shown in table 1 these are typical values for a mp structure installed in 20 30 m water depth the main particulars are used to build a numerical model in the state of the art ansys aqwa suit of programs century dynamics ansys inc 2011 a physical model for the mp tp mating operation is shown in fig 7 a and the corresponding spring damper model is shown in fig 7 b mechanical properties for the spring damper elements and other modeling parameters are shown in table 2 the mating operation is normally carried out at low values of winch speed e g 2 m min which is applied in this paper more details of the modeling parameters chosen for this marine operation are given by guachamin acero et al 2017a since the dynamic system is non linear and the stochastic responses are result of a non stationary process the problem is solved using the time domain method a schematic view of the dynamic coupled model is shown in fig 8 4 2 assessment of operational limits the operational limits in terms of hs tp are assessed by following the general methodology proposed by guachamin acero et al 2016b according to fig 5 step 2 the characteristic value and the allowable limit of the impact force or impact velocity basic limiting parameters are needed in this case study the impact velocity is considered to assess the allowable limit of the impact velocity the allowable stress of the bracket supports need to be known this value depends on the yield strength of the material e g assume σ a l l o w n 500 20 mpa where n stands for normal random variable with corresponding mean value and standard deviation for a typical bracket support with 50 cm height and a plate with 3 5 cm thickness see fillet weld in fig 7 detail x the allowable impact force can be determined similarly due to uncertainties in the construction and soil properties a contact spring coefficient of k n 5 0 5 10 8 n m is assumed and based on eq 1 the impact velocity is obtained monte carlo simulation with 2000 samples is applied and for an assumed non exceedance probability of 0 99 the allowable impact velocity is approximately v a l l o w 0 20 m s a characteristic value of the impact velocity for each hs tp combination using jonswap spectra is calculated from time domain simulations of the non stationary tp lowering operation lc 2 for a non stationary lift off operation it was found that the statistical parameters maximum and standard deviation of a snap force in a cable converged after at approximately 45 random seeds guachamin acero et al 2016a in this study forty simulations each of them with an approximate duration of 2 min excluding transients are conducted for each sea state and the first impact velocities are selected the impact velocities are fitted into a probability distribution function the characteristic values were calculated for an assumed non exceedance probability of 0 997 of a gaussian distribution the non exceedance probability should be selected based on the desired reliability of the marine operation the characteristic values of impact velocities are compared with the allowable limit and the corresponding hs tp limits are identified fig 9 shows the results for allowable impact velocity of 0 2 m s in addition and for sake of comparison the results for an allowable limit of 0 15 m s are shown as well these operational limits correspond to step 3 in fig 5 similar results can be obtained for other headings of the installation vessel 4 3 operational limits including uncertainties in wave spectrum energy distribution operational limits obtained in fig 9 are semi probabilistic and they depend on the input wave spectra used to compute the dynamic responses and corresponding characteristic values as it was discussed earlier it is desired that these limits include safety margins due to uncertainties in wave spectral energy distribution the hs tp operational limits shown in fig 9 are applied into the dynamic system of lc 3 see fig 5 step 4 the dynamic responses which are allowable limits of the auxiliary limiting parameter are thus obtained in this case study the auxiliary parameter is chosen as the tp heave velocity v t p the results are shown in fig 10 where single amplitude significant velocities 2 rms are plotted rms stands for root mean squared value or m 0 note that other magnitudes rather than 2 rms for the allowable velocities can be selected and the reason is given at the end of this subsection because dynamic system of lc 3 is weakly non linear and the dynamic responses are results from a stationary process the steady state time domain method was applied the frequency domain method can also be applied in addition the surge and sway velocity components of the tp can be important for some structural components however they are not considered in this case study fig 10 shows that the allowable limits for tp heave velocities v t p as expected small variations over tp are observed for two allowable limits of impact velocities v a l l o w the allowable limits are also independent of the vessel heading for example the average tp heave velocity for v a l l o w 0 2 m s is v t p 0 12 m s and the average tp heave velocity for v a l l o w 0 15 m s is v t p 0 07 m s an averaged allowable tp heave velocity from fig 10 is further used in this case study the dynamic responses of lc 3 are obtained using the 2d response amplitude operators raos and 2d hindcast wave spectra the fd method was applied see eq 2 seven years 2d spectral wave data 2001 2007 sampled every hour were applied the data have been provided by li et al 2015 and correspond to the north sea site 15 time histories of hs are computed by integrating the energy density of the 2d hindcast wave spectra over all frequencies and directions and the tp refers to the highest peak of each 2d spectrum alternatively hs and tp time histories of combined wind sea and swell wave actions which are provided by meteorologic institutes can be used the averaged allowable tp heave velocities v t p of 0 12 and 0 07 m s from fig 10 are compared with 2 rms tp heave velocities computed using the 2d wave spectra as it was mentioned earlier other magnitudes rather than 2 rms could have been chosen as far as the allowable limits and dynamic responses are consistent with each other the hs tp for which the tp heave velocities are close to the corresponding allowable limits are selected the responses and the allowable limits do not need to be exactly equal see subsec 4 4 each hs value is classified according to a peak period tp range for each tp range a percentile or probability of non exceedance is chosen e g 0 8 20 can exceed the hs tp limits thus new hs tp operational limits are obtained see figs 11 and 12 similar figures can be obtained for other probabilities of non exceedance that will depend on the risks associated with the marine operations this procedure can be applied for any potential installation season heading and offshore site moreover these operational limits can directly be used to find weather windows during planning and execution of marine operations 4 4 discussions operational limits obtained in fig 9 are convenient for planning and execution of marine operations however these limits depend on the wave spectra at the offshore site this fact can result in unexpected vessel dynamic responses during execution of marine operations thus it is necessary to consider the associated uncertainties to these operational limits a parameter that resembles the impact force was assumed to be the tp impact velocity basic limiting parameters of lc 2 see eq 1 this equation is empirical and has been obtained by equating the potential and kinetic energies during impact in a quasi static condition considering that impact velocities during offshore installation occur at low values and that we are only interested in the first impact the assumption is valid the allowable limits of sea states hs tp were applied to the dynamic system of lc 3 from which fairly constant allowable limits of the tp heave velocity v t p were obtained see fig 10 these limits are equivalent to the allowable impact velocities v a l l o w of 0 20 and 0 15 m s see subsec 4 2 note that instead of the tp heave velocity crane tip velocity can also be used because both velocities are related to the impact force new v t p limits are computed as 2 rms but instead 1 3 or 4 rms can be used the averaged allowable limits of v t p are compared with the values obtained using 2d hindcast wave spectra for a proper assessment of the uncertainties in hs tp limits a significant sample size of hs and tp is required this is done by selecting a proper range for v t p for example a value of 0 11 m s can be represented by a range between 0 11 0 12 m s the hs tp limits shown in figs 11 and 12 were obtained using all year wave spectral data and such information is necessary on board hlvs when executing tp installations in practice installation campaigns are normally carried out during the summer season figs 13 and 14 correspond to hs tp limits for the period may september the results are different from those from figs 11 and 12 because local wind and swell direction can change during the year and thus wave energy distribution varies from season to season allowable limits of sea states can be monthly based but there is a risk that the number of data used to assess hs for every tp range is very limited or simply null figs 13 and 14 show that the available number of hs points for tp 12 s is very limited this is because these hs and tp combinations in this specific offshore site do not occur often or because the selection range is too narrow thus hs tp limits for these cases may not be applicable or they are not reliable fig 15 a shows the allowable h tp for a v t p range between 0 11 0 12 m s to obtain more data for hs and tp a practical solution is to increase the range for v t p e g 0 105 0 125 m s and thus the new hs tp limits shown in fig 15 b are more reliable that the hs tp limits shown in fig 15 a the operational limits obtained in figs 11 13 can be compared with the ones shown in fig 9 it is observed that there are significant differences in fact hs tp limits that include uncertainties in wave spectral energy distribution are fairly constant for this case study moreovoer these hs tp limits are derived systematically and this is important for safe execution of marine operations similar curves can be obtained for other marine operational phases and the combination from all these curves can be used to find weather windows for the execution of the entire operation 5 conclusions and recommendations marine operations need to be executed in a safe manner and safety depends on the safety margins that are included in the operational limits operational limits can be expressed in terms of environmental parameters such as significant wave height hs and peak period tp these hs tp limits depend on the 2d wave spectra used to compute dynamic responses because wave spectra at an offshore site may be multi modal and not necessarily resemble the typical jonswap or pm models the operational limits will vary for every offshore site a general methodology to assess hs tp operational including uncertainties in wave spectral energy distribution was developed the methodology uses the response based operational limits the 2d directional hindcast wave spectra and the dynamic coupled models of a marine operation the developed methodology transforms an allowable limit of a basic parameter that limits an operation i e impact force into an equivalent allowable limit of an auxiliary parameter such as the crane tip heave velocity for an equivalent loading condition of the coupled dynamic system and under certain assumptions 2d hindcast wave spectra were used to compute dynamic responses of this auxiliary parameter these responses were compared with the corresponding allowable limit and as a result hs tp limits that include uncertainties due to wave spectral energy distribution were obtained the methodology was applied on a case study of an offshore wind turbine transition piece installation significant differences in hs tp operational limits were observed when considering the uncertainties in the wave spectral shape this methodology can be used for several marine operations such as heavy lifting float over and subsea installation and can be applied to any offshore site and season the hs tp operational limits resulting from this methodology can be used to identify workable weather windows during planning or execution of marine operations based on these weather windows safer decisions on whether to start stop or not an operation can be made the proposed methodology has also some limitations it addresses uncertainties in hs tp limits by considering that the 2d hindcast wave spectra gives a true representation of the ocean surface this is not true since the 2d hindcast spectra may deviate from the measured wave spectra moreover the hs tp operational limits are derived for a combined sea of wind sea and swells in future the methodology should consider wind sea and swell components separately in addition other environmental parameters such as current speed and wind speed that are important for planning and execution of marine operations are not included it is recommended that other sources of uncertainties which are present in numerical models environmental parameters such as wind current and human decisions are included in the safety margins of hs tp limits this is important for reliability analysis of marine operations acknowledgments the first author acknowledges the financial support from project pij 15 03 elaboración de un
