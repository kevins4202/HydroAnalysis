23140,ship domain is often used in marine navigation and marine traffic engineering as a safety condition the basic idea behind those applications is that an encounter of two or more ships can be considered safe if neither of ship domains is intruded by other ships research utilising this approach has been documented in numerous works including publications on optimising collision avoidance manoeuvres performed to fulfil domain based safety conditions however up to this point there has been no method which would apply ship s domain to determine the last moment when a particular collision avoidance manoeuvre can still be successfully performed this issue is addressed here the proposed method uses a model of ship s dynamics to assess the time and distance necessary for a manoeuvre resulting in avoiding domain violations in give way situations the model and the method are described in detail and illustrated in a series of simulation results the simulations cover full spectrum of typical give way encounters in various circumstances head on crossing and overtaking situations manoeuvres limited to course alteration and those combining turns with speed reduction open or confined waters and finally in good and restricted visibility keywords collision avoidance manoeuvres evasive manoeuvres ship s manoeuvrability ship domain ship encounters collision risk 1 introduction a ship domain has been first introduced in fujii and tanaka 1971 where it has been defined as a two dimensional area surrounding a ship which other ships must avoid ever since then ship domain concept has been used in maritime research including recent applications to various traffic engineering related problems waterway capacity analysis liu et al 2015 waterway collision risk analyses goerlandt and kujala 2014 goerlandt and montewka 2015 qu et al 2011 weng et al 2012 and ais based near miss detection van iperen 2015 wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 van westrenen and ellerbroek 2017 however it is collision avoidance that is arguably main purpose for ship domain s development pietrzykowski 2008 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 hansen et al 2013 wang and chin 2015 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 and as evidenced by some works it still remains its important field of application szlapczynski 2008 lazarowska 2016 those applications of ship domain are based on the assumption that an encounter of two or more ships can be considered safe if neither of ship domains is intruded by other ships however up to this point there has been no method which would combine ship s manoeuvrability and ship s domain to determine the last moment when a particular collision avoidance manoeuvre can still be successfully performed this issue is addressed in the hereby paper the presented method uses a model of ship s dynamics to assess the time and distance necessary for a manoeuvre successful in terms of avoiding domain violation the method is inspired by action area presented in dinh and im 2016 critical range and time researched in hilgert and baldauf 1997 and critical distance introduced in krata and montewka 2015 and later extended in krata et al 2016 the rest of the paper is organized as follows related works and method s genesis are discussed in section 2 the method is outlined in section 3 which also includes description of its key algorithms the applied ship dynamics model is given in section 4 section 5 provides results obtained for an example ship these results cover typical ship encounters in various circumstances head on crossing and overtaking situations manoeuvres limited to course alteration and those combining turns with speed reduction open or confined waters and finally good and restricted visibility results are discussed in section 6 followed by the summary and conclusions given in section 7 2 related works and the current method s genesis most of collision avoidance research is focused on manoeuvres done in advance with enough time for optimisation kao et al 2007 tam et al 2009 tsou et al 2010 praczyk 2015 zhang et al 2015 tsou 2016 pietrzykowski et al 2017 in comparison there are relatively few works on when exactly a manoeuvre should be performed to achieve safe separation the concept of an arena an evasion area around a ship was first outlined in davis et al 1980 and later developed in colley et al 1983 close quarters term was defined in hilgert 1983 where the author observed that colregs cockcroft et al 2012 do not give specific distances where an evasive action is necessary such limit values at which the navigator has to order the evasive actions were determined in hilgert and baldauf 1997 and the approach presented there was later applied in an on board manoeuvring support system baldauf et al 2014 similarly in zhang et al 2012 a study on minimum distance for escape action was presented based on an analysis of an encounter scenario following this in dinh and im 2016 a combination of analytical approach with utilising expert navigators knowledge was applied to determine a ship s action zone however the limitation of the above research was either the limited number of encounter scenarios taken into account or simplified modelling of ship s manoeuvres those limitations were overcome in krata and montewka 2015 those authors were interested in determining the last moment when collision could still be avoided by manoeuvres of the own ship alone their research involved a detailed analysis of the own ship s evasive action which included precise prediction of the own trajectory based on the manoeuvrability parameters the method was further extended in krata et al 2016 where among others stability issues were taken into account avoidance of excessive heel matusiak and stigler 2012 the final result of both versions of this method was a critical distance between the own ship and a target ship determined for a given encounter situation this critical distance represented the last moment when a manoeuvre had to be performed to avoid collision the method was dedicated to situations when the own ship was a stand on one which generated some additional assumptions among others a resulting near zero separation between ships was assumed there for simulations in practice a manoeuvre would have to be initiated earlier sometimes much earlier if a larger ship separation is supposed to be kept the current paper is inspired by krata and montewka 2015 and the works of their predecessors but the central idea of that paper is here combined with a ship domain model we are interested in a distance and time to potential collision which still make it possible to avoid violation of a specified ship domain additionally the collision avoidance action is supposed to fulfil a number of configurable conditions dictated either by colregs or by a navigator for a given encounter situation a considered turn should be made to starboard or port only depending on the particular encounter and visibility conditions not exceed a given angle of rudder 3 the method s overview contrary to krata and montewka 2015 krata et al 2016 the current method is mostly dedicated for situations when own ship is the give way ship while colregs specify what action should be taken depending on the encounter type it is up to the navigator of the own ship to decide when exactly to perform a manoeuvre this decision may depend on the intended separation which is represented here by a ship s domain a scheme of the method s main algorithm is given in fig 1 the method applies a degree of domain violation ddv a parameter indicating to what extent a ship s domain will be intruded during a close quarters situation szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 in brief the method works as follows it reads the necessary input parameters and detects potential domain violations if a domain violation is predicted based on the current data the encounter situation is classified and the action type is chosen for a chosen action type and auxiliary user specified parameters the method determines the time for initiating the manoeuvre by means of a gradient algorithm which is shown in fig 2 the gradient algorithm fig 2 works as follows at first a set of initial parameters is read comprising of both ship parameters including positions speeds and courses and threshold for the time range ε and action type parameters including manoeuvre direction and ranges of considered course and speed alterations then a candidate time tc is introduced and initialized the algorithm detects potential domain violations of a manoeuvre initiated at time tc domain violations are checked during and after performing the manoeuvre because the latter might be done analytically meaning faster computations after manoeuvre check is performed before during manoeuvre check depending on whether the manoeuvre done at tc is safe or not the considered time range is narrowed up to or down to tc a new tc value is then selected from the updated t1 t2 range based on the results of domain violation check and the simulation is repeated the algorithm ends when the range t1 t2 gets smaller than the threshold value ε once the action time t c is determined fig 2 the action distance is computed according to formula 1 and returned by the algorithm 1 d t c v r t c 2 v r x x r v r y y r t c x r y r 2 where d t c action distance as a function of action time t c action time x r x component of the target s initial relative position y r y component of the target s initial relative position v r target s relative speed v r x x component of the target s relative speed v r y y component of the target s relative speed computed action distance is then further used in the algorithm depicted in fig 1 in general the method s functional scope is limited to determining the distance and time at which the specified manoeuvre preferred by a navigator should be performed in order to avoid domain s violation the manoeuvre s parameters the maximal size of course change and optionally speed reduction are assumed to be set by a navigator a separate complementary decision support tool enabling the navigator to choose a particular manoeuvre has been presented by the authors in szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2015 4 model of ship s manoeuvrability used in the method the model ship taken into account is a mid size ro pax whose particulars are as follows table 1 a matlab script has been prepared to perform the simulation of the model ship dynamics the applied model comprises the following ship s initial speed and her inertia time for gradual reduction of the propeller thrust simple formula for calculation of the hull resistance dependent on ship s speed it was assumed that the ship steaming with service speed equal 17 knots for 100 s is followed by 120 s of the dropping power supply to the propeller the thrust gradually decreases to the value corresponding to the speed 8 knots which still enables to control the course with the use of a rudder however the ship is pushed forward by her inertia besides the propeller thrust so the decrease in speed is slower than the thrust reduction which is assumed a realistic scenario the result of the simulation is presented in fig 3 as it may be clearly seen in fig 3 the reduction of ship speed alone cannot be found as time efficient manoeuvre however speed reduction of the model ship is considered in the research flexible enough to be an additional manoeuvre supporting course alternation according to the result of the performed simulations the ship slowing down characteristics is presented in further computations in the form of a meta model as follows 2 v t i 1 9 s i t i 1 where s i coefficients of the polynomial model and t the time from the speed reduction manoeuvre initiation since there are numerous factors influencing practical manoeuvring characteristics of the ship we utilize laidyn software matusiak 2013 the tool is capable to simulate in time domain motions of a ship in six degrees of freedom with regard to her shape rudder and propulsion action and the action of wind and wave in irregular seas conditions laidyn is based on a panel method and froude krylov force is modelled in nonlinear approach along with diffraction and refraction forces the rudder force is also calculated on the basis of the rudder profile and water flow conditions as a result not only ship inertia is taken into account but also very detailed distribution of friction and pressure field surrounding the hull is considered including sea wave action and hull s generated wave system action as well the ship rolling pitching and heaving is included to the force balance and energy balance calculations the mathematical formulation remaining behind laidyn is as follows 3 d u d t x p r o p x r e s i s t m r v m x u d v d t m r u y v v y r r y r r l m y v d r d t n v v n r r n v v 2 l l p p i z z n r where u the linear velocity along axis x x prop the propeller thrust x resist the ship resistance m the ship mass r the angular velocity along axis z v the linear velocity along axis y l the lift forces on the rudder l pp the length of the ship between perpendiculars i zz a mass moment of inertia x u y v y r y r y v n v n r n v n r hydrodynamics derivates the detailed description of the laidyn code is available in matusiak 2007 2013 the state of the art laidyn code satisfactorily passed numerous ittc benchmark tests ittc 2002 ittc 2005 and has been found a reliable simulation tool moreover even the rudder and propeller thrust is directly modelled instead of typical simple attaching of a virtual usually arbitrary set up and fixed in time thrust force which is quite common thus the top quality model of the ship dynamics is utilized in the study which allows for covering of all key hydrodynamic phenomena in this study the laidyn code is utilized to obtain the time histories of the considered ro pax circulations with regard to her 6dof motions similarly to the former work matusiak and stigler 2012 the rudder angle is assumed consecutively to 10 20 and 30 to port and to starboard to obtain the set of trajectories in order to observe noticeable effects of seas action the weather conditions taken into account in simulations are quite heavy e g the wind force is set 8b and the corresponding jonswap wave spectrum is considered the numerical simulations of 6dof ship motions provide the time history of coupled motions with regard to the ship characteristics influencing all degrees of freedom however for further use in evasive manoeuvre planning procedure the shape of ship tracks are essential these trajectories obtained for every single studied case are represented by a set of relative positions in consecutive time steps ti xi yi where xi and yi denote the position of ship s centre of gravity referred to the initial position fixed at the manoeuvre commencing sample trajectories for the model ship are shown in fig 4 the obtained set of simulation results for the model ship turning to port and to starboard comprises the full range of rudder settings reaching from 30 up to 30 as the irregular seas are taken into account the result of a simulation is non deterministic so every single case is repeated three times and averaged at the post processing stage the obtained trajectories are generalized in the form of a meta model consisting in three formulas enabling calculation of ship s centre of gravity relative position in every moment of the turning manoeuvre and the relative heading the relative position and the relative heading refer to the initial position and the initial heading of the ship at the manoeuvre commencing the 5 th and 6 th order polynomial power series constituting the meta model are as follows 4 x t i 1 6 p i t i y t i 1 6 q i t i h e a d i n g r e l t i 1 5 r i t i where x t y t the modelled position of ship s centre of gravity referred to the initial position fixed at the manoeuvre commencing at any time moment heading rel t the relative heading at any time moment taking the initial heading at the manoeuvre commencing as zero t time of the turning manoeuvre continuous variable in the meta model p i q i r i the model coefficients adjusted with the use of least squares method two meta models has been worked out in the course of this study namely the speed reduction model without ship course alternation the turning model without supplied power reduction only natural speed reduction due to circulation exists both models allow for time efficient computations at the stage of collision manoeuvre planning it must be emphasised that the full set of ship motion simulations has to be carried out once only and does not need to be repeated on board which is vital in terms of possible application in future research the ship dynamics model may be extended so as to cover ship s behaviour in severe weather conditions and stability related issues wawrzyński and krata 2016a wawrzyński and krata 2016b krata and wawrzyński 2017a krata and wawrzyński 2017b 5 method s simulation results this section contains results of simulation experiments carried out to determine the boundary line around the own ship which should not be intruded by a target ship if neither of the ships domains own ship s domain as well as target ship s domain are to remain unviolated the domains shown in fig 5 have been applied for head on and crossing encounters left and for overtaking encounters right the domains decentralised elliptic shapes were first proposed in coldwell 1983 but the dimensions used here have been updated so as to be in line with more recent research in the field based on empirical data hansen et al 2013 wang and chin 2015 throughout all test scenarios the model of the own ship from section 4 has been used to generate boundary lines defining ship s arena davis et al 1980 colley et al 1983 the own speed is set to 17 knots for all scenarios unless speed reduction is applied and discussed as for rudder deflection in case of course alteration manoeuvres a 10 rudder deflection has been applied for turns of up to 60 and a 20 rudder deflection for turns larger than that this choice has been dictated by the model of the selected own ship for standard turns of up to 60 a small rudder deflection is sufficient to change course quickly as for large turns a larger rudder deflection is justified to shorten the manoeuvre s execution time however truly large rudder deflections should normally be avoided because of stability related phenomena especially when navigating in harsh weather throughout the simulations normal weather conditions are assumed so as to isolate the action lines dependency on the chosen evasive manoeuvre and its volume 5 1 general results obtained for good and restricted visibility conditions it has been assumed that a single target ship approaches the own ship from various relative bearings with the same true speed or the same relative speed for target ship s positions granularity of 0 05 has been applied in each simulation which means that 7200 target ship s relative bearings have been used to generate a full action line around the own ship all target ships have been placed at 6 nm distance from the own ship as for the courses of the target ships they have been automatically set to values which would result in dcpa equal to 0 and degree of domain violation ddv equal to 1 it must be mentioned here that setting target ships courses to different values would obviously affect the obtained results selected 12 of the above mentioned 7200 target ship s positions are shown in fig 6 results for good visibility and fig 7 results for restricted visibility a fixed true speed of a target ship has been applied by default for various relative bearings of a target ship however in some cases the same true speed did not allow to generate appropriate encounters for all considered relative bearings so the fixed relative speed was used as an alternative when determining ships arenas the two different approaches are shown in fig 6 fixed true speed for various relative bearings of a target ship and fig 7 fixed relative speed for various relative bearings of a target ship where arenas are determined for good and restricted visibility respectively applying fixed relative speed for the restricted visibility case makes it easier to simulate smaller values of relative speeds at which ships should approach each other in restricted visibility in fig 6 a target ship s true speeds of either 18 knots blue line or 25 knots red line have been assumed target ship s speed smaller than 18 knots would not make overtaking possible and the full arena could not be generated for fig 7 target ship s relative speeds of either 5 knots blue line or 12 knots red line have been assumed to illustrate both overtaking and being overtaken a relative speed of a target ship had to be used in fig 7 because the same true speed of a target ship obviously does not allow for both overtaking and being overtaken true speed vectors are marked parallel to target ships domains as can be seen the arenas boundaries are not continuous because different colregs rules begin to apply at some relative bearings in case of good visibility fig 6 the situation becomes classified as crossing for a relative bearing of 22 5 behind traverse so only manoeuvres to starboard are considered for restricted visibility fig 7 only turns to starboard are considered for target ships in front of the own ship unless they are to be overtaken in both cases manoeuvres to starboard for target ships behind the traverse or near the traverse on starboard side require much earlier action as a result the arena s line is more distant from the own ship s domain in the behind the traverse part of the starboard sector fig 6 or near traverse part fig 7 for both figs 6 and 7 course alterations of up to 90 only were considered and speed reduction manoeuvre was not taken into account it must be emphasised here that the arena action line depends strongly on the maximal course alteration and maximal speed reduction which are acceptable from the navigator s point of view maximal acceptable course alteration may be dictated by either navigator s preferences or limitations of a waterway as for reducing own speed this manoeuvre may be undesired in case of some engines so the maximal speed reduction parameter should also be set by a navigator and in some cases it will significantly affect the action distances the abovementioned and other tendencies will be investigated in detail in the following sub sections dedicated to various types of ship to ship encounters 5 2 head on encounters own ship s action lines for head on encounters are presented below in fig 8 action lines for target ships of various true speeds are shown assuming that the encounter takes place in limits sea room conditions and manoeuvres of up to 15 only are possible as can be expected the faster the approaching target ship the earlier the own action is needed in case of a target ship whose true speed is 20 knots the action is needed when the distance is about 4 nm for slower target ships the action can be started at about 3 nm from target ship the action triggering lines are not symmetrical because manoeuvres to starboard only are considered and the domain itself is not symmetrical either the asymmetry is especially evident for slower target ships when the action is started later and the own dynamics and domain s shape heavily affect the results in fig 9 the action lines are shown for various sizes of course changes 15 30 and 60 to starboard as can be seen the action has to be initiated much earlier for course changes limited to 15 the distance can be reduced nearly by half if turns up to 30 are possible larger turns bring relatively little difference in the action distance also as has been investigated speed reduction does not affect the results significantly and is not a recommended option in this case it must be noted however that the latter can be attributed to the own ship s model which allows for very fast turns and relatively more consuming speed reduction 5 3 overtaking in case of overtaking it has been decided to use relative speeds in simulations because a small true speed of a target ship makes it nearly impossible to generate appropriate encounters for more distant relative bearings manoeuvres to either port or starboard are allowed when overtaking and the results for this case are provided in subsection 5 3 1 in some cases however manoeuvre to one side only is possible due to presence of obstacles or some other limitations therefore results for manoeuvres to port are additionally presented in subsection 5 3 2 as for manoeuvres to starboards the results would be nearly mirror images of those to port minor differences appear because of slightly different dynamics of turns to starboard and port so they are not shown 5 3 1 manoeuvres to either side the basic action triggering lines are visualized in fig 10 for small relative speeds the own ship can avoid domain violation by a 15 turn done even at the very last moment as expected much earlier reaction is needed for larger relative speeds up to 4 nautical mile distance in case of approaching a target ship with the unlikely relative speed of 16 knots the distance gets larger for larger relative bearings it is much easier to avoid a target ship directly in front than further on the side when larger turns are applied fig 11 the distance can be reduced from nearly 3 nm to about 1 5 nm for a relative speed of 12 knots speed reduction however brings little gain in terms of reducing the action distance for target ships on more distant relative bearings the distance can be shortened from about 2 8 nm to 2 5 nm which is shown in fig 12 blue parts in fig 12 mark progress achieved by speed reduction when compared to action line obtained for course alteration only marked in red in case of overlapping lines of different colours the red line is always shown on top followed by blue green and black lines as a result for partly overlapping action lines only differences between them are shown 5 3 2 manoeuvres to one side only avoiding domain violation gets significantly harder if small turns to one side only e g to port are possible and the target ship is on that side fig 13 for relative bearings nearing 45 the action distance ranges from about 2 5 nm for relative speed of 4 kn to 5 5 nm for relative speed of 16 knots fortunately larger turns can reduce the distance to about 4 5 nm in the worst case and to 2 5 nm or less for all other cases fig 14 if such turns are not possible than speed reduction is a reasonable alternative fig 15 the action distance can be shortened to about 3 5 nm when reducing own speed by 3 kn or to 3 nm when reducing by 6 kn further speed reduction brings little gain 5 4 crossing encounters with a target ship whose true speed is 18 knots have been investigated throughout this subsection rule 15 of colregs states that the give way ship should avoid crossing ahead of the other ship which in this case means avoiding turns to port a turn of 75 to starboard has been found the minimal one which still made it possible to avoid domain violation for target ships behind the traverse on starboard however the manoeuvre would have to be initiated at a distance of about 4 5 nm larger turns enabled actions at shorter distances about 2 8 nm for 90 1 5 nm for 120 and 1 nm for 150 fig 16 a combination of course alteration and speed reduction has occurred to be a useful alternative to large turns fig 17 the same 75 turn makes it possible to act at a 2 6 nm distance when combined with a reduction of speed by 3 knots a reduction by 6 knots may reduce the action distance to less than 2 nm and the gain is the largest in case of target ships far behind the traverse speed reductions by more than 6 knots are not justified as they cannot effectively shorten the action distance it is worth noting that much smaller turns are sufficient in case of a target ship in front even though the same true speed of a target ship 18 knots results in larger relative speed manoeuvres of only 20 to starboard are sufficient to avoid domain violation if initiated at 6 5 nm distance from the target ship by enlarging the turn to 30 45 or 60 the distance can be reduced to 4 1 nm 2 6 nm and 1 9 nm respectively fig 18 a turn by 20 combined with speed reduction may reduce the action distance to 5 nm or 4 2 nm in case of reductions by 3 or 6 knots respectively fig 19 larger speed reductions do not bring significant gain 5 5 restricted visibility in restricted visibility manoeuvres to starboard are recommended for all target ships in front of the own ship this makes it particularly hard to avoid domain s violation in case of fast approaching target ships on port fig 20 the action distance values rise to about 5 nm for relative bearings of 50 55 and manoeuvres up to 45 this can be attributed to the fact that turning by 45 to starboard makes the courses of both ships nearly parallel so the own ship needs a larger turn to escape the faster target ship indeed the action distance falls rapidly to 3 nm and less if manoeuvres up to 60 are considered larger turns however bring smaller progress and it takes a 90 turn to reduce the distance to 2 nm the action line has a less dramatic shape on starboard side where a 4 5 nm action distance is needed in case of 45 turn for a target ship on traverse again the action distance can be easily shortened to 3 nm and less for larger turns as for speed reduction it can shorten the action distance to 3 4 nm for the worst cases of target ships on port and to about 2 3 nm for target ships on far starboard near traverse fig 21 in case of being overtaken by a target ship in restricted visibility a turn away from the target ship is recommended this combined with a small relative speed makes it much easier to avoid domain violation smaller turns or shorter action distances are sufficient fig 22 a turn of 15 is sufficient for a target ship behind on near parallel course the same turn however is not enough for target ships near traverse the own manoeuvres would have to be made extremely early enlarging the size of a turn brings consequent progress shortening the action distance to 3 5 nm for 30 and about 1 nm for 45 similar results can be obtained by a combination of course alteration and speed reduction fig 23 the action distance can be shortened to 3 2 nm if a 6 knot reduction is combined with a turn by 15 the latter is particularly important if turns have to be minimised due to limitations of a waterway 6 discussion and summary of results the ship whose model has been used throughout the simulations is very manoeuvrable a full circulation takes 150 s when turning to starboard and 172 when turning to port speed reduction on the other hand is harder to make for the assumed ship and it takes about 10 min to reduce own speed from 17 to 8 knots obviously the obtained results are affected by the abovementioned dynamics of own manoeuvres the manoeuvring abilities of the own ship are however to some extent neutralized by the high speeds of both the own ship and the target ships used in the simulations therefore roughly similar results may be expected in case of a less manoeuvrable own ship and lower speeds it must be also emphasised here that the presented method checks the effects of all combinations of course change and speed change that are within the limits specified by a user the optimal combination the one allowing for the latest action is always chosen as already depicted in fig 1 and these optimal combinations produce the action distances shown in the figures in section 5 in general a combination of course change and speed reduction should always be carefully planned as simultaneous turn and speed reduction may sometimes cancel each other s effects a detailed method for choosing a combination of own course and speed in an encounter situation to avoid collision has been presented in szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2015 6 1 discontinuity of action lines around the own ship the first noteworthy observation concerns the already mentioned discontinuity of the determined action lines if the action distances are computed for wide sectors around the own ship and colregs compliance is assumed then action lines will lose continuity in the points where different colregs rules start to apply in good visibility the action distances will rise drastically for relative bearings where overtaking manoeuvres to either side turns into crossing manoeuvres to starboard only as shown in fig 6 similarly in restricted visibility the action distances will greatly rise for target ships observed ahead of traverse manoeuvres to starboard mean turning towards a target ship when compared with target ships behind the traverse manoeuvres away from a target ship which are more effective as shown in fig 7 this fact has not been properly investigated before by researchers proposing arena shapes davis et al 1980 colley et al 1983 or action zone dinh and im 2016 and as evidenced here it makes a huge difference in the obtained action distances for various bearings around the own ship 6 2 head on encounters unsurprisingly head on encounters have been found the easiest to solve even though relative speeds are the largest for head on the courses are nearly parallel so a minor alteration of course is usually enough to avoid collision hanninen and kujala 2012 as a result the action distances are rather short and speed reduction is neither necessary nor effective in comparison to near instantly done minor turns in particular turns of about 30 allow for very small action distances fig 9 at the still acceptable deviation cost also according to the results the fact that manoeuvres to starboard only are considered has no significant impact on action distances determined for target ships on starboard 6 3 overtaking encounters two separate cases of overtaking have been analysed the first one when manoeuvres to either side are possible and the second when turns to one side only are feasible due to some outside obstacles or limitations despite low relative speeds the first case has been found similar to head on in that minor course alterations are usually sufficient even if performed at a short distance from a target ship figs 10 figs 11 and 12 for the lowest relative speeds fig 10 or larger turns fig 11 the action lines are very close to the domain s boundary and resemble its shape for larger relative speeds and smaller turns the action distance is the shortest in case of target ships straight ahead another similarity to head on encounters is the low effectiveness of speed reduction it has only been found useful for target ships on more distant bearings to either side and even then the gain is insignificant fig 12 if manoeuvres to one side only are possible the action distances are considerably larger even by 2 nm when turns have to be made towards target ship figs 13 figs 14 and 15 the distances rise with the relative bearings of target ships except when large course alterations 60 or speed reductions by 6 or more knots are assumed speed reductions are useful when turning towards the target ship as they can significantly shorten the action distances fig 15 6 4 crossing encounters crossing encounters cover a great range of relative bearings so again two cases can be distinguished depending on whether the target ship s relative bearing is up to 60 to starboard or more than that in the first case turns of up to 45 are sufficient for the action distances of about 2 nm fig 18 those turns can be even smaller if accompanied with a speed reduction fig 19 in the second case especially for target ships behind the traverse the action distances are much longer if the distance between ships gets shorter than 3 nm than a truly huge turn is necessary 120 150 as shown in fig 16 or a combination of a large turn e g by 75 and speed reduction by about 6 knots in fig 17 it is particularly interesting and counter intuitional that speed reduction which was practically useless for encounters with target ships ahead head on overtaking and the previous case of crossings becomes essential for late actions in crossing encounters with target ships behind the traverse however it is worth repeating here that in encounter situations a combination of a turn and speed reduction manoeuvre should always be simulated first before being performed simultaneous manoeuvres of course and speed changes may occasionally cancel each other s effect 6 5 encounters in restricted visibility colregs recommend turning away from a target ship when being overtaken and it makes this scenario much easier to solve for moderate target ship s speeds which can be expected in this case a turn of up to 45 is enough to avoid violating ships domains when being overtaken fig 22 even smaller turns of the own ship down to 15 will still be sufficient if they are accompanied by an appropriate speed reduction the largest for target ships near traverse fig 23 as for encountering a target ship in front rule 19 of colregs instructs navigators to turn to starboard rather than port this makes it relatively hard to avoid faster target ships approaching from port fig 20 if a manoeuvre is performed early a turn up to 45 may be sufficient especially if it is combined with a speed reduction however late manoeuvres at a distance of 2 nm or less may require turns by more than 60 fig 21 in general the situation of meeting a target ship in front of the own ship in restricted visibility may be considered hard but still easier to solve than some extreme cases of crossing in good visibility when a fast target ship is behind the traverse fortunately in restricted visibility colregs instructs navigators to turn away from a target ship abaft the beam which eliminates the necessity of most inconvenient manoeuvres and allows for smaller action distances or smaller turns in case of target ships approaching from behind 7 summary and conclusions the paper introduces a method of determining action distances in give way situations when the own ship should perform a specified manoeuvre including speed reduction if necessary the method uses a ship domain and related parameters as criteria for detecting potential close quarters situations it takes into account own ship s dynamics and simulates own ship s movement throughout encounter situation applying robust numerical algorithms and author derived analytical solutions owing to all of the above the method combines high accuracy with a low computational complexity which allows for fast and precise real time computations on board of a ship the method has been applied in a series of extensive simulations to determine action lines around the modelled own ship for a wide array of encounter scenarios chosen scenarios cover head on crossing and overtaking situations manoeuvres limited to course alteration and those combining turns with speed reduction open or confined waters and finally good and restricted visibility in the course of the simulation experiments it has been revealed that the shape of action lines around the own ship largely differs from shapes presented in previous works on this subject the biggest difference is the discontinuity of the action lines which is bound to appear if colregs are to be obeyed some other anomalies and counter intuitional results have been obtained these include among others the fact that one of the most dangerous encounter situations may be crossing when a stand on target ship is approaching fast from behind the traverse rule 15 of colregs instructs the navigators to avoid crossing ahead of a target ship which practically means that a turn to starboard towards a target ship should be made for some combinations of ships positions courses and speeds this particular manoeuvre may require a large action distance or if the distance is already too small reducing own speed significantly similar risk revealing results have been observed for simulating encounters in restricted visibility when a target ship on starboard side is forward of the beam but very close to traverse rule 19 of colregs recommends manoeuvres to starboard in that case which again may be problematic and require early manoeuvre considering the popularity of ship domains as safety criteria in collision avoidance research it is essential to specify when exactly a navigator has to act to avoid domain s violation and it is perhaps equally important to point out situations when earlier than usual or counter intuitional actions should be taken the paper addresses both issues though presented simulation results are obviously dependant on the dynamics of a ship which has been used in the simulations further research utilising a larger number of ship models should be performed to allow for additional and more far fetched statements concerning the subject investigated here acknowledgment the authors thank dr tomasz

23140,ship domain is often used in marine navigation and marine traffic engineering as a safety condition the basic idea behind those applications is that an encounter of two or more ships can be considered safe if neither of ship domains is intruded by other ships research utilising this approach has been documented in numerous works including publications on optimising collision avoidance manoeuvres performed to fulfil domain based safety conditions however up to this point there has been no method which would apply ship s domain to determine the last moment when a particular collision avoidance manoeuvre can still be successfully performed this issue is addressed here the proposed method uses a model of ship s dynamics to assess the time and distance necessary for a manoeuvre resulting in avoiding domain violations in give way situations the model and the method are described in detail and illustrated in a series of simulation results the simulations cover full spectrum of typical give way encounters in various circumstances head on crossing and overtaking situations manoeuvres limited to course alteration and those combining turns with speed reduction open or confined waters and finally in good and restricted visibility keywords collision avoidance manoeuvres evasive manoeuvres ship s manoeuvrability ship domain ship encounters collision risk 1 introduction a ship domain has been first introduced in fujii and tanaka 1971 where it has been defined as a two dimensional area surrounding a ship which other ships must avoid ever since then ship domain concept has been used in maritime research including recent applications to various traffic engineering related problems waterway capacity analysis liu et al 2015 waterway collision risk analyses goerlandt and kujala 2014 goerlandt and montewka 2015 qu et al 2011 weng et al 2012 and ais based near miss detection van iperen 2015 wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 van westrenen and ellerbroek 2017 however it is collision avoidance that is arguably main purpose for ship domain s development pietrzykowski 2008 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 hansen et al 2013 wang and chin 2015 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 and as evidenced by some works it still remains its important field of application szlapczynski 2008 lazarowska 2016 those applications of ship domain are based on the assumption that an encounter of two or more ships can be considered safe if neither of ship domains is intruded by other ships however up to this point there has been no method which would combine ship s manoeuvrability and ship s domain to determine the last moment when a particular collision avoidance manoeuvre can still be successfully performed this issue is addressed in the hereby paper the presented method uses a model of ship s dynamics to assess the time and distance necessary for a manoeuvre successful in terms of avoiding domain violation the method is inspired by action area presented in dinh and im 2016 critical range and time researched in hilgert and baldauf 1997 and critical distance introduced in krata and montewka 2015 and later extended in krata et al 2016 the rest of the paper is organized as follows related works and method s genesis are discussed in section 2 the method is outlined in section 3 which also includes description of its key algorithms the applied ship dynamics model is given in section 4 section 5 provides results obtained for an example ship these results cover typical ship encounters in various circumstances head on crossing and overtaking situations manoeuvres limited to course alteration and those combining turns with speed reduction open or confined waters and finally good and restricted visibility results are discussed in section 6 followed by the summary and conclusions given in section 7 2 related works and the current method s genesis most of collision avoidance research is focused on manoeuvres done in advance with enough time for optimisation kao et al 2007 tam et al 2009 tsou et al 2010 praczyk 2015 zhang et al 2015 tsou 2016 pietrzykowski et al 2017 in comparison there are relatively few works on when exactly a manoeuvre should be performed to achieve safe separation the concept of an arena an evasion area around a ship was first outlined in davis et al 1980 and later developed in colley et al 1983 close quarters term was defined in hilgert 1983 where the author observed that colregs cockcroft et al 2012 do not give specific distances where an evasive action is necessary such limit values at which the navigator has to order the evasive actions were determined in hilgert and baldauf 1997 and the approach presented there was later applied in an on board manoeuvring support system baldauf et al 2014 similarly in zhang et al 2012 a study on minimum distance for escape action was presented based on an analysis of an encounter scenario following this in dinh and im 2016 a combination of analytical approach with utilising expert navigators knowledge was applied to determine a ship s action zone however the limitation of the above research was either the limited number of encounter scenarios taken into account or simplified modelling of ship s manoeuvres those limitations were overcome in krata and montewka 2015 those authors were interested in determining the last moment when collision could still be avoided by manoeuvres of the own ship alone their research involved a detailed analysis of the own ship s evasive action which included precise prediction of the own trajectory based on the manoeuvrability parameters the method was further extended in krata et al 2016 where among others stability issues were taken into account avoidance of excessive heel matusiak and stigler 2012 the final result of both versions of this method was a critical distance between the own ship and a target ship determined for a given encounter situation this critical distance represented the last moment when a manoeuvre had to be performed to avoid collision the method was dedicated to situations when the own ship was a stand on one which generated some additional assumptions among others a resulting near zero separation between ships was assumed there for simulations in practice a manoeuvre would have to be initiated earlier sometimes much earlier if a larger ship separation is supposed to be kept the current paper is inspired by krata and montewka 2015 and the works of their predecessors but the central idea of that paper is here combined with a ship domain model we are interested in a distance and time to potential collision which still make it possible to avoid violation of a specified ship domain additionally the collision avoidance action is supposed to fulfil a number of configurable conditions dictated either by colregs or by a navigator for a given encounter situation a considered turn should be made to starboard or port only depending on the particular encounter and visibility conditions not exceed a given angle of rudder 3 the method s overview contrary to krata and montewka 2015 krata et al 2016 the current method is mostly dedicated for situations when own ship is the give way ship while colregs specify what action should be taken depending on the encounter type it is up to the navigator of the own ship to decide when exactly to perform a manoeuvre this decision may depend on the intended separation which is represented here by a ship s domain a scheme of the method s main algorithm is given in fig 1 the method applies a degree of domain violation ddv a parameter indicating to what extent a ship s domain will be intruded during a close quarters situation szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 in brief the method works as follows it reads the necessary input parameters and detects potential domain violations if a domain violation is predicted based on the current data the encounter situation is classified and the action type is chosen for a chosen action type and auxiliary user specified parameters the method determines the time for initiating the manoeuvre by means of a gradient algorithm which is shown in fig 2 the gradient algorithm fig 2 works as follows at first a set of initial parameters is read comprising of both ship parameters including positions speeds and courses and threshold for the time range ε and action type parameters including manoeuvre direction and ranges of considered course and speed alterations then a candidate time tc is introduced and initialized the algorithm detects potential domain violations of a manoeuvre initiated at time tc domain violations are checked during and after performing the manoeuvre because the latter might be done analytically meaning faster computations after manoeuvre check is performed before during manoeuvre check depending on whether the manoeuvre done at tc is safe or not the considered time range is narrowed up to or down to tc a new tc value is then selected from the updated t1 t2 range based on the results of domain violation check and the simulation is repeated the algorithm ends when the range t1 t2 gets smaller than the threshold value ε once the action time t c is determined fig 2 the action distance is computed according to formula 1 and returned by the algorithm 1 d t c v r t c 2 v r x x r v r y y r t c x r y r 2 where d t c action distance as a function of action time t c action time x r x component of the target s initial relative position y r y component of the target s initial relative position v r target s relative speed v r x x component of the target s relative speed v r y y component of the target s relative speed computed action distance is then further used in the algorithm depicted in fig 1 in general the method s functional scope is limited to determining the distance and time at which the specified manoeuvre preferred by a navigator should be performed in order to avoid domain s violation the manoeuvre s parameters the maximal size of course change and optionally speed reduction are assumed to be set by a navigator a separate complementary decision support tool enabling the navigator to choose a particular manoeuvre has been presented by the authors in szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2015 4 model of ship s manoeuvrability used in the method the model ship taken into account is a mid size ro pax whose particulars are as follows table 1 a matlab script has been prepared to perform the simulation of the model ship dynamics the applied model comprises the following ship s initial speed and her inertia time for gradual reduction of the propeller thrust simple formula for calculation of the hull resistance dependent on ship s speed it was assumed that the ship steaming with service speed equal 17 knots for 100 s is followed by 120 s of the dropping power supply to the propeller the thrust gradually decreases to the value corresponding to the speed 8 knots which still enables to control the course with the use of a rudder however the ship is pushed forward by her inertia besides the propeller thrust so the decrease in speed is slower than the thrust reduction which is assumed a realistic scenario the result of the simulation is presented in fig 3 as it may be clearly seen in fig 3 the reduction of ship speed alone cannot be found as time efficient manoeuvre however speed reduction of the model ship is considered in the research flexible enough to be an additional manoeuvre supporting course alternation according to the result of the performed simulations the ship slowing down characteristics is presented in further computations in the form of a meta model as follows 2 v t i 1 9 s i t i 1 where s i coefficients of the polynomial model and t the time from the speed reduction manoeuvre initiation since there are numerous factors influencing practical manoeuvring characteristics of the ship we utilize laidyn software matusiak 2013 the tool is capable to simulate in time domain motions of a ship in six degrees of freedom with regard to her shape rudder and propulsion action and the action of wind and wave in irregular seas conditions laidyn is based on a panel method and froude krylov force is modelled in nonlinear approach along with diffraction and refraction forces the rudder force is also calculated on the basis of the rudder profile and water flow conditions as a result not only ship inertia is taken into account but also very detailed distribution of friction and pressure field surrounding the hull is considered including sea wave action and hull s generated wave system action as well the ship rolling pitching and heaving is included to the force balance and energy balance calculations the mathematical formulation remaining behind laidyn is as follows 3 d u d t x p r o p x r e s i s t m r v m x u d v d t m r u y v v y r r y r r l m y v d r d t n v v n r r n v v 2 l l p p i z z n r where u the linear velocity along axis x

ship between perpendiculars i zz a mass moment of inertia x u y v y r y r y v n v n r n v n r hydrodynamics derivates the detailed description of the laidyn code is available in matusiak 2007 2013 the state of the art laidyn code satisfactorily passed numerous ittc benchmark tests ittc 2002 ittc 2005 and has been found a reliable simulation tool moreover even the rudder and propeller thrust is directly modelled instead of typical simple attaching of a virtual usually arbitrary set up and fixed in time thrust force which is quite common thus the top quality model of the ship dynamics is utilized in the study which allows for covering of all key hydrodynamic phenomena in this study the laidyn code is utilized to obtain the time histories of the considered ro pax circulations with regard to her 6dof motions similarly to the former work matusiak and stigler 2012 the rudder angle is assumed consecutively to 10 20 and 30 to port and to starboard to obtain the set of trajectories in order to observe noticeable effects of seas action the weather conditions taken into account in simulations are quite heavy e g the wind force is set 8b and the corresponding jonswap wave spectrum is considered the numerical simulations of 6dof ship motions provide the time history of coupled motions with regard to the ship characteristics influencing all degrees of freedom however for further use in evasive manoeuvre planning procedure the shape of ship tracks are essential these trajectories obtained for every single studied case are represented by a set of relative positions in consecutive time steps ti xi yi where xi and yi denote the position of ship s centre of gravity referred to the initial position fixed at the manoeuvre commencing sample trajectories for the model ship are shown in fig 4 the obtained set of simulation results for the model ship turning to port and to starboard comprises the full range of rudder settings reaching from 30 up to 30 as the irregular seas are taken into account the result of a simulation is non deterministic so every single case is repeated three times and averaged at the post processing stage the obtained trajectories are generalized in the form of a meta model consisting in three formulas enabling calculation of ship s centre of gravity relative position in every moment of the turning manoeuvre and the relative heading the relative position and the relative heading refer to the initial position and the initial heading of the ship at the manoeuvre commencing the 5 th and 6 th order polynomial power series constituting the meta model are as follows 4 x t i 1 6 p i t i y t i 1 6 q i t i h e a d i n g r e l t i 1 5 r i t i where x t y t the modelled position of ship s centre of gravity referred to the initial position fixed at the manoeuvre commencing at any time moment heading rel t the relative heading at any time moment taking the initial heading at the manoeuvre commencing as zero t time of the turning manoeuvre continuous variable in the meta model p i q i r i the model coefficients adjusted with the use of least squares method two meta models has been worked out in the course of this study namely the speed reduction model without ship course alternation the turning model without supplied power reduction only natural speed reduction due to circulation exists both models allow for time efficient computations at the stage of collision manoeuvre planning it must be emphasised that the full set of ship motion simulations has to be carried out once only and does not need to be repeated on board which is vital in terms of possible application in future research the ship dynamics model may be extended so as to cover ship s behaviour in severe weather conditions and stability related issues wawrzyński and krata 2016a wawrzyński and krata 2016b krata and wawrzyński 2017a krata and wawrzyński 2017b 5 method s simulation results this section contains results of simulation experiments carried out to determine the boundary line around the own ship which should not be intruded by a target ship if neither of the ships domains own ship s domain as well as target ship s domain are to remain unviolated the domains shown in fig 5 have been applied for head on and crossing encounters left and for overtaking encounters right the domains decentralised elliptic shapes were first proposed in coldwell 1983 but the dimensions used here have been updated so as to be in line with more recent research in the field based on empirical data hansen et al 2013 wang and chin 2015 throughout all test scenarios the model of the own ship from section 4 has been used to generate boundary lines defining ship s arena davis et al 1980 colley et al 1983 the own speed is set to 17 knots for all scenarios unless speed reduction is applied and discussed as for rudder deflection in case of course alteration manoeuvres a 10 rudder deflection has been applied for turns of up to 60 and a 20 rudder deflection for turns larger than that this choice has been dictated by the model of the selected own ship for standard turns of up to 60 a small rudder deflection is sufficient to change course quickly as for large turns a larger rudder deflection is justified to shorten the manoeuvre s execution time however truly large rudder deflections should normally be avoided because of stability related phenomena especially when navigating in harsh weather throughout the simulations normal weather conditions are assumed so as to isolate the action lines dependency on the chosen evasive manoeuvre and its volume 5 1 general results obtained for good and restricted visibility conditions it has been assumed that a single target ship approaches the own ship from various relative bearings with the same true speed or the same relative speed for target ship s positions granularity of 0 05 has been applied in each simulation which means that 7200 target ship s relative bearings have been used to generate a full action line around the own ship all target ships have been placed at 6 nm distance from the own ship as for the courses of the target ships they have been automatically set to values which would result in dcpa equal to 0 and degree of domain violation ddv equal to 1 it must be mentioned here that setting target ships courses to different values would obviously affect the obtained results selected 12 of the above mentioned 7200 target ship s positions are shown in fig 6 results for good visibility and fig 7 results for restricted visibility a fixed true speed of a target ship has been applied by default for various relative bearings of a target ship however in some cases the same true speed did not allow to generate appropriate encounters for all considered relative bearings so the fixed relative speed was used as an alternative when determining ships arenas the two different approaches are shown in fig 6 fixed true speed for various relative bearings of a target ship and fig 7 fixed relative speed for various relative bearings of a target ship where arenas are determined for good and restricted visibility respectively applying fixed relative speed for the restricted visibility case makes it easier to simulate smaller values of relative speeds at which ships should approach each other in restricted visibility in fig 6 a target ship s true speeds of either 18 knots blue line or 25 knots red line have been assumed target ship s speed smaller than 18 knots would not make overtaking possible and the full arena could not be generated for fig 7 target ship s relative speeds of either 5 knots blue line or 12 knots red line have been assumed to illustrate both overtaking and being overtaken a relative speed of a target ship had to be used in fig 7 because the same true speed of a target ship obviously does not allow for both overtaking and being overtaken true speed vectors are marked parallel to target ships domains as can be seen the arenas boundaries are not continuous because different colregs rules begin to apply at some relative bearings in case of good visibility fig 6 the situation becomes classified as crossing for a relative bearing of 22 5 behind traverse so only manoeuvres to starboard are considered for restricted visibility fig 7 only turns to starboard are considered for target ships in front of the own ship unless they are to be overtaken in both cases manoeuvres to starboard for target ships behind the traverse or near the traverse on starboard side require much earlier action as a result the arena s line is more distant from the own ship s domain in the behind the traverse part of the starboard sector fig 6 or near traverse part fig 7 for both figs 6 and 7 course alterations of up to 90 only were considered and speed reduction manoeuvre was not taken into account it must be emphasised here that the arena action line depends strongly on the maximal course alteration and maximal speed reduction which are acceptable from the navigator s point of view maximal acceptable course alteration may be dictated by either navigator s preferences or limitations of a waterway as for reducing own speed this manoeuvre may be undesired in case of some engines so the maximal speed reduction parameter should also be set by a navigator and in some cases it will significantly affect the action distances the abovementioned and other tendencies will be investigated in detail in the following sub sections dedicated to various types of ship to ship encounters 5 2 head on encounters own ship s action lines for head on encounters are presented below in fig 8 action lines for target ships of various true speeds are shown assuming that the encounter takes place in limits sea room conditions and manoeuvres of up to 15 only are possible as can be expected the faster the approaching target ship the earlier the own action is needed in case of a target ship whose true speed is 20 knots the action is needed when the distance is about 4 nm for slower target ships the action can be started at about 3 nm from target ship the action triggering lines are not symmetrical because manoeuvres to starboard only are considered and the domain itself is not symmetrical either the asymmetry is especially evident for slower target ships when the action is started later and the own dynamics and domain s shape heavily affect the results in fig 9 the action lines are shown for various sizes of course changes 15 30 and 60 to starboard as can be seen the action has to be initiated much earlier for course changes limited to 15 the distance can be reduced nearly by half if turns up to 30 are possible larger turns bring relatively little difference in the action distance also as has been investigated speed reduction does not affect the results significantly and is not a recommended option in this case it must be noted however that the latter can be attributed to the own ship s model which allows for very fast turns and relatively more consuming speed reduction 5 3 overtaking in case of overtaking it has been decided to use relative speeds in simulations because a small true speed of a target ship makes it nearly impossible to generate appropriate encounters for more distant relative bearings manoeuvres to either port or starboard are allowed when overtaking and the results for this case are provided in subsection 5 3 1 in some cases however manoeuvre to one side only is possible due to presence of obstacles or some other limitations therefore results for manoeuvres to port are additionally presented in subsection 5 3 2 as for manoeuvres to starboards the results would be nearly mirror images of those to port minor differences appear because of slightly different dynamics of turns to starboard and port so they are not shown 5 3 1 manoeuvres to either side the basic action triggering lines are visualized in fig 10 for small relative speeds the own ship can avoid domain violation by a 15 turn done even at the very last moment as expected much earlier reaction is needed for larger relative speeds up to 4 nautical mile distance in case of approaching a target ship with the unlikely relative speed of 16 knots the distance gets larger for larger relative bearings it is much easier to avoid a target ship directly in front than further on the side when larger turns are applied fig 11 the distance can be reduced from nearly 3 nm to about 1 5 nm for a relative speed of 12 knots speed reduction however brings little gain in terms of reducing the action distance for target ships on more distant relative bearings the distance can be shortened from about 2 8 nm to 2 5 nm which is shown in fig 12 blue parts in fig 12 mark progress achieved by speed reduction when compared to action line obtained for course alteration only marked in red in case of overlapping lines of different colours the red line is always shown on top followed by blue green and black lines as a result for partly overlapping action lines only differences between them are shown 5 3 2 manoeuvres to one side only avoiding domain violation gets significantly harder if small turns to one side only e g to port are possible and the target ship is on that side fig 13 for relative bearings nearing 45 the action distance ranges from about 2 5 nm for relative speed of 4 kn to 5 5 nm for relative speed of 16 knots fortunately larger turns can reduce the distance to about 4 5 nm in the worst case and to 2 5 nm or less for all other cases fig 14 if such turns are not possible than speed reduction is a reasonable alternative fig 15 the action distance can be shortened to about 3 5 nm when reducing own speed by 3 kn or to 3 nm when reducing by 6 kn further speed reduction brings little gain 5 4 crossing encounters with a target ship whose true speed is 18 knots have been investigated throughout this subsection rule 15 of colregs states that the give way ship should avoid crossing ahead of the other ship which in this case means avoiding turns to port a turn of 75 to starboard has been found the minimal one which still made it possible to avoid domain violation for target ships behind the traverse on starboard however the manoeuvre would have to be initiated at a distance of about 4 5 nm larger turns enabled actions at shorter distances about 2 8 nm for 90 1 5 nm for 120 and 1 nm for 150 fig 16 a combination of course alteration and speed reduction has occurred to be a useful alternative to large turns fig 17 the same 75 turn makes it possible to act at a 2 6 nm distance when combined with a reduction of speed by 3 knots a reduction by 6 knots may reduce the action distance to less than 2 nm and the gain is the largest in case of target ships far behind the traverse speed reductions by more than 6 knots are not justified as they cannot effectively shorten the action distance it is worth noting that much smaller turns are sufficient in case of a target ship in front even though the same true speed of a target ship 18 knots results in larger relative speed manoeuvres of only 20 to starboard are sufficient to avoid domain violation if initiated at 6 5 nm distance from the target ship by enlarging the turn to 30 45 or 60 the distance can be reduced to 4 1 nm 2 6 nm and 1 9 nm respectively fig 18 a turn by 20 combined with speed reduction may reduce the action distance to 5 nm or 4 2 nm in case of reductions by 3 or 6 knots respectively fig 19 larger speed reductions do not bring significant gain 5 5 restricted visibility in restricted visibility manoeuvres to starboard are recommended for all target ships in front of the own ship this makes it particularly hard to avoid domain s violation in case of fast approaching target ships on port fig 20 the action distance values rise to about 5 nm for relative bearings of 50 55 and manoeuvres up to 45 this can be attributed to the fact that turning by 45 to starboard makes the courses of both ships nearly parallel so the own ship needs a larger turn to escape the faster target ship indeed the action distance falls rapidly to 3 nm and less if manoeuvres up to 60 are considered larger turns however bring smaller progress and it takes a 90 turn to reduce the distance to 2 nm the action line has a less dramatic shape on starboard side where a 4 5 nm action distance is needed in case of 45 turn for a target ship on traverse again the action distance can be easily shortened to 3 nm and less for larger turns as for speed reduction it can shorten the action distance to 3 4 nm for the worst cases of target ships on port and to about 2 3 nm for target ships on far starboard near traverse fig 21 in case of being overtaken by a target ship in restricted visibility a turn away from the target ship is recommended this combined with a small relative speed makes it much easier to avoid domain violation smaller turns or shorter action distances are sufficient fig 22 a turn of 15 is sufficient for a target ship behind on near parallel course the same turn however is not enough for target ships near traverse the own manoeuvres would have to be made extremely early enlarging the size of a turn brings consequent progress shortening the action distance to 3 5 nm for 30 and about 1 nm for 45 similar results can be obtained by a combination of course alteration and speed reduction fig 23 the action distance can be shortened to 3 2 nm if a 6 knot reduction is combined with a turn by 15 the latter is particularly important if turns have to be minimised due to limitations of a waterway 6 discussion and summary of results the ship whose model has been used throughout the simulations is very manoeuvrable a full circulation takes 150 s when turning to starboard and 172 when turning to port speed reduction on the other hand is harder to make for the assumed ship and it takes about 10 min to reduce own speed from 17 to 8 knots obviously the obtained results are affected by the abovementioned dynamics of own manoeuvres the manoeuvring abilities of the own ship are however to some extent neutralized by the high speeds of both the own ship and the target ships used in the simulations therefore roughly similar results may be expected in case of a less manoeuvrable own ship and lower speeds it must be also emphasised here that the presented method checks the effects of all combinations of course change and speed change that are within the limits specified by a user the optimal combination the one allowing for the latest action is always chosen as already depicted in fig 1 and these optimal combinations produce the action distances shown in the figures in section 5 in general a combination of course change and speed reduction should always be carefully planned as simultaneous turn and speed reduction may sometimes cancel each other s effects a detailed method for choosing a combination of own course and speed in an encounter situation to avoid collision has been presented in szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2015 6 1 discontinuity of action lines around the own ship the first noteworthy observation concerns the already mentioned discontinuity of the determined action lines if the action distances are computed for wide sectors around the own ship and colregs compliance is assumed then action lines will lose continuity in the points where different colregs rules start to apply in good visibility the action distances will rise drastically for relative bearings where overtaking manoeuvres to either side turns into crossing manoeuvres to starboard only as shown in fig 6 similarly in restricted visibility the action distances will greatly rise for target ships observed ahead of traverse manoeuvres to starboard mean turning towards a target ship when compared with target ships behind the traverse manoeuvres away from a target ship which are more effective as shown in fig 7 this fact has not been properly investigated before by researchers proposing arena shapes davis et al 1980 colley et al 1983 or action zone dinh and im 2016 and as evidenced here it makes a huge difference in the obtained action distances for various bearings around the own ship 6 2 head on encounters unsurprisingly head on encounters have been found the easiest to solve even though relative speeds are the largest for head on the courses are nearly parallel so a minor alteration of course is usually enough to avoid collision hanninen and kujala 2012 as a result the action distances are rather short and speed reduction is neither necessary nor effective in comparison to near instantly done minor turns in particular turns of about 30 allow for very small action distances fig 9 at the still acceptable deviation cost also according to the results the fact that manoeuvres to starboard only are considered has no significant impact on action distances determined for target ships on starboard 6 3 overtaking encounters two separate cases of overtaking have been analysed the first one when manoeuvres to either side are possible and the second when turns to one side only are feasible due to some outside obstacles or limitations despite low relative speeds the first case has been found similar to head on in that minor course alterations are usually sufficient even if performed at a short distance from a target ship figs 10 figs 11 and 12 for the lowest relative speeds fig 10 or larger turns fig 11 the action lines are very close to the domain s boundary and resemble its shape for larger relative speeds and smaller turns the action distance is the shortest in case of target ships straight ahead another similarity to head on encounters is the low effectiveness of speed reduction it has only been found useful for target ships on more distant bearings to either side and even then the gain is insignificant fig 12 if manoeuvres to one side only are possible the action distances are considerably larger even by 2 nm when turns have to be made towards target ship figs 13 figs 14 and 15 the distances rise with the relative bearings of target ships except when large course alterations 60 or speed reductions by 6 or more knots are assumed speed reductions are useful when turning towards the target ship as they can significantly shorten the action distances fig 15 6 4 crossing encounters crossing encounters cover a great range of relative bearings so again two cases can be distinguished depending on whether the target ship s relative bearing is up to 60 to starboard or more than that in the first case turns of up to 45 are sufficient for the action distances of about 2 nm fig 18 those turns can be even smaller if accompanied with a speed reduction fig 19 in the second case especially for target ships behind the traverse the action distances are much longer if the distance between ships gets shorter than 3 nm than a truly huge turn is necessary 120 150 as shown in fig 16 or a combination of a large turn e g by 75 and speed reduction by about 6 knots in fig 17 it is particularly interesting and counter intuitional that speed reduction which was practically useless for encounters with target ships ahead head on overtaking and the previous case of crossings becomes essential for late actions in crossing encounters with target ships behind the traverse however it is worth repeating here that in encounter situations a combination of a turn and speed reduction manoeuvre should always be simulated first before being performed simultaneous manoeuvres of course and speed changes may occasionally cancel each other s effect 6 5 encounters in restricted visibility colregs recommend turning away from a target ship when being overtaken and it makes this scenario much easier to solve for moderate target ship s speeds which can be expected in this case a turn of up to 45 is enough to avoid violating ships domains when being overtaken fig 22 even smaller turns of the own ship down to 15 will still be sufficient if they are accompanied by an appropriate speed reduction the largest for target ships near traverse fig 23 as for encountering a target ship in front rule 19 of colregs instructs navigators to turn to starboard rather than port this makes it relatively hard to avoid faster target ships approaching from port fig 20 if a manoeuvre is performed early a turn up to 45 may be sufficient especially if it is combined with a speed reduction however late manoeuvres at a distance of 2 nm or less may require turns by more than 60 fig 21 in general the situation of meeting a target ship in front of the own ship in restricted visibility may be considered hard but still easier to solve than some extreme cases of crossing in good visibility when a fast target ship is behind the traverse fortunately in restricted visibility colregs instructs navigators to turn away from a target ship abaft the beam which eliminates the necessity of most inconvenient manoeuvres and allows for smaller action distances or smaller turns in case of target ships approaching from behind 7 summary and conclusions the paper introduces a method of determining action distances in give way situations when the own ship should perform a specified manoeuvre including speed reduction if necessary the method uses a ship domain and related parameters as criteria for detecting potential close quarters situations it takes into account own ship s dynamics and simulates own ship s movement throughout encounter situation applying robust numerical algorithms and author derived analytical solutions owing to all of the above the method combines high accuracy with a low computational complexity which allows for fast and precise real time computations on board of a ship the method has been applied in a series of extensive simulations to determine action lines around the modelled own ship for a wide array of encounter scenarios chosen scenarios cover head on crossing and overtaking situations manoeuvres limited to course alteration and those combining turns with speed reduction open or confined waters and finally good and restricted visibility in the course of the simulation experiments it has been revealed that the shape of action lines around the own ship largely differs from shapes presented in previous works on this subject the biggest difference is the discontinuity of the action lines which is bound to appear if colregs are to be obeyed some other anomalies and counter intuitional results have been obtained these include among others the fact that one of the most dangerous encounter situations may be crossing when a stand on target ship is approaching fast from behind the traverse rule 15 of colregs instructs the navigators to avoid crossing ahead of a target ship which practically means that a turn to starboard towards a target ship should be made for some combinations of ships positions courses and speeds this particular manoeuvre may require a large action distance or if the distance is already too small reducing own speed significantly similar risk revealing results have been observed for simulating encounters in restricted visibility when a target ship on starboard side is forward of the beam but very close to traverse rule 19 of colregs recommends manoeuvres to starboard in that case which again may be problematic and require early manoeuvre considering the popularity of ship domains as safety criteria in collision avoidance research it is essential to specify when exactly a navigator has to act to avoid domain s violation and it is perhaps equally important to point out situations when earlier than usual or counter intuitional actions should be taken the paper addresses both issues though presented simulation results are obviously dependant on the dynamics of a ship which has been used in the simulations further research utilising a larger number of ship models should be performed to allow for additional and more far fetched statements concerning the subject investigated here acknowledgment the authors thank dr tomasz

23141,marine hydrokinetic energy in ocean currents can be harvested using vortex induced vibration viv the purpose of this paper is to investigate the viv energy harvesting and maximize the power to volume density by arranging four staggered cylinders reasonably consequently the effect of spacing between the cylinders is the focus considered throughout this paper the in flow spacing x varies from 1 2d to 10 0d where d is the diameter of the cylinder the transverse spacing y varies from 2 0d to 8 0d a series of numerical simulations are conducted using two dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations in conjunction with the k ω sst turbulence model results indicate that the interference between the tandem cylinders is stronger than between the side by side arranged cylinders the multi cylinder interference is divided into three regions synchronization region blocking encouraged region and recovery region interaction effects can induce much more vigorous viv response of the downstream cylinder in encouraged region where the maximum converted power ratio reaches up to 3 9 with in flow spacing x of 2 0d and transverse spacing y of 4 0d moreover the average power to volume density will keep increasing as the spacing x decreases if there are no other physical limitations these results lead the way for future layout optimization of multiple cylinders keywords vortex

environmental pollution problems have promoted the development of renewable energy technology ocean currents which contain a great deal of predictable and renewable energy have an enormous potential for electric power generation in particular a vortex induced vibration aquatic clean energy vivace converter invented by bernitsas et al at the university of michigan bernitsas et al 2006 2008 uses the viv phenomenon for the first time to harvest energy from ocean currents and convert it to electricity when exposed to a fluid flow the converter enhances rather than spoils vortex shedding on either side of the oscillator a circular cylinder resulting in maximizing rather than suppressing viv experimental investigations on the viv response of a single cylinder have been conducted in recent years for a low mass ratio viv system e g m 2 4 khalak and williamson 1996 1997 at cornell university investigated the viv responses of circular cylinders and found three kinds of branches of the viv amplitude curve initial branch upper branch and lower branch govardhan et al govardhan and williamson 2006 and raghavan et al raghavan and bernitsas 2011 analyzed the reynolds number effect on viv of rigid cylinders on elastic supports it was found that the range of synchronization in the upper branch increases with reynolds number park h et al park et al 2013 reported the galloping range follows the viv range thus expanding dramatically the fim range lee j h et al lee et al 2011 built a virtual damper spring system for viv experiments thus improving the efficiency of the viv experiments zhao et al 2013 investigated the viv responses of a square cylinder at a low reynolds number and found the flow approaching angle affects not only the vibration amplitude but also the lock in regime which is different from circular cylinders then the viv energy conversion of cylinders was improved continuously it was reported that a single cylinder d 8 9 cm l 91 4 cm converter successfully generated power from currents as slow as 0 4 m s and the maximum power reached up to 15 85 w at flow speed of 1 11 m s lee and bernitsas 2011 the converter is robust to environmental changes compared with other similar energy converters the vivace converter has much better adaptability a single vivce converter cannot provide high enough power for the actual utilization therefore multiple converters can be placed in close proximity to establish an array some researches have been conducted by placing multiple cylinders in tandem two cylinder systems have been studied the most because they are the simplest multi cylinder arrangement zdravkovich 1985 studied flow induced oscillations of two interfering circular cylinders assi et al 2006 further verified flow induced vibration interference between two circular cylinders employing a piv system alam et al 2005 investigated fluid forces acting on two staggered circular cylinders of equal diameter in cross flow they found at very small spacing lift forces depend largely on the gap flow between the cylinders obviously when multiple cylinders are in close staggered formation interaction effects will significantly affect the viv responses furthermore interaction effects have been used to further enhance viv or fim flow induced motion of tandem cylinders kim et al kim et al 2013 kim and bernitsas 2016 reported that the multiple converters 2 4 cylinders placed in tandem the spacing changes from 2 5d to 5d will produce higher power density the synergy scale converted energy ratio of downstream cylinders was greater than one in the reduced velocity range of 8 2 u 11 6 the maximum value of the synergy scale reaches up to about 2 0 kim and bernitsas 2016 it indicates that multiple cylinder interference may enable higher viv responses and converted power ding et al 2015a studied the effect of tandem spacing on flow induced motions of two cylinders with passive turbulence control in addition bernitsas 2016 has reported many different types of the viv responses of multiple cylinders but the interaction effects from side cylinders have not been considered at the same time huera huarte et al huera huarte and gharib 2011 investigated flow induced vibrations of a side by side arrangement of two flexible circular cylinders similarly zhou et al 2001 reported free vibrations of two side by side cylinders previous studies mainly focused on multiple cylinders in tandem or side by side arrangement few studies exist on interference among multiple cylinders in a close staggered array in two directions the viv responses of multiple cylinders in staggered configuration are quite different from those of the cylinders in tandem or side by side arrangement it is noteworthy that ming zhao et al 2015 have investigated flow induced vibration of a square array of cylinders however the research is mainly in the viv fiv responses but not in the energy conversion consequently the relevant research is urgent in the present study the viv responses and energy conversion of four cylinders in close staggered formation will be investigated in detail for multi cylinder arrangements the mutual interference between the cylinders is more complex upstream cylinders generate a high level of turbulence and a series of shed vortices acting on the downstream cylinders assi et al 2010 cfd computational fluid dynamics method has become a very useful tool in investigating vortex shedding and wake structure ding et al 2015b 2016 have analyzed the viv of different bluff bodies via numerical simulations using openfoam govardhan and williamson et al govardhan and williamson 2000 blackburn et al 2001 investigated viv and the shedding mode of vortices using 2 and 3 dimensional numerical simulations the effect of tip flow on viv of circular cylinders was also studied by kinaci et al 2016 using cfd method tang et al 2015 and joly et al 2012 have investigated the flow induced motion of a square cylinder using cfd software fluent these studies have indicated that cfd method could accurately predict integral properties of viv such as vortices forces motions the main goal of this paper is to maximize the power to volume density by arranging the cylinders reasonably consequently the effect of spacing between the cylinders is the focus considered throughout this paper four close cylinders are selected as a unit and investigated in detail unlike previous studies both the spacing x in the flow direction varying from 1 2d to 10d and the spacing y transversely to the flow direction varying from 2d to 8d are taken into account at the same time numerical simulations are conducted at different spacing the results show that the viv response and converted power of the cylinders will be significantly enhanced by using wake energy and interaction effects the maximum amplitude reaches up to 1 78d the maximum converted power ratio reaches up to 3 9 at x 2 0d and y 4 0d furthermore by properly placing four cylinders in an array e g x 1 2d and y 7d higher average power to volume density can be achieved more conclusions are summarized at the end 2 geometry configuration 2 1 physical model the concept of the vivace converter was initially introduced as a single smooth circular cylinder module bernitsas et al 2006 2008 the main elements of the converter consist of a cylinder springs transmission mechanisms and a generator fig 1 a shows a schematic of the vivace converter zhang et al 2017 the cylinder is elastically supported by two linear end springs and drives the generator a simplified physical model is also established as shown in fig 1 b k represents the stiffness of the springs c total represents the total system damping of the transmission mechanisms and the generator a is the oscillating amplitude of the cylinder vortex streets provide alternating lift acting on the cylinder when the vortex formation frequency close to the cylinder s natural frequency the phenomenon of lock in and high amplitude oscillation occur bernitsas et al 2008 khalak and williamson 1997 since the transverse amplitude of a viv bluff body is significantly higher than the streamwise amplitude only one degree of freedom is considered the cylinder is free to respond in the transverse y direction which is perpendicular to the flow velocity the viv responses of a single smooth circular cylinder and ptc cylinders with localized surface roughness have been investigated at different setup parameters by kim and park et al park et al 2013 kim et al 2013 kim and bernitsas 2016 ptc stands for passive turbulence control ptc is appended on smooth circular cylinders surface in the form of selective roughness to enhance flow induced vibration the present simulation data will be compared with the experimental data presented by park et al 2013 consequently in the following simulations the testing parameters refer these experiments according to the practical application the present viv system is characterized by high reynolds number value and low mass ratio m 1 68 the main parameters are presented in table 1 in this work the focused flow speed is about 1 0 m s based on the actual current speed the corresponding reynolds number is about 8 2 104 at flow speed of 1 0 m s four cylinders are placed in close proximity to each other as shown in fig 2 clearly close staggered cylinders will be significantly influenced by others interaction effects among the cylinders are more complex than multiple cylinders in tandem or side by side arrangement the four cylinder system including cylinder a b c and d is the most representative example for a staggered array cylinder c and d are slightly staggered and placed symmetrically on both sides of cylinder a and b for all tests the additional challenge in close staggered formation is that unlike for tandem or side by side arrangement for which the side cylinders have a significant impact on the upstream or downstream cylinders the viv responses of the four cylinders depend on the spacing between them the horizontal center to center spacing x between cylinder a and b in the flow direction and the vertical center to center spacing y between cylinder c and d transversely to the flow direction are variable and will be studied in detail in the following sections 2 2 equation of viv response in this section a mathematical model for the fim system is presented in this section a combined mass spring damper oscillator model is used to describe the dynamics of the rectangular cylinder the equation of motion in y direction with one degree of freedom is given as 1 m y disp c total y disp k y disp f fluid y t where y disp is the displacement of the cylinder transversely to the flow f fluid y t is the fluid force acting on the cylinder in the y direction m is the total mass of the oscillatory system in addition the added mass was also taken into consideration the total fluid force f fluid y t includes the heave motion induced inertia force and viscous force which result in the added mass and viscous effects according to the cfd method f fluid y t can be obtained directly using fluent solver from the numerical computations thus the added mass and viscous effects has been considered and included in the total fluid force f fluid y t it should be noted that c total is the total system damping which includes the damping of the transmission system and the generator etc in order to evaluate the energy conversion of the cylinder total energy converted from the flow to the cylinder in one cycle is defined as 2 e viv 1 2 k a 2 0 t o s c c total y disp d t where t o s c represents a cycle of oscillation e viv represents the total energy converted from currents energy to mechanical energy the detailed definition of e viv has been given by kim et al kim and bernitsas 2016 on the right hand side of eq 2 the first term is the total mechanical energy stored in the oscillation system the second term represents the work consumed energy done by the system damping force to simplify eq 2 and obtain the mathematical model of e viv the motion of the cylinder could be assumed as approximately sinusoidal bernitsas et al 2008 ding et al 2015b therefore the displacement y disp of the cylinder can be expressed as 3 y disp a sin 2 π f o s c t where f o s c is the oscillation frequency of the cylinder the velocity of the cylinder in the y direction can be deduced by derivation analysis as 4 y disp 2 π f o s c a cos 2 π f o s c t thus eq 2 can be rewritten as 5 e viv 1 2 k a 2 0 t o s c c t o t a l 2 π f o s c a cos 2 π f o s c t d t finally eq 5 can be further simplified the simplification approach and details are based on refs bernitsas et al 2008 kim and bernitsas 2016 therefore more details are not discussed here the final expression of e viv per cycle can be expressed as 6 e viv 1 2 k a 2 2 π 2 c t o t a l f o s c a 2 furthermore the viv power extracted from the flow over a cycle of oscillation t o s c is defined as 7 p viv 1 t o s c e v i v to evaluate the power to volume density p viv v of a vivce converter p viv v is estimated based on the viv power p viv of the cylinders in close staggered formation 8 p viv v p viv v p viv 1 s p viv 1 xy 3 numerical method 3 1 mathematical model in the present work the flow around the cylinders is numerically simulated using 2d reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations accompanied with the k ω sst shear stress transport turbulence model menter 1994 the requirement of the present study is the precision of the numerical study should be as close to experimental data at the beginning of the study other turbulence models have already been analyzed such as the spalart allmaras s a turbulence model and the k epsilon k ε turbulence model for the s a turbulence model the viv upper branch can t be found which is far from the experimental data for the k epsilon k ε turbulence model the prediction precision of the simulation results is low and more than anything the viv responses terminated prematurely in the viv lower branch in general the k ω sst turbulence model is most accurate based on verification tests compared with other tested turbulence models and the k ω model is well suited for simulating flow in the viscous sub layer and for predicting flow behavior in regions away from the cylinder these advantages make the k ω turbulence model suitable for the viv responses of multiple cylinders by using the k ω sst turbulence model all the branches of the viv responses can be found and are in agreement with the experimental data in addition according to a similar study lin 2013 it is also proved that the k ω sst model is better than k ε model on the whole for a low mass ratio viv system therefore the k ω turbulence model is acceptable and selected in this work simulations were performed based on a reliable cfd software fluent the dynamic mesh is applied in the present study user defined functions udf are written and embedded in fluent to solve the motion of cylinders in cfd simulations the dynamic mesh method is used to model flows where the position or shape of the domain is changing with time due to motion on the domain boundaries in this paper the dynamic mesh method is based on local remeshing method to adapt for large displacement specifically according to the fluid force and the velocity of a cylinder the udf was redacted in the fluent solver to specify the moving of the cylinders then based on the new positions the near wall grids of the cylinders were updated by the scheme of remeshing newmark β method is used in udf newmark β method is a method of numerical integration used to solve differential equations newmark 1959 newmark β method is widely used to solve the mass spring damper oscillator model and has been successfully used to describe the oscillatory system xiaolong 2015 deü and matignon 2010 the solution of the mass spring damper oscillator model eq 1 can be obtained by using newmark β method based on the basic assumptions of center difference method an explicit difference method for dynamic equation is used firstly using the extended mean value theorem newmark β method states that the first time derivative velocity in the equation of motion can be solved as 9 u t δ t u t u t δ t where u is the velocity of the fim cylinder in y direction then further derivation leads to 10 u t δ t u t 1 γ u t γ u t δ t δ t where γ 0 5 which means a center difference method because acceleration also varies with time the extended mean value theorem must also be extended to the second time derivative to obtain the correct displacement thus 11 u t δ t u t u δ t 1 2 β u t β u t δ t δ t 2 two weightings gama γ and beta β are just two constants in newmark β method in mathematics according to previous articles xiaolong 2015 deü and matignon 2010 newmark β method had shown that reasonable values of γ and β are 0 5 and 0 25 which is unconditionally stable and second order accurate for non dissipative linear systems according to eq 10 and eq 11 u t δ t and u t δ t can be expressed as 12 u t δ t 1 β δ t 2 u t δ t u t 1 β δ t u t 1

used in the udf implemented by using c computer language the flowchart of the numerical simulation is also given as fig 3 3 2 computational domain the entire computational domain and grids are illustrated in fig 4 the computational domain is 25d 20d which includes four kinds of boundaries inlet outlet side wall and cylinders the blockage effects are verified by comparing the viv responses under different distance between side boundaries the tested distances are 10d 15d 20d and 30d when the distance is short 10d and 15d the blockage effects exist and the viv amplitude is slightly compressed however when the distance increases to 20d and 30d there were only about 0 5 relative errors in the viv amplitude between two different distances the blockage effects can already be ignored therefore taking calculation efficiency and grid number into consideration the distance between the side walls is defined as 20d the inflow velocity is considered as uniform and constant 1 0 m s at the outflow boundary a zero gradient condition is specified for velocity the distance from the cylinder to the outlet boundary is sufficiently long thus the zero gradient boundary condition has negligible influence on the near wake region of the cylinder according to verification tests the side wall conditions are not disturbed by the presence of cylinder since the distance from the cylinder to the boundary is large enough thus the velocities at the side walls are set to be the same as the inflow free slip with the flow the grid density in the distortion domain is further enhanced for the near wall region of the cylinders the value of y is set close to 1 on the cylinders walls correspondingly the minimum grid size is 3 10 5 m based on the dynamic mesh when under the influence of fluid forces the cylinders will oscillate in distortion domain the four cylinders can oscillate freely transversely to the flow as shown in fig 4 since the interference between the cylinders in tandem is in general stronger than in the side by side arrangement the range of the spacing x is greater that of the spacing y x varies from 1 2d to 10d y varies from 2d to 8d 3 3 numerical method validation since the transient cfd method is applied in this paper time step independence validation was conducted first to assess the numerical uncertainty time step independence validation is conducted using different time steps ranging from 0 001s step to 0 005s step the viv amplitude curves in the first 4 s are compared in fig 5 a the viv amplitudes have great consistency at different time steps especially for 0 001 0 003s step the average relative error of the maximum amplitudes is about 0 67 taking the calculation efficiency into consideration 0 003s step is selected in these cfd simulations similarly the grid resolution analysis is tested by assessing the viv responses with different grid densities four different grid densities are considered for the grid sensitivity study with 35000 40000 47000 62000 elements as shown in fig 5 b the four grids produce similar results with error less than 1 03 to ensure the accuracy and efficiency the grid density with approximately 50000 elements is selected in the present work in general for each case the total simulation time is 45 0 s time step size 0 003s 20 iterations step number of time steps 15000 the total simulation time was determined based on the convergent limit of the residual when the number of time steps reaches about 3000 9s the monitored iteration residuals are less than 10 03 10 5 in order to assure the accuracy of the numerical results and reached a higher statistically stationary regime the iteration was continued until the total simulation time 45 0s 15000 time steps was reached the final 25 30 cycles are selected and averaged in the reported plots in this case the numerical solutions are considered convergent and the numerical uncertainty is acceptable numerical method is verified by other classical experimental results and cfd results in predicting amplitude and frequency park et al 2013 bernitsas 2016 according to the previous experiments main test parameters of the viv system for the numerical method validation are presented in table 2 the viv response was numerically simulated in the range of 2 u reduced velocity 14 2 as shown in figs 6 and 7 correspondingly the range of flow velocity is 0 04 m s u 0 29 m s the oscillation frequency is calculated by fft fast fourier transform of the displacement when u 4 at lower velocities the amplitude increases rapidly corresponding to the viv initial branch the viv upper branch covers a broader range of u 4 u 7 the amplitude ratio is approximately 0 8 1 0 in this range the upper branch represents the optimum regime for energy harnessing the oscillation frequency is locked above the natural frequency finally the viv phenomenon will disappear at the end of the low branch u 12 it is also found that for smooth cylinders galloping will not occur at higher velocities in general the numerical data follows closely to the experimental data the most important features of amplitude and frequency are in agreement with the each other despite some differences remain the difference between experiments and cfd values in the upper branch is mainly caused by two reasons the first reason is in the reference experiments the viv system parameters are given in non dimensional or normalized format such as the mass ratio m the damping ratio ξ and the reduced velocity u etc thus the actual parameters must be obtained by derivation based on the non dimensional parameters which may lead to these differences the second reason is the current study was conducted by using two dimensional assumption it simulates ideal three dimensional fluid without lateral flow the viv upper branch means that the vortex shedding frequency coincides with the natural frequency of the viv system for the ideal three dimensional fluid in the numerical simulations the range of the vortex shedding frequency is very narrow and sensitive accordingly the upper branch is relatively narrow at the coincidence point which is different with actual fluid in experimental test similar conclusions were also drawn in other literature bernitsas 2016 lin 2013 in addition to this difference in the upper branch all the branches of the viv responses can be found and are in agreement with the experimental data the initial branch the upper branch and the lower branch almost appear at the same time compared with the experimental data therefore the numerical method is acceptable and could be used in understanding the viv response furthermore vortex patterns velocity distributions and wake interactions can be accurately displayed using the numerical method finally a simulation example is given at the flow speed of 0 6 m s as shown in fig 8 there is a long wake in the flow direction shed vortices are close to each other two vortices shed from the cylinder per cycle of oscillation consequently the mode of vortex shedding is similar to the classical karman vortex street in the vicinity of the cylinder the vortex pattern is a typical 2s pattern ding et al 2015b zdravkovich 1977 in the position of high velocity vortices high turbulence intensity areas appear correspondingly 4 results and analysis 4 1 typical viv responses in the case of four cylinders in close staggered formation the downstream and side cylinders cylinder b c and d are subjected to a more complex flow generated from the upstream cylinder it should be emphasized that the present study focuses on the effect of the spacing therefore besides the spacing x and y other parameters are not considered in detail first for better explanation of the viv responses a zoning map versus x and y is introduced according to whether the cylinders click on each other as shown in fig 9 there are three zones including c d collision zone c d a b collision zone and no collision zone the collision zone means the cylinder will click on each other before two cylinders click on each other the mesh between two cylinders will be compressed and updated based on the dynamic mesh method when the two cylinders click on each other negative grids appear then the iterative computation will be suspended 4 1 1 c d a b collision zone and c d collision zone in order to better illustrate the viv response in the c d a b collision zone and c d collision zone wake structure is studied in the collision zone the cylinders will click on each other two representative simulation examples case1 x 1 7 y 4 and case2 x 4 y 2 5 are given for c d collision and c d a b collision at flow speed 1 0 m s re 8 2 104 velocity vector charts are shown in fig 10 the upstream cylinders generate a long wake acting on the downstream cylinders meanwhile there is a feedback from the downstream cylinders leading to a very complex interaction between the cylinders 4 1 2 no collision zone two simulation results are given as examples in the no collision zone case 3 x 2 y 3 and case 4 x 10 y 7 in the following sections the values of x and y are selected in the no collision zone to avoid the risk of clicking on each other for case 3 velocity vector charts and pressure distributions are shown in fig 11 when the cylinders are placed very close to each other it is clearly seen the wake from upstream and side cylinders a c and d affects the motion of the downstream cylinder b a lot of vortices act on the downstream cylinder it can also be observed the flow speed in the front of the cylinders is reduced at the high speed areas low pressure areas appear correspondingly the amplitude curves of cylinder a and b are compared in fig 12 a 1 the amplitude of cylinder b downstream cylinder is higher than that of cylinder a upstream cylinder or a single cylinder in isolation the amplitude curves of cylinder c and d are compared in fig 12 a 2 the average peak amplitude of cylinder b reaches up to 0 12m and is almost 1 35 times more than that of a single cylinder it indicates that the interaction effects enhance the viv response of the downstream cylinder other studies have also got similar conclusions kim et al 2013 kim and bernitsas 2016 the oscillating frequency for each cylinder is processed using fast fourier transform fft as shown in fig 12 b the oscillation frequency is not notably affected by the spacing it is also easy to observe that the motion of cylinder a is suppressed when the spacing x is small due to the presence of cylinder b it is conjectured that cylinder b is too close to cylinder a which blocks the flow and decreases the flow velocity for cylinder c and d the viv responses are similar the average amplitudes are slightly smaller than that of a single cylinder for case 4 x 10 0 y 7 0 velocity distributions and turbulence intensity distributions are shown in fig 13 since the spacing is large enough the viv responses of the four cylinders are almost independent to each other due to higher velocity the vortex pattern of the cylinders is different from that of a single cylinder placed in low speed flow for example at 0 6 m s as shown in fig 8 the vortices shed are significantly elongated as shown in fig 14 the viv amplitudes of the cylinders in a large sparse array are somewhat similar to that of a single cylinder the amplitude of cylinder b is slightly higher than that of the cylinder a or a single cylinder in isolation for cylinder c and d the amplitudes are in close proximity to each other meanwhile the amplitudes are quite approximate to that of a single cylinder more characteristics will be discussed in the following sections 4 2 amplitude response in the no collision zone the effect of spacing on viv amplitudes of the four cylinders is investigated in detail the interaction effects among multiple cylinders in close staggered formation are different from multiple cylinders in tandem or side by side arrangement the amplitude ratio curves of the four cylinders are summarized in fig 15 according to some literature zdravkovich 1977 2003 zhou and alam 2016 when analyzing stationary staggered cylinders in flow it was summarized the interference between the cylinders could be divided into different regions such as proximity interference wake interference proximity and wake interference and no interference similarly for better understanding of the viv responses of the four cylinders the amplitude ratio curves are divided into 3 different regions versus the spacing x a synchronization region occurs when x changes from 1 2d to 2d b blocking region encouraged region occurs when the spacing x changes from 2d to 4d c recovery region occurs when the spacing x changes from 4d to 10d more explanations about each region are as follows 4 2 1 synchronization region when the downstream and side cylinders cylinder b c and d are placed very close to the upstream cylinder cylinder a x 2d there is a synchronization phenomenon that the four cylinders will oscillate together the curves show the amplitudes of the four cylinders are slightly higher than that of a single cylinder in isolation 4 2 2 blocking region encouraged region when the spacing is the spacing 2d x 4d the viv response of upstream cylinders will be obviously affected by downstream cylinders for the upstream and side cylinders cylinder a cylinder c and cylinder d the viv amplitude is significantly lower corresponding to blocking region since the downstream cylinder cylinder b leads to blockage and decreases the flow velocity the minimum amplitude even reduces to 0 36d in general the amplitudes of cylinder a cylinder c and cylinder d increase with the vertical spacing y for the downstream cylinder cylinder b there is an important phenomenon that the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is greater than that of a single cylinder in the encouraged region similar phenomena were also found in previous studies kim et al 2013 kim and bernitsas 2016 when involving multiple cylinders in tandem array it is conjectured that low pressure vortices in the wake motivated by upstream cylinder cyclically acts on the downstream cylinder which further enhances the lift on the downstream cylinder in y direction consequently the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is encouraged for cylinder b at the spacing of x 2d and y 4d the amplitude ratio even reaches up to 1 78 4 2 3 recovery region for large spacing x 4d as the spacing x and y increase the amplitudes gradually recover and tend closer to the amplitude of a single cylinder in isolation it indicates the interaction effects and wake effects become weakened and negligible it should be emphasized that the interaction effects in tandem is more noticeable than in the side by side arrangement in general as the vertical spacing y increases more than 5d the amplitudes of cylinder b and cylinder c are very close to that of a single cylinder since the side cylinders gradually move away from the wake produced by cylinder a 4 3 power analysis according to eq 7 the converted power p viv of the four cylinders is plotted in fig 16 meanwhile the converted power is compared with the converted power of a single cylinder p single the power ratio is defined by p viv p single in normalized format the converted power is nonlinear when the cylinders are in close proximity to each other to better illustrate the relationship between the power and the spacing the power distributions vs x and y are also drawn in fig 16 since the converted power p viv is presented as a function of the amplitude etc the converted power p viv curves have obvious similarity to the amplitude ratio curves shown in fig 15 for cylinder a as discussed in previous sections the upstream cylinder is affected by the blocking effects induced by downstream cylinders especially in the case of x 3d and y 5d there is a low energy region cylinder b c and d significantly affect the converted power of the upstream cylinder the minimum value of the converted power ratio is only 0 16 0 49w x 2d and y 4d there is a relatively high energy region in the case of x 2d and y 6d the maximum converted power ratio reaches up to 1 4 4 15w at x 1 7d and y 7d for cylinder b when cylinder b is so close to other cylinders x 4d and y 5d the amplitude is significantly encouraged as shown in fig 15 wake energy and interaction effects enhance the motion of the downstream cylinder correspondingly a high energy region appears the maximum converted power ratio reaches 3 9 11 95w at x 2d and y 4d but the converted power curve rapidly decreases with a small increase in the spacing x in the case of x 4d cylinder b lies in recovery region the converted power is not seriously affected by the spacing and tends to be stable for cylinder c and d because cylinder c and cylinder d are symmetric the characteristics of the converted power are similar to each other in general the converted power drops as the spacing x increases until x 3d and gradually recovers when the spacing x 3d specifically for x 2d and y 6d cylinder c and d lie in synchronization region where the amplitudes of the cylinders are slightly enhanced correspondingly there are high energy regions in the case of 2d x 4d and y 5d the viv responses of cylinder c and d are significantly suppressed accordingly low energy regions appear the minimum values of the converted power ratio are both about 0 45 1 4w at x 3d and y 3d the converted power curves show that through rational layout for the cylinders in an array more energy will be harvested obviously the staggered array will result in significant increase in the power to volume density 4 4 power to volume density the power to volume density is a factor showing the energy harvesting ability of a cylinder per unit volume of ocean currents the power to volume density p viv v is calculated by the mathematical model eq 8 for the four cylinders the power to volume density p viv v of each cylinder is plotted in fig 17 in general the power to volume density decreases as the spacing x increases this means that the cylinders will reach higher power to volume density at small spacing in most cases as the spacing y increases the power to volume densities of cylinder a c or d increases for cylinder b since the viv response is enhanced when the spacing y is smaller the power to volume density increases as the spacing y decreases the maximum power to volume density of cylinder b reaches up to 250w m3 x 2d and y 4d for the four close staggered cylinders the average power to volume density p viv v 4 is calculated by 16 p viv v 4 1 4 i 1 n 4 p viv i 1 x y the average power to volume density and the distributions are summarized and plotted in fig 18 the maximum average power to volume density reaches up to 133w m3 x 1 2d and y 7d overall it is easy to conclude that by properly configuring multiple cylinders interaction effects and wake energy have a positive impact on the energy harvesting the average power to volume density will keep increasing as the spacing x decreases if there is no physical limitation but what cannot be neglected other devices e g supporting structures need more space in the practical operation 5 conclusions vortex induced vibration and energy harvesting of four staggered cylinders are investigated using 2 dimensional rans equations in conjunction with k ω sst turbulence model the numerical simulation is based on fluent solver and udf in which newmark β method is embedded to solve the mass spring damper oscillator model experimental data are used to verify the numerical method the viv responses and the converted power are analyzed in detail the results indicate that interaction effects in the multi cylinder system and wake energy have a significant impact on the viv energy conversion based on the simulation results throughout this paper the major conclusions are summarized below 1 for the four cylinders in close staggered formation the spacing x and y significantly affects the viv responses of the cylinders the interaction effect in tandem is stronger than that in side by side arrangement tandem cylinders are easily affected by others 2 in general the multi cylinder interference is divided into three regions synchronization region x 2d there is a synchronization phenomenon that the four cylinders move together with the same phase and frequency blocking region encouraged region 2d x 4d for cylinder a c and d the viv amplitude of each cylinder is suppressed due to the blockage effects the minimum amplitude ratio of cylinder a even drops to nearly 0 36 on the contrary the viv response of cylinder b is encouraged by periodic vortices and wake energy the maximum amplitude of cylinder b reaches up to 1 78d recovery region x 4d since the interaction effects become negligible as the spacing x increases the cylinders are hardly affected by each other and the effect of the vertical spacing y is not very pronounced in this case therefore the amplitudes of the cylinders gradually recover and tend closer to that of a single cylinder in isolation 3 the converted power curves have a similar trend with the amplitude ratio curves at x 2d and y 4d the interaction effects significantly enhance the viv response of the downstream cylinder the maximum converted power ratio of cylinder b reaches up to 3 9 11 95w 4 by properly configuring the cylinders higher average power to volume density will be achieved for example the maximum average power density is p viv v 4 133w m3 at x 1 2d and y 7d overall as the spacing x decreases the average power to volume density will keep increasing if there is no physical limitation but other devices of the viv system should be considered since these devices need more space in the present study the numerical simulations lead the way for the experimental design of multiple cylinders in viv the simulation results also provide fundamentals to optimize the layout of the vivace converters in a close staggered array acknowledgement this research is supported by the national science foundation of china

23141,marine hydrokinetic energy in ocean currents can be harvested using vortex induced vibration viv the purpose of this paper is to investigate the viv energy harvesting and maximize the power to volume density by arranging four staggered cylinders reasonably consequently the effect of spacing between the cylinders is the focus considered throughout this paper the in flow spacing x varies from 1 2d to 10 0d where d is the diameter of the cylinder the transverse spacing y varies from 2 0d to 8 0d a series of numerical simulations are conducted using two dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations in conjunction with the k ω sst turbulence model results indicate that the interference between the tandem cylinders is stronger than between the side by side arranged cylinders the multi cylinder interference is divided into three regions synchronization region blocking encouraged region and recovery region interaction effects can induce much more vigorous viv response of the downstream cylinder in encouraged region where the maximum converted power ratio reaches up to 3 9 with in flow spacing x of 2 0d and transverse spacing y of 4 0d moreover the average power to volume density will keep increasing as the spacing x decreases if there are no other physical limitations these results lead the way for future layout optimization of multiple cylinders keywords vortex

environmental pollution problems have promoted the development of renewable energy technology ocean currents which contain a great deal of predictable and renewable energy have an enormous potential for electric power generation in particular a vortex induced vibration aquatic clean energy vivace converter invented by bernitsas et al at the university of michigan bernitsas et al 2006 2008 uses the viv phenomenon for the first time to harvest energy from ocean currents and convert it to electricity when exposed to a fluid flow the converter enhances rather than spoils vortex shedding on either side of the oscillator a circular cylinder resulting in maximizing rather than suppressing viv experimental investigations on the viv response of a single cylinder have been conducted in recent years for a low mass ratio viv system e g m 2 4 khalak and williamson 1996 1997 at cornell university investigated the viv responses of circular cylinders and found three kinds of branches of the viv amplitude curve initial branch upper branch and lower branch govardhan et al govardhan and williamson 2006 and raghavan et al raghavan and bernitsas 2011 analyzed the reynolds number effect on viv of rigid cylinders on elastic supports it was found that the range of synchronization in the upper branch increases with reynolds number park h et al park et al 2013 reported the galloping range follows the viv range thus expanding dramatically the fim range lee j h et al lee et al 2011 built a virtual damper spring system for viv experiments thus improving the efficiency of the viv experiments zhao et al 2013 investigated the viv responses of a square cylinder at a low reynolds number and found the flow approaching angle affects not only the vibration amplitude but also the lock in regime which is different from circular cylinders then the viv energy conversion of cylinders was improved continuously it was reported that a single cylinder d 8 9 cm l 91 4 cm converter successfully generated power from currents as slow as 0 4 m s and the maximum power reached up to 15 85 w at flow speed of 1 11 m s lee and bernitsas 2011 the converter is robust to environmental changes compared with other similar energy converters the vivace converter has much better adaptability a single vivce converter cannot provide high enough power for the actual utilization therefore multiple converters can be placed in close proximity to establish an array some researches have been conducted by placing multiple cylinders in tandem two cylinder systems have been studied the most because they are the simplest multi cylinder arrangement zdravkovich 1985 studied flow induced oscillations of two interfering circular cylinders assi et al 2006 further verified flow induced vibration interference between two circular cylinders employing a piv system alam et al 2005 investigated fluid forces acting on two staggered circular cylinders of equal diameter in cross flow they found at very small spacing lift forces depend largely on the gap flow between the cylinders obviously when multiple cylinders are in close staggered formation interaction effects will significantly affect the viv responses furthermore interaction effects have been used to further enhance viv or fim flow induced motion of tandem cylinders kim et al kim et al 2013 kim and bernitsas 2016 reported that the multiple converters 2 4 cylinders placed in tandem the spacing changes from 2 5d to 5d will produce higher power density the synergy scale converted energy ratio of downstream cylinders was greater than one in the reduced velocity range of 8 2 u 11 6 the maximum value of the synergy scale reaches up to about 2 0 kim and bernitsas 2016 it indicates that multiple cylinder interference may enable higher viv responses and converted power ding et al 2015a studied the effect of tandem spacing on flow induced motions of two cylinders with passive turbulence control in addition bernitsas 2016 has reported many different types of the viv responses of multiple cylinders but the interaction effects from side cylinders have not been considered at the same time huera huarte et al huera huarte and gharib 2011 investigated flow induced vibrations of a side by side arrangement of two flexible circular cylinders similarly zhou et al 2001 reported free vibrations of two side by side cylinders previous studies mainly focused on multiple cylinders in tandem or side by side arrangement few studies exist on interference among multiple cylinders in a close staggered array in two directions the viv responses of multiple cylinders in staggered configuration are quite different from those of the cylinders in tandem or side by side arrangement it is noteworthy that ming zhao et al 2015 have investigated flow induced vibration of a square array of cylinders however the research is mainly in the viv fiv responses but not in the energy conversion consequently the relevant research is urgent in the present study the viv responses and energy conversion of four cylinders in close staggered formation will be investigated in detail for multi cylinder arrangements the mutual interference between the cylinders is more complex upstream cylinders generate a high level of turbulence and a series of shed vortices acting on the downstream cylinders assi et al 2010 cfd computational fluid dynamics method has become a very useful tool in investigating vortex shedding and wake structure ding et al 2015b 2016 have analyzed the viv of different bluff bodies via numerical simulations using openfoam govardhan and williamson et al govardhan and williamson 2000 blackburn et al 2001 investigated viv and the shedding mode of vortices using 2 and 3 dimensional numerical simulations the effect of tip flow on viv of circular cylinders was also studied by kinaci et al 2016 using cfd method tang et al 2015 and joly et al 2012 have investigated the flow induced motion of a square cylinder using cfd software fluent these studies have indicated that cfd method could accurately predict integral properties of viv such as vortices forces motions the main goal of this paper is to maximize the power to volume density by arranging the cylinders reasonably consequently the effect of spacing between the cylinders is the focus considered throughout this paper four close cylinders are selected as a unit and investigated in detail unlike previous studies both the spacing x in the flow direction varying from 1 2d to 10d and the spacing y transversely to the flow direction varying from 2d to 8d are taken into account at the same time numerical simulations are conducted at different spacing the results show that the viv response and converted power of the cylinders will be significantly enhanced by using wake energy and interaction effects the maximum amplitude reaches up to 1 78d the maximum converted power ratio reaches up to 3 9 at x 2 0d and y 4 0d furthermore by properly placing four cylinders in an array e g x 1 2d and y 7d higher average power to volume density can be achieved more conclusions are summarized at the end 2 geometry configuration 2 1 physical model the concept of the vivace converter was initially introduced as a single smooth circular cylinder module bernitsas et al 2006 2008 the main elements of the converter consist of a cylinder springs transmission mechanisms and a generator fig 1 a shows a schematic of the vivace converter zhang et al 2017 the cylinder is elastically supported by two linear end springs and drives the generator a simplified physical model is also established as shown in fig 1 b k represents the stiffness of the springs c total represents the total system damping of the transmission mechanisms and the generator a is the oscillating amplitude of the cylinder vortex streets provide alternating lift acting on the cylinder when the vortex formation frequency close to the cylinder s natural frequency the phenomenon of lock in and high amplitude oscillation occur bernitsas et al 2008 khalak and williamson 1997 since the transverse amplitude of a viv bluff body is significantly higher than the streamwise amplitude only one degree of freedom is considered the cylinder is free to respond in the transverse y direction which is perpendicular to the flow velocity the viv responses of a single smooth circular cylinder and ptc cylinders with localized surface roughness have been investigated at different setup parameters by kim and park et al park et al 2013 kim et al 2013 kim and bernitsas 2016 ptc stands for passive turbulence control ptc is appended on smooth circular cylinders surface in the form of selective roughness to enhance flow induced vibration the present simulation data will be compared with the experimental data presented by park et al 2013 consequently in the following simulations the testing parameters refer these experiments according to the practical application the present viv system is characterized by high reynolds number value and low mass ratio m 1 68 the main parameters are presented in table 1 in this work the focused flow speed is about 1 0 m s based on the actual current speed the corresponding reynolds number is about 8 2 104 at flow speed of 1 0 m s four cylinders are placed in close proximity to each other as shown in fig 2 clearly close staggered cylinders will be significantly influenced by others interaction effects among the cylinders are more complex than multiple cylinders in tandem or side by side arrangement the four cylinder system including cylinder a b c and d is the most representative example for a staggered array cylinder c and d are slightly staggered and placed symmetrically on both sides of cylinder a and b for all tests the additional challenge in close staggered formation is that unlike for tandem or side by side arrangement for which the side cylinders have a significant impact on the upstream or downstream cylinders the viv responses of the four cylinders depend on the spacing between them the horizontal center to center spacing x between cylinder a and b in the flow direction and the vertical center to center spacing y between cylinder c and d transversely to the flow direction are variable and will be studied in detail in the following sections 2 2 equation of viv response in this section a mathematical model for the fim system is presented in this section a combined mass spring damper oscillator model is used to describe the dynamics of the rectangular cylinder the equation of motion in y direction with one degree of freedom is given as 1 m y disp c total y disp k y disp f fluid y t where y disp is the displacement of the cylinder transversely to the flow f fluid y t is the fluid force acting on the cylinder in the y direction m is the total mass of the oscillatory system in addition the added mass was also taken into consideration the total fluid force f fluid y t includes the heave motion induced inertia force and viscous force which result in the added mass and viscous effects according to the cfd method f fluid y t can be obtained directly using fluent solver from the numerical computations thus the added mass and viscous effects has been considered and included in the total fluid force f fluid y t it should be noted that c total is the total system damping which includes the damping of the transmission system and the generator etc in order to evaluate the energy conversion of the cylinder total energy converted from the flow to the cylinder in one cycle is defined as 2 e viv 1 2 k a 2 0 t o s c c total y disp d t where t o s c represents a cycle of oscillation e viv represents the total energy converted from currents energy to mechanical energy the detailed definition of e viv has been given by kim et al kim and bernitsas 2016 on the right hand side of eq 2 the first term is the total mechanical energy stored in the oscillation system the second term represents the work consumed energy done by the system damping force to simplify eq 2 and obtain the mathematical model of e viv the motion of the cylinder could be assumed as approximately sinusoidal bernitsas et al 2008 ding et al 2015b therefore the displacement y disp of the cylinder can be expressed as 3 y disp a sin 2 π f o s c t where f o s c is the oscillation frequency of the cylinder the velocity of the cylinder in the y direction can be deduced by derivation analysis as 4 y disp 2 π f o s c a cos 2 π f o s c t thus eq 2 can be rewritten as 5 e viv 1 2 k a 2 0 t o s c c t o t a l 2 π f o s c a cos 2 π f o s c t d t finally eq 5 can be further simplified the simplification approach and details are based on refs bernitsas et al 2008 kim and bernitsas 2016 therefore more details are not discussed here the final expression of e viv per cycle can be expressed as 6 e viv 1 2 k a 2 2 π 2 c t o t a l f o s c a 2 furthermore the viv power extracted from the flow over a cycle of oscillation t o s c is defined as 7 p viv 1 t o s c e v i v to evaluate the power to volume density p viv v of a vivce converter p viv v is estimated based on the viv power p viv of the cylinders in close staggered formation 8 p viv v p viv v p viv 1 s p viv 1 xy 3 numerical method 3 1 mathematical model in the present work the flow around the cylinders is numerically simulated using 2d reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations accompanied with the k ω sst shear stress transport turbulence model menter 1994 the requirement of the present study is the precision of the numerical study should be as close to experimental data at the beginning of the study other turbulence models have already been analyzed such as the spalart allmaras s a turbulence model and the k epsilon k ε turbulence model for the s a turbulence model the viv upper branch can t be found which is far from the experimental data for the k epsilon k ε turbulence model the prediction precision of the simulation results is low and more than anything the viv responses terminated prematurely in the viv lower branch in general the k ω sst turbulence model is most accurate based on verification tests compared with other tested turbulence models and the k ω model is well suited for simulating flow in the viscous sub layer and for predicting flow behavior in regions away from the cylinder these advantages make the k ω turbulence model suitable for the viv responses of multiple cylinders by using the k ω sst turbulence model all the branches of the viv responses can be found and are in agreement with the experimental data in addition according to a similar study lin 2013 it is also proved that the k ω sst model is better than k ε model on the whole for a low mass ratio viv system therefore the k ω turbulence model is acceptable and selected in this work simulations were performed based on a reliable cfd software fluent the dynamic mesh is applied in the present study user defined functions udf are written and embedded in fluent to solve the motion of cylinders in cfd simulations the dynamic mesh method is used to model flows where the position or shape of the domain is changing with time due to motion on the domain boundaries in this paper the dynamic mesh method is based on local remeshing method to adapt for large displacement specifically according to the fluid force and the velocity of a cylinder the udf was redacted in the fluent solver to specify the moving of the cylinders then based on the new positions the near wall grids of the cylinders were updated by the scheme of remeshing newmark β method is used in udf newmark β method is a method of numerical integration used to solve differential equations newmark 1959 newmark β method is widely used to solve the mass spring damper oscillator model and has been successfully used to describe the oscillatory system xiaolong 2015 deü and matignon 2010 the solution of the mass spring damper oscillator model eq 1 can be obtained by using newmark β method based on the basic assumptions of center difference method an explicit difference method for dynamic equation is used firstly using the extended mean value theorem newmark β method states that the first time derivative velocity in the equation of motion can be solved as 9 u t δ t u t u t δ t where u is the velocity of the fim cylinder in y direction then further derivation leads to 10 u t δ t u t 1 γ u t γ u t δ t δ t where γ 0 5 which means a center difference method because acceleration also varies with time the extended mean value theorem must also be extended to the second time derivative to obtain the correct displacement thus 11 u t δ t u t u δ t 1 2 β u t β u t δ t δ t 2 two weightings gama γ and beta β are just two constants in newmark β method in mathematics according to previous articles xiaolong 2015 deü and matignon 2010 newmark β method had shown that reasonable values of γ and β are 0 5 and 0 25 which is unconditionally stable and second order accurate for non dissipative linear systems according to eq 10 and eq 11 u t δ t and u t δ t can be expressed as 12 u t δ t 1 β δ t 2 u t δ t u t 1 β δ t u t 1

used in the udf implemented by using c computer language the flowchart of the numerical simulation is also given as fig 3 3 2 computational domain the entire computational domain and grids are illustrated in fig 4 the computational domain is 25d 20d which includes four kinds of boundaries inlet outlet side wall and cylinders the blockage effects are verified by comparing the viv responses under different distance between side boundaries the tested distances are 10d 15d 20d and 30d when the distance is short 10d and 15d the blockage effects exist and the viv amplitude is slightly compressed however when the distance increases to 20d and 30d there were only about 0 5 relative errors in the viv amplitude between two different distances the blockage effects can already be ignored therefore taking calculation efficiency and grid number into consideration the distance between the side walls is defined as 20d the inflow velocity is considered as uniform and constant 1 0 m s at the outflow boundary a zero gradient condition is specified for velocity the distance from the cylinder to the outlet boundary is sufficiently long thus the zero gradient boundary condition has negligible influence on the near wake region of the cylinder according to verification tests the side wall conditions are not disturbed by the presence of cylinder since the distance from the cylinder to the boundary is large enough thus the velocities at the side walls are set to be the same as the inflow free slip with the flow the grid density in the distortion domain is further enhanced for the near wall region of the cylinders the value of y is set close to 1 on the cylinders walls correspondingly the minimum grid size is 3 10 5 m based on the dynamic mesh when under the influence of fluid forces the cylinders will oscillate in distortion domain the four cylinders can oscillate freely transversely to the flow as shown in fig 4 since the interference between the cylinders in tandem is in general stronger than in the side by side arrangement the range of the spacing x is greater that of the spacing y x varies from 1 2d to 10d y varies from 2d to 8d 3 3 numerical method validation since the transient cfd method is applied in this paper time step independence validation was conducted first to assess the numerical uncertainty time step independence validation is conducted using different time steps ranging from 0 001s step to 0 005s step the viv amplitude curves in the first 4 s are compared in fig 5 a the viv amplitudes have great consistency at different time steps especially for 0 001 0 003s step the average relative error of the maximum amplitudes is about 0 67 taking the calculation efficiency into consideration 0 003s step is selected in these cfd simulations similarly the grid resolution analysis is tested by assessing the viv responses with different grid densities four different grid densities are considered for the grid sensitivity study with 35000 40000 47000 62000 elements as shown in fig 5 b the four grids produce similar results with error less than 1 03 to ensure the accuracy and efficiency the grid density with approximately 50000 elements is selected in the present work in general for each case the total simulation time is 45 0 s time step size 0 003s 20 iterations step number of time steps 15000 the total simulation time was determined based on the convergent limit of the residual when the number of time steps reaches about 3000 9s the monitored iteration residuals are less than 10 03 10 5 in order to assure the accuracy of the numerical results and reached a higher statistically stationary regime the iteration was continued until the total simulation time 45 0s 15000 time steps was reached the final 25 30 cycles are selected and averaged in the reported plots in this case the numerical solutions are considered convergent and the numerical uncertainty is acceptable numerical method is verified by other classical experimental results and cfd results in predicting amplitude and frequency park et al 2013 bernitsas 2016 according to the previous experiments main test parameters of the viv system for the numerical method validation are presented in table 2 the viv response was numerically simulated in the range of 2 u reduced velocity 14 2 as shown in figs 6 and 7 correspondingly the range of flow velocity is 0 04 m s u 0 29 m s the oscillation frequency is calculated by fft fast fourier transform of the displacement when u 4 at lower velocities the amplitude increases rapidly corresponding to the viv initial branch the viv upper branch covers a broader range of u 4 u 7 the amplitude ratio is approximately 0 8 1 0 in this range the upper branch represents the optimum regime for energy harnessing the oscillation frequency is locked above the natural frequency finally the viv phenomenon will disappear at the end of the low branch u 12 it is also found that for smooth cylinders galloping will not occur at higher velocities in general the numerical data follows closely to the experimental data the most important features of amplitude and frequency are in agreement with the each other despite some differences remain the difference between experiments and cfd values in the upper branch is mainly caused by two reasons the first reason is in the reference experiments the viv system parameters are given in non dimensional or normalized format such as the mass ratio m the damping ratio ξ and the reduced velocity u etc thus the actual parameters must be obtained by derivation based on the non dimensional parameters which may lead to these differences the second reason is the current study was conducted by using two dimensional assumption it simulates ideal three dimensional fluid without lateral flow the viv upper branch means that the vortex shedding frequency coincides with the natural frequency of the viv system for the ideal three dimensional fluid in the numerical simulations the range of the vortex shedding frequency is very narrow and sensitive accordingly the upper branch is relatively narrow at the coincidence point which is different with actual fluid in experimental test similar conclusions were also drawn in other literature bernitsas 2016 lin 2013 in addition to this difference in the upper branch all the branches of the viv responses can be found and are in agreement with the experimental data the initial branch the upper branch and the lower branch almost appear at the same time compared with the experimental data therefore the numerical method is acceptable and could be used in understanding the viv response furthermore vortex patterns velocity distributions and wake interactions can be accurately displayed using the numerical method finally a simulation example is given at the flow speed of 0 6 m s as shown in fig 8 there is a long wake in the flow direction shed vortices are close to each other two vortices shed from the cylinder per cycle of oscillation consequently the mode of vortex shedding is similar to the classical karman vortex street in the vicinity of the cylinder the vortex pattern is a typical 2s pattern ding et al 2015b zdravkovich 1977 in the position of high velocity vortices high turbulence intensity areas appear correspondingly 4 results and analysis 4 1 typical viv responses in the case of four cylinders in close staggered formation the downstream and side cylinders cylinder b c and d are subjected to a more complex flow generated from the upstream cylinder it should be emphasized that the present study focuses on the effect of the spacing therefore besides the spacing x and y other parameters are not considered in detail first for better explanation of the viv responses a zoning map versus x and y is introduced according to whether the cylinders click on each other as shown in fig 9 there are three zones including c d collision zone c d a b collision zone and no collision zone the collision zone means the cylinder will click on each other before two cylinders click on each other the mesh between two cylinders will be compressed and updated based on the dynamic mesh method when the two cylinders click on each other negative grids appear then the iterative computation will be suspended 4 1 1 c d a b collision zone and c d collision zone in order to better illustrate the viv response in the c d a b collision zone and c d collision zone wake structure is studied in the collision zone the cylinders will click on each other two representative simulation examples case1 x 1 7 y 4 and case2 x 4 y 2 5 are given for c d collision and c d a b collision at flow speed 1 0 m s re 8 2 104 velocity vector charts are shown in fig 10 the upstream cylinders generate a long wake acting on the downstream cylinders meanwhile there is a feedback from the downstream cylinders leading to a very complex interaction between the cylinders 4 1 2 no collision zone two simulation results are given as examples in the no collision zone case 3 x 2 y 3 and case 4 x 10 y 7 in the following sections the values of x and y are selected in the no collision zone to avoid the risk of clicking on each other for case 3 velocity vector charts and pressure distributions are shown in fig 11 when the cylinders are placed very close to each other it is clearly seen the wake from upstream and side cylinders a c and d affects the motion of the downstream cylinder b a lot of vortices act on the downstream cylinder it can also be observed the flow speed in the front of the cylinders is reduced at the high speed areas low pressure areas appear correspondingly the amplitude curves of cylinder a and b are compared in fig 12 a 1 the amplitude of cylinder b downstream cylinder is higher than that of cylinder a upstream cylinder or a single cylinder in isolation the amplitude curves of cylinder c and d are compared in fig 12 a 2 the average peak amplitude of cylinder b reaches up to 0 12m and is almost 1 35 times more than that of a single cylinder it indicates that the interaction effects enhance the viv response of the downstream cylinder other studies have also got similar conclusions kim et al 2013 kim and bernitsas 2016 the oscillating frequency for each cylinder is processed using fast fourier transform fft as shown in fig 12 b the oscillation frequency is not notably affected by the spacing it is also easy to observe that the motion of cylinder a is suppressed when the spacing x is small due to the presence of cylinder b it is conjectured that cylinder b is too close to cylinder a which blocks the flow and decreases the flow velocity for cylinder c and d the viv responses are similar the average amplitudes are slightly smaller than that of a single cylinder for case 4 x 10 0 y 7 0 velocity distributions and turbulence intensity distributions are shown in fig 13 since the spacing is large enough the viv responses of the four cylinders are almost independent to each other due to higher velocity the vortex pattern of the cylinders is different from that of a single cylinder placed in low speed flow for example at 0 6 m s as shown in fig 8 the vortices shed are significantly elongated as shown in fig 14 the viv amplitudes of the cylinders in a large sparse array are somewhat similar to that of a single cylinder the amplitude of cylinder b is slightly higher than that of the cylinder a or a single cylinder in isolation for cylinder c and d the amplitudes are in close proximity to each other meanwhile the amplitudes are quite approximate to that of a single cylinder more characteristics will be discussed in the following sections 4 2 amplitude response in the no collision zone the effect of spacing on viv amplitudes of the four cylinders is investigated in detail the interaction effects among multiple cylinders in close staggered formation are different from multiple cylinders in tandem or side by side arrangement the amplitude ratio curves of the four cylinders are summarized in fig 15 according to some literature zdravkovich 1977 2003 zhou and alam 2016 when analyzing stationary staggered cylinders in flow it was summarized the interference between the cylinders could be divided into different regions such as proximity interference wake interference proximity and wake interference and no interference similarly for better understanding of the viv responses of the four cylinders the amplitude ratio curves are divided into 3 different regions versus the spacing x a synchronization region occurs when x changes from 1 2d to 2d b blocking region encouraged region occurs when the spacing x changes from 2d to 4d c recovery region occurs when the spacing x changes from 4d to 10d more explanations about each region are as follows 4 2 1 synchronization region when the downstream and side cylinders cylinder b c and d are placed very close to the upstream cylinder cylinder a x 2d there is a synchronization phenomenon that the four cylinders will oscillate together the curves show the amplitudes of the four cylinders are slightly higher than that of a single cylinder in isolation 4 2 2 blocking region encouraged region when the spacing is the spacing 2d x 4d the viv response of upstream cylinders will be obviously affected by downstream cylinders for the upstream and side cylinders cylinder a cylinder c and cylinder d the viv amplitude is significantly lower corresponding to blocking region since the downstream cylinder cylinder b leads to blockage and decreases the flow velocity the minimum amplitude even reduces to 0 36d in general the amplitudes of cylinder a cylinder c and cylinder d increase with the vertical spacing y for the downstream cylinder cylinder b there is an important phenomenon that the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is greater than that of a single cylinder in the encouraged region similar phenomena were also found in previous studies kim et al 2013 kim and bernitsas 2016 when involving multiple cylinders in tandem array it is conjectured that low pressure vortices in the wake motivated by upstream cylinder cyclically acts on the downstream cylinder which further enhances the lift on the downstream cylinder in y direction consequently the amplitude of the downstream cylinder is encouraged for cylinder b at the spacing of x 2d and y 4d the amplitude ratio even reaches up to 1 78 4 2 3 recovery region for large spacing x 4d as the spacing x and y increase the amplitudes gradually recover and tend closer to the amplitude of a single cylinder in isolation it indicates the interaction effects and wake effects become weakened and negligible it should be emphasized that the interaction effects in tandem is more noticeable than in the side by side arrangement in general as the vertical spacing y increases more than 5d the amplitudes of cylinder b and cylinder c are very close to that of a single cylinder since the side cylinders gradually move away from the wake produced by cylinder a 4 3 power analysis according to eq 7 the converted power p viv of the four cylinders is plotted in fig 16 meanwhile the converted power is compared with the converted power of a single cylinder p single the power ratio is defined by p viv p single in normalized format the converted power is nonlinear when the cylinders are in close proximity to each other to better illustrate the relationship between the power and the spacing the power distributions vs x and y are also drawn in fig 16 since the converted power p viv is presented as a function of the amplitude etc the converted power p viv curves have obvious similarity to the amplitude ratio curves shown in fig 15 for cylinder a as discussed in previous sections the upstream cylinder is affected by the blocking effects induced by downstream cylinders especially in the case of x 3d and y 5d there is a low energy region cylinder b c and d significantly affect the converted power of the upstream cylinder the minimum value of the converted power ratio is only 0 16 0 49w x 2d and y 4d there is a relatively high energy region in the case of x 2d and y 6d the maximum converted power ratio reaches up to 1 4 4 15w at x 1 7d and y 7d for cylinder b when cylinder b is so close to other cylinders x 4d and y 5d the amplitude is significantly encouraged as shown in fig 15 wake energy and interaction effects enhance the motion of the downstream cylinder correspondingly a high energy region appears the maximum converted power ratio reaches 3 9 11 95w at x 2d and y 4d but the converted power curve rapidly decreases with a small increase in the spacing x in the case of x 4d cylinder b lies in recovery region the converted power is not seriously affected by the spacing and tends to be stable for cylinder c and d because cylinder c and cylinder d are symmetric the characteristics of the converted power are similar to each other in general the converted power drops as the spacing x increases until x 3d and gradually recovers when the spacing x 3d specifically for x 2d and y 6d cylinder c and d lie in synchronization region where the amplitudes of the cylinders are slightly enhanced correspondingly there are high energy regions in the case of 2d x 4d and y 5d the viv responses of cylinder c and d are significantly suppressed accordingly low energy regions appear the minimum values of the converted power ratio are both about 0 45 1 4w at x 3d and y 3d the converted power curves show that through rational layout for the cylinders in an array more energy will be harvested obviously the staggered array will result in significant increase in the power to volume density 4 4 power to volume density the power to volume density is a factor showing the energy harvesting ability of a cylinder per unit volume of ocean currents the power to volume density p viv v is calculated by the mathematical model eq 8 for the four cylinders the power to volume density p viv v of each cylinder is plotted in fig 17 in general the power to volume density decreases as the spacing x increases this means that the cylinders will reach higher power to volume density at small spacing in most cases as the spacing y increases the power to volume densities of cylinder a c or d increases for cylinder b since the viv response is enhanced when the spacing y is smaller the power to volume density increases as the spacing y decreases the maximum power to volume density of cylinder b reaches up to 250w m3 x 2d and y 4d for the four close staggered cylinders the average power to volume density p viv v 4 is calculated by 16 p viv v 4 1 4 i 1 n 4 p viv i 1 x y the average power to volume density and the distributions are summarized and plotted in fig 18 the maximum average power to volume density reaches up to 133w m3 x 1 2d and y 7d overall it is easy to conclude that by properly configuring multiple cylinders interaction effects and wake energy have a positive impact on the energy harvesting the average power to volume density will keep increasing as the spacing x decreases if there is no physical limitation but what cannot be neglected other devices e g supporting structures need more space in the practical operation 5 conclusions vortex induced vibration and energy harvesting of four staggered cylinders are investigated using 2 dimensional rans equations in conjunction with k ω sst turbulence model the numerical simulation is based on fluent solver and udf in which newmark β method is embedded to solve the mass spring damper oscillator model experimental data are used to verify the numerical method the viv responses and the converted power are analyzed in detail the results indicate that interaction effects in the multi cylinder system and wake energy have a significant impact on the viv energy conversion based on the simulation results throughout this paper the major conclusions are summarized below 1 for the four cylinders in close staggered formation the spacing x and y significantly affects the viv responses of the cylinders the interaction effect in tandem is stronger than that in side by side arrangement tandem cylinders are easily affected by others 2 in general the multi cylinder interference is divided into three regions synchronization region x 2d there is a synchronization phenomenon that the four cylinders move together with the same phase and frequency blocking region encouraged region 2d x 4d for cylinder a c and d the viv amplitude of each cylinder is suppressed due to the blockage effects the minimum amplitude ratio of cylinder a even drops to nearly 0 36 on the contrary the viv response of cylinder b is encouraged by periodic vortices and wake energy the maximum amplitude of cylinder b reaches up to 1 78d recovery region x 4d since the interaction effects become negligible as the spacing x increases the cylinders are hardly affected by each other and the effect of the vertical spacing y is not very pronounced in this case therefore the amplitudes of the cylinders gradually recover and tend closer to that of a single cylinder in isolation 3 the converted power curves have a similar trend with the amplitude ratio curves at x 2d and y 4d the interaction effects significantly enhance the viv response of the downstream cylinder the maximum converted power ratio of cylinder b reaches up to 3 9 11 95w 4 by properly configuring the cylinders higher average power to volume density will be achieved for example the maximum average power density is p viv v 4 133w m3 at x 1 2d and y 7d overall as the spacing x decreases the average power to volume density will keep increasing if there is no physical limitation but other devices of the viv system should be considered since these devices need more space in the present study the numerical simulations lead the way for the experimental design of multiple cylinders in viv the simulation results also provide fundamentals to optimize the layout of the vivace converters in a close staggered array acknowledgement this research is supported by the national science foundation of china

more explainable and easy for a class of nlees to attain different type of new traveling wave solutions with additional parameters the objective of this article is construct exact solutions for nonlinear evolution equations in mathematical physics through the boussinesq equation and the 2 1 dimensional extended shallow water wave equation by means of the new generalized g g expansion method 2 explanation of the new generalized g g expansion method in this section we present the new approach of the generalized g g expansion method feng et al 2011 naher et al 2011 abazari and abazari 2011 naher 2015 alam et al 2014 alam and akbar 2015 for investigating traveling wave solution to nonlinear evolution equation consider the general nonlinear evolution equation in the following form 1 f u u t u x u t t u t x u x x 0 where u u x t is an unidentified function f is a polynomial in u x t which has highest order derivatives and nonlinear terms and the order of this method is as follows step 1 we consider the combination of spatial variable x and temporal variable t be the variable η as follows 2 u x t u η η x v t where v is the speed of the traveling wave through equation 2 equation 1 will be changed into an ordinary differential equation ode as follows 3 r u u u u 0 where r is a polynomial of u and its derivatives and the superscripts indicate the ordinary derivatives with respect to η step 2 conforming to possibility equation 3 can be integrated term by term and integral constant maybe zero for simplicity step 3 we consider the traveling wave solution of equation 3 as follows 4 u η k 0 m a k d h k k 1 m b k d h k where either a m or b m may be zero but both a m and b m could not be zero at a time a k k 0 1 2 3 m b k k 1 2 3 m and d are arbitrary constant to be determined such that 5 h g g where g g η satisfies the following auxiliary nonlinear ode 6 a g g b g g e g 2 c g 2 0 prime indicates the derivative with respect to η and a b c e are parameters step 4 the positive integer m is determined by taking the homogeneous balance between the highest order nonlinear term and the highest order derivative appearing in equation 3 step 5 inserting equations 4 and 6 along with equation 5 into equation 3 with the value of m obtained in step 4 we obtain polynomial in d h m m 0 1 2 and d h m m 1 2 3 then we collect each coefficient of the resulted polynomial is equal to zero and obtain a class of algebraic equations for a k k 0 1 2 m b k k 1 2 3 m d and v step 6 the general solution of equation 5 is well familiar to us replacing the value of a k k 0 1 2 m b k k 1 2 m d and v into equation 4 then we find more general type and new exact traveling wave solution of the nonlinear evolution equation 1 step 7 with the help of general solution of equation 6 we attain the following solution of equation 5 family 1 when b 0 φ a c and q b 2 4 e a c 0 7 h η b 2 φ q 2 φ l sinh q 2 a η m cosh q 2 a η l cosh q 2 a η m sinh q 2 a η family 2 when b 0 φ a c and q b 2 4 e a c 0 8

solutions in this section we have established some further general and new closed form wave solutions to the boussinesq equation and the 2 1 dimensional extended shallow water wave equation by using the new generalized g g expansion method 3 1 the boussinesq equation the boussinesq equation can be represented as 12 u t t u x x u 2 x x β u x x x x 0 in 1872 the boussinesq equation was established by joseph boussinesq to describe the propagation of small amplitude long waves on the surface of shallow water the boussinesq estimation for water wave considers the vertical structure of the horizontal and vertical flow velocity this results in partial differential equations called boussinesq type equations which incorporate frequency dispersion in coastal engineering boussinesq type equations are frequently used in computer models for the simulation of water waves in shallow seas and harbors equation 12 reduced to the following ode by using the transformation u x t u η where η x v t 13 v 2 1 u u 2 β u 0 integrating equation 13 with respect to η twice we obtain 14 v 2 1 u u 2 β u c 0 where c is an integrating constant which to be determined to obtain the value of m applying the homogeneous balance between u 2 and u in equation 14 we obtain m 2 consequently we obtain the solution of equation 14 in the following form 15 u η a 0 a 1 d h a 2 d h 2 b 1 d h 1 b 2 d h 2 where a 0 a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 and d are constants substituting equation ns 5 and 15 into equation 14 we observed that the left hand side of equation 14 is converted into the polynomial of g g m m 0 1 2 3 and g g m m 1 2 3 we collect each coefficient of these resulted polynomials is equal to zero and attain a group of algebraic equations and solve the algebraic equations by the algebraic computation software

from navier stokes equations and are represented by a family of hyperbolic partial differential equations which explain the flow below a pressure surface in a fluid the shallow water equations in unidirectional form are also called saint venant equations after adhemar jean claude barre de saint venant the applications of the shallow water equations are huge in the area of ocean modeling and coriolis forces in atmosphere in the recent times shallow water wave equation is also introduced to examine the characteristic of moist convection in atmospheric dynamics let us consider the 2 1 dimensional extended shallow water wave equation is of the following form 19 u y t u x x x y 3 u x x u y 3 u x u x y α u x y 0 it is noted that the vertical velocity term does not appear in shallow water equations though this velocity does not need to be zero this is an important difference because as for instance the vertical velocity cannot be zero when the floor depth changes and thus if it is zero only for flat floors thus once a solution has been found the vertical velocity can be recovered via the equation of continuity we reduce equation 19 into the following ordinary differential equation by choosing the transformation u x t u η where η x y v t then we obtain 20 α v u u i v 6 u u 0 integrating equation 20 with respect to η we attain 21 α v u u 3 u 2 c 1 0 where c 1 is an integrating constant which to be determined now taking the homogeneous balance between the highest order nonlinear term u 2 and linear term of highest derivative u in equation 21 we obtain m 1

from navier stokes equations and are represented by a family of hyperbolic partial differential equations which explain the flow below a pressure surface in a fluid the shallow water equations in unidirectional form are also called saint venant equations after adhemar jean claude barre de saint venant the applications of the shallow water equations are huge in the area of ocean modeling and coriolis forces in atmosphere in the recent times shallow water wave equation is also introduced to examine the characteristic of moist convection in atmospheric dynamics let us consider the 2 1 dimensional extended shallow water wave equation is of the following form 19 u y t u x x x y 3 u x x u y 3 u x u x y α u x y 0 it is noted that the vertical velocity term does not appear in shallow water equations though this velocity does not need to be zero this is an important difference because as for instance the vertical velocity cannot be zero when the floor depth changes and thus if it is zero only for flat floors thus once a solution has been found the vertical velocity can be recovered via the equation of continuity we reduce equation 19 into the following ordinary differential equation by choosing the transformation u x t u η where η x y v t then we obtain 20 α v u u i v 6 u u 0 integrating equation 20 with respect to η we attain 21 α v u u 3 u 2 c 1 0 where c 1 is an integrating constant which to be determined now taking the homogeneous balance between the highest order nonlinear term u 2 and linear term of highest derivative u in equation 21 we obtain m 1

23143,many efforts have been made to investigate ice loads and pressure distributions occurring during ice structure interaction in laboratory scale tests based on results obtained utilizing a high resolution pressure indicating film pif during an ice crushing test actual contact areas and spatial pressure distributions at each test step were re examined according to the pixel resolutions furthermore the resultant pressure distribution plot was utilized to estimate the maximum load to further evaluate the expanded utilization of the pif by comparing the maximum load results measured by a load cell the measurement of contact area during an ice structure interaction using the pif was found to be reasonably accurate in the case of ice loads the load values predicted by the pif slightly overestimated the values to the load cell measurement keywords ice crushing test pressure indicating film maximum ice load activated contact area 1 introduction there have been a number of field measurement and medium scale laboratory ice impact tests since the 1980s as well as numerous laboratory scale ice tests conducted by many researchers akagawa et al 2001 daley 1994 frederking et al 1990 1999 2000 2004 2005 2008a 2008b jordaan et al 2005 lee et al 2014 2016 ritch et al 2008 sayed and frederking 1992 sodhi et al 1998 these study all furthered understanding of the characteristics of ice loads acting on ships or offshore structures which is essential to support activities in the arctic region a practical ice load result can be obtained from realistic ice conditions in a full scale measurement program and thus field measurement data is highly valuable however a significant time and expense are required to support any full scale measurement program besides most field measurement data are acquired from different and uncontrolled environmental loading condition i e ice condition ambient temperature vessel speed etc therefore a direct comparison between tests is often not straightforward a series of laboratory scale ice test conducted by many researchers barrette et al 2003 bruneau et al 2012 2013 dempsey et al 2001 timco and frederking 1993 tuhkuri 1995 and all enhance the understanding of ice behavior in the case of laboratory ice crushing tests a specific geometry of an ice specimen is prepared and crushed against the surface as an output a time history of the ice load is measured by a load cell and a nominal contact area which is calculated from the controlled crushing displacement and the original geometry of the sample are used to develop pressure area plots there were also efforts to measure spatial pressure distribution directly using a pressure panel frederking 2004 gagnon 2008a b however it is clear that measured spatial pressure distribution highly dependent on the resolution of the sensing equipment because the real contact area and pressure distribution during an ice structure interaction change rapidly furthermore there are still limitations of resolution data acquisition rate and difficulties of calibration inhibit the applicability of currently applied measurement methods kim et al 2012 2013 2014 and ulan kvitberg 2012 first adopted a chemical based pressure indicating film pif in ice crushing test to examine the variation of an actual contact area as well as the spatial pressure distribution during an ice structure interaction the film itself has high resolution and respond instantly to applied loads against the film the most significant advantage of the pif in laboratory scale ice crushing tests is the simplicity of application the pif can be placed easily in any location where measuring a contact area and spatial pressure distribution is required furthermore there is no required data acquisition system during measurement and analysis a procedure for analysis of a tested pif is well established by kim et al 2012 2013 2014 previous studies have shown examples of results obtained by pif application such as 1 pixel resolution sensitivity analysis 2 plotting process and spatial pressure area curves and 3 concepts of contour averaging method cam and square averaging method sam in this study the test data were further adapted to estimate the maximum ice load through the pif to verify the utilization of the pif as an extended application of measuring the load during a laboratory scale test the resultant load values obtained using the pif are compared with the load cell measurement results also the sensitivity of measured loads and actual contact area were re assessed and discussed according to the respective test conditions 2 pressure indicating film 2 1 specification there is two type of pif which are mono and two sheet type only the two sheet type film is applied in this study and the structure of the pif is illustrated in fig 1 the reaction mechanism is the same for both types of film basically microcapsules containing colored fluid are broken if the pressure applied on the face of the film exceeds a certain level and the color forming material reacts with the color developing material so color turns red the microcapsules are designed to break according to the pressure magnitude so the color density represents a specific pressure value bachus et al 2006 liggins et al 1992 there is seven type of pif with each type of film categorized by the detectable pressure range kim et al 2012 2013 2014 and ulan kvitberg 2012 performed a series of pre tests to determine the most reasonable pressure range during a laboratory scale ice crushing test as a result three types of pif were chosen which are low medium and high type and detectable pressure range for each pif are 2 5 10 mpa low type 10 50 mpa medium type and 50 130 mpa high type three overlapping types of film were applied to measure pressure values from a minimum of 2 5 mpa to a maximum of 130 mpa the background for the selection of the three types of film was that the pressure values were measured above 50 mpa or even higher through the pre testing any pressure value smaller than 2 5 mpa is below the lowest detectable ranges in this application the pressure values smaller than 2 5 mpa did not record during the test and this could be a potential source of error in the analysis process all three types of pif were stacked together during a crushing test to obtain the pressure values for each film type the test will be carried out with the pif of the three types selected in this study and the maximum value of pressure measured by each film at the same location pixel after the crushing test will be applied as a representative pressure value of the particular pixel as a result a spatial pressure distribution was plotted using captured data each pif is not reusable since the pattern is left permanently 2 2 image processing method the pressure films were analyzed after the test followed by three steps 1 tested pressure film scanning 2 pixel value determination and 3 conversion of the pixel value to a pressure value a brief explanation of each step is described as below more details about the procedure and illustrations can be found in the references kim et al 2012 2013 2014 ulan kvitberg 2012 2 3 step 1 tested pressure film scanning a tested pressure film was digitally scanned at 1200 dpi and saved as an image file 2 4 step 2 pixel value determination the scanned image was cleaned of any stains scratches or other obviously extraneous information prior to determining the pixel value of the tested pressure film the cleaned image was converted into a 16 bit image from which x y coordinates and the corresponding pixel in the rgb format were extracted and saved into a text file only includes non zero pixels 2 5 step 3 pressure value conversion the obtained pixel values were then converted into an actual pressure value mpa using regression equations derived from calibration of the pressure films kim et al 2012 2013 2014 at each pixel location there was the maximum of three pressure values due to the pressure film layering the text files were sorted to retain only the highest pressure value at each x y coordinate hence the pressure distribution plot was created for each step 3 test condition 100 mm diameter cone shaped ice specimen was prepared to conduct an ice crushing test for the preparation de aired de ionized water to reduce the number of cracks and air bubbles inside the specimen was prepared and seeded with a specific grain size ice then mixed into an insulated container to control the direction of ice growth from bottom to top in one direction then it was allowed to grow for 48 h once the specimen was completely frozen it was taken out from the container and mounted on ice shaving equipment to shape into the desired cone angles dillenburg 2012 the crushing tests were performed using an mts mechanical testing machine fig 2 and the ice specimens were placed into position on the bottom ram of the mts machine as shown in fig 2 two different cone angles 30 50 were chosen for the test in the case of 30 cone angle ice specimen the test consisted of three crushing steps 9 18 27 mm in the case of 50 cone angle ice specimen the test consisted of four crushing steps 15 30 45 55 mm cone shaped ice specimen and corresponding crushing steps at each angle are illustrated in fig 3 as discussed three types of pif were stacked together and attached to the rigid steel plate to measure the complete ranges of pressure during an ice structure interaction at each designed step the stack of pif was replaced with the new pif and record a spatial pressure distribution at each crushing steps more details about the stepped crushing procedure adopted in this study were discussed by ulan kvitberg 2012 fig 4 illustrates each crushing step and corresponding pif pattern analysis table 1 represents the test condition applied in this study total of eight tests was performed the cone angle of ice specimen crushing speed cold room temperature and grain size were selected as controlled parameters for the test however there was no particular trend observed by cold room temperature and grain size as discussed by ulan kvitberg 2012 therefore only the cone angle and crushing speed were considered as an active parameter in this study 4 ice load evaluation using pressure indicating film in previous studies only a simple evaluation of the contact area and pressure distribution obtained by utilizing the pif was discussed the applicability of the pif whether it is able to capture a spatial pressure distribution was the focus of the assessment during the ice crushing test the ice load as a text file format which includes time displacement and load output was also measured through a load cell attached to the universal testing machine utm in a real time in this study a comparison of the ice load results derived from the load cell measurement and the pif is undertaken as part of a further evaluation of pif application not limited to the contact area and pressure distribution the additional assessment was conducted to examine whether it is possible to identify the maximum ice loads using the pif the pif obtained after the test is eventually converted into a series of pressure values at each pixel location through the image processing process the value of the ice loads that occur at each pixel location can be obtained by multiplying the converted pressure value and the pixel area pixel size is pre determined by the user and then summing the converted load values for all pixels to represent a total ice load in a particular test step fig 5 the reasons for not evaluating the ice loads using the pif in earlier studies can be explained as follows first the characteristic of the pif itself described as one time use which only records a specific moment is a limitation in evaluating the time series ice load variation of the load cell measurement second all contact areas and pressure distribution patterns that occur within in a specific ice crushing step will remain on the single pif a characteristic referred to as a memory until the film is replaced after the test this means that the information of contact area and pressure distribution pattern on the pif after a specific test step may not accurately reflect the true contact area and pressure distribution at a given time due to the characteristic of pif which contains all the memories of the event before replacing the film consequently the results of ice crushing test i e contact area pressure distribution and loads for each test analyzed through pif tends to overestimate load results at given time step kim et al 2012 2013 2014 explained the characteristics of pif using the active vs activated area concept as illustrated in fig 6 each crushing step consists of multiple sub steps true contact area representing the real shape of the contact can be defined for a specific moment but not necessarily that captured by the pif a specific pressure pattern should also be associated with the instantaneous true contact area this combination of instantaneous contact area and associated pressure pattern can be defined as the active contact area however the shape of the contact area recorded on the pif will be activated contact area which records all the previous active steps until the film is replaced therefore the recorded contact area corresponding pressure distribution and magnitude of measured ice loads using the pif are generally overestimated when compared to time series measurements for this reason the comparison of the magnitude of ice loads between the load cell and pif measurement should be evaluated in consideration of 1 the maximum load that can be derived from a specific crushing step instead of a direct comparison with real time load variation and 2 the magnitude of the converted ice loads at each step using the pif will be greater than the maximum load measured through the load cell as illustrated in fig 7 mainly these differences between the load cell measurement and pif load conversion are due to traces of previous interaction process captured by the pif another pif limitation which tends to reduce the measured load estimate is the measurable minimum pressure range which is 2 5 mpa for the low pressure type film adopted in this study since any applied pressure which is lower than the minimum detectable pressure range cannot be recorded on the pif these pressures cannot contribute to the estimated the total load thus we have two sources of misestimation the characteristic that all events are permanently recorded is a source of overestimation in the converted load and the characteristic that the film is unable to capture any pressure value smaller than 2 5 mpa is a source of underestimation of the converted load although these properties may in some sense balance each other this is neither consistent nor predictable under the random pressure are conditions of an ice interaction 5 comparison of ice load measurement results of the ice load prediction from the eight tests conducted in this study were summarized in table 2 the magnitude of the converted ice loads and the sensitivity by with the size of each pixel using the pif were analyzed for each test condition furthermore the results of the maximum ice load measured through the load cell were compiled together in each step of the test and the ratio between the two measurements pif vs load cell was assessed for validation of the capability of the maximum load assessment using the pif in a laboratory scale ice crushing test the value of ice loads converted from the pif measurement was chosen when the pixel size was 0 25 mm as a representative value of the converted ice loads the results summarized in table 2 show the following there is a significant difference observed between the two measurement methods especially at the first step in most tests this is because the first step in the ice crushing test is the period where the ice load is gradually increasing build up therefore the magnitude of the ice load is not significant in the load cell measurement however all events during the step are recorded on the pif thus the film presents a stacked value of the converted ice load and the difference is substantial during subsequent steps the tendency of an overall decrement in variation can be observed this is attributed to a lower range of pressures within a step for the later steps test 5 and test 7 show the smallest difference of the maximum load between the two measurement methods conversely the most noticeable differences in maximum load were observed in test 4 and test 8 the main factor influencing the difference between the two measurement results is the size of the measured contact area in the high type the larger contact area recorded in the high type pif leads to greater ice loads accumulated on the pressure film and resulting in substantially overestimated maximum ice loads compared to the load measured through the load cell this can be confirmed by comparing the size of the contact pattern remaining in the high type pif table 3 shows a series of the scanned high type pif in test 4 5 7 and 8 the maximum load value estimated from the pif is relatively similar to that of the load cell measurement in test 5 and 7 contact area not evident in the high type pif from the test as shown in table 3 only a few activated pixels can be seen during the first step high pressure contact rarely appears at the later steps in contrast in test 4 and 8 there is a definite contact pattern on the high type pif consistently throughout the crushing test plots of pressure distribution result from each test are illustrated in table 4 to identify further the high pressure zone detected by high type pif the map colors from orange to red represents the pressure measured by the high type pif where the magnitude of pressure is higher than 50 mpa if the maximum load analyzed through the pif is larger than the load cell measurement results it is noticeable that the appearance of the high pressure patterns is widely presented in test 5 and 7 significantly during the entire crushing process fig 8 12 show the comparison of the maximum load measurement obtained through the load cell and the pif analysis fig 8 show the results of all tests includes all steps the solid line indicates the case where the ratio between the measurement results between the load cell and the pif is equal to 1 1 as demonstrated by the pressure distribution plots the maximum load measured at the load cell can be seen as lower overall compared to the results converted from the pif analysis this is due to the result of all contact events occurring within a specific step being recorded on the pif there are some cases where the measured load was slightly larger or roughly identical in the load cell measurement and the pif analysis in addition to the previously discussed reasons for discrepancies between pif based load estimates and direct load readings there is a possibility of inadvertent data loss during the analysis of tested pif image processing while removing unnecessary parts of the scanned pif before converting a pixel value to an actual pressure value figs 9 and 10 summarize the results according to the number of steps the regression curve shows a slightly closer fit to the 1 1 line in the four steps test case and this is consistent with the trend of results are getting closer to the 1 1 line as the number of steps is increased figs 11 and 12 summarize the results of the test in accordance with the crushing speed in contrast to the effect of the number of steps crushing speed significantly affects the trend of load measurement in the case of 1 0 mm s crushing speed the test results and the trend of the regression curve is close to the 1 1 line except for a few data points indicated by the red dotted circle in contrast the maximum load converted through the pif can be found to be substantially larger than the results of the load cell measurement in most cases when the crushing speed is 100 mm s this result reflects the effect of crushing speed or strain rate in a typical ice crushing test if the crushing speed is low the appearance of saw tooth pattern in measured load which is induced by spalling events is rarely observed in slow tests the tendency of the ice load is to exhibits a steady increment in time or displacement as illustrated in fig 13 in contrast spalling will frequently occur during a fast ice structure interaction thus inducing sharp variations of load displacement history evident in the saw tooth load pattern as illustrated in fig 14 therefore it can be expected that there will be a relatively large number of events recorded on the pif although it does not appear in the measurement through the load cell at the same time this will lead to a greater estimation of the maximum load using the pif especially at the high crushing speed case as shown in fig 12 it can be concluded that using the pif in the ice crushing test to evaluate the maximum load is impractical based on the results of this analysis this is mainly due to the memory characteristics of the pif but also due to the low pressure threshold for activating the pif however if the pif is utilized in a limited condition i e a large number of test steps at a low crushing speed it is possible to evaluate the approximation of the maximum load during an ice structure interaction as well as contact area observation 6 comparison of contact area measurement a previous series of studies have been conducted in the contact area during an ice crushing test utilizing the pif kim et al 2012 2013 2014 conducted the study on the sensitivity of the measured pressure values according to the pixel size of the analyzed pif ulan kvitberg 2012 analyzed the difference of the contact area measured on the pif and the nominal contact area however an intensive analysis of the cause of the discrepancy was not discussed and the results were presented only as figures in this study the sensitivity of the contact area to the magnitude of the pixel size was revisited and then the nominal contact area simultaneously evaluated using the tested pif and pressure distribution plots the nominal contact area was calculated according to the designed displacement in each step the results of pixel size sensitivity and the nominal contact area of each test were summarized in table 5 the smallest pixel size 0 25 mm results are applied as a representative value for the evaluation of the results the contact area calculated from the pif is not a true or active area but the activated area as discussed previously this means that the area of contact from all events that occurred before the film being replaced was recorded in the same way as the maximum load measurement therefore it may be expected that the size of the activated area on the pif is larger compared to the active area true area at any point in time during an ice crushing test however the changes in contact area during an ice structure interaction which can be observed using the pif provide useful information on the characteristics of ice load and contact area as shown in table 5 the size of the contact area measured by the pif is always less than the nominal contact area at each step this is because the nature of the contact area is inconsistent and the shape of the contact area is highly randomized as reported in many medium and laboratory scale tests therefore the fact that the nominal contact area is always larger is not surprising but it is a natural result of the ice crushing process daley 1998 sanderson 1988 zou et al 1996 fig 15 19 show how the magnitude of the contact area varies according to each of the test conditions fig 15 shows the results that include all test cases most of the contact areas were measured at approximately 60 of the nominal value by the pif the slope of the regression curve also reflects this result figs 16 and 17 show the effect of the number of test steps in the measured contact area in the three steps test case the contact area measured by the pif is approximately 55 of the nominal contact area in the four steps test case the contact area measured by the pif is about 65 of the nominal contact area however there are a number of data points that significantly deviate from the regression curve as shown in fig 17 in conclusion the smaller number of steps show a lower measured contact area figs 18 and 19 show the result of the measured contact area in accordance with the crushing speed if the crushing speed was 1 0 mm s low speed test the measured contact area from the pif indicates approximately 68 of the area relative to the nominal contact area except for a few data points which show the differences in step 4 all other results follows the trend the loss of contact area during an ice structure interaction due to spalling events is relatively less frequent if the crushing speed is low at low strain rate this means that the rate of the contact area variation is almost constant during the low speed crushing test conversely the measured contact area by the pif captured approximately 52 of the nominal contact area when the crushing speed was 100 mm s however most of the data followed the trend of the regression curve only with a small variation in most cases where the crushing speed strain rate is high the saw tooth load pattern due to the occurrence of spalling events daley 1992 sanderson 1988 tuhkuri 1995 is observed thus the effects on contact area measurement arising from crushing speed are fully predictable and were able to be visually explicit by utilizing the pif figs 20 and 21 shows test the variation in contact area through the load displacement history and corresponding pif measurements and pressure distribution plots fig 20 shows the load displacement history of test 1 in the first and second step contact areas close to the nominal contact area 67 8 and 75 7 are measured which is due to the absence of significant spalling events during a gradual increment of the ice load this can be visually verified in that there is virtually no void space between the actual pressure pattern indicated by the red colored area and the nominal contact area indicated by the black dotted line however a significant reduction of the apparent load in the third step was observed due to spalling events and the contact area also significantly decreased sharply compared to the previous steps in the case of the load displacement history shown in fig 19 the tendency of increasing ice loads was observed without experiencing a notable spalling event throughout the test and the contact area is also steadily increasing until it reaches step 4 as a result differences between the measured contact area using the pif and the nominal contact area are reduced as the step progresses fig 22 shows the load displacement history where the measured contact area is significantly different from the nominal contact area the load displacement history for test 5 could not satisfy the conditions which are 1 the ice load gradually increases as the displacement increase during the crushing process and 2 no instantaneous reduction of load and contact area due to the spalling events which is necessary to achieve a steady increment of the contact area and a ratio close to the nominal contact area even though the ice load tends to increase after the first step the magnitude of the ice load tends to maintain the same value within each step rather than continuously increasing because of a frequent occurrence of spalling events throughout all steps for that reason the measured contact area was always less than 50 compared to the nominal contact area and differences were widened as the subsequent step progressed 7 conclusions in this study laboratory scale ice crushing tests were analyzed by measuring the contact area pressure distribution and the maximum load using high resolution pressure indication film the sensitivity analysis was done with the pixel size in a previous study and this study expanded the analysis to trends in the scope of measured contact area and the maximum load variation for each test condition additional verification was conducted by comparing the maximum load derived using the pif and obtained from load cell measurements to verify whether the pif could be utilized to estimate not only the contact area pressure distribution but also the maximum load in the case of the maximum load measurement the overall difference between the pif measurement and the load cell measurement was significant this is due to the characteristic that the pif record all the events until the film replaced therefore the maximum load derived from the pif will inevitably be larger than the maximum load measured by the load cell the most significant factor determining the difference in the maximum load measured through the pif was the existence of high pressure zones in the ice contact which influenced the amount of the contact area captured by the high type pif where the magnitude of measured pressure is greater than 50 mpa in the case where high pressure frequently occurred during the ice crushing process more loads remain on the pif indicating that the measured load value is greater than the load cell measurement this has been visually verified by comparison with 1 tested pifs and 2 pressure distribution plots at specific test results the load cell measurements were observed larger than the pif results in some test cases and this can be explained by the lowest pressure value which can be measured through the low type pif was 2 5 mpa during the tests therefore the pif could not measure pressures below 2 5 mpa even though the pressure load is applied during the crushing process and recorded in the load cell measurement as the number of test steps increased the maximum load measurement converted by the pif was closer to the results of the load cell measurement but it was not significantly improved crushing speed showed a noticeable effect on measured load variation for lower crushing speed an overall pressure distribution pattern was stabilized and the magnitude of pressure does not tend to exceed 50 mpa as no significant pressure pattern observed in the high type pif a gradual increment of the maximum load is observed as the displacement increased therefore it was found that the results of the maximum load measurement between the load cell and the pif were similar at the low crushing speed strain rate accurate estimation of the maximum load using the pif is expected to be limited except in the test condition when the crushing speed is relatively low to achieve more accurate and reliable results using the pif in maximum load estimation a wider range of pif types to accurately reflect the range of pressure occurring during the test should be considered in the case of the contact area it was found that an average of 60 was measured through the pif relative to the nominal contact area it was visually confirmed that the actual contact area of the test would normally exhibit a highly randomized shape of contact area compared to the nominal contact area which is an idealized area due to a frequent spalling event similar to the maximum load prediction the variation at the final step between the actual contact area measured by the pif and the nominal contact area was relatively large in the case of crushing speed there were less spalling events at the low crushing speed which resulted in the measured contact area being greater by about 15 relative to the high crushing speed case in conclusion the fundamental parameter determining the difference of the contact area between the nominal contact area and the actual contact area measured by the pif is the loss of ice by spalling events during the higher speed ice crushing process the application of the pif to assess the more accurate maximum loads and contact areas may be improved under the following conditions additional test steps need to be added to reduce the amount of accumulated memory in the pif between test steps this will reduce discrepancies in both load and contact area predicted by the pif second the low pressure range of the pif films should be extended to cover ranges below 2 5 mpa this will reduce the amount of lost pressure left unrecorded by the pif this study was conducted to verify the limitation of using the pif in laboratory scale ice crushing tests however it is advantageous to obtain information about the contact area and the maximum load in the crushing process without a special instrumentation equipment therefore it is expected to be able to obtain more precise analysis results using the pif if the discussed problems are supplemented

23143,many efforts have been made to investigate ice loads and pressure distributions occurring during ice structure interaction in laboratory scale tests based on results obtained utilizing a high resolution pressure indicating film pif during an ice crushing test actual contact areas and spatial pressure distributions at each test step were re examined according to the pixel resolutions furthermore the resultant pressure distribution plot was utilized to estimate the maximum load to further evaluate the expanded utilization of the pif by comparing the maximum load results measured by a load cell the measurement of contact area during an ice structure interaction using the pif was found to be reasonably accurate in the case of ice loads the load values predicted by the pif slightly overestimated the values to the load cell measurement keywords ice crushing test pressure indicating film maximum ice load activated contact area 1 introduction there have been a number of field measurement and medium scale laboratory ice impact tests since the 1980s as well as numerous laboratory scale ice tests conducted by many researchers akagawa et al 2001 daley 1994 frederking et al 1990 1999 2000 2004 2005 2008a 2008b jordaan et al 2005 lee et al 2014 2016 ritch et al 2008 sayed and frederking 1992 sodhi et al 1998 these study all furthered understanding of the characteristics of ice loads acting on ships or offshore structures which is essential to support activities in the arctic region a practical ice load result can be obtained from realistic ice conditions in a full scale measurement program and thus field measurement data is highly valuable however a significant time and expense are required to support any full scale measurement program besides most field measurement data are acquired from different and uncontrolled environmental loading condition i e ice condition ambient temperature vessel speed etc therefore a direct comparison between tests is often not straightforward a series of laboratory scale ice test conducted by many researchers barrette et al 2003 bruneau et al 2012 2013 dempsey et al 2001 timco and frederking 1993 tuhkuri 1995 and all enhance the understanding of ice behavior in the case of laboratory ice crushing tests a specific geometry of an ice specimen is prepared and crushed against the surface as an output a time history of the ice load is measured by a load cell and a nominal contact area which is calculated from the controlled crushing displacement and the original geometry of the sample are used to develop pressure area plots there were also efforts to measure spatial pressure distribution directly using a pressure panel frederking 2004 gagnon 2008a b however it is clear that measured spatial pressure distribution highly dependent on the resolution of the sensing equipment because the real contact area and pressure distribution during an ice structure interaction change rapidly furthermore there are still limitations of resolution data acquisition rate and difficulties of calibration inhibit the applicability of currently applied measurement methods kim et al 2012 2013 2014 and ulan kvitberg 2012 first adopted a chemical based pressure indicating film pif in ice crushing test to examine the variation of an actual contact area as well as the spatial pressure distribution during an ice structure interaction the film itself has high resolution and respond instantly to applied loads against the film the most significant advantage of the pif in laboratory scale ice crushing tests is the simplicity of application the pif can be placed easily in any location where measuring a contact area and spatial pressure distribution is required furthermore there is no required data acquisition system during measurement and analysis a procedure for analysis of a tested pif is well established by kim et al 2012 2013 2014 previous studies have shown examples of results obtained by pif application such as 1 pixel resolution sensitivity analysis 2 plotting process and spatial pressure area curves and 3 concepts of contour averaging method cam and square averaging method sam in this study the test data were further adapted to estimate the maximum ice load through the pif to verify the utilization of the pif as an extended application of measuring the load during a laboratory scale test the resultant load values obtained using the pif are compared with the load cell measurement results also the sensitivity of measured loads and actual contact area were re assessed and discussed according to the respective test conditions 2 pressure indicating film 2 1 specification there is two type of pif which are mono and two sheet type only the two sheet type film is applied in this study and the structure of the pif is illustrated in fig 1 the reaction mechanism is the same for both types of film basically microcapsules containing colored fluid are broken if the pressure applied on the face of the film exceeds a certain level and the color forming material reacts with the color developing material so color turns red the microcapsules are designed to break according to the pressure magnitude so the color density represents a specific pressure value bachus et al 2006 liggins et al 1992 there is seven type of pif with each type of film categorized by the detectable pressure range kim et al 2012 2013 2014 and ulan kvitberg 2012 performed a series of pre tests to determine the most reasonable pressure range during a laboratory scale ice crushing test as a result three types of pif were chosen which are low medium and high type and detectable pressure range for each pif are 2 5 10 mpa low type 10 50 mpa medium type and 50 130 mpa high type three overlapping types of film were applied to measure pressure values from a minimum of 2 5 mpa to a maximum of 130 mpa the background for the selection of the three types of film was that the pressure values were measured above 50 mpa or even higher through the pre testing any pressure value smaller than 2 5 mpa is below the lowest detectable ranges in this application the pressure values smaller than 2 5 mpa did not record during the test and this could be a potential source of error in the analysis process all three types of pif were stacked together during a crushing test to obtain the pressure values for each film type the test will be carried out with the pif of the three types selected in this study and the maximum value of pressure measured by each film at the same location pixel after the crushing test will be applied as a representative pressure value of the particular pixel as a result a spatial pressure distribution was plotted using captured data each pif is not reusable since the pattern is left permanently 2 2 image processing method the pressure films were analyzed after the test followed by three steps 1 tested pressure film scanning 2 pixel value determination and 3 conversion of the pixel value to a pressure value a brief explanation of each step is described as below more details about the procedure and illustrations can be found in the references kim et al 2012 2013 2014 ulan kvitberg 2012 2 3 step 1 tested pressure film scanning a tested pressure film was digitally scanned at 1200 dpi and saved as an image file 2 4 step 2 pixel value determination the scanned image was cleaned of any stains scratches or other obviously extraneous information prior to determining the pixel value of the tested pressure film the cleaned image was converted into a 16 bit image from which x y coordinates and the corresponding pixel in the rgb format were extracted and saved into a text file only includes non zero pixels 2 5 step 3 pressure value conversion the obtained pixel values were then converted into an actual pressure value mpa using regression equations derived from calibration of the pressure films kim et al 2012 2013 2014 at each pixel location there was the maximum of three pressure values due to the pressure film layering the text files were sorted to retain only the highest pressure value at each x y coordinate hence the pressure distribution plot was created for each step 3 test condition 100 mm diameter cone shaped ice specimen was prepared to conduct an ice crushing test for the preparation de aired de ionized water to reduce the number of cracks and air bubbles inside the specimen was prepared and seeded with a specific grain size ice then mixed into an insulated container to control the direction of ice growth from bottom to top in one direction then it was allowed to grow for 48 h once the specimen was completely frozen it was taken out from the container and mounted on ice shaving equipment to shape into the desired cone angles dillenburg 2012 the crushing tests were performed using an mts mechanical testing machine fig 2 and the ice specimens were placed into position on the bottom ram of the mts machine as shown in fig 2 two different cone angles 30 50 were chosen for the test in the case of 30 cone angle ice specimen the test consisted of three crushing steps 9 18 27 mm in the case of 50 cone angle ice specimen the test consisted of four crushing steps 15 30 45 55 mm cone shaped ice specimen and corresponding crushing steps at each angle are illustrated in fig 3 as discussed three types of pif were stacked together and attached to the rigid steel plate to measure the complete ranges of pressure during an ice structure interaction at each designed step the stack of pif was replaced with the new pif and record a spatial pressure distribution at each crushing steps more details about the stepped crushing procedure adopted in this study were discussed by ulan kvitberg 2012 fig 4 illustrates each crushing step and corresponding pif pattern analysis table 1 represents the test condition applied in this study total of eight tests was performed the cone angle of ice specimen crushing speed cold room temperature and grain size were selected as controlled parameters for the test however there was no particular trend observed by cold room temperature and grain size as discussed by ulan kvitberg 2012 therefore only the cone angle and crushing speed were considered as an active parameter in this study 4 ice load evaluation using pressure indicating film in previous studies only a simple evaluation of the contact area and pressure distribution obtained by utilizing the pif was discussed the applicability of the pif whether it is able to capture a spatial pressure distribution was the focus of the assessment during the ice crushing test the ice load as a text file format which includes time displacement and load output was also measured through a load cell attached to the universal testing machine utm in a real time in this study a comparison of the ice load results derived from the load cell measurement and the pif is undertaken as part of a further evaluation of pif application not limited to the contact area and pressure distribution the additional assessment was conducted to examine whether it is possible to identify the maximum ice loads using the pif the pif obtained after the test is eventually converted into a series of pressure values at each pixel location through the image processing process the value of the ice loads that occur at each pixel location can be obtained by multiplying the converted pressure value and the pixel area pixel size is pre determined by the user and then summing the converted load values for all pixels to represent a total ice load in a particular test step fig 5 the reasons for not evaluating the ice loads using the pif in earlier studies can be explained as follows first the characteristic of the pif itself described as one time use which only records a specific moment is a limitation in evaluating the time series ice load variation of the load cell measurement second all contact areas and pressure distribution patterns that occur within in a specific ice crushing step will remain on the single pif a characteristic referred to as a memory until the film is replaced after the test this means that the information of contact area and pressure distribution pattern on the pif after a specific test step may not accurately reflect the true contact area and pressure distribution at a given time due to the characteristic of pif which contains all the memories of the event before replacing the film consequently the results of ice crushing test i e contact area pressure distribution and loads for each test analyzed through pif tends to overestimate load results at given time step kim et al 2012 2013 2014 explained the characteristics of pif using the active vs activated area concept as illustrated in fig 6 each crushing step consists of multiple sub steps true contact area representing the real shape of the contact can be defined for a specific moment but not necessarily that captured by the pif a specific pressure pattern should also be associated with the instantaneous true contact area this combination of instantaneous contact area and associated pressure pattern can be defined as the active contact area however the shape of the contact area recorded on the pif will be activated contact area which records all the previous active steps until the film is replaced therefore the recorded contact area corresponding pressure distribution and magnitude of measured ice loads using the pif are generally overestimated when compared to time series measurements for this reason the comparison of the magnitude of ice loads between the load cell and pif measurement should be evaluated in consideration of 1 the maximum load that can be derived from a specific crushing step instead of a direct comparison with real time load variation and 2 the magnitude of the converted ice loads at each step using the pif will be greater than the maximum load measured through the load cell as illustrated in fig 7 mainly these differences between the load cell measurement and pif load conversion are due to traces of previous interaction process captured by the pif another pif limitation which tends to reduce the measured load estimate is the measurable minimum pressure range which is 2 5 mpa for the low pressure type film adopted in this study since any applied pressure which is lower than the minimum detectable pressure range cannot be recorded on the pif these pressures cannot contribute to the estimated the total load thus we have two sources of misestimation the characteristic that all events are permanently recorded is a source of overestimation in the converted load and the characteristic that the film is unable to capture any pressure value smaller than 2 5 mpa is a source of underestimation of the converted load although these properties may in some sense balance each other this is neither consistent nor predictable under the random pressure are conditions of an ice interaction 5 comparison of ice load measurement results of the ice load prediction from the eight tests conducted in this study were summarized in table 2 the magnitude of the converted ice loads and the sensitivity by with the size of each pixel using the pif were analyzed for each test condition furthermore the results of the maximum ice load measured through the load cell were compiled together in each step of the test and the ratio between the two measurements pif vs load cell was assessed for validation of the capability of the maximum load assessment using the pif in a laboratory scale ice crushing test the value of ice loads converted from the pif measurement was chosen when the pixel size was 0 25 mm as a representative value of the converted ice loads the results summarized in table 2 show the following there is a significant difference observed between the two measurement methods especially at the first step in most tests this is because the first step in the ice crushing test is the period where the ice load is gradually increasing build up therefore the magnitude of the ice load is not significant in the load cell measurement however all events during the step are recorded on the pif thus the film presents a stacked value of the converted ice load and the difference is substantial during subsequent steps the tendency of an overall decrement in variation can be observed this is attributed to a lower range of pressures within a step for the later steps test 5 and test 7 show the smallest difference of the maximum load between the two measurement methods conversely the most noticeable differences in maximum load were observed in test 4 and test 8 the main factor influencing the difference between the two measurement results is the size of the measured contact area in the high type the larger contact area recorded in the high type pif leads to greater ice loads accumulated on the pressure film and resulting in substantially overestimated maximum ice loads compared to the load measured through the load cell this can be confirmed by comparing the size of the contact pattern remaining in the high type pif table 3 shows a series of the scanned high type pif in test 4 5 7 and 8 the maximum load value estimated from the pif is relatively similar to that of the load cell measurement in test 5 and 7 contact area not evident in the high type pif from the test as shown in table 3 only a few activated pixels can be seen during the first step high pressure contact rarely appears at the later steps in contrast in test 4 and 8 there is a definite contact pattern on the high type pif consistently throughout the crushing test plots of pressure distribution result from each test are illustrated in table 4 to identify further the high pressure zone detected by high type pif the map colors from orange to red represents the pressure measured by the high type pif where the magnitude of pressure is higher than 50 mpa if the maximum load analyzed through the pif is larger than the load cell measurement results it is noticeable that the appearance of the high pressure patterns is widely presented in test 5 and 7 significantly during the entire crushing process fig 8 12 show the comparison of the maximum load measurement obtained through the load cell and the pif analysis fig 8 show the results of all tests includes all steps the solid line indicates the case where the ratio between the measurement results between the load cell and the pif is equal to 1 1 as demonstrated by the pressure distribution plots the maximum load measured at the load cell can be seen as lower overall compared to the results converted from the pif analysis this is due to the result of all contact events occurring within a specific step being recorded on the pif there are some cases where the measured load was slightly larger or roughly identical in the load cell measurement and the pif analysis in addition to the previously discussed reasons for discrepancies between pif based load estimates and direct load readings there is a possibility of inadvertent data loss during the analysis of tested pif image processing while removing unnecessary parts of the scanned pif before converting a pixel value to an actual pressure value figs 9 and 10 summarize the results according to the number of steps the regression curve shows a slightly closer fit to the 1 1 line in the four steps test case and this is consistent with the trend of results are getting closer to the 1 1 line as the number of steps is increased figs 11 and 12 summarize the results of the test in accordance with the crushing speed in contrast to the effect of the number of steps crushing speed significantly affects the trend of load measurement in the case of 1 0 mm s crushing speed the test results and the trend of the regression curve is close to the 1 1 line except for a few data points indicated by the red dotted circle in contrast the maximum load converted through the pif can be found to be substantially larger than the results of the load cell measurement in most cases when the crushing speed is 100 mm s this result reflects the effect of crushing speed or strain rate in a typical ice crushing test if the crushing speed is low the appearance of saw tooth pattern in measured load which is induced by spalling events is rarely observed in slow tests the tendency of the ice load is to exhibits a steady increment in time or displacement as illustrated in fig 13 in contrast spalling will frequently occur during a fast ice structure interaction thus inducing sharp variations of load displacement history evident in the saw tooth load pattern as illustrated in fig 14 therefore it can be expected that there will be a relatively large number of events recorded on the pif although it does not appear in the measurement through the load cell at the same time this will lead to a greater estimation of the maximum load using the pif especially at the high crushing speed case as shown in fig 12 it can be concluded that using the pif in the ice crushing test to evaluate the maximum load is impractical based on the results of this analysis this is mainly due to the memory characteristics of the pif but also due to the low pressure threshold for activating the pif however if the pif is utilized in a limited condition i e a large number of test steps at a low crushing speed it is possible to evaluate the approximation of the maximum load during an ice structure interaction as well as contact area observation 6 comparison of contact area measurement a previous series of studies have been conducted in the contact area during an ice crushing test utilizing the pif kim et al 2012 2013 2014 conducted the study on the sensitivity of the measured pressure values according to the pixel size of the analyzed pif ulan kvitberg 2012 analyzed the difference of the contact area measured on the pif and the nominal contact area however an intensive analysis of the cause of the discrepancy was not discussed and the results were presented only as figures in this study the sensitivity of the contact area to the magnitude of the pixel size was revisited and then the nominal contact area simultaneously evaluated using the tested pif and pressure distribution plots the nominal contact area was calculated according to the designed displacement in each step the results of pixel size sensitivity and the nominal contact area of each test were summarized in table 5 the smallest pixel size 0 25 mm results are applied as a representative value for the evaluation of the results the contact area calculated from the pif is not a true or active area but the activated area as discussed previously this means that the area of contact from all events that occurred before the film being replaced was recorded in the same way as the maximum load measurement therefore it may be expected that the size of the activated area on the pif is larger compared to the active area true area at any point in time during an ice crushing test however the changes in contact area during an ice structure interaction which can be observed using the pif provide useful information on the characteristics of ice load and contact area as shown in table 5 the size of the contact area measured by the pif is always less than the nominal contact area at each step this is because the nature of the contact area is inconsistent and the shape of the contact area is highly randomized as reported in many medium and laboratory scale tests therefore the fact that the nominal contact area is always larger is not surprising but it is a natural result of the ice crushing process daley 1998 sanderson 1988 zou et al 1996 fig 15 19 show how the magnitude of the contact area varies according to each of the test conditions fig 15 shows the results that include all test cases most of the contact areas were measured at approximately 60 of the nominal value by the pif the slope of the regression curve also reflects this result figs 16 and 17 show the effect of the number of test steps in the measured contact area in the three steps test case the contact area measured by the pif is approximately 55 of the nominal contact area in the four steps test case the contact area measured by the pif is about 65 of the nominal contact area however there are a number of data points that significantly deviate from the regression curve as shown in fig 17 in conclusion the smaller number of steps show a lower measured contact area figs 18 and 19 show the result of the measured contact area in accordance with the crushing speed if the crushing speed was 1 0 mm s low speed test the measured contact area from the pif indicates approximately 68 of the area relative to the nominal contact area except for a few data points which show the differences in step 4 all other results follows the trend the loss of contact area during an ice structure interaction due to spalling events is relatively less frequent if the crushing speed is low at low strain rate this means that the rate of the contact area variation is almost constant during the low speed crushing test conversely the measured contact area by the pif captured approximately 52 of the nominal contact area when the crushing speed was 100 mm s however most of the data followed the trend of the regression curve only with a small variation in most cases where the crushing speed strain rate is high the saw tooth load pattern due to the occurrence of spalling events daley 1992 sanderson 1988 tuhkuri 1995 is observed thus the effects on contact area measurement arising from crushing speed are fully predictable and were able to be visually explicit by utilizing the pif figs 20 and 21 shows test the variation in contact area through the load displacement history and corresponding pif measurements and pressure distribution plots fig 20 shows the load displacement history of test 1 in the first and second step contact areas close to the nominal contact area 67 8 and 75 7 are measured which is due to the absence of significant spalling events during a gradual increment of the ice load this can be visually verified in that there is virtually no void space between the actual pressure pattern indicated by the red colored area and the nominal contact area indicated by the black dotted line however a significant reduction of the apparent load in the third step was observed due to spalling events and the contact area also significantly decreased sharply compared to the previous steps in the case of the load displacement history shown in fig 19 the tendency of increasing ice loads was observed without experiencing a notable spalling event throughout the test and the contact area is also steadily increasing until it reaches step 4 as a result differences between the measured contact area using the pif and the nominal contact area are reduced as the step progresses fig 22 shows the load displacement history where the measured contact area is significantly different from the nominal contact area the load displacement history for test 5 could not satisfy the conditions which are 1 the ice load gradually increases as the displacement increase during the crushing process and 2 no instantaneous reduction of load and contact area due to the spalling events which is necessary to achieve a steady increment of the contact area and a ratio close to the nominal contact area even though the ice load tends to increase after the first step the magnitude of the ice load tends to maintain the same value within each step rather than continuously increasing because of a frequent occurrence of spalling events throughout all steps for that reason the measured contact area was always less than 50 compared to the nominal contact area and differences were widened as the subsequent step progressed 7 conclusions in this study laboratory scale ice crushing tests were analyzed by measuring the contact area pressure distribution and the maximum load using high resolution pressure indication film the sensitivity analysis was done with the pixel size in a previous study and this study expanded the analysis to trends in the scope of measured contact area and the maximum load variation for each test condition additional verification was conducted by comparing the maximum load derived using the pif and obtained from load cell measurements to verify whether the pif could be utilized to estimate not only the contact area pressure distribution but also the maximum load in the case of the maximum load measurement the overall difference between the pif measurement and the load cell measurement was significant this is due to the characteristic that the pif record all the events until the film replaced therefore the maximum load derived from the pif will inevitably be larger than the maximum load measured by the load cell the most significant factor determining the difference in the maximum load measured through the pif was the existence of high pressure zones in the ice contact which influenced the amount of the contact area captured by the high type pif where the magnitude of measured pressure is greater than 50 mpa in the case where high pressure frequently occurred during the ice crushing process more loads remain on the pif indicating that the measured load value is greater than the load cell measurement this has been visually verified by comparison with 1 tested pifs and 2 pressure distribution plots at specific test results the load cell measurements were observed larger than the pif results in some test cases and this can be explained by the lowest pressure value which can be measured through the low type pif was 2 5 mpa during the tests therefore the pif could not measure pressures below 2 5 mpa even though the pressure load is applied during the crushing process and recorded in the load cell measurement as the number of test steps increased the maximum load measurement converted by the pif was closer to the results of the load cell measurement but it was not significantly improved crushing speed showed a noticeable effect on measured load variation for lower crushing speed an overall pressure distribution pattern was stabilized and the magnitude of pressure does not tend to exceed 50 mpa as no significant pressure pattern observed in the high type pif a gradual increment of the maximum load is observed as the displacement increased therefore it was found that the results of the maximum load measurement between the load cell and the pif were similar at the low crushing speed strain rate accurate estimation of the maximum load using the pif is expected to be limited except in the test condition when the crushing speed is relatively low to achieve more accurate and reliable results using the pif in maximum load estimation a wider range of pif types to accurately reflect the range of pressure occurring during the test should be considered in the case of the contact area it was found that an average of 60 was measured through the pif relative to the nominal contact area it was visually confirmed that the actual contact area of the test would normally exhibit a highly randomized shape of contact area compared to the nominal contact area which is an idealized area due to a frequent spalling event similar to the maximum load prediction the variation at the final step between the actual contact area measured by the pif and the nominal contact area was relatively large in the case of crushing speed there were less spalling events at the low crushing speed which resulted in the measured contact area being greater by about 15 relative to the high crushing speed case in conclusion the fundamental parameter determining the difference of the contact area between the nominal contact area and the actual contact area measured by the pif is the loss of ice by spalling events during the higher speed ice crushing process the application of the pif to assess the more accurate maximum loads and contact areas may be improved under the following conditions additional test steps need to be added to reduce the amount of accumulated memory in the pif between test steps this will reduce discrepancies in both load and contact area predicted by the pif second the low pressure range of the pif films should be extended to cover ranges below 2 5 mpa this will reduce the amount of lost pressure left unrecorded by the pif this study was conducted to verify the limitation of using the pif in laboratory scale ice crushing tests however it is advantageous to obtain information about the contact area and the maximum load in the crushing process without a special instrumentation equipment therefore it is expected to be able to obtain more precise analysis results using the pif if the discussed problems are supplemented

23144,in the present study the flow characteristics of a 76000 dwt panamax bulker were measured using a customized stereoscopic underwater particle image velocimetry spiv system in a ship model towing tank the aim was to identify the flow characteristics around hulls with high block coefficients and u shaped sterns in the spiv tests the time averaged and instantaneous velocity turbulence characteristics and vorticity information were measured in the propeller plane at a froude number of 0 167 the results obtained from the time averaged and instantaneous wake fields show different flow characteristics in the propeller working region the time averaged flow fields clearly illustrate the presence of a bilge vortex hub cap vortex and hook shaped velocity contours the instantaneous flow patterns confirm the hook like velocity contours found in the time averaged flow fields but the instantaneous contours are not smooth and consecutive the swirling patterns of the primary bilge vortex bv and the secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex hcv are found to be time dependent the turbulence characteristics show that the flow in the propeller region has an anisotropic turbulence structure and the spatial distributions of the turbulence statistics including the reynolds stresses and turbulent kinetic energy have a u hook pattern similar to a u shaped stern analysis of the vorticity swirling strength planar 2nd invariant q and lambda 2 criterion reiterates the formation of the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex the formation growth development and transmission of bv and hcv can be described by integrating the spiv data with computational fluid dynamics the experimental results for the time averaged and instantaneous velocity turbulence characteristics and vorticity information are not only useful for understanding the wake fields around ships with high block coefficients and u shaped sterns but also enable the numerical verification of the computational fluid

optimization of the hull shape wake adapted designs of the propeller and rudder energy saving appendages and verification of the underlying theory and numerical simulations pitot tubes laser doppler velocimetry ldv and particle image velocimetry piv have commonly been used to measure and characterize flow fields recent developments in lasers and image processing technologies mean that ldv and piv

aft vortices felli et al 2015 the present study investigates the wake field characteristics of a 76000 dwt panamax bulker particular attention is focused on the time averaged and instantaneous velocity turbulence characteristics and vorticity information in the propeller working region of a hull with a high block coefficient and u shaped stern the wake fields in the propeller region of the hull model were measured by a towed underwater spiv system in the towing tank of harbin engineering university china initially the time averaged and instantaneous velocities of the propeller plane

facility tests were conducted in the towing tank 108 m long 7 m wide and 3 5 m deep at harbin engineering university china the maximum speed of the towing carriage with a main bridge and sub bridge is 6 5 0 003 m s the four component motion measuring device and piv system used to collect the data were attached to the bridge and sub bridge 2 2 testing model and experimental conditions the model was manufactured in fiberglass geometric details are listed in table 1 the cross sections and test model with local coordinate systems for spiv measurements are shown in fig 1 turbulence stimulators were installed at 5 length between perpendicular lpp intervals away from the forward perpendicular fp to minimize the scaling effect induced by the conflict between froude and reynolds scaling to prevent the ship motion from interfering with the image acquisition the four degrees of freedom were locked the model was painted matte black to minimize laser sheet reflection the origin of the global xyz coordinate system was placed at the crossing point of the fp baseline and hull centreline with the x axis running along the model centreline to downstream y running toward starboard and z upward table

0 0199 y 0 z 0 01644 x x lpp and so on in the global coordinate system whereas the local coordinates are x local 0 y local 0 z local 0 x local x local lpp and so on 2 3 spiv system the spiv system used in this study is a customized stereoscopic underwater piv system for towing tanks dantec dynamics inc skovlunde denmark the submersible piv system comprising the submersible camera modules mirror modules and submersible light sheet unit have two configurations asymmetrical and symmetrical the configuration in the present test is asymmetrical the piv system consists of the following components a piv probe assembled in asymmetrical configuration with streamlined nose and tail b two streamlined struts with consoles and head for supporting the piv probe and for guiding the light and cables to the piv probe c two camera modules with water detection equipped with two flowsense 4m mk ii 12 bit ccd cameras supplied by dantec dynamics inc the cameras are equipped with 85 and 50 mm f 1 8 canon ef lenses the scheimpflug angle focus and aperture can be adjusted through the controller box using dynamic studio software d two camera mirror modules with two mirror sections and open windows the mirror sections for cameras 1 and 2 are equipped with big and small mirrors with mirror angles of 56 and 19 respectively thus the angle between the camera axes and views is 68 and 38 respectively e the light sheet unit containing light sheet optics and a window for the light sheet the adopted laser supply was a dualpower 200 mj 15 hz nd yag laser supplied by litron lasers the arrangement of the spiv system is similar to that described in the literature yoon et al 2015 falchi et al 2014 the spiv setup with test model and the detailed arrangement of the probes in the underwater spiv system are shown in figs 2 and 3 polyamide seeding particles with a diameter of 50 μm dantec dynamics inc were used as the tracer particles for this spiv test approximately 150 g m3 of particles were mixed with the water using a motorized stirrer in the particle seeding device to ensure uniformity of particles in the test region a customized rake shaped pipe was used during the particle seeding process 2 4 calibration and vector field calculation of spiv system the submersible piv system for towing tanks was calibrated using a 400 310 mm2 multilevel dot matrix dantec dynamics calibration target half the markers at the same level as the zero marker the other half in a 2nd level closer to or farther from the viewer see fig 4 before the stereo calibration the multilevel dot matrix calibration target should be installed at the laser sheet plane where the field of views of the two cameras overlap a special tool with a small mirror mounted on the calibration target is used to adjust the position of the calibration target and light sheet accurately the direct linear transform dlt mathematical model dantec dynamics 2015 of dynamics studio was used to describe the affine transform function that describes how the points are transferred from the object coordinates mm of the object space to the image coordinates pixels of the image plane the affine transform function created in the stereo calibration plays an important role in reconstructing the 3d velocity vectors of the spiv process a dantec dynamics calibration refinement was performed to improve the accuracy of the existing stereo calibration using particle images acquired simultaneously from both cameras in the uniform flow measurement condition at test speed without the test model spiv analysis was conducted in batch processes using dantec studio v 6 0 software the field of view was approximately 320 mm 280 mm width height the distance between the piv probe and test model was 1215 mm the acquisition frequency was 7 5 hz in the piv test because of camera performance limitations flowsense 4m mk ii 12 bit ccd cameras 7 5 hz was the highest acquisition frequency possible for the underwater spiv system the velocity vectors were calculated using the adaptive correlation method dantec dynamics 2015 with an initial 128 128 pixel interrogation window and a final 32 32 pixel interrogation window the correlation analysis of images was implemented with two passes using 128 128 64 64 and 32 32 pixel interrogation windows in that order an overlap of 50 among neighbouring interrogation windows was used during the correlation analysis process local neighbourhood validation compared individual vectors to the local vectors in the neighbourhood vector area size 3 3 and any spurious vectors were removed and replaced by vectors calculated through the local interpolation of the vectors present in the area the final spacing of the vector grid of one velocity vector in the time averaged velocity map was 2 45 2 45 mm2 the separation time between two consecutive illuminations of the tracer particles was 400 μs this interval makes sure the maximum particle displacement within 1 4 interrogation window 2 5 uncertainty and convergence analysis of the present spiv system the three main sources of uncertainty in spiv measurements are as follows i image processing and adaptive correlation algorithm errors in the vector field analysis process ii velocity reconstruction to obtain the three component velocity vector fields based on the two planar components and iii piv light sheet registration errors with the calibration target in this study the simplified method adopted for the uncertainty and convergence of the present spiv system is similar to the approach of falchi falchi et al 2014 the bias and peak locking errors were disregarded and only the correlation noise error was estimated in this study formulas were derived to evaluate the root mean square rms error of the three velocity components as a function of the angular displacement between the cameras and the level of correlation noise of the 2c piv fields prasad 2000 the detailed approximation formulas are as follows 1 r m s δ x r m s δ x 1 δ x 2 cos θ 2 2 cos θ 1 2 sin θ 2 θ 1 2 r m s δ y r m s δ x 1 δ x 2 2 3 r m s δ z r m s δ x 1 δ x 2 sin θ 2 2 sin θ 1 2 sin θ 2 θ 1 where δx 1 and δx 2 are the in disc displacements along the x axis θ 1 and θ 2 are the inclinations between the camera axes and views θ 1 68 θ 2 38 for the utilized spiv system δx δy and δz are the displacements in the absolute reference frame and rms is a conservative value of the root mean square particle image displacement which is used as an indicator for this kind of error u v and w are the velocities in the x y and z coordinates respectively the percentage uncertainty in the instantaneous velocities derived from approximated formulas and excluding the effect of the statistically converged velocity fields can be expressed as follows 4 r m s u u r m s δ x δ x r m s δ t δ t where rms δx δx represents the error due to the processing software the processing error rms δx 1 δx 2 of stereo recombination is 0 1 pixels according to the literature raffel et al 2007 adrian and westerweel 2011 and the mean displacement of the tracer particles in the time interval δt is about 7 pixels rms δt δt represents the error due to the electronic time jitter the jitter for the actual laser used in this study was 1 ns and the actual time interval δt between the two pulses was 400 μs for the dantec spiv equipment used here substituting these values into eq 4 gives rms u u 2 492 rms v u 1 014 rms w u 3 179 as the estimated error for the instantaneous velocity field is approximately 3 of the mean velocity a conservative approximation for the global uncertainty of the current piv measurements would be up to 4 of the estimated flow velocity this is similar to the estimate given by prasad 2000 for the statistical convergence considerations the following section discusses the relationship between the number of required samples n and the desired statistical quantity as well as the corresponding confidence interval according to the literature of random data bendat and piersol 1986 2010 the velocity samples are assumed to follow a normal distribution the confidence interval is u i z α 2 σ 0 n and the u i conf is z α 2 σ 0 n where u i is the mean free stream velocity in the x y and z coordinates and the digital characteristics of the velocity are as follows variance σ 0 2 is equal to the global uncertainty 0 04 and the standard deviation σ 0 is equal to the rms of the velocity the relationship between the required samples n and the level of precision confidence interval see fig 5 can then be computed as follows 5 n z α 2 2 σ 0 2 u i c o n f 2 where u i conf represents the level of precision viz confidence interval is u i u i c o n f with which the desired statistical quantity is evaluated z α 2 1 96 probability 95 α 0 05 for a two tailed normal distribution is the probability of a normal distribution and σ 0 0 2 is the standard deviation of the velocity a population of 250 double frame images was recorded in the present study and the level of precision of spiv system was approximately 2 5 the confidence interval is u i 2 5 the following relationship can be used to assess the uncertainty on second order statistical moments the rms of the velocity 6 s 1 z α 2 2 n σ 0 s 1 z α 2 2 n where s is the estimated rms value when n 250 and z α 2 1 96 then 0 92s σ 0 1 096s it can be seen that the estimation of the confidence interval is used to evaluate second order statistical moments the uncertainty in the above analysis for these quantities is equal to 17 of the exact value which is close to the value of 12 derived by falchi falchi et al 2014 2 6 parameters of velocity fields a total of 250 instantaneous velocity fields were measured with a single towing carriage run to acquire the time averaged velocity fields theoretically speaking the more pictures the better because of the length limitation of the towing tank we took 250 pairs of images per run similar piv tests at seoul national university towing tank 110 m long 8 m wide and 3 5 m deep and the iihr towing tank of the university of iowa 100 m long 3 m wide and 3 m deep also took around 250 images yoon et al 2015 seo et al 2016 the time averaged parameters were calculated from these n 250 pairs of piv images as follows the time averaged velocity component u i was computed as 7 u i 1 250 n 1 250 u i n the whole flow velocity vector magnitude velocity l and cross flow velocity vector magnitude velocity s was computed using the time averaged velocity component in eq 7 l u 2 v 2 w 2 1 2 and s v 2 w 2 1 2 respectively the average kinetic energy ake was computed using the time averaged velocity component in eq 7 for i j as 8 a k e 1 2 u u v v w w the instantaneous kinetic energy ike was computed using the n th instantaneous velocity component in eq 7 for i j as 9 i k e 1 2 u n u n v n v n w n w n where the index i 1 2 3 indicates the axial transverse and vertical velocity component respectively in eq 8 u v and w indicate the time averaged axial transverse and vertical velocities respectively in eq 9 u n v n and w n indicate the n th instantaneous axial transverse and vertical velocities respectively the rms velocity component ū i rms which is also the ū i velocity fluctuation was computed as 10 u i r m s u i 1 250 n 1 250 u i n u i 2 the reynolds stress tensor component ū i ū j was then computed as 11 u i u j 1 250 n 1 250 u i n u i u j n u j the turbulent kinetic energy tke was computed using the reynolds normal stresses in eq 11 for i j as 12 t k e 1 2 u u v v w w where i j 1 2 3 indicate the axial u transverse v and vertical w velocity fluctuations respectively in eqs 7 10 and 11 u i n or u j n represents the n th instantaneous velocity data 3 results and discussion 3 1 time averaged velocity fields the time averaged velocity information vectors and streamlines at the propeller plane of a 76000 dwt panamax bulker were obtained through spiv measurements the results are shown in figs 7 and 8 fig 6 illustrates the definition of u and v form hulls ferraro et al 2012 and the u shaped stern frame lines of a 76000 dwt panamax bulker fig 7 illustrates the wake fields in the whole spiv capture region and fig 8 a h illustrates the wake fields in the propeller region which is part of the spiv capture region normalized coordinates y r and z r are used to represent the y and z axes in figs 7 and 8 where r 75 mm is the propeller radius similarly the velocity information shown in figs 7 and 8 is normalized with respect to the ship s velocity u fig 8 a b display the axial flow velocity u u and cross flow vector distribution of the wake fields in the propeller plane across the whole spiv capture region fig 6 shows that the 76000 dwt panamax bulker has u shaped stern frame lines the incident flows that pass by this u shaped stern generate intense bilge vortices labelled bv figs 7 and 8 b f the velocity u u and l u in the propeller plane is affected by these vortices and distinct hook like axial velocity contours labelled a appear when u u 0 3 and l u 0 3 the distortion of these hook shaped contours which were mentioned by lee and kim lee et al 1998 2003 kim et al 2001 is caused by flows with lower average kinetic energy ake fig 8 h labelled d being transferred through an intense longitudinal bilge vortex towards the centre of the hull this causes a reduction in velocity and creates local hook shaped structures a secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex labelled hcv fig 7 b c d fig 8 b f is situated below the bilge vortex and tightly adheres to the hull s longitudinal profile the presence of the hook shaped bilge vortex and counter rotational hub cap vortex has a positive effect on the rotational efficiency of the propeller lee et al 1998 2003 kim et al 2001 fig 8 c d show that the positive and negative velocities correspond to the direction of rotation in the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex and in the region 0 y r 1 0 z r 1 of the velocity w u contours the velocity w u has a regular layered distribution in the region 0 y r 1 1 z r 0 of the velocity w u contours the velocity w u has a u shaped distribution fig 8 e f show the contours and streamlines of s u the streamlined flow is divided into counter clockwise and clockwise flows by the bilge vortex and the hub cap vortex the bilge vortex foci f1 at y r 0 5 z r 0 05 hub cap vortex foci f2 at y r 0 215 z r 0 425 and two saddle points s1 at y r 0 1 z r 0 05 s2 at y r 0 4 z r 0 65 develop in the propeller region the saddle point s1 indicates the upwash flow shear layer merging with the downwash flow shear layer the saddle point s2 indicates the leftwash flow and rightwash flow separating from the up downwash flow shear layer the 0 contour of s u intersection point of the 0 contours of v u and w u in fig 8 c d contains the foci f1 f2 of the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex and also the two saddle points s1 s2 the transverse evolution of u u v u w u s u l u and ake u 2 at z r 0 00 in the propeller region is illustrated in fig 9 the velocities u u and l u gradually increase from the centre of the propeller s axis towards the side of the ship the hook shaped distributions of u u and l u first increase then decrease and finally increase again the area of the plot with a concave distribution is the hook shaped velocity contour distribution region in figs 7 and 8 the velocity v u gradually increases to its maximum at the normalized y location y r 0 35 and then gradually decreases to a negative speed at y r 0 85 the velocity w u gradually decreases from the centre of the propeller s axis towards the side of the ship as a result of the bilge vortex the distribution of s u is concave within the range y r 0 4 0 6 with a minimum velocity at the normalized y location y r 0 5 of magnitude s u 0 02 the disturbance caused by the hook shaped velocity contours and the bilge vortex results in an area of low kinetic energy ake u 2 appearing within the range y r 0 0 7 ake then rises to a maximum at y r 1 the flow characteristics within the wake fields around the propeller region can be further quantified by considering the velocity and ake u 2 profiles along several radii r r 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 fig 10 shows the velocities u u v u w u s u l u and ake u 2 with respect to the circumferential angle θ which runs clockwise from 0 top to 180 data points are taken every 10 data from 180 to 360 are the mirror image of those from 0 to 180 at r r 0 4 and 0 6 the distribution of u u w u s u l u and ake u 2 with respect to θ shows an overall decreasing trend the disturbances of the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex mean that the plots have some slight fluctuations for r r 0 4 these occur at θ 100 and 160 180 for r r 0 6 they occur for θ between 110 140 and 160 180 the distribution of v u with respect to θ is v shaped first decreasing and then increasing at r r 0 8 the plots are located at the outer boundary of the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex regions thus the distributions of u u s u l u and ake u 2 with respect to θ are relatively stable except for some local undulations in u u l u between 10 30 and 160 180 the distribution of v u with respect to θ exhibits strong fluctuations and w u decreases before increasing again clearly affected by the stripe distribution of the w u contours fig 8 d at r r 1 0 the distributions of u u l u and ake u 2 with respect to θ are obviously increasing and v u exhibits strong fluctuations the plot of w u s u decreases increases at first and then increases decreases being affected by the stripe distribution of the w u s u contours fig 8 d e 3 2 instantaneous velocity fields some additional flow field characteristics regarding the instantaneous velocity in the propeller region are now presented fig 11 presents the instantaneous velocity u u cross flow vectors kinetic energy ike u 2 streamline 2nd invariant q and lambda 2 distributions of the wake fields in the propeller region the instantaneous wake fields are different from the time averaged flow fields and some additional vortices are generated in the instantaneous flow structures as there were 250 instantaneous velocity fields in our spiv test it is not feasible to present all of these results in the manuscript in order to show the characteristics of the instantaneous velocity field and the difference between the instantaneous velocity field and the average velocity field the frame numbers n 60 70 are typical flow field moments of developmental stage of the spiv test and the frame number n 150 155 are typical flow field moments of fully developed stages of the spiv test the intervals of the frame number are 10 and 5 for developmental and fully developed stages of the spiv test respectively to a certain extent the selection of this specific frame numbers have certain randomness these instantaneous velocity fields are chosen as representative cases to express the complexity of the instantaneous fields if we select the instantaneous velocity field of the other frame numbers in the corresponding stage the similar flow characteristics can also be illustrated fig 11a presents various quantities captured at frame number n 60 instead of only two large wake vortices bilge vortex and hub cap vortex two foci and two saddle points form in the wake region as shown in the time averaged flow fields figs 7 and 8 two large wake vortices bilge vortex and hub cap vortex three local secondary vortices see red lines and some very small vortices are not present similarly hereinafter with five foci three stable and two unstable smits and lim 2012 perry and chong 1987 eight saddle points and a stagnation point st 1 frank 2002 are present in the propeller region fig 11b shows the instantaneous velocity fields captured at n 70 the instantaneous cross flow vectors streamlines 2nd invariant q and lambda 2 still show two vortices bv and hcv and some small local secondary vortices in the wake region although the ship has moved to a different location than when n 60 fig 11a in addition six foci four stable and two unstable and five saddle points are present in the propeller region when n 70 fig 11c and d presents the instantaneous streamwise flow pattern captured at n 150 and 155 respectively from the instantaneous cross flow vectors streamlines 2nd invariant q and lambda 2 shown in these two frames it is clear that the secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex hcv is situated immediately under the primary bilge vortex bv the size of the secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex increases as the frame number progresses from 150 to 155 in addition the primary bilge vortex bv becomes larger after it absorbs the small local secondary vortices in its vicinity compare n 155 with the swirling patterns shown when n 150 the secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex hcv has moved downward slightly in frame n 155 compared with n 150 this is clear when comparing both the instantaneous cross flow vectors and streamlines between n 150 and 155 as shown in fig 11c and d respectively from the instantaneous velocity u u and kinetic energy ike u 2 contours shown in fig 11 we can observe the hook like velocity contours and low kinetic energy ike area found in the time averaged flow fields however the instantaneous velocity u u and kinetic energy ike u 2 contours are not smooth and time resolved in addition the swirling patterns of the primary bilge vortex bv do not change significantly in different frames the location of the secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex hcv is unfixed and moves up and down it can be inferred that the hub cap vortex forms around the shaft stern bulb and sheds into the downstream and propeller regions the longitudinal shedding pattern of the hub cap vortex is not present in our spiv capture region and further investigation using high speed piv in various planes is recommended to fully resolve the instantaneous flow pattern in the propeller region the transverse evolution of the instantaneous velocity u u and ike u 2 in different frames at z r 0 00 in the propeller region is shown in fig 12 figs 13 and 14 plot the instantaneous velocity u u and ike u 2 profiles respectively with respect to θ along several radii r r 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 the distributions of the instantaneous velocity u u and ike u 2 transverse evolution and circumferential distribution in the different frames are similar to the time averaged distributions as there are no smooth and consecutive disturbances in the hook shaped velocity and ike contours of the evolving swirling patterns of the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex the plots have a different degree of fluctuation the envelope curves shown in figs 10 12 describe the detailed values and locations of these fluctuations 3 3 turbulence characteristic of flow fields the turbulent flow characteristics in the propeller region of a 76000 dwt panamax bulker are now discussed contours of the rms velocities be normalized by u and turbulence statistics be normalized by u 2 including the turbulent kinetic energy and reynolds stresses are presented in fig 15 a c and 16 a g respectively from fig 15 the contours of the rms velocities u rms v rms and w rms which also give the velocity fluctuations u v and w are equal to the square root of the normal stresses fig 16 b d the square root of the normal stress normalized by u represents the turbulent intensity of each velocity component comparing the three normal stresses the streamwise turbulent intensity u u u 2 is different from the other two stresses v v u 2 and w w u 2 in the propeller region lumley and newman lumley and newman 1977 choi and lumley 2001 pope 2005 introduced a new tensor a i j u i u j 2 3 t k e δ i j to quantify the degree of anisotropy of the turbulent flow field the normalized anisotropy tensor which is used extensively is defined as b i j a i j 2 t k e u i u j 2 t k e 1 3 δ i j where δ ij is the kronecker delta δ ij 1 if i j and δ ij 0 if i j another way to quantify the isotropic characteristics of turbulence is described in seo 2016 where the anisotropy is derived from the mean and standard deviation of the reynolds normal stress at a certain location as follows 13 a n i s o t r o p y u u 2 v v 2 w w 2 3 u u v v w w 3 1 if a ij and the anisotropy are zero the turbulence is totally isotropic fig 17 displays the anisotropy b 11 b 22 and b 33 distributions of the wake fields in the propeller plane the normalized anisotropy tensor b 12 b 21 u v 2 t k e b 13 b 31 u w 2 t k e and b 23 b 32 v w 2 t k e is non zero this indicates that the flow in the stern region has an anisotropic turbulence structure which is typical of most three dimensional turbulent flows bradshaw pope 2005 bradshaw 1973 1996 1997 hewitt and vassilicos 2005 has argued that whenever a thin turbulent shear layer experiences an extra rate of strain i e in addition to the usual rate of strain u y strictly s 12 1 2 u y v x the response of the turbulence parameters is an order of magnitude greater than one would expect from an observation of the appropriate extra terms in the mean flow equations of momentum and continuity for a ship with an axisymmetric boundary layer as is being considered here patel and lee said that there are two extra rates of strain e l due to the longitudinal curvature and e t due to the convergence or divergence of the streamlines in planes parallel to the surface associated with the changes in the transverse curvature patel and lee 1979 therefore the anisotropic structure of the wake fields is related to the extra rates of strain associated with flow convergence and divergence around the stern hull form in the propeller region of this 76000 dwt panamax bulker with u shaped stern frame lines the normal stresses are large at the bottom and side regions of the longitudinal bilge vortex behind the propeller boss the bottom and lower side regions of the longitudinal vortex have especially large reynolds normal stresses the spatial distributions of the three turbulent intensities for the u shaped stern hull form have a similar pattern and are similar to the contour lines of the axial mean velocity u shown in fig 8a the kinetic energy exhibits some correlation with both the axial velocity and vorticity contours see section 3 4 note that the region with large turbulent intensity has a hook like shape around the longitudinal bilge vortex the hook like spatial distributions of the turbulence statistics are located at the region where the average kinetic energy changes as shown in fig 8h and some of the turbulence contours are located behind the propeller boss fig 15 the contours of turbulent kinetic energy with the largest values of k 0 05u are similar to those of the streamwise turbulent intensity u u u 2 this is because the largest streamwise normal stress of u u 0 09u is much greater than the maximum of the other two normal stresses v v 6 and w w 1 4 therefore the turbulent kinetic energy is large in the high shear region where the axial velocity component has a large velocity gradient the proportional relation between the reynolds stresses and mean rates of strain which was first proposed by boussinesq in 1877 pope 2005 boussinesq 1877 veerstegmalalasekera 2007 is defined as 14 τ i j ρ u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ρ t k e δ i j 2 ρ υ t s i j 2 3 ρ t k e δ i j where τ ij is the reynolds stress and u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i is the rate of strain tensor u i x j u j x i are the velocity gradients the positive scalar coefficient υ t is the turbulent viscosity also called the eddy viscosity with dimensions m2 s ρ is the density of the fluid because the mean velocity components v and w are much smaller than the axial velocity u their gradients in the x direction i e v x w x the y direction i e w y and the z direction i e v z are relatively insignificant the gradients in the y direction i e u y and the z direction i e u z are relatively significant base on the rate of strain tensor s ij we get s 12 s 21 1 2 u y v x s 13 s 31 1 2 u z w x s 23 s 32 1 2 v z w y therefore the reynolds shear stresses τ 12 ρ u v and τ 23 ρ u w related to the large strain rate s 12 s 21 s 13 s 31 are more significant than the shear stress τ 23 ρ v w related to the strain rate s 23 s 32 we can see the effect of the longitudinal vortex behind the propeller boss on the reynolds shear stresses u v and u w the reynolds shear stresses u v u w and v w have similar hook shape contours in the near wake behind the propeller boss the primary bilge vortex bv and secondary hub cap vortices are surrounded by the hook shape reynolds shear stress contours the reynolds shear stress u v is negative in the propeller region where u y is increasing as is ρ u v and positive in the region where u y is decreasing with a maximum value where the gradient is largest u v 0 04u the reynolds shear stress u w exhibits similar behaviour but is correlated with u z and attains a maximum of u w 0 01u the transverse evolution of the rms velocities and turbulence statistics at z r 0 00 of the propeller region are presented in fig 18 fig 19 shows the turbulence statistics profiles with respect to θ along several radii r r 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 from fig 18 it can be seen that high levels of rms velocity and reynolds normal stresses in the x y and z directions appear along the side regions of the longitudinal bilge vortex and behind the propeller boss from fig 19 at r r 0 4 and 0 6 located within the low ake region labelled d in fig 8 h the overall turbulence statistics with respect to θ are fairly stable at r r 0 8 located at the boundary of the region where ake changes the turbulence statistics with respect to θ exhibit an increasing trend for tke and reynolds normal stresses at r r 1 0 located in the region of changing ake the turbulence statistics with respect to θ have strong fluctuations 3 4 vorticity information of flow fields vorticity information for the propeller region of a 76000 dwt panamax bulker is presented in this subsection fig 20 a d shows contour maps of the vorticity swirling strength adrian et al 2000 planar 2nd invariant q hunt 1988 chong et al 1990 and lambda 2 criterion jeong and hussain 1995 respectively there are two sources of vorticity fig 20a d 21 the bilge vortex strictly the primary bilge vortex and the secondary vortex of the bilge vortex with the same rotation direction and the hub cap vortex the bilge vortex counter clockwise on the starboard clockwise on the port side is generated from the bilge of the ship s hull and sheds into the propeller plane thus the vortex is located around the outer boundary layer u u 0 3 0 6 fig 8a covering a large area the vortex shedding around the shaft is from the hub cap vortex the hub cap vortex clockwise on the starboard counter clockwise on the port side forms inside the inner wake field where u u 0 2 fig 8a the bilge vortex is above the shaft and the hub cap vortex in the low speed area is below the shaft from the instantaneous vorticity fig 11 at different frame numbers n 60 70 150 155 we can determine that the intensity and vorticity contours of the bilge vortex bv and secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex hcv are time dependent and fluctuating in addition the intensity of the outer boundary of the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex regions changes significantly whereas the core region of the bilge vortex does not change significantly the vorticity fluctuations in the hcv region prove that the hub cap vortex is being shed into the downstream and propeller regions and does not have a fixed core location integrating cfd and spiv data the formation growth development and transmission of bv and hcv for a 76000 dwt panamax bulker were computed the results are presented in figs 21 and 22 the computational predictions time averaged vorticity boundary layer information and iso q surfaces for a 76000 dwt panamax bulker were studied in a previous paper details of the cfd domain mesh boundary conditions turbulence model treatment of free surface and wave damping can be found in wu et al 2017 the predicted wake fields in the propeller region are in good agreement with the available experimental results the results show that the mesh and numerical simulation methods are valid from the time averaged vorticity and velocity boundary layer information at different stations fig 21 we find that the velocity boundary layer 0 0 99u has no region of flow reversal the shear layer develops and its thickness increases and both bv and hcv evolve as the flow moves downstream from the middle to the stern of the ship at stations 3 and 2 the cross flow velocities v w are increasing and directed to the concave hull surface forming a somewhat thick shear layer and bv forms and grows in this region at station 1 in which the hull offset has dramatically changed the cross flow converges in the hollow stern region and develops a large scale vortex as the cross sectional area of the model abruptly decreases the boundary layer that has developed along the hull surface becomes separated due to a large adverse pressure gradient and forms a thick shear layer at station 0 5 in which the hull offset is near the stern bulb flows with lower ake are transferred through the longitudinal bv towards the centre of the hull reducing their velocity and creating local hook shaped structures hcv forms in this station and is shed into the downstream and propeller regions from the stern bulb the boundary layer is similar to that at station 1 in the propeller plane bv hcv and the hook shaped flow pattern maintain their flow structures and are transmitted into the propeller region from the evolution of bv and hcv shown by the iso q surfaces coloured by vorticity fig 22 it appears that the evolution of bv consists of four stages the first is the formation stage located between the middle of the ship and station 3 the other three stages are the growth development and transmission of bv which occur between station 3 and the downstream region fig 22 a 4 conclusions the wake fields in the propeller region of a 76000 dwt panamax bulker model with u shaped stern frame lines have been experimentally investigated in the harbin engineering university towing tank using a dantec dynamics inc skovlunde denmark custom designed underwater spiv system the wake field data include time averaged and instantaneous velocities turbulence characteristics and vorticity information from processing and analysing the experimental data the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the time averaged results for u u and l u obtained from the present spiv experiments exhibit a distinct hook shaped flow pattern at a velocity of u u 0 3 and l u 0 3 and an intense longitudinal bilge vortex appears towards the centre of the hull with a secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex situated below adhering tightly to the hull s longitudinal profile the bilge vortex foci f1 are located at y r 0 5 z r 0 05 the hub cap vortex foci f2 are located at y r 0 215 z r 0 425 and two saddle points s1 at y r 0 1 z r 0 05 s2 at y r 0 4 z r 0 65 develop in the propeller region 2 the instantaneous results obtained from the present spiv experiments display the hook like velocity contours and low kinetic energy ike area of the time averaged flow fields but the instantaneous velocity u u contours and kinetic energy ike u 2 contours are not smooth and time resolved the swirling patterns of the primary bilge vortex bv and the secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex hcv are time dependent and the location of the secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex hcv is not fixed and moves up and down 3 the turbulence characteristics obtained from the present spiv experiments show that the flow in the propeller region has an anisotropic turbulence structure that is typical for most three dimensional turbulent flows the spatial distributions of the turbulence statistics including reynolds stresses and turbulent kinetic energy for the u shaped stern hull have a similar pattern with similar contours of the axial mean velocity u the u hook like spatial distributions of the turbulence statistics are located at the region where the average kinetic energy changes and around the longitudinal bilge vortex 4 the vorticity information obtained from the present spiv experiments shows that there are two sources of vorticity the bilge vortex and the hub cap vortex these were identified by determining the vorticity swirling strength planar 2nd invariant q and lambda 2 criterion corresponding to the time averaged vectors and streamlines the evolution of bv consists of four stages namely formation growth development and transmission the bilge vortex is generated from the ship s hull and is then shed into the propeller plane the vortex shedding around the shaft is from the hub cap vortex the measured results of the wake fields contribute directly to the in depth understanding of the flow characteristics around hulls with high block coefficients and u shaped sterns wake adapted designs of the propeller and energy saving appendages and verification of the underlying theory and numerical simulations 5 limitations of the study and future research recommendations although the time averaged and instantaneous velocity turbulence characteristics and vorticity information in the propeller region of a 76000 dwt panamax bulker have been investigated the present study still has some limitations firstly the design constraints of the existing underwater spiv system fig 2 meant that piv data could only be obtained in the spanwise direction perpendicular to the centreline of the ship model secondly as the existing underwater spiv system is two dimensional with three velocity components 2d 3c only planar vortex structures could be investigated as a result of these limitations it is recommended that further investigations of the time averaged and instantaneous quantities should be conducted in the following areas i 2d 3c piv measurements in other planes ii three dimensional wake field reconstructions using multiple 2d 3c piv measurement data and iii tomographic piv to investigate the wake fields more comprehensively acknowledgments this work was

tank the aim was to identify the flow characteristics around hulls with high block coefficients and u shaped sterns in the spiv tests the time averaged and instantaneous velocity turbulence characteristics and vorticity information were measured in the propeller plane at a froude number of 0 167 the results obtained from the time averaged and instantaneous wake fields show different flow characteristics in the propeller working region the time averaged flow fields clearly illustrate the presence of a bilge vortex hub cap vortex and hook shaped velocity contours the instantaneous flow patterns confirm the hook like velocity contours found in the time averaged flow fields but the instantaneous contours are not smooth and consecutive the swirling patterns of the primary bilge vortex bv and the secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex hcv are found to be time dependent the turbulence characteristics show that the flow in the propeller region has an anisotropic turbulence structure and the spatial distributions of the turbulence statistics including the reynolds stresses and turbulent kinetic energy have a u hook pattern similar to a u shaped stern analysis of the vorticity swirling strength planar 2nd invariant q and lambda 2 criterion reiterates the formation of the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex the formation growth development and transmission of bv and hcv can be described by integrating the spiv data with computational fluid dynamics the experimental results for the time averaged and instantaneous velocity turbulence characteristics and vorticity information are not only useful for understanding the wake fields around ships with high block coefficients and u shaped sterns but also enable the numerical verification of the computational fluid dynamics keywords stereo particle image velocimetry towing tank experiment wake fields bilge vortex hub cap vortex hook shaped velocity contours 1 introduction the flow fields around ships and wake

addition the wake fields in the propeller working region vary considerably depending on the hull form and stern type enhancing the hydrodynamic performance of a ship e g ship speed and resistance propulsion manoeuvring hydrodynamic cavitation vibration and noise performance can reduce its operational emissions and running costs while improving the onboard safety and comfort of crew and passengers during voyages measurements of the turbulent wake field at the stern and near wake region combined with an in depth understanding of the flow characteristics contribute directly to the optimization of the hull shape wake adapted designs of the propeller and rudder energy saving appendages and verification of the underlying theory and numerical simulations pitot tubes laser doppler velocimetry ldv and particle image velocimetry piv have commonly been used to measure and characterize flow fields recent developments in lasers and image processing technologies mean that ldv and piv have gradually come to replace pitot tubes which suffer from contact interference during flow field measurements the piv method is widely used to measure flow fields in the wake of ships and propellers piv systems have progressed from 2d to stereoscopic and tomographic approaches using towed model fixed systems yoon et al 2015 in 1997 2d piv was applied in a ship model towing tank for the

aft vortices felli et al 2015 the present study investigates the wake field characteristics of a 76000 dwt panamax bulker particular attention is focused on the time averaged and instantaneous velocity turbulence characteristics and vorticity information in the propeller working region of a hull with a high block coefficient and u shaped stern the wake fields in the propeller region of the hull model were measured by a towed underwater spiv system in the towing tank of harbin engineering university china initially the time averaged and instantaneous velocities of the propeller plane were identified and then turbulence statistics including the turbulent kinetic energy and reynolds stresses were analysed the vorticity information was investigated based on the time averaged and instantaneous vorticity swirling strength planar 2nd invariant q lambda 2 criterion and the evolution of the bilge vortex bv and hub cap vortex hcv integrated with cfd the remainder of this paper is

wherein section 3 1 reports the time averaged velocity fields section 3 2 covers the instantaneous velocity fields and sections 3 3 and 3 4 describe the turbulence characteristics and vorticity information of the flow fields respectively sections 4 and 5 provide a summary of this study and its limitations and recommendations for future research 2 experimental facilities and set up 2 1 facility tests were conducted in the towing tank 108 m long 7 m wide and 3 5 m deep at harbin engineering university china the maximum speed of the towing carriage with a main bridge and sub bridge is 6 5 0 003 m s the four component motion measuring device and piv system used to collect the data were attached to the bridge and sub bridge 2 2 testing model and experimental conditions the model was manufactured in fiberglass geometric details are listed in table 1 the cross sections and test model with local coordinate systems for spiv measurements are shown in fig 1 turbulence stimulators were installed at 5 length between perpendicular lpp intervals away from the forward perpendicular fp to minimize the scaling effect induced by the conflict between froude and reynolds scaling to prevent the ship motion from interfering with the image acquisition the four degrees of freedom were locked the model was painted matte black to minimize laser sheet reflection the origin of the global xyz coordinate system was placed at the crossing point of the fp baseline and hull centreline with the x axis running along the model centreline to downstream y running toward starboard and z upward table 2 presents the measured sections and conditions for piv measurements of the wake fields the flow fields were generally measured at the propeller plane the centre of the propeller plane is located at x 0 0199 y 0 z 0 01644 x x lpp and so on in the global coordinate system whereas the local coordinates are x local 0 y local 0 z local 0 x local x local lpp and so on 2 3 spiv system the spiv system used in this study is a customized stereoscopic underwater piv system for towing tanks dantec dynamics inc skovlunde denmark the submersible piv system comprising the submersible camera modules mirror modules and submersible light sheet unit have two configurations asymmetrical and symmetrical the configuration in the present test is asymmetrical the piv system consists of the following components a piv probe assembled in asymmetrical configuration with streamlined nose and tail b two streamlined struts with consoles and head for supporting the piv probe and for guiding the light and cables to the piv probe c two camera modules with water detection equipped with two flowsense 4m mk ii 12 bit ccd cameras supplied by dantec dynamics inc the cameras are equipped with 85 and 50 mm f 1 8 canon ef lenses the scheimpflug angle focus and aperture can be adjusted through the controller box using dynamic studio software d two camera mirror modules with two mirror sections and open windows the mirror sections for cameras 1 and 2 are equipped with big and small mirrors with mirror angles of 56 and 19 respectively thus the angle between the camera axes and views is 68 and 38 respectively e the light sheet unit containing light sheet optics and a window for the light sheet the adopted laser supply was a dualpower 200 mj 15 hz nd yag laser supplied by litron lasers the arrangement of the spiv system is similar to that described in the literature yoon et al 2015 falchi et al 2014 the spiv setup with test model and the detailed arrangement of the probes in the underwater spiv system are shown in figs 2 and 3 polyamide seeding particles with a diameter of 50 μm dantec dynamics inc were used as the tracer particles for this spiv test approximately 150 g m3 of particles were mixed with the water using a motorized stirrer in the particle seeding device to ensure uniformity of particles in the test region a customized rake shaped pipe was used during the particle seeding process 2 4 calibration and vector field calculation of spiv system the submersible piv system for towing tanks was calibrated using a 400 310 mm2 multilevel dot matrix dantec dynamics calibration target half the markers at the same level as the zero marker the other half in a 2nd level closer to or farther from the viewer see fig 4 before the stereo calibration the multilevel dot matrix calibration target should be installed at the laser sheet plane where the field of views of the two cameras overlap a special tool with a small mirror mounted on the calibration target is used to adjust the position of the calibration target and light sheet accurately the direct linear transform dlt mathematical model dantec dynamics 2015 of dynamics studio was used to describe the affine transform function that describes how the points are transferred from the object coordinates mm of the object space to the image coordinates pixels of the image plane the affine transform function created in the stereo calibration plays an important role in reconstructing the 3d velocity vectors of the spiv process a dantec dynamics calibration refinement was performed to improve the accuracy of the existing stereo calibration using particle images acquired simultaneously from both cameras in the uniform flow measurement condition at test speed without the test model spiv analysis was conducted in batch processes using dantec studio v 6 0 software the field of view was approximately 320 mm 280 mm width height the distance between the piv probe and test model was 1215 mm the acquisition frequency was 7 5 hz in the piv test because of camera performance limitations flowsense 4m mk ii 12 bit ccd cameras 7 5 hz was the highest acquisition frequency possible for the underwater spiv system the velocity vectors were calculated using the adaptive correlation method dantec dynamics 2015 with an initial 128 128 pixel interrogation window and a final 32 32 pixel interrogation window the correlation analysis of images was implemented with two passes using 128 128 64 64 and 32 32 pixel interrogation windows in that order an overlap of 50 among neighbouring interrogation windows was used during the correlation analysis process local neighbourhood validation compared individual vectors to the local vectors in the neighbourhood vector area size 3 3 and any spurious vectors were removed and replaced by vectors calculated through the local interpolation of the vectors present in the area the final spacing of the vector grid of one velocity vector in the time averaged velocity map was 2 45 2 45 mm2 the separation time between two consecutive illuminations of the tracer particles was 400 μs this interval makes sure the maximum particle displacement within 1 4 interrogation window 2 5 uncertainty and convergence analysis of the present spiv system the three main sources of uncertainty in spiv measurements are as follows i image processing and adaptive correlation algorithm errors in the vector field analysis process ii velocity reconstruction to obtain the three component velocity vector fields based on the two planar components and iii piv light sheet registration errors with the calibration target in this study the simplified method adopted for the uncertainty and convergence of the present spiv system is similar to the approach of falchi falchi et al 2014 the bias and peak locking errors were disregarded and only the correlation noise error was estimated in this study formulas were derived to evaluate the root mean square rms error of the three velocity components as a function of the angular displacement between the cameras and the level of correlation noise of the 2c piv fields prasad 2000 the detailed approximation formulas are as follows 1 r m s δ x r m s δ x 1 δ x 2 cos θ 2 2 cos θ 1 2 sin θ 2 θ 1 2 r m s δ y r m s δ x 1 δ x 2 2 3 r m s δ z r m s δ x 1 δ x 2 sin θ 2 2 sin θ 1 2 sin θ 2 θ 1 where δx 1 and δx 2 are the in disc displacements along the x axis θ 1 and θ 2 are the inclinations between the camera axes and views θ 1 68 θ 2 38 for the utilized spiv system δx δy and δz are the displacements in the absolute reference frame and rms is a conservative value of the root mean square particle image displacement which is used as an indicator for this kind of error u v and w are the velocities in the x y and z coordinates respectively the percentage uncertainty in the instantaneous velocities derived from approximated formulas and excluding the effect of the statistically converged velocity fields can be expressed as follows 4 r m s u u r m s δ x δ x r m s δ t δ t where rms δx δx represents the error due to the processing software the processing error rms δx 1 δx 2 of stereo recombination is 0 1 pixels according to the literature raffel et al 2007 adrian and westerweel 2011 and the mean displacement of the tracer particles in the time interval δt is about 7 pixels rms δt δt represents the error due to the electronic time jitter the jitter for the actual laser used in this study was 1 ns and the actual time interval δt between the two pulses was 400 μs for the dantec spiv equipment used here substituting these values into eq 4 gives rms u u 2 492 rms v u 1 014 rms w u 3 179 as the estimated error for the instantaneous velocity field is approximately 3 of the mean velocity a conservative approximation for the global uncertainty of the current piv measurements would be up to 4 of the estimated flow velocity this is similar to the estimate given by prasad 2000 for the statistical convergence considerations the following section discusses the relationship between the number of required samples n and the desired statistical quantity as well as the corresponding confidence interval according to the literature of random data bendat and piersol 1986 2010 the velocity samples are assumed to follow a normal distribution the confidence interval is u i z α 2 σ 0 n and the u i conf is z α 2 σ 0 n where u i is the mean free stream velocity in the x y and z coordinates and the digital characteristics of the velocity are as follows variance σ 0 2 is equal to the global uncertainty 0 04 and the standard deviation σ 0 is equal to the rms of the velocity the relationship between the required samples n and the level of precision confidence interval see fig 5 can then be computed as follows 5 n z α 2 2 σ 0 2 u i c o n f 2 where u i conf represents the level of precision viz confidence interval is u i u i c o n f with which the desired statistical quantity is evaluated z α 2 1 96 probability 95 α 0 05 for a two tailed normal distribution is the probability of a normal distribution and σ 0 0 2 is the standard deviation of the velocity a population of 250 double frame images was recorded in the present study and the level of precision of spiv system was approximately 2 5 the confidence interval is u i 2 5 the following relationship can be used to assess the uncertainty on second order statistical moments the rms of the velocity 6 s 1 z α 2 2 n σ 0 s 1 z α 2 2 n where s is the estimated rms value when n 250 and z α 2 1 96 then 0 92s σ 0 1 096s it can be seen that the estimation of the confidence interval is used to evaluate second order statistical moments the uncertainty in the above analysis for these quantities is equal to 17 of the exact value which is close to the value of 12 derived by falchi falchi et al 2014 2 6 parameters of velocity fields a total of 250 instantaneous velocity fields were measured with a single towing carriage run to acquire the time averaged velocity fields theoretically speaking the more pictures the better because of the length limitation of the towing tank we took 250 pairs of images per run similar piv tests at seoul national university towing tank 110 m long 8 m wide and 3 5 m deep and the iihr towing tank of the university of iowa 100 m long 3 m wide and 3 m deep also took around 250 images yoon et al 2015 seo et al 2016 the time averaged parameters were calculated from these n 250 pairs of piv images as follows the time averaged velocity component u i was computed as 7 u i 1 250 n 1 250 u i n the whole flow velocity

velocity fields the time averaged velocity information vectors and streamlines at the propeller plane of a 76000 dwt panamax bulker were obtained through spiv measurements the results are shown in figs 7 and 8 fig 6 illustrates the definition of u and v form hulls ferraro et al 2012 and the u shaped stern frame lines of a 76000 dwt panamax bulker fig 7 illustrates the wake fields in the whole spiv capture region and fig 8 a h illustrates the wake fields in the propeller region which is part of the spiv capture region normalized coordinates y r and z r are used to represent the y and z axes in figs 7 and 8 where r 75 mm is the propeller radius similarly the velocity information shown in figs 7 and 8 is normalized with respect to the ship s velocity u fig 8 a b display the axial flow velocity u u and cross flow vector distribution of the wake fields in the propeller plane across the whole spiv capture region fig 6 shows that the 76000 dwt panamax bulker has u shaped stern frame lines the incident flows that pass by this u shaped stern generate intense bilge vortices labelled bv figs 7 and 8 b f the velocity u u and l u in the propeller plane is affected by these vortices and distinct hook like axial velocity contours labelled a appear when u u 0 3 and l u 0 3 the distortion of these hook shaped contours which were mentioned by lee and kim lee et al 1998 2003 kim et al 2001 is caused by flows with lower average kinetic energy ake fig 8 h labelled d being transferred through an intense longitudinal bilge vortex towards the centre of the hull this causes a reduction in velocity and creates local hook shaped structures a secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex labelled hcv fig 7 b c d fig 8 b f is situated below the bilge vortex and tightly adheres to the hull s longitudinal profile the presence of the hook shaped bilge vortex and counter rotational hub cap vortex has a positive effect on the rotational efficiency of the propeller lee et al 1998 2003 kim et al 2001 fig 8 c d show that the positive and negative velocities correspond to the direction of rotation in the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex and in the region 0 y r 1 0 z r 1 of the velocity w u contours the velocity w u has a regular layered distribution in the region 0 y r 1 1 z r 0 of the velocity w u contours the velocity w u has a u shaped distribution fig 8 e f show the contours and streamlines of s u the streamlined flow is divided into counter clockwise and clockwise flows by the bilge vortex and the hub cap vortex the bilge vortex foci f1 at y r 0 5 z r 0 05 hub cap vortex foci f2 at y r 0 215 z r 0 425 and two saddle points s1 at y r 0 1 z r 0 05 s2 at y r 0 4 z r 0 65 develop in the propeller region the saddle point s1 indicates the upwash flow shear layer merging with the downwash flow shear layer the saddle point s2 indicates the leftwash flow and rightwash flow separating from the up downwash flow shear layer the 0 contour of s u intersection point of the 0 contours of v u and w u in fig 8 c d contains the foci f1 f2 of the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex and also the two saddle points s1 s2 the transverse evolution of u u v u w u s u l u and ake u 2 at z r 0 00 in the propeller region is illustrated in fig 9 the velocities u u and l u gradually increase from the centre of the propeller s axis towards the side of the ship the hook shaped distributions of u u and l u first increase then decrease and finally increase again the area of the plot with a concave distribution is the hook shaped velocity contour distribution region in figs 7 and 8 the velocity v u gradually increases to its maximum at the normalized y location y r 0 35 and then gradually decreases to a negative speed at y r 0 85 the velocity w u gradually decreases from the centre of the propeller s axis towards the side of the ship as a result of the bilge vortex the distribution of s u is concave within the range y r 0 4 0 6 with a minimum velocity at the normalized y location y r 0 5 of magnitude s u 0 02 the disturbance caused by the hook shaped velocity contours and the bilge vortex results in an area of low kinetic energy ake u 2 appearing within the range y r 0 0 7 ake then rises to a maximum at y r 1 the flow characteristics within the wake fields around the propeller region can be further quantified by considering the velocity and ake u 2 profiles along several radii r r 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 fig 10 shows the velocities u u v u w u s u l u and ake u 2 with respect to the circumferential angle θ which runs clockwise from 0 top to 180 data points are taken every 10 data from 180 to 360 are the mirror image of those from 0 to 180 at r r 0 4 and 0 6 the distribution of u u w u s u l u and ake u 2 with respect to θ shows an overall decreasing trend the disturbances of the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex mean that the plots have some slight fluctuations for r r 0 4 these occur at θ 100 and 160 180 for r r 0 6 they occur for θ between 110 140 and 160 180 the distribution of v u with respect to θ is v shaped first decreasing and then increasing at r r 0 8 the plots are located at the outer boundary of the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex regions thus the distributions of u u s u l u and ake u 2 with respect to θ are relatively stable except for some local undulations in u u l u between 10 30 and 160 180 the distribution of v u with respect to θ exhibits strong fluctuations and w u decreases before increasing again clearly affected by the stripe distribution of the w u contours fig 8 d at r r 1 0 the distributions of u u l u and ake u 2 with respect to θ are obviously increasing and v u exhibits strong fluctuations the plot of w u s u decreases increases at first and then increases decreases being affected by the stripe distribution of the w u s u contours fig 8 d e 3 2 instantaneous velocity fields some additional flow field characteristics regarding the instantaneous velocity in the propeller region are now presented fig 11 presents the instantaneous velocity u u cross flow vectors kinetic energy ike u 2 streamline 2nd invariant q and lambda 2 distributions of the wake fields in the propeller region the instantaneous wake fields are different from the time averaged flow fields and some additional vortices are generated in the instantaneous flow structures as there were 250 instantaneous velocity fields in our spiv test it is not feasible to present all of these results in the manuscript in order to show the characteristics of the instantaneous velocity field and the difference between the instantaneous velocity field and the average velocity field the frame numbers n 60 70 are typical flow field moments of developmental stage of the spiv test and the frame number n 150 155 are typical flow field moments of fully developed stages of the spiv test the intervals of the frame number are 10 and 5 for developmental and fully developed stages of the spiv test respectively to a certain extent the selection of this specific frame numbers have certain randomness these instantaneous velocity fields are chosen as representative cases to express the complexity of the instantaneous fields if we select the instantaneous velocity field of the other frame numbers in the corresponding stage the similar flow characteristics can also be illustrated fig 11a presents various quantities captured at frame number n 60 instead of only two large wake vortices bilge vortex and hub cap vortex two foci and two saddle points form in the wake region as shown in the time averaged flow fields figs 7 and 8 two large wake vortices bilge vortex and hub cap vortex three local secondary vortices see red lines and some very small vortices are not present similarly hereinafter with five foci three stable and two unstable smits and lim 2012 perry and chong 1987 eight saddle points and a stagnation point st 1 frank 2002 are present in the propeller region fig 11b shows the instantaneous velocity fields captured at n 70 the instantaneous cross flow vectors streamlines 2nd invariant q and lambda 2 still show two vortices bv and hcv and some small local secondary vortices in the wake region although the ship has moved to a different location than when n 60 fig 11a in addition six foci four stable and two unstable and five saddle points are present in the propeller region when n 70 fig 11c and d presents the instantaneous streamwise flow pattern captured at n 150 and 155 respectively from the instantaneous cross flow vectors streamlines 2nd invariant q and lambda 2 shown in these two frames it is clear that the secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex hcv is situated immediately under the primary bilge vortex bv the size of the secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex increases as the frame number progresses from 150 to 155 in addition the primary bilge vortex bv becomes larger after it absorbs the small local secondary vortices in its vicinity compare n 155 with the swirling patterns shown when n 150 the secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex hcv has moved downward slightly in frame n 155 compared with n 150 this is clear when comparing both the instantaneous cross flow vectors and streamlines between n 150 and 155 as shown in fig 11c and d respectively from the instantaneous velocity u u and kinetic energy ike u 2 contours shown in fig 11 we can observe the hook like velocity contours and low kinetic energy ike area found in the time averaged flow fields however the instantaneous velocity u u and kinetic energy ike u 2 contours are not smooth and time resolved in addition the swirling patterns of the primary bilge vortex bv do not change significantly in different frames the location of the secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex hcv is unfixed and moves up and down it can be inferred that the hub cap vortex forms around the shaft stern bulb and sheds into the downstream and propeller regions the longitudinal shedding pattern of the hub cap vortex is not present in our spiv capture region and further investigation using high speed piv in various planes is recommended to fully resolve the instantaneous flow pattern in the propeller region the transverse evolution of the instantaneous velocity u u and ike u 2 in different frames at z r 0 00 in the propeller region is shown in fig 12 figs 13 and 14 plot the instantaneous velocity u u and ike u 2 profiles respectively with respect to θ along several radii r r 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 the distributions of the instantaneous velocity u u and ike u 2 transverse evolution and circumferential distribution in the different frames are similar to the time averaged distributions as there are no smooth and consecutive disturbances in the hook shaped velocity and ike contours of the evolving swirling patterns of the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex the plots have a different degree of fluctuation the envelope curves shown in figs 10 12 describe the detailed values and locations of these fluctuations 3 3 turbulence characteristic of flow fields the turbulent flow characteristics in the propeller region of a 76000 dwt panamax bulker are now discussed contours of the rms velocities be normalized by u and turbulence statistics be normalized by u 2 including the turbulent kinetic energy and reynolds stresses are presented in fig 15 a c and 16 a g respectively from fig 15 the contours of the rms velocities u rms v rms and w rms which also give the velocity fluctuations u v and w are equal to the square root of the normal stresses fig 16 b d the square root of the normal stress normalized by u represents the turbulent intensity of each velocity component comparing the three normal stresses the streamwise turbulent intensity u u u 2 is different from the other two stresses v v u 2 and w w u 2 in the propeller region lumley and newman lumley and newman 1977 choi and lumley 2001 pope 2005 introduced a new tensor a i j u i u j 2 3 t k e δ i j to quantify the degree of anisotropy of the turbulent flow field the normalized anisotropy tensor which is used extensively is defined as b i j a i j 2 t k e u i u j 2 t k e 1 3 δ i j where δ ij is the kronecker delta δ ij 1 if i j and δ ij 0 if i j another way to quantify the isotropic characteristics of turbulence is described in seo 2016 where the anisotropy is derived from the mean and standard deviation of the reynolds normal stress at a certain location as follows 13 a n i s o t r o p y u u 2 v v 2 w w 2 3 u u v v w w 3 1 if a ij and the anisotropy are zero the turbulence is totally isotropic fig 17 displays the anisotropy b 11 b 22 and b 33 distributions of the wake fields in the propeller plane the normalized anisotropy tensor b 12 b 21 u v 2 t k e b 13 b 31 u w 2 t k e and b 23 b 32 v w 2 t k e is non zero this indicates that the flow in the stern region has an anisotropic turbulence structure which is typical of most three dimensional turbulent flows bradshaw pope 2005 bradshaw 1973 1996 1997 hewitt and vassilicos 2005 has argued that whenever a thin turbulent shear layer experiences an extra rate of strain i e in addition to the usual rate of strain u y strictly s 12 1 2 u y v x the response of the turbulence parameters is an order of magnitude greater than one would expect from an observation of the appropriate extra terms in the mean flow equations of momentum and continuity for a ship with an axisymmetric boundary layer as is being considered here patel and lee said that there are two extra rates of strain e l due to the longitudinal curvature and e t due to the convergence or divergence of the streamlines in planes parallel to the surface associated with the changes in the transverse curvature patel and lee 1979 therefore the anisotropic structure of the wake fields is related to the extra rates of strain associated with flow convergence and divergence around the stern hull form in the propeller region of this 76000 dwt panamax bulker with u shaped stern frame lines the normal stresses are large at the bottom and side regions of the longitudinal bilge vortex behind the propeller boss the bottom and lower side regions of the longitudinal vortex have especially large reynolds normal stresses the spatial distributions of the three turbulent intensities for the u shaped stern hull form have a similar pattern and are similar to the contour lines of the axial mean velocity u shown in fig 8a the kinetic energy exhibits some correlation with both the axial velocity and vorticity contours see section 3 4 note that the region with large turbulent intensity has a hook like shape around the longitudinal bilge vortex the hook like spatial distributions of the turbulence statistics are located at the region where the average kinetic energy changes as shown in fig 8h and some of the turbulence contours are located behind the propeller boss fig 15 the contours of turbulent kinetic energy with the largest values of k 0 05u are similar to those of the streamwise turbulent intensity u u u 2 this is because the largest streamwise normal stress of u u 0 09u is much greater than the maximum of the other two normal stresses v v 6 and w w 1 4 therefore the turbulent kinetic energy is large in the high shear region where the axial velocity component has a large velocity gradient the proportional relation between the reynolds stresses and mean rates of strain which was first proposed by boussinesq in 1877 pope 2005 boussinesq 1877 veerstegmalalasekera 2007 is defined as 14 τ i j ρ u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ρ t k e δ i j 2 ρ υ t s i j 2 3 ρ t k e δ i j where τ ij is the reynolds stress and u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i is the rate of strain tensor u i x j u j x i are the velocity gradients the positive scalar coefficient υ t is the turbulent viscosity also called the eddy viscosity with dimensions m2 s ρ is the density of the fluid because the mean velocity components v and w are much smaller than the axial velocity u their gradients in the x direction i e v x w x the y direction i e w y and the z direction i e v z are relatively insignificant the gradients in the y direction i e u y and the z direction i e u z are relatively significant base on the rate of strain tensor s ij we get s 12 s 21 1 2 u y v x s 13 s 31 1 2 u z w x s 23 s 32 1 2 v z w y therefore the reynolds shear stresses τ 12 ρ u v and τ 23 ρ u w related to the large strain rate s 12 s 21 s 13 s 31 are more significant than the shear stress τ 23 ρ v w related to the strain rate s 23 s 32 we can see the effect of the longitudinal vortex behind the propeller boss on the reynolds shear stresses u v and u w the reynolds shear stresses u v u w and v w have similar hook shape contours in the near wake behind the propeller boss the primary bilge vortex bv and secondary hub cap vortices are surrounded by the hook shape reynolds shear stress contours the reynolds shear stress u v is negative in the propeller region where u y is increasing as is ρ u v and positive in the region where u y is decreasing with a maximum value where the gradient is largest u v 0 04u the reynolds shear stress u w exhibits similar behaviour but is correlated with u z and attains a maximum of u w 0 01u the transverse evolution of the rms velocities and turbulence statistics at z r 0 00 of the propeller region are presented in fig 18 fig 19 shows the turbulence statistics profiles with respect to θ along several radii r r 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 from fig 18 it can be seen that high levels of rms velocity and reynolds normal stresses in the x y and z directions appear along the side regions of the longitudinal bilge vortex and behind the propeller boss from fig 19 at r r 0 4 and 0 6 located within the low ake region labelled d in fig 8 h the overall turbulence statistics with respect to θ are fairly stable at r r 0 8 located at the boundary of the region where ake changes the turbulence statistics with respect to θ exhibit an increasing trend for tke and reynolds normal stresses at r r 1 0 located in the region of changing ake the turbulence statistics with respect to θ have strong fluctuations 3 4 vorticity information of flow fields vorticity information for the propeller region of a 76000 dwt panamax bulker is presented in this subsection fig 20 a d shows contour maps of the vorticity swirling strength adrian et al 2000 planar 2nd invariant q hunt 1988 chong et al 1990 and lambda 2 criterion jeong and hussain 1995 respectively there are two sources of vorticity fig 20a d 21 the bilge vortex strictly the primary bilge vortex and the secondary vortex of the bilge vortex with the same rotation direction and the hub cap vortex the bilge vortex counter clockwise on the starboard clockwise on the port side is generated from the bilge of the ship s hull and sheds into the propeller plane thus the vortex is located around the outer boundary layer u u 0 3 0 6 fig 8a covering a large area the vortex shedding around the shaft is from the hub cap vortex the hub cap vortex clockwise on the starboard counter clockwise on the port side forms inside the inner wake field where u u 0 2 fig 8a the bilge vortex is above the shaft and the hub cap vortex in the low speed area is below the shaft from the instantaneous vorticity fig 11 at different frame numbers n 60 70 150 155 we can determine that the intensity and vorticity contours of the bilge vortex bv and secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex hcv are time dependent and fluctuating in addition the intensity of the outer boundary of the bilge vortex and hub cap vortex regions changes significantly whereas the core region of the bilge vortex does not change significantly the vorticity fluctuations in the hcv region prove that the hub cap vortex is being shed into the downstream and propeller regions and does not have a fixed core location integrating cfd and spiv data the formation growth development and transmission of bv and hcv for a 76000 dwt panamax bulker were computed the results are presented in figs 21 and 22 the computational predictions time averaged vorticity boundary layer information and iso q surfaces for a 76000 dwt panamax bulker were studied in a previous paper details of the cfd domain mesh boundary conditions turbulence model treatment of free surface and wave damping can be found in wu et al 2017 the predicted wake fields in the propeller region are in good agreement with the available experimental results the results show that the mesh and numerical simulation methods are valid from the time averaged vorticity and velocity boundary layer information at different stations fig 21 we find that the velocity boundary layer 0 0 99u has no region of flow reversal the shear layer develops and its thickness increases and both bv and hcv evolve as the flow moves downstream from the middle to the stern of the ship at stations 3 and 2 the cross flow velocities v w are increasing and directed to the concave hull surface forming a somewhat thick shear layer and bv forms and grows in this region at station 1 in which the hull offset has dramatically changed the cross flow converges in the hollow stern region and develops a large scale vortex as the cross sectional area of the model abruptly decreases the boundary layer that has developed along the hull surface becomes separated due to a large adverse pressure gradient and forms a thick shear layer at station 0 5 in which the hull offset is near the stern bulb flows with lower ake are transferred through the longitudinal bv towards the centre of the hull reducing their velocity and creating local hook shaped structures hcv forms in this station and is shed into the downstream and propeller regions from the stern bulb the boundary layer is similar to that at station 1 in the propeller plane bv hcv and the hook shaped flow pattern maintain their flow structures and are transmitted into the propeller region from the evolution of bv and hcv shown by the iso q surfaces coloured by vorticity fig 22 it appears that the evolution of bv consists of four stages the first is the formation stage located between the middle of the ship and station 3 the other three stages are the growth development and transmission of bv which occur between station 3 and the downstream region fig 22 a 4 conclusions the wake fields in the propeller region of a 76000 dwt panamax bulker model with u shaped stern frame lines have been experimentally investigated in the harbin engineering university towing tank using a dantec dynamics inc skovlunde denmark custom designed underwater spiv system the wake field data include time averaged and instantaneous velocities turbulence characteristics and vorticity information from processing and analysing the experimental data the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the time averaged results for u u and l u obtained from the present spiv experiments exhibit a distinct hook shaped flow pattern at a velocity of u u 0 3 and l u 0 3 and an intense longitudinal bilge vortex appears towards the centre of the hull with a secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex situated below adhering tightly to the hull s longitudinal profile the bilge vortex foci f1 are located at y r 0 5 z r 0 05 the hub cap vortex foci f2 are located at y r 0 215 z r 0 425 and two saddle points s1 at y r 0 1 z r 0 05 s2 at y r 0 4 z r 0 65 develop in the propeller region 2 the instantaneous results obtained from the present spiv experiments display the hook like velocity contours and low kinetic energy ike area of the time averaged flow fields but the instantaneous velocity u u contours and kinetic energy ike u 2 contours are not smooth and time resolved the swirling patterns of the primary bilge vortex bv and the secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex hcv are time dependent and the location of the secondary counter rotating hub cap vortex hcv is not fixed and moves up and down 3 the turbulence characteristics obtained from the present spiv experiments show that the flow in the propeller region has an anisotropic turbulence structure that is typical for most three dimensional turbulent flows the spatial distributions of the turbulence statistics including reynolds stresses and turbulent kinetic energy for the u shaped stern hull have a similar pattern with similar contours of the axial mean velocity u the u hook like spatial distributions of the turbulence statistics are located at the region where the average kinetic energy changes and around the longitudinal bilge vortex 4 the vorticity information obtained from the present spiv experiments shows that there are two sources of vorticity the bilge vortex and the hub cap vortex these were identified by determining the vorticity swirling strength planar 2nd invariant q and lambda 2 criterion corresponding to the time averaged vectors and streamlines the evolution of bv consists of four stages namely formation growth development and transmission the bilge vortex is generated from the ship s hull and is then shed into the propeller plane the vortex shedding around the shaft is from the hub cap vortex the measured results of the wake fields contribute directly to the in depth understanding of the flow characteristics around hulls with high block coefficients and u shaped sterns wake adapted designs of the propeller and energy saving appendages and verification of the underlying theory and numerical simulations 5 limitations of the study and future research recommendations although the time averaged and instantaneous velocity turbulence characteristics and vorticity information in the propeller region of a 76000 dwt panamax bulker have been investigated the present study still has some limitations firstly the design constraints of the existing underwater spiv system fig 2 meant that piv data could only be obtained in the spanwise direction perpendicular to the centreline of the ship model secondly as the existing underwater spiv system is two dimensional with three velocity components 2d 3c only planar vortex structures could be investigated as a result of these limitations it is recommended that further investigations of the time averaged and instantaneous quantities should be conducted in the following areas i 2d 3c piv measurements in other planes ii three dimensional wake field reconstructions using multiple 2d 3c piv measurement data and iii tomographic piv to investigate the wake fields more comprehensively acknowledgments this work was
