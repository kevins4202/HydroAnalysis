20730,measurements of wave impacts are important in several fields wave impacts on a ship model can be measured using force panels that are mounted on the model these force panels are a combination of a standard force transducer with a small impact plate on top of the force transducer the static behaviour of the force panel can be easily determined by a static calibration however knowledge of the dynamic behaviour of the force panel is essential for the understanding of the measurement of highly dynamic wave impacts with these force panels this paper presents a methodology to determine the dynamic behaviour of a force panel this approach is not a dynamic calibration but a characterisation of the dynamic behaviour of the force panel the characterisation is based on modal analysis using an instrumented impact hammer relevant theoretical background for the method is briefly discussed all individual steps in the characterisation process such as set up measurement and analysis are clarified and discussed the presented method is used for qualification of force panels in a calibration laboratory and for verification of the force panels that are installed on a model features of the application of force panels measuring actual wave impacts on model scale are discussed keywords wave impact dynamic characterisation force panel modal analysis impact hammer frequency response function coherence function 1 introduction 1 1 wave impacts wave impacts on vessels offshore structures and coastal structures have been a subject of interest for a long time in the past years renewed interest in wave impact assessment has risen for various reasons update of classification society guidelines to calculate the airgap and impact loads on deck of semi submersible platforms dnv gl otg 13 and dnv gl otg 14 the guidelines were modified following the coslinnovator accident in 2015 seabed subsidence combined with sea water level rises due to global warming these result in the decreasing air gap of fixed platforms see fig 1 scharnke et al 2014 scharnke 2019 consequently class societies have released new guidelines installation of offshore large diameter wind turbines in increasingly deeper water chella et al 2012 bunnik et al 2015 lng sloshing in lng tanks bunt and kaminski 2009 bogaert 2018 new design of breakwaters and other coastal structures peregrine et al 2005 bullock et al 2007 assessing the wave impact loads in extreme sea states is an essential part of the design of offshore structures such structures include not only fixed constructions such as gravity based structures gbs and jackets but also floating facilities such as drilling semi submersible drill ships accommodation platforms and productions units for example production facilities such as fpsos or flngs are typically designed to stay on the field for a duration or typically twenty to forty years in such a long period the structure should be able to cope with severe environmental conditions such as 10 000 year storms in such storms significant wave height up of 20 m leading to steep waves and large impact loads are common however the design should be such that the wave impacts that will hit the structure during all those years should not lead to significant structural damages crew injuries or large economic damages not only can the impact vary by the type of structures they act on but also by the type of impact itself the impacts can be in the form of wave in deck loading green water type of loading slamming loads on the hull of ships drummen et al 2014 van essen et al 2019 2020 impact of lng sloshing in lng carriers and tanks bunt and kaminski 2009 bogaert 2018 and impact loads on columns when a wave interacts with a structure the energy transfer that occurs can be very dynamic and violent this can destabilize the structure on short term structure breakdown through extreme loading see fig 1 or on long term structure breakdown through fatigue for structural design of new built structures and structural reassessment of existing platforms it is therefore essential to have an accurate estimate of expected impact loads based on the expected impact loads the structure stiffeners position and size steel plate thickness position of glass windows position of lifeboats etc will be designed accordingly even though numerical tools are getting more powerful these days the design values are still based on model test data model testing remains the option of choice especially in the determination of loading in very non linear breaking waves and it is therefore important to measure the impact forces accurately during model testing 1 2 measuring wave impacts depending on the application and field of interest different aspects of the wave impacts are measured or determined the wave impact measurements can be on real world objects or on scale models of these real world objects in this paper we concentrate on measuring the wave impact force that is exercised on a model for measurement of wave impacts a range of measuring instruments are applied depending on the application and depending on the research question measuring instruments that are generally used for the measurement of various aspects of wave impacts are 1 pressure transducers peregrine et al 2005 bunt and kaminski 2009 fullerton et al 2010 guo et al 2017 2 force panels scharnke 2019 van essen et al 2020 3 load cells slam panels fullerton et al 2010 guo et al 2017 4 pressure mapping systems ramachandran et al 2013 stagonas et al 2016 5 high speed video bunt and kaminski 2009 bogaert 2018 these measuring instruments all have advantages and disadvantages which will not be discussed in this paper wave impacts can be violent with high pressure peaks and high local structural loading forces however more importantly the wave impacts particularly on a model can have a wide frequency bandwidth as a result the measuring instruments should have a frequency bandwidth which is at least equal or preferably larger than the wave impact signal bandwidth most commonly transducers that are used for wave impact measurements like pressure transducers and load cells only have a static calibration and limited information on the transducer s bandwidth or dynamic response even if a bandwidth is provided for a transducer it is usually a general value for a specific model or type of transducer 1 3 the force panel in this paper the application of force panels for measuring wave impact forces is discussed marin prefers force panels for measurement of larger water impacts on scale models this is because the force panel area on model scale corresponds to a full scale area that is suitable for structural design in contrast pressure transducers measure local pressures on a smaller surface area typical 2 mm2 on model scale this smaller surface area and the fact that the pressure transducers are sparser over an area makes it more difficult to interpret the results for structural design the local pressures measured by pressure transducers can be much higher in comparison with the loads measured by force panels this effect is caused by the spatial averaging of the larger area of the force panel in comparison with the smaller pressure transducer the force panel discussed throughout this paper is using on an s beam load cell it has a 50 mm 50 mm model scale plate mounted on the top of the transducer see fig 2 the load cell is a custom designed strain gauge force transducer typical measuring range 400 n the total mass of the plate and transducer is 113 g the force transducers are calibrated according to dkd r 3 3 2010 this calibration process delivers a static calibration of the force transducer without the plate the static calibration will be valid for a certain part of the frequency range as will be shown later the s beam load cell is stiff for bending moments and therefore insensitive for loads which will be introduced when an impact hits the force panel in an asymmetrical way in some cases accelerometers are mounted on the back of the force panel plate as can be seen in fig 2 typically a measurement set up can consist of between 40 and 80 force panels mounted in several matrix arrangements on a structure as is shown in fig 2 the combination of the plate and the force transducer acts as a second order mechanical system a mass spring damper system fig 3 shows a bode plot of a typical second order system the magnitude part of the bode plot shows three distinct sections 1 at low frequencies the magnitude is constant 2 at the resonance frequency a clear peak 3 at higher frequencies the magnitude decreases these three sections can be regarded as the desired behaviour of the force panel in the frequency domain 1 at low frequencies the magnitude is within limits constant this means that for the low frequencies the static calibration is valid this part is called the static calibration bandwidth throughout this paper 2 the frequency at which the resonance peak occurs is an indication of the useful bandwidth of the force panel this is the frequency range of the transducer without exciting the resonance peak the frequency content of the wave impact should be lower than the useful bandwidth of the force panel otherwise the wave impact will excite the force panel at its resonance frequency this will result in a strong ringing behaviour of the force panel at the resonance frequency 3 after the resonance peak the magnitude decreases rapidly 1 4 dynamic calibration versus dynamic characterisation the standard calibration of transducers delivers a calibration that is only valid for static measurements to understand the dynamic behaviour of a transducer a dynamic calibration or dynamic characterisation is required the dynamic calibration should be a traceable calibration as is the case for static calibrations vlajic and chijioke 2017 2018 the existing dynamic calibration methods for force or pressure transducers fall into three categories fujii 2006 kobusch et al 2007 2015 1 impact or shock excitation 2 sinusoidal excitation 3 step force excitation the calibration method that is appropriate for force panels is the impact excitation method due to its similarity to the actual expected wave impact measurement impact calibration methods where force panels or pressure transducers impact in water have been performed using a wedge or a cone see for examples of this impact excitation method bunt and bouvy 2011 spencer et al 2014 and lian et al 2015 to reliably perform dynamic calibrations these methods require a large mechanical system furthermore only a limited number of transducers can be calibrated using these techniques due to time and cost constraints the levitation mass method fujii 2006 is an alternative impact calibration method for force transducers the main advantage here is that there is no reference force transducer needed the excitation force is derived from the product of a moving mass and its acceleration the acceleration of the mass is measured using an optical inferometer one of the disadvantages is that this method requires a large and complex set up an alternative method to the previous impact calibration method is the hopkinson bar technique nuffel et al 2012 this technique also requires a large mechanical set up the previously mentioned impact calibration methods are all complex and are not cost effective for providing a dynamic calibration for a limited number of force panels furthermore the complex impact calibration methods cannot be easily used for the verification of the transducers that are installed on the model a more straightforward and cost effective method for dynamic characterisation is exploiting system identification this method using a model based approach is called model based calibration see kobusch et al 2015 and vlajic and chijioke 2018 as mentioned before the behaviour of the force panel can be approximated by a second order mechanical system the system identification for this second order system can be performed using modal analysis brown et al 2015 sek 2016 wren 2016 the method described in this paper based on modal analysis is not a model based calibration method but a method to describe the dynamic behaviour of the force panel dynamic characterisation the characterisation method is not as complex as the previously mentioned dynamic calibration methods and can therefore not only be used for the dynamic characterisation of a transducer but also for the verification of the transducer when mounted on the support structure on the model 2 dynamic characterisation by means of modal analysis 2 1 introduction modal analysis can be used to describe the dynamic behaviour of the force panel modal analysis is the study of the dynamic properties of systems in the frequency domain a typical example is testing structures under forced excitation there are generally two different methods to perform modal analysis the first method uses a shaker that excites the device under test dut either harmonically or with white noise the second method uses an impact hammer or similar device to excite the dut with an impact in this paper the hammer impact method is used an instrumented impact hammer is used to excite the force panel the excitation force is measured with the transducer imbedded in the hammer head and the response force is measured with the force transducer that is part of the force panel the aim is to determine parameters like the static calibration bandwidth the useful bandwidth and the resonance frequency of the force panel the theory and methodology behind the modal analysis is well documented in the references agilent 2000 brown et al 2015 sek 2016 wren 2016 and is only briefly presented in this paper the modal analysis presented here is based on multiple degrees of freedom parameter model the force panel will approximately act as a single degree of freedom parameter model for the primary mode shape other mode shapes of the force panel like bending and rotation see section 2 1 are present but can be neglected when the impacts are perpendicular to the force plate all impact measurements will be with fixed boundary conditions the force panel is mounted rigidly on a frame as compared to a free suspension set up the different modal contributions can be determined by inspecting a frequency response function in the following sections the different elements of the modal analysis are discussed 2 2 force panel mode shape estimation using fem analysis using the finite element method module within autodesk inventor a motion analysis was made of the force panel the different mode shapes of the force panel are listed in table 1 accompanied by an estimation of the resonance frequency only the first four mode shapes are listed here definition of the coordinate system x axis perpendicular to the plate of the force panel pointing upward yz plane parallel to the plane of the plate the first two mode shapes are rotations around axes in the yz plane that could be excited during the hammer impacts when the impacts are not centred on the force plate due to the high stiffness of the load cell for bending modes these resonance frequencies will only result in very small signal levels of the load cell the third mode shape is unlikely to be excited by an impact in the x direction because it is a rotation around the x axis the fourth mode shape is in the same direction as the sensitivity axis of the load cell this mode shape at a resonance frequency of 2060 hz will strongly affect the signal output of de load cell when excited fig 4 shows the movement plot for the fourth mode shape it must be pointed out that fem analysis is a useful tool to confirm the results of the measurements and give an indication of the dynamic behaviour but due to the typically limited knowledge of the materials used and the uncertainty of the material parameters the fem analysis will not be able to supersede a measurement the result of the fem analysis is that an expected range of the resonance frequency of the force panel is available around 2 khz 2 3 the instrumented impact hammer two important choices must be made when an impact hammer is used for excitation hammer mass and tip stiffness these two parameters determine the duration of the impact and therefore the frequency content of the excitation the frequency content of the excitation signal should be adequate to excite the relevant modes of the dut in the frequency range of interest the fem analysis of the force plate showed that the dominant mode shape of the force panels is in the range of 2 khz see section 2 1 therefore the impact hammer should be able to excite the force panel over the full frequency range of at least 0 hz 2 khz the impact hammer that is used for exciting the force panel is the dytran type 5800 b2 see fig 5 dytran 2019 this model has a 100 g head additional mass pieces can be attached to the hammer head the hammer contains a piezoelectric force transducer that is acceleration compensated the different impact tips that were used during the modal analysis are model 6250 ps soft plastic tip model 6250p plastic tip and model 6250a aluminium tip see fig 5 the maximum load allowed for the piezoelectric force transducer in this impact hammer is 220 n this value is in the range of the transducers that are used for the force panel the average pulse duration and the estimated maximum bandwidth when applying the three different hammer tips are as follows brown et al 2015 dytran 2019 1 soft plastic tip pulse duration 3 3 ms frequency bandwidth 0 hz 600 hz 2 plastic tip pulse duration 0 5 ms frequency bandwidth 0 hz to 2 3 khz 3 aluminium tip pulse duration 0 2 ms frequency bandwidth 0 hz to 6 8 khz for the impact shapes and frequency bandwidth see fig 5 the dytran impact hammer in combination with the plastic tip can provide an impact for testing the force panels with a frequency bandwidth of 0 hz 3 khz the aluminium tip will provide a larger frequency bandwidth as can be seen in fig 5 however it can overload or saturate the response signal measurement 2 4 the frequency response function the frequency response function frf is the mathematical representation of the relationship between the input excitation in time domain x t in frequency domain x jω and the output response in time domain y t in frequency domain y jω of a single input single output system see fig 6 jenkins and watts 1968 bendat and piersol 1980 2010 the frequency response function h jω is defined as the ratio of the complex spectrum of the response y jω to the complex spectrum of the excitation x jω 1 h j ω y j ω x j ω in modal analysis the frf can be estimated using one of the following formula see wren 2016 2 h 1 j ω s x y j ω s x x j ω 3 h 2 j ω s y y j ω s x y j ω the frf estimator that is used here is h1 the ratio of the cross spectral density function and the auto spectral density function of the input signal bendat and piersol 1980 h1 is preferred if the output signal is noisy and h2 is preferred if the input signal is noisy wren 2016 the frf is estimated using the tfestimate function in matlab that uses welch s method of overlapped segment averaging estimation welch 1967 to avoid spectral leakage the blackmanharris spectral window is used heinzel et al 2002 the overlap value for averaging of 50 and a taper length of 4096 are empirical values based on the sample frequency of the data acquisition system before the frf is estimated group delay differences between the excitation and response signal should be corrected it is furthermore assumed that the excitation and response signal measurement are synchronised the frf is in this paper presented as a plot showing the magnitude and phase as a function of the frequency schwarz and richardson 1999 the frequency response function can have a variety of names depending on whether the response is measured as displacement velocity acceleration or force schwarz and richardson 1999 lang 2015 1 compliance the stimulus is force the response is displacement 2 mobility the stimulus is force the response is velocity 3 inertance or receptance the stimulus is force the response is acceleration 4 transmissibility the stimulus and the response are the same quantity for instance force using the impact hammer with the force as an input signal and the force from the force panel the stimulus and response are both force the frf in this case is called transmissibility from the frequency response function the following quantities can be observed or derived resonances peaks in the magnitude plot with corresponding 180 phase shift in the phase plot indicate the presence of the natural frequencies of the structure under test anti resonances where the magnitude shows a pronounced minimum in the magnitude spectrum accompanied by a large shift in the phase lang 2015 damping damping is proportional to the width of the resonance peaks the wider the peak the higher the damping mode shape s the different mode shapes frequencies of the mdof system can be derived from the frf it is expected that the excitation signal contain energy in the frequency part of interest to generate a suitable result without an adequate excitation a reliable frf estimation is not possible the reliable part of the magnitude of the frf can be seen when inspecting the coherence function that is explained in the following section 2 5 the coherence function in system analysis it is essential to quantify the relationship between the input and output of the system in statistics this is indicated by the correlation coefficient in the frequency domain it is shown by the coherence function cf the cf quantifies the degree of relationship between two signals or data sets bendat and piersol 1980 the coherence function c xy jω is defined as the ratio of the squared magnitude of the cross spectral density function sxy jω and the product of the auto spectral density functions and sxx jω and syy jω of the signals x t and y t in formula 4 c x y j ω s x y j ω 2 s x x j ω s y y j ω the coherence function is a real valued quantity with values between zero and one a value of one corresponds to a perfect correlation relationship between the signals at the frequency lines in the theoretical case that there is no noise present and the system is a linear and time invariant system the cf is equal to one if x t and y t are completely uncorrelated the cross spectral density function will be zero for all frequencies and the cf will be equal to zero for all frequencies values less than one for the cf are an indication that one of the following conditions exist bendat and piersol 1980 nuij and rijlaarsdam 2014 1 extraneous noise is present in the measurements 2 the system relationship between input x t and output y t is not linear 3 other unmeasured inputs that contribute to the output 4 resolution errors in the spectral density estimates 5 leakage in the spectral estimates 6 resonance or anti resonance 7 time variant system behaviour when the cf is used for the analysis of hammer impacts the deviation of the value of one can be caused by skewed impacts spreading of the hammer impact point over the dut or impact points close to a node point if the cf decreases and approaches zero the estimation of the frf becomes meaningless bendat and piersol 1980 when using the cf it is possible to detect a range of errors in the process of modal analysis furthermore it is an essential instrument to consider which part of the frf is reliable the cf is estimated using the mscohere function in matlab that uses welch s method of overlapped segment averaging estimation welch 1967 to avoid spectral leakage the blackmanharris spectral window is used the same overlap and taper length were applied as in the frf estimation for the estimation of the cf it is important that any mean value of the signal is removed bendat and piersol 1980 the estimation of the coherence function is not straightforward a periodogram based estimation of the coherence function will deliver a value of one for all frequencies only averaging approaches e g welch s method will result in a meaningful coherence function bendat and piersol 1980 nuij and rijlaarsdam 2014 2 6 averaging the frequency response function and coherence function the variability of the impacts and the limited signal length have a strong effect on the estimation of the frf and cf consequently the frf and coherence function show a large variability especially for the higher frequencies in the hammer impact measurements both signals x t and y t will be contaminated by extraneous noise from the transducers and conditioner electronics in the measurement system however it can be assumed that the contaminating noise is uncorrelated with the input and output signals another source for the variability is the impact process itself manually exciting the dut repeatedly with the same force speed impact angle and impact point is problematic the variability in the frf and the cf due to noise and the process can be reduced by averaging over several impacts the averaging is carried out for each frequency point individually the cf is real value function and can easily be average over the valid impacts the frf is a complex value function and can only be averaged over the magnitude and phase respectively 3 practical implementation of the methodology 3 1 application of the dynamic characterisation dynamic characterisation is in this paper used for two different situations 1 the first situation is the qualification of the stand alone force panel extensive impact testing is performed on a limited set of force panels mounted on a rigid frame to classify the specific type of force panel the process of exciting the force panel with the impact hammer can be closely monitored and controlled the result of the quantification process is a data sheet with the static calibration and the dynamic characterisation of the force panel type 2 the second situation is the verification of the force panel mounted on a model structure see fig 2 the purpose is to verify that all force panels function in accordance with the datasheet of the force panel as determined in the qualification process the verification process should reveal any force plate mounting or model structure related resonances ringing that will influence the force panel response the bandwidth measured by the force panel is in accordance with the expected signal bandwidth during the model tests the static calibration that is used is correct and the dynamic characterisation from the data sheet can be verified both applications of the dynamic characterisation can be captured in a flow chart a flow chart for the qualification of the force panel see fig 7 and a flow chart for the verification of the force panel when mounted on a structure see fig 8 in the following sections the application of the dynamic characterisation is further explained 3 2 applying the modal analysis method the following general rules for the correct application of the modal analysis method are applied 1 the hammer impact force level should firstly be high enough to excite the relevant mode shapes and should secondly not overload the impact hammer or the force transducers in the force panels 2 double impacts and double bounces must be avoided during the impact a double impact may occur during testing due to an improper hammer swing sometimes it is not possible to move the hammer away fast enough from a very responsive structure avoiding double impacts should be feasible for the soft tip and the plastic tip for the aluminium tip this is a challenge the use of the aluminium tip should be avoided for handheld impact tests 3 the response signals should decay before the next excitation 4 for qualification measure a set of at least twenty impacts to be able to disregard the occasional invalid impact for the verification a set of five to ten valid impact is sufficient 5 during verification use the hammer tip that will have the bandwidth that matches the expected wave impact type during the actual model tests for green water impacts use the soft plastic tip and for the more dynamic wave impacts use the plastic tip 6 when using the soft tip or the plastic tip a sample frequency of at least 19 2 khz is to be used for the aluminium tip use higher sample frequencies at least 50 khz 7 the quality of the individual impact and the whole impacting process can be established by close inspection of the cf the interpretation of an frf without simultaneous interpretation of the cf might lead to incorrect conclusions see bendat and piersol 1980 an impact is considered valid when it meets the following criteria a no significant ringing in the response signal b no double bounces in the excitation signal c excitation and response signal exceed the empirically determined threshold d excitation and response signal show no artefacts or high noise levels e excitation and response signal show the same pulse shape f there is no second excitation within an empirically determined time window 3 3 data acquisition system measurement of excitation and response signals are performed using the hbm quantumx data acquisition system the maximum sampling frequency of the data acquisition system is 96 khz a general rule of thumb is that the sampling frequency of the data acquisition system should be 5 to 10 times higher than the maximum bandwidth of the signals that are to be measured the expected bandwidth of the soft plastic and plastic tip is 2 khz 3 khz according to section 2 2 consequently a sampling frequency of 19 2 khz with the anti aliasing aa filter at 3 2 khz is adequate for measuring the excitation and response signals for impacts using the aluminium tip a sampling frequency of 96 khz aa filter at 38 khz is advised 3 4 impact hammer usage in section 2 2 it is stated that the combination of hammer mass and hammer tip stiffness are parameters that are important for the duration of the impact and the frequency content of the excitation for this study the hammer mass was not increased with additional mass pieces the effect of different hammer tips was investigated in fig 9 the results of impacts with a soft tip and impacts with a plastic tip are presented in the form of the averaged frf and cf both hammer tips were used on the same type of force panel in addition for both analyses the same number of averaged impacts are used for the frf and cf from the soft plastic tip in fig 9 it can be deduced that 1 the frf shows a resonance peak at 2 khz with the associated phase jump of 180 but the frf is already quite noisy from 1 khz and higher furthermore the magnitude shows an increasing trend that is not expected 2 the frf shows a flat response up until around 700 hz 1 db 3 the cf shows a good coherence up until around 400 hz with a fast decline after 400 hz this means that for frequencies higher than 400 hz the frf estimate is not reliable even at the resonance peak that is clearly shown at 2 khz the cf indicates that the soft plastic tip impact does not contain energy above 400 hz the peak that is shown at 2 khz reaches only a value of 0 6 which is an indication of a low correlation because the excitation and response signals are already close to the noise levels in the measurements at 2 khz the frf will still show a peak but an inspection of the power spectrum of the excitation would show a low power level in the range of 2 khz for the frf and cf from the plastic tip in fig 9 it can be deduced that 1 the frf shows a resonance peak at 2 khz with the associated phase jump of 180 when compared to soft plastic tip the magnitude plot here shows the declining trend after the resonance peak as would be expected from a second order system 2 the frf shows a flat response up until 700 hz 1 db this would be the static calibration bandwidth 3 the cf shows a good coherence close to 1 up until 3 khz which is a clear indication that up until 3 khz the plastic tip impact contains enough energy to excite the resonance frequency above 3 khz the frf is not reliable anymore 4 the cf shows several notches that can be attributed to one of the errors as discussed in section 2 4 the notch at around 800 hz could be attributed to a bending mode shape of the force panel see section 2 1 this will not be further discussed in this paper when the two hammer tips are compared it shows that a resonance peak can be seen in fig 9 for the soft tip however the hammer tip will not excite the mode shape at 2 khz with enough energy to render reliable results this can be derived from the cf where the coherence above 500 hz is low with a small peak around 2 khz the excitation signal for the soft plastic tip does not contain enough energy in the frequencies above 400 hz to generate accurate results above 400 hz without a proper excitation no reliable estimate of the frf is possible in comparison the plastic tip excites the mode shape at 2 khz this can be concluded from the frf in combination with the cf here the coherence is close to one for the resonance frequency this comparison of the two impact hammer tips is a clear indication that the frf should only be interpreted in combination with the cf 3 5 analysis of a single impact in fig 10 the impact hammer excitation and the force panel response are shown for a single impact in the figure a total of six plots are shown these plots allow an evaluation of the excitation and response signals in the time and frequency domain the six plots figure is used to visually analyse each individual impact and decide which impacts are correct and which impacts are to be disregarded the correct impacts are then used for further analysis fig 10 shows information on a single hammer impact and response measurement in both the time domain and in the frequency domain the six plots show the following information 1 upper left plot is the time trace shortly before the impact and shortly after the impact this plot is mainly to visually inspect the quality and magnitude of the impact time window from 2 ms to 18 ms relative to the point in time where the excitation force crosses a threshold 2 upper right plot is the time trace with a large time window in this time window the impact and response signal should be completely diminished the estimation of the frf and cf are performed using the part of the signal that is shown in this plot time window from 20 ms to 500 ms 3 middle left plot shows the magnitude of the frequency response function 4 middle right plot shows the power spectrum of the excitation and response signal 5 bottom left plot shows the phase of the frequency response function 6 bottom right plot shows the cf for all frequency plots in fig 10 the frequency axis is limited to 7 khz due to the sampling rate of 19 2 khz information in spectral plots is available up to 9 6 khz in fig 10 values higher than 3 4 khz are not relevant as can be derived from the coherence plot the cf shows a sharp decline after 2 8 khz this means that the frf above this frequency is not reliable anymore this can also be seen in the phase plot of the frf where the phase shows a large variation which is an indication for noise in the measurement in the power spectrum it can also be seen that the excitation energy is rapidly decreasing above 2 khz the cf shows two significant notches one at around 800 hz and one at 2 5 khz the notch at 800 hz is also visible in the magnitude plot of the frf this can be attributed to a spectral resolution error or another possibility is that the effects are visible of one of the other mode shape of the force panel see section 2 1 where the other mode shapes are listed this has not been further investigated the notch around 2 5 khz is more noticeably in the cf and in the frf 3 6 variability of the excitation fig 11 shows 40 excitation signals from hammering the same panel repeatedly these impacts were carried out using the impact hammer with the plastic tip the threshold for the detection of the impact during the analysis was 130 n the variability of the excitation signal is visible the duration of the impact is 0 6 ms 0 7 ms this is in the same order of magnitude as the pulse duration from the calibration sheet of 0 5 ms the height of the measured impact force ranges from 160 n to over 400 n some of the impacts show a distinct secondary peak around t 1 623 s this is due to a secondary bounce of the impact hammer and these excitation signals are regarded invalid and are ignored in the analysis in some cases the hammer impact will cause the force panel to resonate ringing at its resonance frequency the measured peak of the response force will be significantly higher due to ringing the amplification of the peak will depend on the damping of the force panel see fig 12 for an example of this amplification 4 some aspects of the application of force panels for measuring wave impacts the measurement of wave impacts with force panels mounted on a structure will show in some cases several artefacts in this section a number of these artefacts will be shown the artefacts can be attributed either to undesired behaviour of the force panels or its support structure or to physical phenomena that are present during the sometimes violent wave impact it is important to be able to distinguish between these two sources 4 1 inertia correction on dry force panels and during impact in this example force panels were mounted in the deck box of a floating platform examples of test signals of the measured load on the force panel the impact hammer and a corrected signal of the force panel are presented in fig 12 the correction is carried out using the accelerations measured on the force panel and considering the dry mass of the panel and transducer inertia correction f ma see fig 2 for the force panel with combined accelerometer for a detailed description of this method please refer to scharnke et al 2014 almost no overshoot can be observed for the force panels when hit with the soft plastic tip the rise time of the upward slope is about 670 kn ms at full scale for the impact with the plastic tip a small overshoot of about 15 can be observed in this case the rise time of the presented impact with the plastic tip is about 2500 kn ms at full scale the inertia correction is only effective when the force plate is excited close to the resonance frequency in section 3 4 it was shown that the soft plastic tip would not excite the force panel at the resonance frequency however the plastic tip excitation can excite the resonance frequency with enough energy as is shown in the same section the rise time of the measured wave impact loads is in the same order as the measured impacts from the impact hammer with the soft plastic tip and the plastic tip the inertia correction is done for a selection of actual wave impacts on the same force panels with combined accelerometers these results are presented in fig 13 as can be seen in the figures there is no difference between the measured force and the inertia corrected signals indicating that there is no significant inertia related response exciting of the resonance frequency of the force panel during these impacts in must be noted that the dry mass of panel and transducer was used for the inertia correction during a wave impact however the actual mass is shortly larger due to added mass on the panels during the impact the response of the force panel might therefore be underestimated when using the dry mass for the correction 4 2 oscillations on force measurement signals due to entrapped air in some cases oscillations on a force measurement signal that appear as structural response at first sight can turn out to be oscillations due to entrapped air pockets see fig 14 to distinguish between force panel response and entrapped air pockets the response frequencies must be reviewed carefully and compared to impact hammer tests in addition visual analysis of the impacts through high speed videos can help in detecting entrapped air during an impact see right figure in fig 14 5 discussion this paper presents a methodology to determine the dynamic behaviour of a force panel the methodology is based on modal analysis however it will not deliver the lumped parameters of the second order mechanical system with which the force panel can be modelled nevertheless it will deliver the frequency response function and coherence function from these functions several parameters can be derived that are essential for the characterisation of the dynamic behaviour of the force panel and these parameters are crucial for the application of the force panel the most important parameter of the characterisation is the bandwidth for which the static calibration can be applied this is called the static calibration bandwidth the static calibration bandwidth is defined as the bandwidth for which the averaged magnitude of the frf is within the range 1 db from the unity amplification the static calibration bandwidth can be increased when necessary by using stiffer transducers with a higher resonance peak however stiffer strain gauge transducers have lower sensitivity so a compromise between bandwidth and sensitivity must be made the second parameter is the frequency of the resonance peak this will determine the bandwidth for which the force panel can be applied without exciting the force panel at its resonance frequency these two parameters will determine the response of the force panel to the wave impact when the wave impact bandwidth is smaller than the static calibration bandwidth the force panel will not show any ringing and the static calibration can be applied in the case the wave impact bandwidth is in the range of the resonance frequency of the force panel the signal measured by the force panel will show a ringing response and the measured force amplitude will be amplified by this ringing see section 4 1 the measured response will not fully reflect the real wave impact force and is therefore not as reliable for these situations the wave impact forces can be corrected with an inertia correction to be able to apply this correction the force panel must be equipped with an accelerometer see section 4 1 as mentioned before see section 1 4 the dynamic characterisation using modal analysis is not equal to a dynamic calibration the dynamic characterisation does not deliver a calibration factor that is dependent on the frequency however it provides the information that is needed to describe the dynamic behaviour of the force panels an important issue in calibrations is the traceability of internal calibration standards to international standards for dynamic force measurements traceability is solely based on static calibrations kobusch et al 2007 a common accepted guideline for dynamic force measurements and the corresponding methods for dynamic calibration for force transducers is under development vlajic and chijioke 2017 present a method to develop a dynamic force transfer standard the first step would be to calibrate an impact hammer with a traceable calibration method which in turn is used to calibrate dynamically a force transducer this traceable dynamic calibration would be an important step further then the dynamic characterisation described in this paper modal analysis by means of impact testing is not just hammering away on the intended object it takes knowledge and expertise to get it right avitabile and peres 2012 brown et al 2015 this applies to all aspects of the modal analysis process from the selection of the impact hammer and hammer tip to the measurement set up and the analysis of the impacts 6 conclusions and recommendations 6 1 conclusions the dynamic characterisation of the force panels proves to be a practical tool to describe the dynamic behaviour of the force panel it delivers information on the static calibration bandwidth i e the bandwidth for which the static calibration of the force panel is valid the modal analysis based characterisation method confirms that force panels can measure dynamic forces caused by wave impacts correctly during the measurement of the violent wave impact several artefacts can be present on the measured signal it is important to be able to distinguish between actual physical phenomena and instrumentation artefacts this can only be achieved when the behaviour of the force panel is fully understood as can be seen in section 4 some force panel artefacts can be remedied using the inertia correction during the analysis of the data to inspect and quantify a hammer impact a combination of time domain and frequency domain analysis tools is necessary for the frequency domain the frequency response function and the coherence function are indispensable the frequency response function should only be examined in combination with the coherence function the resonance frequency of 2060 hz found using fem analysis section 2 1 matches the resonance frequency at 2 khz found in sections 3 4 and 3 5 where the frf is estimated the modal analysis method using the impact hammer can be used to characterize and qualify the force panel however importantly the method does not require a complex set up is quite practicable and can therefore be used to verify the correct functioning of the force panels mounted on a model structure 6 2 recommendations the dynamic characterisation using modal analysis as a method is implemented the next step would be to improve and refine the method the following improvements could made 1 the modal analysis can be improved by improving the impacting process especially for the qualification situation the impact hammer with the tip with the maximal bandwidth should be used in this case this would be the aluminium tip however performing impacts manually with the aluminium tip is very challenging if not impracticable brown et al 2015 to improve the impacting process with the aluminium tip it is suggested to us a mechanical frame which incorporates a pendulum and mechanical fixture for the force panel then the hammer swing can be tuned to have a valid impact and no double bounces furthermore the impact process can be performed with better repeatability and less variability using the pendulum 2 the estimation of the frequency response function and coherence function can be further improved by comparing different estimators use different parameters for the spectral estimation process and applying extended spectral analysis techniques an interesting method to improve the estimation of frf and cf is presented by brandt and brincker 2010 they propose an optimization algorithm that selects the optimum impacts from a set of impacts the current estimation is based on the welch method of overlapping segments welch 1967 an alternative method is the mvdr approach benesty 2005 3 furthermore the influence of the aa filtering aa filter type and aa filter frequency when measuring the signals is not fully investigated after the improvement of the method for instance the imperfections in the estimation of the frf and cf should diminish and only the force panel behaviour should be shown another important step in acceptance of the method would be the estimation of the confidence limits of the estimated frequency response function and coherence function jenkins and watts 1968 bendat and piersol 1980 2010 this would be an indication of the quality of the process and the results furthermore an uncertainty analysis should be applied to the parameters that are estimated during the modal analysis when inspecting figs 9 and 10 is can be seen that the spectral resolution is 46 9 hz and 23 4 hz respectively this is due to the spectral bin size used in the estimation of the frf and cf this bin size is a first indication of the uncertainty of the estimation of the resonance frequency determined using the frf the force panel described in this paper has a relatively large 50 mm 50 mm frontal plate compared to the pressure transducers used for wave impact measurement currently smaller transducers with greater stiffness are under investigation this will reduce the frontal plate size resulting in both a higher resonance frequency and a larger static calibration bandwidth with the higher resonance frequency the amplification or ringing can be avoided this higher resonance frequency will come at the cost of sensitivity and resolution and might introduce larger bending moments of the transducer these bending modes will possibly introduce mode shapes at frequencies within the static calibration bandwidth which cannot be neglected the application of smaller and stiffer transducers needs to be carefully investigated the necessary tools to characterize dynamically the force panel built with these new transducers are available the methodology presented in this paper functions straightforward for force panels with relatively small mass for force panels with larger mass the qualification will be more complicated in that case the rigid mounting of the force panel is more complex furthermore the accelerations of the force panel during the impact will have to be considered for a correct qualification credit authorship

20730,measurements of wave impacts are important in several fields wave impacts on a ship model can be measured using force panels that are mounted on the model these force panels are a combination of a standard force transducer with a small impact plate on top of the force transducer the static behaviour of the force panel can be easily determined by a static calibration however knowledge of the dynamic behaviour of the force panel is essential for the understanding of the measurement of highly dynamic wave impacts with these force panels this paper presents a methodology to determine the dynamic behaviour of a force panel this approach is not a dynamic calibration but a characterisation of the dynamic behaviour of the force panel the characterisation is based on modal analysis using an instrumented impact hammer relevant theoretical background for the method is briefly discussed all individual steps in the characterisation process such as set up measurement and analysis are clarified and discussed the presented method is used for qualification of force panels in a calibration laboratory and for verification of the force panels that are installed on a model features of the application of force panels measuring actual wave impacts on model scale are discussed keywords wave impact dynamic characterisation force panel modal analysis impact hammer frequency response function coherence function 1 introduction 1 1 wave impacts wave impacts on vessels offshore structures and coastal structures have been a subject of interest for a long time in the past years renewed interest in wave impact assessment has risen for various reasons update of classification society guidelines to calculate the airgap and impact loads on deck of semi submersible platforms dnv gl otg 13 and dnv gl otg 14 the guidelines were modified following the coslinnovator accident in 2015 seabed subsidence combined with sea water level rises due to global warming these result in the decreasing air gap of fixed platforms see fig 1 scharnke et al 2014 scharnke 2019 consequently class societies have released new guidelines installation of offshore large diameter wind turbines in increasingly deeper water chella et al 2012 bunnik et al 2015 lng sloshing in lng tanks bunt and kaminski 2009 bogaert 2018 new design of breakwaters and other coastal structures peregrine et al 2005 bullock et al 2007 assessing the wave impact loads in extreme sea states is an essential part of the design of offshore structures such structures include not only fixed constructions such as gravity based structures gbs and jackets but also floating facilities such as drilling semi submersible drill ships accommodation platforms and productions units for example production facilities such as fpsos or flngs are typically designed to stay on the field for a duration or typically twenty to forty years in such a long period the structure should be able to cope with severe environmental conditions such as 10 000 year storms in such storms significant wave height up of 20 m leading to steep waves and large impact loads are common however the design should be such that the wave impacts that will hit the structure during all those years should not lead to significant structural damages crew injuries or large economic damages not only can the impact vary by the type of structures they act on but also by the type of impact itself the impacts can be in the form of wave in deck loading green water type of loading slamming loads on the hull of ships drummen et al 2014 van essen et al 2019 2020 impact of lng sloshing in lng carriers and tanks bunt and kaminski 2009 bogaert 2018 and impact loads on columns when a wave interacts with a structure the energy transfer that occurs can be very dynamic and violent this can destabilize the structure on short term structure breakdown through extreme loading see fig 1 or on long term structure breakdown through fatigue for structural design of new built structures and structural reassessment of existing platforms it is therefore essential to have an accurate estimate of expected impact loads based on the expected impact loads the structure stiffeners position and size steel plate thickness position of glass windows position of lifeboats etc will be designed accordingly even though numerical tools are getting more powerful these days the design values are still based on model test data model testing remains the option of choice especially in the determination of loading in very non linear breaking waves and it is therefore important to measure the impact forces accurately during model testing 1 2 measuring wave impacts depending on the application and field of interest different aspects of the wave impacts are measured or determined the wave impact measurements can be on real world objects or on scale models of these real world objects in this paper we concentrate on measuring the wave impact force that is exercised on a model for measurement of wave impacts a range of measuring instruments are applied depending on the application and depending on the research question measuring instruments that are generally used for the measurement of various aspects of wave impacts are 1 pressure transducers peregrine et al 2005 bunt and kaminski 2009 fullerton et al 2010 guo et al 2017 2 force panels scharnke 2019 van essen et al 2020 3 load cells slam panels fullerton et al 2010 guo et al 2017 4 pressure mapping systems ramachandran et al 2013 stagonas et al 2016 5 high speed video bunt and kaminski 2009 bogaert 2018 these measuring instruments all have advantages and disadvantages which will not be discussed in this paper wave impacts can be violent with high pressure peaks and high local structural loading forces however more importantly the wave impacts particularly on a model can have a wide frequency bandwidth as a result the measuring instruments should have a frequency bandwidth which is at least equal or preferably larger than the wave impact signal bandwidth most commonly transducers that are used for wave impact measurements like pressure transducers and load cells only have a static calibration and limited information on the transducer s bandwidth or dynamic response even if a bandwidth is provided for a transducer it is usually a general value for a specific model or type of transducer 1 3 the force panel in this paper the application of force panels for measuring wave impact forces is discussed marin prefers force panels for measurement of larger water impacts on scale models this is because the force panel area on model scale corresponds to a full scale area that is suitable for structural design in contrast pressure transducers measure local pressures on a smaller surface area typical 2 mm2 on model scale this smaller surface area and the fact that the pressure transducers are sparser over an area makes it more difficult to interpret the results for structural design the local pressures measured by pressure transducers can be much higher in comparison with the loads measured by force panels this effect is caused by the spatial averaging of the larger area of the force panel in comparison with the smaller pressure transducer the force panel discussed throughout this paper is using on an s beam load cell it has a 50 mm 50 mm model scale plate mounted on the top of the transducer see fig 2 the load cell is a custom designed strain gauge force transducer typical measuring range 400 n the total mass of the plate and transducer is 113 g the force transducers are calibrated according to dkd r 3 3 2010 this calibration process delivers a static calibration of the force transducer without the plate the static calibration will be valid for a certain part of the frequency range as will be shown later the s beam load cell is stiff for bending moments and therefore insensitive for loads which will be introduced when an impact hits the force panel in an asymmetrical way in some cases accelerometers are mounted on the back of the force panel plate as can be seen in fig 2 typically a measurement set up can consist of between 40 and 80 force panels mounted in several matrix arrangements on a structure as is shown in fig 2 the combination of the plate and the force transducer acts as a second order mechanical system a mass spring damper system fig 3 shows a bode plot of a typical second order system the magnitude part of the bode plot shows three distinct sections 1 at low frequencies the magnitude is constant 2 at the resonance frequency a clear peak 3 at higher frequencies the magnitude decreases these three sections can be regarded as the desired behaviour of the force panel in the frequency domain 1 at low frequencies the magnitude is within limits constant this means that for the low frequencies the static calibration is valid this part is called the static calibration bandwidth throughout this paper 2 the frequency at which the resonance peak occurs is an indication of the useful bandwidth of the force panel this is the frequency range of the transducer without exciting the resonance peak the frequency content of the wave impact should be lower than the useful bandwidth of the force panel otherwise the wave impact will excite the force panel at its resonance frequency this will result in a strong ringing behaviour of the force panel at the resonance frequency 3 after the resonance peak the magnitude decreases rapidly 1 4 dynamic calibration versus dynamic characterisation the standard calibration of transducers delivers a calibration that is only valid for static measurements to understand the dynamic behaviour of a transducer a dynamic calibration or dynamic characterisation is required the dynamic calibration should be a traceable calibration as is the case for static calibrations vlajic and chijioke 2017 2018 the existing dynamic calibration methods for force or pressure transducers fall into three categories fujii 2006 kobusch et al 2007 2015 1 impact or shock excitation 2 sinusoidal excitation 3 step force excitation the calibration method that is appropriate for force panels is the impact excitation method due to its similarity to the actual expected wave impact measurement impact calibration methods where force panels or pressure transducers impact in water have been performed using a wedge or a cone see for examples of this impact excitation method bunt and bouvy 2011 spencer et al 2014 and lian et al 2015 to reliably perform dynamic calibrations these methods require a large mechanical system furthermore only a limited number of transducers can be calibrated using these techniques due to time and cost constraints the levitation mass method fujii 2006 is an alternative impact calibration method for force transducers the main advantage here is that there is no reference force transducer needed the excitation force is derived from the product of a moving mass and its acceleration the acceleration of the mass is measured using an optical inferometer one of the disadvantages is that this method requires a large and complex set up an alternative method to the previous impact calibration method is the hopkinson bar technique nuffel et al 2012 this technique also requires a large mechanical set up the previously mentioned impact calibration methods are all complex and are not cost effective for providing a dynamic calibration for a limited number of force panels furthermore the complex impact calibration methods cannot be easily used for the verification of the transducers that are installed on the model a more straightforward and cost effective method for dynamic characterisation is exploiting system identification this method using a model based approach is called model based calibration see kobusch et al 2015 and vlajic and chijioke 2018 as mentioned before the behaviour of the force panel can be approximated by a second order mechanical system the system identification for this second order system can be performed using modal analysis brown et al 2015 sek 2016 wren 2016 the method described in this paper based on modal analysis is not a model based calibration method but a method to describe the dynamic behaviour of the force panel dynamic characterisation the characterisation method is not as complex as the previously mentioned dynamic calibration methods and can therefore not only be used for the dynamic characterisation of a transducer but also for the verification of the transducer when mounted on the support structure on the model 2 dynamic characterisation by means of modal analysis 2 1 introduction modal analysis can be used to describe the dynamic behaviour of the force panel modal analysis is the study of the dynamic properties of systems in the frequency domain a typical example is testing structures under forced excitation there are generally two different methods to perform modal analysis the first method uses a shaker that excites the device under test dut either harmonically or with white noise the second method uses an impact hammer or similar device to excite the dut with an impact in this paper the hammer impact method is used an instrumented impact hammer is used to excite the force panel the excitation force is measured with the transducer imbedded in the hammer head and the response force is measured with the force transducer that is part of the force panel the aim is to determine parameters like the static calibration bandwidth the useful bandwidth and the resonance frequency of the force panel the theory and methodology behind the modal analysis is well documented in the references agilent 2000 brown et al 2015 sek 2016 wren 2016 and is only briefly presented in this paper the modal analysis presented here is based on multiple degrees of freedom parameter model the force panel will approximately act as a single degree of freedom parameter model for the primary mode shape other mode shapes of the force panel like bending and rotation see section 2 1 are present but can be neglected when the impacts are perpendicular to the force plate all impact measurements will be with fixed boundary conditions the force panel is mounted rigidly on a frame as compared to a free suspension set up the different modal contributions can be determined by inspecting a frequency response function in the following sections the different elements of the modal analysis are discussed 2 2 force panel mode shape estimation using fem analysis using the finite element method module within autodesk inventor a motion analysis was made of the force panel the different mode shapes of the force panel are listed in table 1 accompanied by an estimation of the resonance frequency only the first four mode shapes are listed here definition of the coordinate system x axis perpendicular to the plate of the force panel pointing upward yz plane parallel to the plane of the plate the first two mode shapes are rotations around axes in the yz plane that could be excited during the hammer impacts when the impacts are not centred on the force plate due to the high stiffness of the load cell for bending modes these resonance frequencies will only result in very small signal levels of the load cell the third mode shape is unlikely to be excited by an impact in the x direction because it is a rotation around the x axis the fourth mode shape is in the same direction as the sensitivity axis of the load cell this mode shape at a resonance frequency of 2060 hz will strongly affect the signal output of de load cell when excited fig 4 shows the movement plot for the fourth mode shape it must be pointed out that fem analysis is a useful tool to confirm the results of the measurements and give an indication of the dynamic behaviour but due to the typically limited knowledge of the materials used and the uncertainty of the material parameters the fem analysis will not be able to supersede a measurement the result of the fem analysis is that an expected range of the resonance frequency of the force panel is available around 2 khz 2 3 the instrumented impact hammer two important choices must be made when an impact hammer is used for excitation hammer mass and tip stiffness these two parameters determine the duration of the impact and therefore the frequency content of the excitation the frequency content of the excitation signal should be adequate to excite the relevant modes of the dut in the frequency range of interest the fem analysis of the force plate showed that the dominant mode shape of the force panels is in the range of 2 khz see section 2 1 therefore the impact hammer should be able to excite the force panel over the full frequency range of at least 0 hz 2 khz the impact hammer that is used for exciting the force panel is the dytran type 5800 b2 see fig 5 dytran 2019 this model has a 100 g head additional mass pieces can be attached to the hammer head the hammer contains a piezoelectric force transducer that is acceleration compensated the different impact tips that were used during the modal analysis are model 6250 ps soft plastic tip model 6250p plastic tip and model 6250a aluminium tip see fig 5 the maximum load allowed for the piezoelectric force transducer in this impact hammer is 220 n this value is in the range of the transducers that are used for the force panel the average pulse duration and the estimated maximum bandwidth when applying the three different hammer tips are as follows brown et al 2015 dytran 2019 1 soft plastic tip pulse duration 3 3 ms frequency bandwidth 0 hz 600 hz 2 plastic tip pulse duration 0 5 ms frequency bandwidth 0 hz to 2 3 khz 3 aluminium tip pulse duration 0 2 ms frequency bandwidth 0 hz to 6 8 khz for the impact shapes and frequency bandwidth see fig 5 the dytran impact hammer in combination with the plastic tip can provide an impact for testing the force panels with a frequency bandwidth of 0 hz 3 khz the aluminium tip will provide a larger frequency bandwidth as can be seen in fig 5 however it can overload or saturate the response signal measurement 2 4 the frequency response function the frequency response function frf is the mathematical representation of the relationship between the input excitation in time domain x t in frequency domain x jω and the output response in time domain y t in frequency domain y jω of a single input single output system see fig 6 jenkins and watts 1968 bendat and piersol 1980 2010 the frequency response function h jω is defined as the ratio of the complex spectrum of the response y jω to the complex spectrum of the excitation x jω 1 h j ω y j ω x j ω in modal analysis the frf can be estimated using one of the following formula see wren 2016 2 h 1 j ω s x y j ω s x x j ω 3 h 2 j ω s y y j ω s x y j ω the frf estimator that is used here is h1 the ratio of the cross spectral density function and the auto spectral density function of the input signal bendat and piersol 1980 h1 is preferred if the output signal is noisy and h2 is preferred if the input signal is noisy wren 2016 the frf is estimated using the tfestimate function in matlab that uses welch s method of overlapped segment averaging estimation welch 1967 to avoid spectral leakage the blackmanharris spectral window is used heinzel et al 2002 the overlap value for averaging of 50 and a taper length of 4096 are empirical values based on the sample frequency of the data acquisition system before the frf is estimated group delay differences between the excitation and response signal should be corrected it is furthermore assumed that the excitation and response signal measurement are synchronised the frf is in this paper presented as a plot showing the magnitude and phase as a function of the frequency schwarz and richardson 1999 the frequency response function can have a variety of names depending on whether the response is measured as displacement velocity acceleration or force schwarz and richardson 1999 lang 2015 1 compliance the stimulus is force the response is displacement 2 mobility the stimulus is force the response is velocity 3 inertance or receptance the stimulus is force the response is acceleration 4 transmissibility the stimulus and the response are the same quantity for instance force using the impact hammer with the force as an input signal and the force from the force panel the stimulus and response are both force the frf in this case is called transmissibility from the frequency response function the following quantities can be observed or derived resonances peaks in the magnitude plot with corresponding 180 phase shift in the phase plot indicate the presence of the natural frequencies of the structure under test anti resonances where the magnitude shows a pronounced minimum in the magnitude spectrum accompanied by a large shift in the phase lang 2015 damping damping is proportional to the width of the resonance peaks the wider the peak the higher the damping mode shape s the different mode shapes frequencies of the mdof system can be derived from the frf it is expected that the excitation signal contain energy in the frequency part of interest to generate a suitable result without an adequate excitation a reliable frf estimation is not possible the reliable part of the magnitude of the frf can be seen when inspecting the coherence function that is explained in the following section 2 5 the coherence function in system analysis it is essential to quantify the relationship between the input and output of the system in statistics this is indicated by the correlation coefficient in the frequency domain it is shown by the coherence function cf the cf quantifies the degree of relationship between two signals or data sets bendat and piersol 1980 the coherence function c xy jω is defined as the ratio of the squared magnitude of the cross spectral density function sxy jω and the product of the auto spectral density functions and sxx jω and syy jω of the signals x t and y t in formula 4 c x y j ω s x y j ω 2 s x x j ω s y y j ω the coherence function is a real valued quantity with values between zero and one a value of one corresponds to a perfect correlation relationship between the signals at the frequency lines in the theoretical case that there is no noise present and the system is a linear and time invariant system the cf is equal to one if x t and y t are completely uncorrelated the cross spectral density function will be zero for all frequencies and the cf will be equal to zero for all frequencies values less than one for the cf are an indication that one of the following conditions exist bendat and piersol 1980 nuij and rijlaarsdam 2014 1 extraneous noise is present in the measurements 2 the system relationship between input x t and output y t is not linear 3 other unmeasured inputs that contribute to the output 4 resolution errors in the spectral density estimates 5 leakage in the spectral estimates 6 resonance or anti resonance 7 time variant system behaviour when the cf is used for the analysis of hammer impacts the deviation of the value of one can be caused by skewed impacts spreading of the hammer impact point over the dut or impact points close to a node point if the cf decreases and approaches zero the estimation of the frf becomes meaningless bendat and piersol 1980 when using the cf it is possible to detect a range of errors in the process of modal analysis furthermore it is an essential instrument to consider which part of the frf is reliable the cf is estimated using the mscohere function in matlab that uses welch s method of overlapped segment averaging estimation welch 1967 to avoid spectral leakage the blackmanharris spectral window is used the same overlap and taper length were applied as in the frf estimation for the estimation of the cf it is important that any mean value of the signal is removed bendat and piersol 1980 the estimation of the coherence function is not straightforward a periodogram based estimation of the coherence function will deliver a value of one for all frequencies only averaging approaches e g welch s method will result in a meaningful coherence function bendat and piersol 1980 nuij and rijlaarsdam 2014 2 6 averaging the frequency response function and coherence function the variability of the impacts and the limited signal length have a strong effect on the estimation of the frf and cf consequently the frf and coherence function show a large variability especially for the higher frequencies in the hammer impact measurements both signals x t and y t will be contaminated by extraneous noise from the transducers and conditioner electronics in the measurement system however it can be assumed that the contaminating noise is uncorrelated with the input and output signals another source for the variability is the impact process itself manually exciting the dut repeatedly with the same force speed impact angle and impact point is problematic the variability in the frf and the cf due to noise and the process can be reduced by averaging over several impacts the averaging is carried out for each frequency point individually the cf is real value function and can easily be average over the valid impacts the frf is a complex value function and can only be averaged over the magnitude and phase respectively 3 practical implementation of the methodology 3 1 application of the dynamic characterisation dynamic characterisation is in this paper used for two different situations 1 the first situation is the qualification of the stand alone force panel extensive impact testing is performed on a limited set of force panels mounted on a rigid frame to classify the specific type of force panel the process of exciting the force panel with the impact hammer can be closely monitored and controlled the result of the quantification process is a data sheet with the static calibration and the dynamic characterisation of the force panel type 2 the second situation is the verification of the force panel mounted on a model structure see fig 2 the purpose is to verify that all force panels function in accordance with the datasheet of the force panel as determined in the qualification process the verification process should reveal any force plate mounting or model structure related resonances ringing that will influence the force panel response the bandwidth measured by the force panel is in accordance with the expected signal bandwidth during the model tests the static calibration that is used is correct and the dynamic characterisation from the data sheet can be verified both applications of the dynamic characterisation can be captured in a flow chart a flow chart for the qualification of the force panel see fig 7 and a flow chart for the verification of the force panel when mounted on a structure see fig 8 in the following sections the application of the dynamic characterisation is further explained 3 2 applying the modal analysis method the following general rules for the correct application of the modal analysis method are applied 1 the hammer impact force level should firstly be high enough to excite the relevant mode shapes and should secondly not overload the impact hammer or the force transducers in the force panels 2 double impacts and double bounces must be avoided during the impact a double impact may occur during testing due to an improper hammer swing sometimes it is not possible to move the hammer away fast enough from a very responsive structure avoiding double impacts should be feasible for the soft tip and the plastic tip for the aluminium tip this is a challenge the use of the aluminium tip should be avoided for handheld impact tests 3 the response signals should decay before the next excitation 4 for qualification measure a set of at least twenty impacts to be able to disregard the occasional invalid impact for the verification a set of five to ten valid impact is sufficient 5 during verification use the hammer tip that will have the bandwidth that matches the expected wave impact type during the actual model tests for green water impacts use the soft plastic tip and for the more dynamic wave impacts use the plastic tip 6 when using the soft tip or the plastic tip a sample frequency of at least 19 2 khz is to be used for the aluminium tip use higher sample frequencies at least 50 khz 7 the quality of the individual impact and the whole impacting process can be established by close inspection of the cf the interpretation of an frf without simultaneous interpretation of the cf might lead to incorrect conclusions see bendat and piersol 1980 an impact is considered valid when it meets the following criteria a no significant ringing in the response signal b no double bounces in the excitation signal c excitation and response signal exceed the empirically determined threshold d excitation and response signal show no artefacts or high noise levels e excitation and response signal show the same pulse shape f there is no second excitation within an empirically determined time window 3 3 data acquisition system measurement of excitation and response signals are performed using the hbm quantumx data acquisition system the maximum sampling frequency of the data acquisition system is 96 khz a general rule of thumb is that the sampling frequency of the data acquisition system should be 5 to 10 times higher than the maximum bandwidth of the signals that are to be measured the expected bandwidth of the soft plastic and plastic tip is 2 khz 3 khz according to section 2 2 consequently a sampling frequency of 19 2 khz with the anti aliasing aa filter at 3 2 khz is adequate for measuring the excitation and response signals for impacts using the aluminium tip a sampling frequency of 96 khz aa filter at 38 khz is advised 3 4 impact hammer usage in section 2 2 it is stated that the combination of hammer mass and hammer tip stiffness are parameters that are important for the duration of the impact and the frequency content of the excitation for this study the hammer mass was not increased with additional mass pieces the effect of different hammer tips was investigated in fig 9 the results of impacts with a soft tip and impacts with a plastic tip are presented in the form of the averaged frf and cf both hammer tips were used on the same type of force panel in addition for both analyses the same number of averaged impacts are used for the frf and cf from the soft plastic tip in fig 9 it can be deduced that 1 the frf shows a resonance peak at 2 khz with the associated phase jump of 180 but the frf is already quite noisy from 1 khz and higher furthermore the magnitude shows an increasing trend that is not expected 2 the frf shows a flat response up until around 700 hz 1 db 3 the cf shows a good coherence up until around 400 hz with a fast decline after 400 hz this means that for frequencies higher than 400 hz the frf estimate is not reliable even at the resonance peak that is clearly shown at 2 khz the cf indicates that the soft plastic tip impact does not contain energy above 400 hz the peak that is shown at 2 khz reaches only a value of 0 6 which is an indication of a low correlation because the excitation and response signals are already close to the noise levels in the measurements at 2 khz the frf will still show a peak but an inspection of the power spectrum of the excitation would show a low power level in the range of 2 khz for the frf and cf from the plastic tip in fig 9 it can be deduced that 1 the frf shows a resonance peak at 2 khz with the associated phase jump of 180 when compared to soft plastic tip the magnitude plot here shows the declining trend after the resonance peak as would be expected from a second order system 2 the frf shows a flat response up until 700 hz 1 db this would be the static calibration bandwidth 3 the cf shows a good coherence close to 1 up until 3 khz which is a clear indication that up until 3 khz the plastic tip impact contains enough energy to excite the resonance frequency above 3 khz the frf is not reliable anymore 4 the cf shows several notches that can be attributed to one of the errors as discussed in section 2 4 the notch at around 800 hz could be attributed to a bending mode shape of the force panel see section 2 1 this will not be further discussed in this paper when the two hammer tips are compared it shows that a resonance peak can be seen in fig 9 for the soft tip however the hammer tip will not excite the mode shape at 2 khz with enough energy to render reliable results this can be derived from the cf where the coherence above 500 hz is low with a small peak around 2 khz the excitation signal for the soft plastic tip does not contain enough energy in the frequencies above 400 hz to generate accurate results above 400 hz without a proper excitation no reliable estimate of the frf is possible in comparison the plastic tip excites the mode shape at 2 khz this can be concluded from the frf in combination with the cf here the coherence is close to one for the resonance frequency this comparison of the two impact hammer tips is a clear indication that the frf should only be interpreted in combination with the cf 3 5 analysis of a single impact in fig 10 the impact hammer excitation and the force panel response are shown for a single impact in the figure a total of six plots are shown these plots allow an evaluation of the excitation and response signals in the time and frequency domain the six plots figure is used to visually analyse each individual impact and decide which impacts are correct and which impacts are to be disregarded the correct impacts are then used for further analysis fig 10 shows information on a single hammer impact and response measurement in both the time domain and in the frequency domain the six plots show the following information 1 upper left plot is the time trace shortly before the impact and shortly after the impact this plot is mainly to visually inspect the quality and magnitude of the impact time window from 2 ms to 18 ms relative to the point in time where the excitation force crosses a threshold 2 upper right plot is the time trace with a large time window in this time window the impact and response signal should be completely diminished the estimation of the frf and cf are performed using the part of the signal that is shown in this plot time window from 20 ms to 500 ms 3 middle left plot shows the magnitude of the frequency response function 4 middle right plot shows the power spectrum of the excitation and response signal 5 bottom left plot shows the phase of the frequency response function 6 bottom right plot shows the cf for all frequency plots in fig 10 the frequency axis is limited to 7 khz due to the sampling rate of 19 2 khz information in spectral plots is available up to 9 6 khz in fig 10 values higher than 3 4 khz are not relevant as can be derived from the coherence plot the cf shows a sharp decline after 2 8 khz this means that the frf above this frequency is not reliable anymore this can also be seen in the phase plot of the frf where the phase shows a large variation which is an indication for noise in the measurement in the power spectrum it can also be seen that the excitation energy is rapidly decreasing above 2 khz the cf shows two significant notches one at around 800 hz and one at 2 5 khz the notch at 800 hz is also visible in the magnitude plot of the frf this can be attributed to a spectral resolution error or another possibility is that the effects are visible of one of the other mode shape of the force panel see section 2 1 where the other mode shapes are listed this has not been further investigated the notch around 2 5 khz is more noticeably in the cf and in the frf 3 6 variability of the excitation fig 11 shows 40 excitation signals from hammering the same panel repeatedly these impacts were carried out using the impact hammer with the plastic tip the threshold for the detection of the impact during the analysis was 130 n the variability of the excitation signal is visible the duration of the impact is 0 6 ms 0 7 ms this is in the same order of magnitude as the pulse duration from the calibration sheet of 0 5 ms the height of the measured impact force ranges from 160 n to over 400 n some of the impacts show a distinct secondary peak around t 1 623 s this is due to a secondary bounce of the impact hammer and these excitation signals are regarded invalid and are ignored in the analysis in some cases the hammer impact will cause the force panel to resonate ringing at its resonance frequency the measured peak of the response force will be significantly higher due to ringing the amplification of the peak will depend on the damping of the force panel see fig 12 for an example of this amplification 4 some aspects of the application of force panels for measuring wave impacts the measurement of wave impacts with force panels mounted on a structure will show in some cases several artefacts in this section a number of these artefacts will be shown the artefacts can be attributed either to undesired behaviour of the force panels or its support structure or to physical phenomena that are present during the sometimes violent wave impact it is important to be able to distinguish between these two sources 4 1 inertia correction on dry force panels and during impact in this example force panels were mounted in the deck box of a floating platform examples of test signals of the measured load on the force panel the impact hammer and a corrected signal of the force panel are presented in fig 12 the correction is carried out using the accelerations measured on the force panel and considering the dry mass of the panel and transducer inertia correction f ma see fig 2 for the force panel with combined accelerometer for a detailed description of this method please refer to scharnke et al 2014 almost no overshoot can be observed for the force panels when hit with the soft plastic tip the rise time of the upward slope is about 670 kn ms at full scale for the impact with the plastic tip a small overshoot of about 15 can be observed in this case the rise time of the presented impact with the plastic tip is about 2500 kn ms at full scale the inertia correction is only effective when the force plate is excited close to the resonance frequency in section 3 4 it was shown that the soft plastic tip would not excite the force panel at the resonance frequency however the plastic tip excitation can excite the resonance frequency with enough energy as is shown in the same section the rise time of the measured wave impact loads is in the same order as the measured impacts from the impact hammer with the soft plastic tip and the plastic tip the inertia correction is done for a selection of actual wave impacts on the same force panels with combined accelerometers these results are presented in fig 13 as can be seen in the figures there is no difference between the measured force and the inertia corrected signals indicating that there is no significant inertia related response exciting of the resonance frequency of the force panel during these impacts in must be noted that the dry mass of panel and transducer was used for the inertia correction during a wave impact however the actual mass is shortly larger due to added mass on the panels during the impact the response of the force panel might therefore be underestimated when using the dry mass for the correction 4 2 oscillations on force measurement signals due to entrapped air in some cases oscillations on a force measurement signal that appear as structural response at first sight can turn out to be oscillations due to entrapped air pockets see fig 14 to distinguish between force panel response and entrapped air pockets the response frequencies must be reviewed carefully and compared to impact hammer tests in addition visual analysis of the impacts through high speed videos can help in detecting entrapped air during an impact see right figure in fig 14 5 discussion this paper presents a methodology to determine the dynamic behaviour of a force panel the methodology is based on modal analysis however it will not deliver the lumped parameters of the second order mechanical system with which the force panel can be modelled nevertheless it will deliver the frequency response function and coherence function from these functions several parameters can be derived that are essential for the characterisation of the dynamic behaviour of the force panel and these parameters are crucial for the application of the force panel the most important parameter of the characterisation is the bandwidth for which the static calibration can be applied this is called the static calibration bandwidth the static calibration bandwidth is defined as the bandwidth for which the averaged magnitude of the frf is within the range 1 db from the unity amplification the static calibration bandwidth can be increased when necessary by using stiffer transducers with a higher resonance peak however stiffer strain gauge transducers have lower sensitivity so a compromise between bandwidth and sensitivity must be made the second parameter is the frequency of the resonance peak this will determine the bandwidth for which the force panel can be applied without exciting the force panel at its resonance frequency these two parameters will determine the response of the force panel to the wave impact when the wave impact bandwidth is smaller than the static calibration bandwidth the force panel will not show any ringing and the static calibration can be applied in the case the wave impact bandwidth is in the range of the resonance frequency of the force panel the signal measured by the force panel will show a ringing response and the measured force amplitude will be amplified by this ringing see section 4 1 the measured response will not fully reflect the real wave impact force and is therefore not as reliable for these situations the wave impact forces can be corrected with an inertia correction to be able to apply this correction the force panel must be equipped with an accelerometer see section 4 1 as mentioned before see section 1 4 the dynamic characterisation using modal analysis is not equal to a dynamic calibration the dynamic characterisation does not deliver a calibration factor that is dependent on the frequency however it provides the information that is needed to describe the dynamic behaviour of the force panels an important issue in calibrations is the traceability of internal calibration standards to international standards for dynamic force measurements traceability is solely based on static calibrations kobusch et al 2007 a common accepted guideline for dynamic force measurements and the corresponding methods for dynamic calibration for force transducers is under development vlajic and chijioke 2017 present a method to develop a dynamic force transfer standard the first step would be to calibrate an impact hammer with a traceable calibration method which in turn is used to calibrate dynamically a force transducer this traceable dynamic calibration would be an important step further then the dynamic characterisation described in this paper modal analysis by means of impact testing is not just hammering away on the intended object it takes knowledge and expertise to get it right avitabile and peres 2012 brown et al 2015 this applies to all aspects of the modal analysis process from the selection of the impact hammer and hammer tip to the measurement set up and the analysis of the impacts 6 conclusions and recommendations 6 1 conclusions the dynamic characterisation of the force panels proves to be a practical tool to describe the dynamic behaviour of the force panel it delivers information on the static calibration bandwidth i e the bandwidth for which the static calibration of the force panel is valid the modal analysis based characterisation method confirms that force panels can measure dynamic forces caused by wave impacts correctly during the measurement of the violent wave impact several artefacts can be present on the measured signal it is important to be able to distinguish between actual physical phenomena and instrumentation artefacts this can only be achieved when the behaviour of the force panel is fully understood as can be seen in section 4 some force panel artefacts can be remedied using the inertia correction during the analysis of the data to inspect and quantify a hammer impact a combination of time domain and frequency domain analysis tools is necessary for the frequency domain the frequency response function and the coherence function are indispensable the frequency response function should only be examined in combination with the coherence function the resonance frequency of 2060 hz found using fem analysis section 2 1 matches the resonance frequency at 2 khz found in sections 3 4 and 3 5 where the frf is estimated the modal analysis method using the impact hammer can be used to characterize and qualify the force panel however importantly the method does not require a complex set up is quite practicable and can therefore be used to verify the correct functioning of the force panels mounted on a model structure 6 2 recommendations the dynamic characterisation using modal analysis as a method is implemented the next step would be to improve and refine the method the following improvements could made 1 the modal analysis can be improved by improving the impacting process especially for the qualification situation the impact hammer with the tip with the maximal bandwidth should be used in this case this would be the aluminium tip however performing impacts manually with the aluminium tip is very challenging if not impracticable brown et al 2015 to improve the impacting process with the aluminium tip it is suggested to us a mechanical frame which incorporates a pendulum and mechanical fixture for the force panel then the hammer swing can be tuned to have a valid impact and no double bounces furthermore the impact process can be performed with better repeatability and less variability using the pendulum 2 the estimation of the frequency response function and coherence function can be further improved by comparing different estimators use different parameters for the spectral estimation process and applying extended spectral analysis techniques an interesting method to improve the estimation of frf and cf is presented by brandt and brincker 2010 they propose an optimization algorithm that selects the optimum impacts from a set of impacts the current estimation is based on the welch method of overlapping segments welch 1967 an alternative method is the mvdr approach benesty 2005 3 furthermore the influence of the aa filtering aa filter type and aa filter frequency when measuring the signals is not fully investigated after the improvement of the method for instance the imperfections in the estimation of the frf and cf should diminish and only the force panel behaviour should be shown another important step in acceptance of the method would be the estimation of the confidence limits of the estimated frequency response function and coherence function jenkins and watts 1968 bendat and piersol 1980 2010 this would be an indication of the quality of the process and the results furthermore an uncertainty analysis should be applied to the parameters that are estimated during the modal analysis when inspecting figs 9 and 10 is can be seen that the spectral resolution is 46 9 hz and 23 4 hz respectively this is due to the spectral bin size used in the estimation of the frf and cf this bin size is a first indication of the uncertainty of the estimation of the resonance frequency determined using the frf the force panel described in this paper has a relatively large 50 mm 50 mm frontal plate compared to the pressure transducers used for wave impact measurement currently smaller transducers with greater stiffness are under investigation this will reduce the frontal plate size resulting in both a higher resonance frequency and a larger static calibration bandwidth with the higher resonance frequency the amplification or ringing can be avoided this higher resonance frequency will come at the cost of sensitivity and resolution and might introduce larger bending moments of the transducer these bending modes will possibly introduce mode shapes at frequencies within the static calibration bandwidth which cannot be neglected the application of smaller and stiffer transducers needs to be carefully investigated the necessary tools to characterize dynamically the force panel built with these new transducers are available the methodology presented in this paper functions straightforward for force panels with relatively small mass for force panels with larger mass the qualification will be more complicated in that case the rigid mounting of the force panel is more complex furthermore the accelerations of the force panel during the impact will have to be considered for a correct qualification credit authorship

20731,this paper presents a newly designed experimental setup based on the interaction of a dam break flow with an elastic sluice gate in the context of the hydroelasticity problems as the experimental measurement displacements of the elastic sluice gate and water level evolutions at various points calculated from the digital video images are used the present phenomenon includes violent free surface motions with the rotational flow hydraulic jump and spilling type wave break and both the static and dynamic impacts of that motions on the boundaries therefore the experiment was repeated two times for testing the stability of the experimental process and measurements and the obtained results were compared the present phenomenon also was modeled numerically using the coupled sph fem model and the numerical computations were compared with experimental measurements graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydroelasticity fluid structure interaction fsi dam break flow smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph sluice gate 1 introduction hydroelasticity is a phenomenon in which the fluid flow modifies the geometry of the solid boundaries significantly and in the meantime deformed solid boundaries lead to considerable changes over the main characteristics of the fluid flow this process maintains until the deformation caused by fluid flow remains unchanged and generates a complex structure faced in many engineering applications because of the nature of the problem involving multi phase and nonlinearity hydroelasticity problems are too complex to solve using analytical methods wu et al 2016 therefore numerical and experimental studies carried out in this field have great importance to understand the nature of the phenomenon although a lot of numerical methods were developed to simulate hydroelasticity problems there are limited experimental studies in the literature investigating the interaction of free surface flows with deformable solid bodies antoci et al 2007 carried out an experimental study involving free surface flow interacting with the hypo elastic gate and used the tip deflection of the elastic gate to compare numerical results idelsohn et al 2008 presented a set of experimental studies based on the interaction between free surface flows including waves and fragmentation and an elastic solid with geometrical non linearity they used the sloshing movement of the oil as the fluid phase of the phenomenon in their experiments and compared experimental measurements with the numerical results of the particle finite element method pfem liao et al 2015 investigated experimentally the interaction of a dam break flow with elastic solid including large impacting force structural vibration and violent free surface flow in their work the horizontal displacements of the three different measurement points on the solid body interacting with various initial water heights were presented and used to compare with the numerical results of the coupling finite differences method fdm with finite volume method fvm in the past decades many numerical methods were developed by researchers to simulate hydroelasticity problems there are some mesh based methods such as the finite element method fem fvm and fdm achieving reasonable accuracy some researchers used coupled forms of mesh based formulations such as fvm fem kassiotis et al 2010 qin et al 2019 and fdm fem liao et al 2015 in the hydroelasticity analyses but these methods need special treatments which are difficult to implement and time consuming in calculations to handle the multi physics of hydroelasticity as an alternative approach mesh free particle methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph and moving particle semi implicit mps have become more popular for the simulation of hydroelasticity problems in recent years these methods present a suitable structure with mesh free lagrangian nature and there is no need for special treatment such as remeshing and interface tracking some researchers used sph antoci et al 2007 rafiee and thiagarajan 2009 and mps formulations falahaty et al 2018 khayyer et al 2019 sun et al 2015 yang and zhang 2018 in the simulation of the hydroelasticity problems also there are many studies coupling classical sph formulation with other enhanced sph formulations han and hu 2018 he et al 2017 khayyer et al 2018 2020 sun et al 2019 zhan et al 2019 and other particle methods such as discrete element method dem wu et al 2016 to utilize the advantages of two different numerical frameworks some researchers preferred the coupling of particle based methods with mesh based methods such as sph fem fourey et al 2017 ma et al 2020 yang et al 2012 and mps fem zhang and wan 2018 all the numerical methods referred to above are still under development and needed to be tested by experimental measurements for this purpose this study presents a set of experimental data of a newly designed setup based on the interaction of the dam break flow with an elastic sluice gate the presented experimental setup can be considered a useful benchmark case with the nature involving both static and dynamic impacts of the fluid flow with a hydraulic jump and spilling type wave break the experimental data of displacements of four different measurement points on the elastic sluice gate and water level evolution by time in three different points were obtained from video records to testing the repeatability of the experiment and the accuracy of the experimental measurements experiments were conducted by two times the phenomenon was also modeled numerically using the well known coupled sph fem model in which the fluid phase is simulated using sph while the solid phase is fem the simulation results were compared with the experimental measurements involving the elastic deformations of the sluice gate and the time evolution of the water level at the three different points the rest of this paper was organized as follows at first the accuracy of the present sph model in the dam break flow simulations was tested experimentally and numerically in this regard free surface profiles at early stages and water height and pressure measurements were used afterward the euler bernoulli beam theory was used to calculate young s modulus of the rubber like material of the sluice gate deforming by water pressure then an experimental study on the interaction of a dam break flow with an elastic sluice gate was conducted finally the phenomenon was numerically modeled using a coupled sph fem model and the results of the numerical calculation were compared with experimental measurements 2 experimental setup 2 1 experimental facility the experiments were carried out at the civil engineering hydraulics laboratory of the iskenderun technical university turkey yılmaz 2019 using a rectangular tank with 1 508 m in length 0 1 m in width 0 3 m in height and with plexiglass walls and a horizontal bottom a rigid vertical gate with 3 mm thickness was located at a distance of 0 5 m from the upstream entrance dividing the tank into two parts as upstream and downstream the upstream was initially filled with a 0 2 m height of water while the downstream was initially dry fig 1 a the rectangular tank was glued to the rigid table to ensure the stability of the setup during the experiments grease oil was used to prevent leakage from the contact edges of the rigid plate and the initial water body was colored with the dye for better identification of the air water interface from video records fig 1b to generate an idealized dam break flow a mechanism involving a weight attached to the rigid plate with a cable was constructed by the release of the weight from a certain height it was purposed that the rigid plate was removed suddenly from the front of the initial water body the removal time of the plate was calculated to be the value of between 0 08 and 0 1 s from video records this value is inside of the limits defined by lauber and hager 1998 for the consideration of the plate movement as sudden removal for a dam break problem a rubber like elastic plate with 27 5 cm in length 9 7 cm in width and 0 7 cm in thickness was installed downstream of the tank with a distance of 1 5 times of the initial water level h 0 to provide interaction between the dam break flow and the elastic structure while the top side of the plate with 15 cm in length was fixed using two rigid plates the bottom side of the plate with 12 5 cm in length could deform freely fig 1c the width of the elastic plate was determined to be 9 7 cm to avoid friction between the edges of the elastic plate and the rigid walls of the tank for determination of the measurement point locations in digital images three markers were stacked on the front face of the rectangular tank and four markers for along the thickness of the elastic plate whereas three measurement points p1 p3 were used to obtain water level evolution in time four measurement points m1 m4 were used for the deformation of the elastic plate fig 1b c 2 2 cameras and measurement technique two different cameras at different positions were used to obtain digital images one of the cameras cam1 was focused on the entire channel while the other one cam2 to the domain where rubber like material deformed in cam1 and cam2 were used to obtain the time evolution of water level and elastic deformations of the plate respectively both cameras were used in the resolution of 1920x1080 pixels while cam1 was used at 60 frames per second it was observed that 60 and also 120 frames per second values are insufficient for cam2 in the definition of the elastic deformations of the plate at the moment of the first contact of the fluid flow with solid boundaries therefore the cam2 was used at 240 fps value fig 2 digital images consist of the pixels having two main features coordinate and rgb values in the video records the resolution represents the count of the pixels that consist of the digital images and each of the pixels has a specific coordinate value by the knowledge of any reference dimension in the video records it can be determined how many pixels represent the dimension of the reference value and how many dimensions a pixel is also each pixel has a specific rgb value that makes it possible to determine the fluid air interface using color contrast between two pixels the time evolution of water levels was obtained using the virtual wave probe technique kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 ozmen cagatay et al 2014 this procedure consists of a fixed vertical line yellow located at a measuring axis and a tiny horizontal line red tracking the fluid air interface after the locating fixed vertical line along with the measurement point the tiny horizontal line begins to follow the fluid air interface via edge detection procedure the interface coordinates were collected throughout the analysis time for each frame and by the usage of the metric calibration interface coordinates could be transformed into metric fig 3 illustrates this measurement process for two different time steps of the current experimental study the deformation values of the elastic solid were obtained using open source code tracker https physlets org tracker which makes it possible to the tracking of any reference marker in the video records via rgb values at first the section of the specific marker stacked along the elastic solid is identified to the code as a template the code starts to search in each frame the section matched with the template inside the area of interest if a match is found coordinates of the matched section along the x and y axis are collected and converted into metric units using metric calibration fig 4 3 numerical model numerical analysis was performed using commercial software ls dyna r 11 0 0 the coupled sph fem model was used to simulate the presented hydroelasticity problem the sph method employed to simulate the fluid phase of the problem was firstly proposed in astrophysics gingold and monaghan 1977 lucy 1977 and later applied successfully in many complex fluid problems altomare et al 2014 2017 colicchio et al 2002 crespo et al 2008 monaghan 1994 in this paper the basic information about the present sph fem model in ls dyna was presented and detailed formulations can be found in hallquist 2006 3 1 smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph 3 1 1 basic equations of sph in sph the conservation laws of the continuum are transformed from their partial differential form using integral equations based on an interpolation function in which a function f r can be represented as follows 1 f r f r w r r h d r where r is the position vector and h is the smoothing length defining the support area of the interpolation function called kernel w the function f r can be approximated in a discrete form based on the set of particles in this case the function is interpolated at a particle a where a summation is performed over all neighboring particles b within the region of compact support of kernel function 2 f r a b f r b m b ρ b w r a r b h where m and ρ are the mass and density of particles respectively the performance of an sph model depends heavily on the choice of the smoothing kernel crespo et al 2015 in the commercial code ls dyna the cubic b spline kernel developed by monaghan and lattanzio 1985 is used in the sph simulations 3 w r a r b h α d 1 3 2 q 2 3 4 q 3 0 q 1 1 4 2 q 3 1 q 2 0 q 2 where q is the non dimensional distance between the particles which is q r h and r is the distance between the particles a and b α d is the constant of normalization which is 10 7πh 2 and 1 πh 3 for 2d and 3d problems respectively 3 1 2 governing equations for fluid motion in this paper the enhanced fluid formulation with a smoothing function of the pressure field available in ls dyna is employed to solve the fluid phase of the phenomenon in this form the momentum equation can be written as 4 d v a d t b m b p b p a ρ b ρ a π a b a w a b g where v is the velocity of the particle t is the time p is the pressure of particle g is the gravitational acceleration and π ab is the artificial viscosity term used for dissipation which is proposed by monaghan 1992 and monaghan and gingold 1983 5 π a b α c a b μ a b ρ a b v a b r a b 0 0 v a b r a b 0 where v a b v a v b and r a b

depending on the problem in the continuity equation the density changes are computed in the present sph model as 6 d ρ a d t b m b v a b a w a b in sph the pressure field of the particles exhibits large pressure oscillations due to acoustic waves present in the compressible fluids one of the most straightforward and computationally least expensive methods to overcome this problem is to spatially filter the particle densities colagrossi and landrini 2003 in the present model the zeroth order shepard filter shepard 1968 is applied which can be written as 7 ρ a n e w b ρ b w a b m b ρ b m b w a b w h e r e w a b w a b b w a b m b ρ b 3 1 3 equation of state in this paper weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics wcsph which is the most common form of the sph in the modeling of hydrodynamic problems is used therefore an equation of state which relates pressure to density variation is employed to close the governing equations the relationship between pressure and density can be expressed following batchelor 1974 and monaghan et al 1999 8 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where γ 7 ρ 0 1000 k g m 3 is the reference density b c 0 2 ρ 0 γ and c 0 c ρ 0 is the speed of sound at the reference density which should be at least ten times faster than the maximum fluid velocity to keep the density variations less than 1 monaghan 1994 in the present model this value is chosen to be 20 times of maximum expected wave velocity calculated considering related dam break cases to guarantee the incompressibility 3 1 4 boundary treatment in most sph simulations the boundaries of rigid bodies have been modeled by using either a ghost particles b fluid particles c normalizing conditions or d boundary particle forces monaghan and kajtar 2009 in the present paper the boundaries are defined by a set of fluid particles fixed in positions these particles satisfy the same continuity and state equations eqs 6 and 8 as fluid particles but they do not move according to the forces exerted on them when the fluid particles enter the compact support area defined by the smoothing length h of a boundary particle the density of the affected boundary particle increases which results in a pressure increase in turn this causes a repulsive force exerted on the fluid particles via pressure term in the momentum equation eq 4 enforcing the non penetration condition 3 2 finite element method fem in the present model the solid phase of the phenomenon is modeled using the fem scheme of ls dyna hallquist 2006 in the method the potential energy for a solid body starting from a statement of the principle virtual work can be written as follow bathe 2006 hallquist 2006 9 δ π v ρ x i δ x i dv v σ i j δ x i j dv v ρ f i δ x i dv δ b 1 t i δ x i ds 0 where π is the total

solution domain is discretized with elements interconnected at nodal points by the summing over the n elements δ π can be approximated as hallquist 2006 10 δ π m 1 n δ π m 0 and can be written in matrix notation hallquist 2006 11 m 1 n v m ρ n t n a d v v m b t σ d v v m ρ n t b d v δ b 1 n t t d s m 0 where n and b are the interpolation and strain displacement matrixes respectively σ is the stress vector a is the nodal acceleration vector b is the body force load vector and t is the applied traction loads 3 3 coupling of sph and fem the coupling of sph and fem is implemented using the 2d node to solid contact algorithm in ls dyna hallquist 2006 where the slave part is defined with sph whereas the master part is fem the contact between the master and slave parts is realized by the penalty based method hallquist 2006 in this method at the beginning of every time step each slave node is checked for penetration to the master surface via the penetration length calculation hallquist

contact point if penetration occurs l 0 the reaction force vector f s given by hallquist 2006 is applied between the slave node and its contact point 13 f s l k c s n i where k c s is the contact stiffness for the master segment the reaction force at the contact point is applied to each node of the master segment using a shape function as follows 14 f m i φ i ξ c η c f s where f m i and φ i ξ c η c are the applied force and shape function for node i at the master segment respectively the related contact forces calculated for sph particles and fem nodes using equation 13 and 14 respectively are applied in opposite directions to satisfy dynamic equilibrium afterward the accelerations of both sph particles and fem nodes are calculated considering the internal external and contact forces and used to renew the velocities and positions of sph particles and fem nodes for the beginning of the next time step lee et al 2016 4 validation of the present sph model in ls dyna in this section the present sph model of ls dyna is validated by a well known dam break case of zhou et al 1999 the schematic view of the experimental setup and locations of the water height h1 h2 and pressure p1 measurement points are shown in fig 5 the initial water body with 1 2m in length and 0 6m in height is confined by a flap in a rectangular tank with 3 22m in length and 2m in height to compare with numerical results experimental data obtained from two wave gauges located 2 228m and 2 725m from the left wall of the tank and a pressure transducer of 0 09m diameter located 0 16m from the bottom on the right wall of the tank were used by the lifting of the flap the initial water body starts to propagate downstream until reaching the rigid wall at the end of the tank by the impact of the dam break flow against the rigid wall the water deviates violently upwards and rises along the wall by reaching limits on the upward direction the motion of the water changes direction due to the gravitational forces and the running down water plunges into the underlying water over the bottom surface after that point violent air entrainment and formation of spray and fragmentation of the free surface are observed many researchers used this test case to validate various numerical models colagrossi and landrini 2003 colicchio et al 2002 park et al 2012 in this paper the results of the presented sph model of ls dyna were compared with experimental measurements and other numerical results of colicchio et al 2002 and park et al 2012 in this regard a sph analysis was performed for 2 5s time using the parameters presented in table 1 the fluid domain with density ρ 1000 k g m 3 and dynamic viscosity μ 0 001 p a s is modeled using the particles with the initial distance d p 0 006 m the smoothing length is chosen to be 1 25 times of d p h 0 0075 m and the artificial viscosity constant is α 0 03 a rectangular tank is modeled with sph particles with the same properties as water however they are fixed and do not move according to the forces exerted on them fig 6 shows the comparison sequence of the numerical results based on the vof method of park et al 2012 and the present sph model it is observed that there is a well agreement between the free surface computations especially until the wave front plunge into the underlying water after that point air entrainment increases highly and chaotic free surface evolution is observed while the vof method of park et al 2012 modeled the problem with two phases the present sph model neglects the air phase of the case and includes a single fluid phase which can be the possible reason for differentiation between the results also it draws attention that there are detachments and fragmentations in the fluid particles near the boundary of the vertical wall between the dimensionless time t g h 3 13 6 25 resulting in pressure anomalies in the area close to particle fragmentations at t g h 6 25 the authors consider that the repulsive forces resultant from the present boundary treatment scheme and the parameters used in the sph model are possible reasons for the issues mentioned which can be treated partially by a detailed parametric study involving initial particle distance and artificial viscosity however it is considered that the presented sph model captured reasonable accuracy with the water height and pressure computations showed in figs 7 and 8 and the further improvements are out of the scope of the present paper fig 7 presents the water height measurement comparisons between the present sph model other sph model of colicchio et al 2002 and the vof based method of park et al 2012 until the abrupt rise at t g h 6 3 for h1 and t g h 5 6 for h2 caused by wave plunging onto the deck it is observed that there is a satisfactory agreement between numerical results and experimental measurements at h1 it is observed that the abrupt rise at t g h 6 3 in the water height occurred earlier in the present sph model than other numerical model results and experimental measurements for h2 the present sph model reached higher water heights at t g h 5 6 7 and stayed at this height for longer than experimental measurements and other numerical model results these differences can be caused by the way to obtain water height data of the present study in this paper water height data of the present sph model is calculated based on the highest particle level at the measurement points whereas in the experiment standard capacitive wave gauges were used which are sensitive to the wetted portion of the wire caused to deduct the height of the entrapped cavity the pressure comparisons between the numerical and experimental results at p1 are presented in fig 8 colicchio et al 2002 reported that pressure undergoes large variation within the area of the transducer and indeed the experimental pressure curve is closer to the pressure computed at the bottom boundary of the transducer area in this regard both of the results obtained from two different measurement points mentioned above are presented in fig 8 for the results obtained from the center of the transducer top plot of fig 8 it is observed that the present sph model shows a rather limited agreement with experimental measurements following the study of colicchio et al 2002 however at the bottom boundary of the transducer bottom plot of fig 8 it is observed that the present sph model reproduces experimental data with reasonable accordance 5 results 5 1 modeling of the dam break flow without sluice gate by sph in this section as a part of the present phenomenon a dam break flow without the sluice gate is investigated experimentally and numerically in the experimental study the dimensions of the rectangular tank and initial water body have the same dimensions as the experimental setup described in section 2 without the elastic plate the schematic view of the experimental setup and locations of the water height measurement points are shown in fig 9 the sph analysis of dam break flow was performed using the parameters presented in table 2 the frames of experimental and numerical results at various time steps were illustrated with a comparative form in fig 10 the experiments were conducted by two times and the results of the free surface profiles at the initial stages are shown in fig 11 comparing with the present sph model computations these profiles were obtained using the virtual wave probe technique described in section 2 unlike the water height measurement the vertical line water height measurement axis which is fixed in water height measurements is slid with constant increments at a specific time frame for each increment the horizontal coordinate of the vertical line and the water height at that point is collected which compose the free surface profile after the sudden removal of the rigid plate dam break flow started to propagate over the dry bed to the end of the rectangular tank while at the early stage the wave front was parabolic shaped it became hump shaped by the time when the numerical and experimental results were compared it can be observed that the numerical calculations of the water surface profiles are generally in good agreement with the experimental one however wave propagation velocity in numerical analysis became slightly faster than the experimental one after the 0 3 s of the analysis as shown in fig 11 the wave front evolution of dam break flow is highly influenced by boundary treatments also the dam break wave front starting to propagate after the sudden removal of the rigid plate is under the high influence of turbulence shigematsu et al 2004 the sph theory used in this study has no turbulence model and the rectangular tank was assumed completely smooth also the sph method has a notable sensitivity to the parameters using in the analysis mao et al 2017 especially the initial distance between the particles and artificial viscosity constant can cause dramatic changes in the analysis results in this study the ratio of the initial water level to initial particle distance h 0 d p was set to be 100 while it provided reasonable accuracy and lower computational costs in the analysis using a higher h 0 d p ratio can ensure higher accuracy but with more computational cost furthermore the artificial viscosity constant has a direct relation with energy dissipation in the analysis which has notable effects on the solution results higher viscosity value causes more energy dissipation but it should be noted that the selection of the viscosity value highly depends on problem characteristics and resolution h 0 d p although the obtained results have an improvable structure it is considered that it provides a reasonable accuracy and is useable to simulate the present experimental setup of the hydroelasticity phenomenon fig 12 presents the water height comparisons between the experimental measurements and numerical computations of the present sph model at p1 the comparison of the numerical computation with experimental measurements is highly compatible at p2 and p3 it is observed that there is good agreement between the results except for little differentiations especially at the initial stages caused by wave front velocity and shape 5 2 calculation of young s modulus of the rubber like elastic plate determination of the mechanic properties of the rubber like elastic solid used in the experiments accurately is essential to the right consideration for the performance of the sph fem method for this purpose the deformations of the rubber like material under the self weight were experimentally measured at the four different points using open source code tracker https physlets org tracker the code was calibrated with the rigid wall length 0 15m and related deflections are calculated according to this calibration the problem can be defined as a classic cantilever beam under the self weight and it was assumed that rubber like material behaves like linear elastic the deformation values in fig 13 were measured using the reference axis which started from the top side of the rubber thickness therefore the deformation values in table 3 using for the calculation of young s modulus of the rubber like material were calculated by subtracting the half value of the rubber thickness 3 5 mm from these values the young s modules providing these deformation values are calculated using the euler bernoulli beam theory which can be written as 15 w x q x 2 6 l 2 4 l x x 2 24 e i where w x is the deflection at the specific position x along the length of the beam l starting from the fixed end q is the uniformly distributed load e is young s modulus i is the second moment of area of the beam s cross section as described in section 2 the elastic plate has the dimensions 0 125m in length 0 097m in width and 0 007m in thickness the density of the rubber like material is 1250 kg m3 it can be observed that the calculated values of young s modulus for all measurement points are about 4 mpa therefore assuming young s modulus of the rubber like material used in this study as 4 mpa is a reasonable approximation all mechanic characteristics of the rubber like material used in the analysis were presented in table 4 5 3 interaction of the dam break flow with an elastic sluice gate in this section the interaction of the dam break flow with an elastic sluice gate was investigated experimentally and numerically the coupled sph fem method was used for numerical modeling of the phenomenon the experimental analysis shows that the phenomenon can be modeled as two dimensional therefore the 2d simulation of the phenomenon was performed with 2 s analysis time elastic deformations of the rubber like material and time evolution of water levels at various points were used for comparisons of the experimental and numerical results 5 3 1 experimental results the experimental process was recorded using two different cameras and frames for 2s time were presented in fig 14 the phenomenon includes high dynamics impacts and violent free surface flow movements therefore testing of the experimental repeatability gains importance for this purpose the experiment was conducted by two times and obtained deformation values of the elastic plate for four different points were compared the comparison results were shown in fig 15 after the sudden removal of the rigid plate the dam break flow wave front started to propagate towards the downstream the first contact between the dam break flow and solid boundaries occurred at about 0 23s this impact which can be defined as the dynamic generated a sudden deformation on elastic boundaries then a relaxation on the solid body was observed until the second impact moment by the second contact at about 0 37s another dynamic deformation occurred for a short period and the generation of hydraulic jump and the spilling type wave break was observed shortly after that time while a part of the dam break waves started to reflect towards upstream the other part traveled towards downstream of the elastic solid by the raising of the water level behind the elastic solid static impacts became more dominant at the pressure forces that enforce the solid boundaries the plate reached maximum deformation under the static forces and then a relaxation was observed depending on the water level behind the gate by the time furthermore as expected some leakage occurred between the rigid walls and the elastic plate edges fig 14 it can be expected that leakage causes some pressure reduction on the solid boundaries but it is considered that this effect is limited dynamic deformations between 0 2s and 0 4s and vibrations between the 0 4s 0 8 s at four measurement points are compatible in both of two repeated experimental measurements also measurements of the water level evolution by the time were compared for repeated two experiments and results were shown in fig 16 the measurement points p1 is at the upstream and p2 and p3 are in behind and front of the elastic plate at p1 where relatively lower fluctuations occurred on the flow free surface the results of the two experimental measurements are highly compatible at p2 and p3 where relatively higher fluctuations occurred the agreement between the experimental measurements is reasonable except for little deviations these results prove the stability of the experiment in the context of the experimental repeatability and exhibit the usability of the presented experimental data as a benchmark case 5 3 2 comparisons of the experimental measurements with sph fem results numerical analysis of the phenomenon was performed using the present sph fem model of ls dyna for 2s while the fluid phase of the problem is modeled with the sph using the parameters in section 5 1 the solid phase with the mechanical properties presented in section 5 2 is based on the fem the frames of the numerical and experimental results at various time steps are shown in fig 17 with pressure von mises stress fields for fluid and solid subdomains respectively the measured and computed horizontal displacements of the elastic plate are plotted in fig 18 it is observed that both dynamic and static impacts of the phenomenon are reproduced by the current sph fem model with reasonable accuracy however it is drawn attention that the oscillations on the solid plate caused by complex fluid motion with hydraulic jump and wave breaking generate a little differentiation between the experimental and numerical results at t 0 45 0 8s the present numerical model results show higher oscillations on the plate displacement in this period than the experimental one the possible reason can be the parametric sensitivity of sph discussed in section 5 1 therefore a detailed parametric study is needed to investigate the effects of the parameters of the sph model on the plate oscillations for the present phenomenon in addition to this the air cavity formed at the violent free surface motion of the hydraulic jump and wave breaking may cause significant changes in the plate oscillations while the present sph model has a single phase of fluid the effect of the air cavity on the numerical results can be investigated using two phase numerical models also as reported in section 5 3 1 some leakage occurred between the elastic plate and rigid walls of the rectangular tank during the experiments whereas this situation does not cause a significant effect on the main deformation characteristics of the elastic plate it could be a reason for the differentiation of oscillating discussed above the pressure stressyy fields for fluid and solid sub domains at various times are shown in fig 19 in which stressyy represents the stress component along the y axis from fig 19 it can be seen clearly that the present sph fem method provided a smooth pressure stress field in the numerical computations the comparison results of the water level evolution by the time between the experimental measurements and numerical computations are presented in fig 20 in addition to this water levels at three measurement points for the previous case without gate are also presented in the figure at p1 located upstream it is observed that the presented numerical model reproduced the experimental measurements with reasonable accuracy except for a phase difference in the reflection wave at the numerical computation wave propagation velocity is lower than the experimental one and this caused a little delay at the rise of the water level also compared to the dam break case without the gate it is not observed a distinctive difference between the experimental results until the reflection wave at p2 it is observed that the present sph fem model captures reasonable accuracy except for a little deviation between the experimental measurements and numerical computations in the water height at about 1 2s caused by reflection wave front shape in the numerical model results the wave crest is not as apparent as the experimental one also it is observed that the presence of the gate did not generate a significant effect on the water height data until the reflection wave reaches this point after that point the water height decreased in the case without the gate while an increase occurred with the reflection wave in the case with the gate at p3 it is observed that little fluctuations occurred in the experimental results caused by the contact between the free surface of fluid and plate these fluctuations are not dominant in the numerical results as well as the experiments however there is a reasonable accuracy between the experimental and numerical results for the case without the gate as expected water height remains at higher levels than the case with the gate 6 conclusions this paper presents a newly designed experimental setup based on the interaction between the dam break flow and an elastic sluice gate in the context of the hydroelasticity problems the present experimental setup involves a dam break flow with hydraulic jump and spilling type wave break and the interaction of this flow with an elastic sluice gate with these dynamics it is considered that the presented setup is a useful benchmark case to investigate the efficiency of the numerical methods in the modeling of hydroelasticity problems as the experimental measurements the deformation of the elastic plate at the four different points and the water level evolution by the time calculated from digital video images were used the experiment was repeated two times to ensure the stability and accuracy of the experimental measurements and it was observed that compared measurements showed well agreement the present phenomenon was also numerically simulated using the coupled sph fem model of ls dyna in which the fluid phase is based on the sph whereas the solid phase fem the solution accuracy of the present sph model in the modeling of free surface flows was investigated using the experimental and numerical results of a well known dam break case and an experimental study of the dam break flow over the dry bed results demonstrated that the present sph model showed a reasonable accuracy in the modeling of the fluid motions then the method was coupled fem using a penalty based contact algorithm of ls dyna and used to simulate the presented hydroelasticity phenomenon finally the obtained numerical computations were compared with experimental data and it was observed that the present sph fem model of ls dyna reproduced the experimental data with reasonable accuracy however it should be noted that the present coupling procedure is featured by the absence of any boundary treatment scheme using the sph formalism i e the sph kernel support remains truncated and the continuity equation is not affected by this fluid solid coupling in future works the effect of the present coupling scheme on the numerical results can be investigated by using different numerical methods and formulations credit authorship contribution statement ada yilmaz

20731,this paper presents a newly designed experimental setup based on the interaction of a dam break flow with an elastic sluice gate in the context of the hydroelasticity problems as the experimental measurement displacements of the elastic sluice gate and water level evolutions at various points calculated from the digital video images are used the present phenomenon includes violent free surface motions with the rotational flow hydraulic jump and spilling type wave break and both the static and dynamic impacts of that motions on the boundaries therefore the experiment was

sph fem model and the numerical computations were compared with experimental measurements graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydroelasticity fluid structure interaction fsi dam break flow smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph sluice gate 1 introduction hydroelasticity is a phenomenon in which the fluid flow modifies the geometry of the solid boundaries significantly and in the meantime deformed solid boundaries lead to considerable changes over the main characteristics of the fluid flow this process maintains until the deformation caused by fluid flow remains unchanged and generates a complex structure faced in many engineering applications because of the nature of the problem involving multi phase and nonlinearity hydroelasticity problems are too complex to solve using analytical methods wu et al 2016 therefore numerical and experimental studies carried out in this field have great importance to understand the nature of the phenomenon although a lot of numerical methods were developed to simulate hydroelasticity problems there are limited experimental studies in the literature investigating the interaction of free surface flows with deformable solid bodies antoci et al 2007 carried out an experimental study involving free surface flow interacting with the hypo elastic gate and used the tip deflection of the elastic gate to compare numerical results idelsohn et al 2008 presented a set of experimental studies based on the interaction between free surface flows including waves and fragmentation and an elastic solid with geometrical non linearity they used the sloshing movement of the oil as the fluid phase of the phenomenon in their experiments and compared experimental measurements with the numerical results of the particle finite element method pfem liao et al 2015 investigated experimentally the interaction of a dam break flow with elastic solid including large impacting force structural vibration and violent free surface flow in their work the horizontal displacements of the three different measurement points on the solid body interacting with various initial water heights were presented and used to compare with the numerical results of the coupling finite differences method fdm with finite volume method fvm in the past decades many numerical methods were developed by researchers to simulate hydroelasticity problems there are some mesh based methods such as the finite element method fem fvm and fdm achieving reasonable accuracy some researchers used coupled forms of mesh based formulations such as fvm fem kassiotis et al 2010 qin et al 2019 and fdm fem liao et al 2015 in the hydroelasticity analyses but these methods need special treatments which are difficult to implement and time consuming in calculations to handle the multi physics of hydroelasticity as an alternative approach mesh free particle methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph and moving particle semi implicit mps have become more popular for the simulation of hydroelasticity problems in recent years these methods present a suitable structure with mesh free lagrangian nature and there is no need for special treatment such as remeshing and interface tracking some researchers used sph antoci et al 2007 rafiee and thiagarajan 2009 and mps formulations falahaty et al 2018 khayyer et al 2019 sun et al 2015 yang and zhang 2018 in the simulation of the hydroelasticity problems also there are many studies coupling classical sph formulation with other enhanced sph formulations han and hu 2018 he et al 2017 khayyer et al 2018 2020 sun et al 2019 zhan et al 2019 and other particle methods such as discrete element method dem wu et al 2016 to utilize the advantages of two different numerical frameworks some researchers preferred the coupling of particle based methods with mesh based methods such as sph fem fourey et al 2017 ma et al 2020 yang et al 2012 and mps fem zhang and wan 2018 all the numerical methods referred to above are still under development and needed to be tested by experimental measurements for this purpose this study presents a set of experimental data of a newly designed setup based on the interaction of the dam break flow with an elastic sluice gate the presented experimental setup can be considered a useful benchmark case with the nature involving both static and dynamic impacts of the fluid flow with a hydraulic jump and spilling type wave break the experimental data of displacements of four different measurement points on the elastic sluice gate and water level evolution by time in three different points were obtained from video records to testing the repeatability of the experiment and the accuracy of the experimental measurements experiments were conducted by two times the phenomenon was also modeled numerically using the well known coupled sph fem model in which the fluid phase is simulated using sph while the solid phase is fem the simulation results were compared with the experimental measurements involving the elastic deformations of the sluice gate and the time evolution of the water level at the three different points the rest of this paper was organized as follows at first the accuracy of the present sph model in the dam break flow simulations was tested experimentally and numerically in this regard free surface profiles at early stages and water height and pressure measurements were used afterward the euler bernoulli beam theory was used to calculate young s modulus of the rubber like material of the sluice gate deforming by water pressure then an experimental study on the interaction of a dam break flow with an elastic sluice gate was conducted finally the phenomenon was numerically modeled using a coupled sph fem model and the results of the numerical calculation were compared with experimental measurements 2 experimental setup 2 1 experimental facility the experiments were carried out at the civil engineering hydraulics laboratory of the iskenderun technical university turkey yılmaz 2019 using a rectangular tank with 1 508 m in length 0 1 m in width 0 3 m in height and with plexiglass walls and a horizontal bottom a rigid vertical gate with 3 mm thickness was located at a distance of 0 5 m from the upstream entrance dividing the tank into two parts as upstream and downstream the upstream was initially filled with a 0 2 m height of water while the downstream was initially dry fig 1 a the rectangular tank was glued to the rigid table to ensure the stability of the setup during the experiments grease oil was used to prevent leakage from the contact edges of the rigid plate and the initial water body was colored with the dye for better identification of the air water interface from video records fig 1b to generate an idealized dam break flow a mechanism involving a weight attached to the rigid plate with a cable was constructed by the release of the weight from a certain height it was purposed that the rigid plate was removed suddenly from the front of the initial water body the removal time of the plate was calculated to be the value of between 0 08 and 0 1 s from video records this value is inside of the limits defined by lauber and hager 1998 for the consideration of the plate movement as sudden removal for a dam break problem a rubber like elastic plate with 27 5 cm in length 9 7 cm in width and 0 7 cm in thickness was installed downstream of the tank with a distance of 1 5 times of the initial water level h 0 to provide interaction between the dam break flow and the elastic structure while the top side of the plate with 15 cm in length was fixed using two rigid plates the bottom side of the plate with 12 5 cm in length could deform freely fig 1c the width of the elastic plate was determined to be 9 7 cm to avoid friction between the edges of the elastic plate and the rigid walls of the tank for determination of the measurement point locations in digital images three markers were stacked on the front face of the rectangular tank and four markers for along the thickness of the elastic plate whereas three measurement points p1 p3 were used to obtain water level evolution in time four measurement points m1 m4 were used for the deformation of the elastic plate fig 1b c 2 2 cameras and measurement technique two different cameras at different positions were used to obtain digital images one of the cameras cam1 was focused on the entire channel while the other one cam2 to the domain where rubber like material deformed in cam1 and cam2 were used to obtain the time evolution of water level and elastic deformations of the plate respectively both cameras were used in the resolution of 1920x1080 pixels while cam1 was used at 60 frames per second it was observed that 60 and also 120 frames per second values are insufficient for cam2 in the definition of the elastic deformations of the plate at the moment of the first contact of the fluid flow with solid boundaries therefore the cam2 was used at 240 fps value fig 2 digital images consist of the pixels having two main features coordinate and rgb values in the video records the resolution represents the count of the pixels that consist of the digital images and each of the pixels has a specific coordinate value by the knowledge of any reference dimension in the video records it can be determined how many pixels represent the dimension of the reference value and how many dimensions a pixel is also each pixel has a specific rgb value that makes it possible to determine the fluid air interface using color contrast between two pixels the time evolution of water levels was obtained using the virtual wave probe technique kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 ozmen cagatay et al 2014 this procedure consists of a fixed vertical line yellow located at a measuring axis and a tiny horizontal line red tracking the fluid air interface after the locating fixed vertical line along with the measurement point the tiny horizontal line begins to follow the fluid air interface via edge detection procedure the interface coordinates were collected throughout the analysis time for each frame and by the usage of the metric calibration interface coordinates could be transformed into metric fig 3 illustrates this measurement process for two different time steps of the current experimental study the deformation values of the elastic solid were obtained using open source code tracker https physlets org tracker which makes it possible to the tracking of any reference marker in the video records via rgb values at first the section of the specific marker stacked along the elastic solid is identified to the code as a template the code starts to search in each frame the section matched with the template inside the area of interest if a match is found coordinates of the matched section along the x and y axis are collected and converted into metric units using metric calibration fig 4 3 numerical model numerical analysis was performed using commercial software ls dyna r 11 0 0 the coupled sph fem model was used to simulate the presented hydroelasticity problem the sph method employed to simulate the fluid phase of the problem was firstly proposed in astrophysics gingold and monaghan 1977 lucy 1977 and later applied successfully in many complex fluid problems altomare et al 2014 2017 colicchio et al 2002 crespo et al 2008 monaghan 1994 in this paper the basic information about the present sph fem model in ls dyna was presented and detailed formulations can be found in hallquist 2006 3 1 smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph 3 1 1 basic equations of sph in sph the conservation laws of the continuum are transformed from their partial differential form using integral equations based on an interpolation function in which a function f r can be represented as follows 1 f r f r w r r h d r where r is the position vector and h is the smoothing length defining the support area of the interpolation function called kernel w the function f r can be approximated in a discrete form based on the set of particles in this case the function is interpolated at a particle a where a summation is performed over all neighboring particles b within the region of compact support of kernel function 2 f r a b f r b m b ρ b w r a r b h where m and ρ are the mass and density of particles respectively the performance of an sph model depends heavily on the choice of the smoothing kernel crespo et al 2015 in the commercial code ls dyna the cubic b spline kernel developed by monaghan and lattanzio 1985 is used in the sph simulations 3 w r a r b h α d 1 3 2 q 2 3 4 q 3 0 q 1 1 4 2 q 3 1 q 2 0 q 2 where q is the non dimensional distance between the particles which is q r h and r is the distance between the particles a and b α d is the constant of normalization which is 10 7πh 2 and 1 πh 3 for 2d and 3d problems respectively 3 1 2 governing equations for fluid motion in this paper the enhanced fluid formulation with a smoothing function of the pressure field available in ls dyna is employed to solve the fluid phase of the phenomenon in this form the momentum equation can be written as 4 d v a d t b m b p b p a ρ b ρ a π a b a w a b g where v is the velocity of the particle t is the time p is the pressure of particle g is the gravitational acceleration and π ab is the artificial viscosity term used for dissipation which is proposed by monaghan 1992 and monaghan and gingold 1983 5 π a b α c a b μ a b ρ a b v a b r a b 0 0 v a b r a b 0 where v a b v a v b and r a b

depending on the problem in the continuity equation the density changes are computed in the present sph model as 6 d ρ a d t b m b v a b a w a b in sph the pressure field of the particles exhibits large pressure oscillations due to acoustic waves present in the compressible fluids one of the most straightforward and computationally least expensive methods to overcome this problem is to spatially filter the particle densities colagrossi and landrini 2003 in the present model the zeroth order shepard filter shepard 1968 is applied which can be written as 7 ρ a n e w b ρ b w a b m b ρ

modeling of hydrodynamic problems is used therefore an equation of state which relates pressure to density variation is employed to close the governing equations the relationship between pressure and density can be expressed following batchelor 1974 and monaghan et al 1999 8 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where γ 7 ρ 0 1000 k g m 3 is the reference density b c 0 2 ρ 0 γ and c 0 c ρ 0 is the speed of sound at the reference density which should be at least ten times faster than the maximum fluid velocity to keep the density variations less than 1 monaghan 1994 in the present model this value is chosen to be 20 times of maximum expected wave velocity calculated considering related dam break cases to guarantee the incompressibility 3 1 4 boundary treatment in most sph simulations the boundaries of rigid bodies have been modeled by using either a ghost particles b fluid particles c normalizing conditions or d boundary particle forces monaghan and kajtar 2009 in the present paper the boundaries are defined by a set of fluid particles fixed in positions these particles satisfy the same continuity and state equations eqs 6 and 8 as fluid particles but they do not move according to the forces exerted on them when the fluid particles enter the compact support area defined by the smoothing length h of a boundary particle the density of the affected boundary particle increases which results in a pressure increase in turn this causes a repulsive force exerted on the fluid particles via pressure term in the momentum equation eq 4 enforcing the non penetration condition 3 2 finite element method fem in the present model the solid phase of the phenomenon is modeled using the fem scheme of ls dyna hallquist 2006 in the method the potential energy for a solid body starting from a statement of the principle virtual work can be written as follow bathe 2006 hallquist 2006 9 δ π v ρ x i δ x i dv v σ i j δ x i j dv v ρ f i δ x i dv δ b 1 t i δ x i ds 0 where π is the total

solution domain is discretized with elements interconnected at nodal points by the summing over the n elements δ π can be approximated as hallquist 2006 10 δ π m 1 n δ π m 0 and can be written in matrix notation hallquist 2006 11 m 1 n v m ρ n t n a d v v m b t σ d v v m ρ n t b d v δ b 1 n t t d s m 0 where n and b are the interpolation and strain displacement matrixes respectively σ is the stress vector a is the nodal acceleration vector b is the body force load vector and t is the applied traction loads 3 3 coupling of sph and fem the coupling of sph and fem is implemented using the 2d node to solid contact algorithm in ls dyna hallquist 2006 where the slave part is defined with sph whereas the master part is fem the contact between the master and slave parts is realized by the penalty based method hallquist 2006 in this method at the beginning of every time step each slave node is checked for penetration to the master surface via the penetration length calculation hallquist 2006 12 l n i t r ξ c η c 0 where t and r are the position vectors for the slave node and contact point coordinates ξ c η c respectively and n is the unit normal vector of the master segment at the contact point if penetration occurs l 0 the reaction force vector f s given by hallquist 2006 is applied between the slave node and its contact point 13 f s l k c s n i where k c s is the contact stiffness for the master segment the reaction force at the contact point is applied to each node of the master segment using a shape function as follows 14 f m i φ i ξ c η c f s where f m i and φ i ξ c η c are the applied force and shape function for node i at the master segment respectively the related contact forces calculated for sph particles and fem nodes using equation 13 and 14 respectively are applied in opposite directions to satisfy dynamic equilibrium afterward the accelerations of both sph particles and fem nodes are calculated considering the internal external and contact forces and used to renew the velocities and positions of sph particles and fem nodes for the beginning of the next time step lee et al 2016 4 validation of the present sph model in ls dyna in this section the present sph model of ls dyna is validated by a well known dam break case of zhou et al 1999 the schematic view of the experimental setup and locations of the water height h1 h2 and pressure p1 measurement points are shown in fig 5 the initial water body with 1 2m in length and 0 6m in height is confined by a flap in a rectangular tank with 3 22m in length and 2m in height to compare with numerical results experimental data obtained from two wave gauges located 2 228m and 2 725m from the left wall of the tank and a pressure transducer of 0 09m diameter located 0 16m from the bottom on the right wall of the tank were used by the lifting of the flap the initial water body starts to propagate downstream until reaching the rigid wall at the end of the tank by the impact of the dam break flow against the rigid wall the water deviates violently upwards and rises along the wall by reaching limits on the upward direction the motion of the water changes direction due to the gravitational forces and the running down water plunges into the underlying water over the bottom surface after that point violent air entrainment and formation of spray and fragmentation of the free surface are observed many researchers used this test case to validate various numerical models colagrossi and landrini 2003 colicchio et al 2002 park et al 2012 in this paper the results of the presented sph model of ls dyna were compared with experimental measurements and other numerical results of colicchio et al 2002 and park et al 2012 in this regard a sph analysis was performed for 2 5s time using the parameters presented in table 1 the fluid domain with density ρ 1000 k g m 3 and dynamic viscosity μ 0 001 p a s is modeled using the particles with the initial distance d p 0 006 m the smoothing length is chosen to be 1 25 times of d p h 0 0075 m and the artificial viscosity constant is α 0 03 a rectangular tank is modeled with sph particles with the same properties as water however they are fixed and do not move according to the forces exerted on them fig 6 shows the comparison sequence of the numerical results based on the vof method of park et al 2012 and the present sph model it is observed that there is a well agreement between the free surface computations especially until the wave front plunge into the underlying water after that point air entrainment increases highly and chaotic free surface evolution is observed while the vof method of park et al 2012 modeled the problem with two phases the present sph model neglects the air phase of the case and includes a single fluid phase which can be the possible reason for differentiation between the results also it draws attention that there are detachments and fragmentations in the fluid particles near the boundary of the vertical wall between the dimensionless time t g h 3 13 6 25 resulting in pressure anomalies in the area close to particle fragmentations at t g h 6 25 the authors consider that the repulsive forces resultant from the present boundary treatment scheme and the parameters used in the sph model are possible reasons for the issues mentioned which can be treated partially by a detailed parametric study involving initial particle distance and artificial viscosity however it is considered that the presented sph model captured reasonable accuracy with the water height and pressure computations showed in figs 7 and 8 and the further improvements are out of the scope of the present paper fig 7 presents the water height measurement comparisons between the present sph model other sph model of colicchio et al 2002 and the vof based method of park et al 2012 until the abrupt rise at t g h 6 3 for h1 and t g h 5 6 for h2 caused by wave plunging onto the deck it is observed that there is a satisfactory agreement between numerical results and experimental measurements at h1 it is observed that the abrupt rise at t g h 6 3 in the water height occurred earlier in the present sph model than other numerical model results and experimental measurements for h2 the present sph model reached higher water heights at t g h 5 6 7 and stayed at this height for longer than experimental measurements and other numerical model results these differences can be caused by the way to obtain water height data of the present study in this paper water height data of the present sph model is calculated based on the highest particle level at the measurement points whereas in the experiment standard capacitive wave gauges were used which are sensitive to the wetted portion of the wire caused to deduct the height of the entrapped cavity the pressure comparisons between the numerical and experimental results at p1 are presented in fig 8 colicchio et al 2002 reported that pressure undergoes large variation within the area of the transducer and indeed the experimental pressure curve is closer to the pressure computed at the bottom boundary of the transducer area in this regard both of the results obtained from two different measurement points mentioned above are presented in fig 8 for the results obtained from the center of the transducer top plot of fig 8 it is observed that the present sph model shows a rather limited agreement with experimental measurements following the study of colicchio et al 2002 however at the bottom boundary of the transducer bottom plot of fig 8 it is observed that the present sph model reproduces experimental data with reasonable accordance 5 results 5 1 modeling of the dam break flow without sluice gate by sph in this section as a part of the present phenomenon a dam break flow without the sluice gate is investigated experimentally and numerically in the experimental study the dimensions of the rectangular tank and initial water body have the same dimensions as the experimental setup described in section 2 without the elastic plate the schematic view of the experimental setup and locations of the water height measurement points are shown in fig 9 the sph analysis of dam break flow was performed using the parameters presented in table 2 the frames of experimental and numerical results at various time steps were illustrated with a comparative form in fig 10 the experiments were conducted by two times and the results of the free surface profiles at the initial stages are shown in fig 11 comparing with the present sph model computations these profiles were obtained using the virtual wave probe technique described in section 2 unlike the water height measurement the vertical line water height measurement axis which is fixed in water height measurements is slid with constant increments at a specific time frame for each increment the horizontal coordinate of the vertical line and the water height at that point is collected which compose the free surface profile after the sudden removal of the rigid plate dam break flow started to propagate over the dry bed to the end of the rectangular tank while at the early stage the wave front was parabolic shaped it became hump shaped by the time when the numerical and experimental results were compared it can be observed that the numerical calculations of the water surface profiles are generally in good agreement with the experimental one however wave propagation velocity in numerical analysis became slightly faster than the experimental one after the 0 3 s of the analysis as shown in fig 11 the wave front evolution of dam break flow is highly influenced by boundary treatments also the dam break wave front starting to propagate after the sudden removal of the rigid plate is under the high influence of turbulence shigematsu et al 2004 the sph theory used in this study has no turbulence model and the rectangular tank was assumed completely smooth also the sph method has a notable sensitivity to the parameters using in the analysis mao et al 2017 especially the initial distance between the particles and artificial viscosity constant can cause dramatic changes in the analysis results in this study the ratio of the initial water level to initial particle distance h 0 d p was set to be 100 while it provided reasonable accuracy and lower computational costs in the analysis using a higher h 0 d p ratio can ensure higher accuracy but with more computational cost furthermore the artificial viscosity constant has a direct relation with energy dissipation in the analysis which has notable effects on the solution results higher viscosity value causes more energy dissipation but it should be noted that the selection of the viscosity value highly depends on problem characteristics and resolution h 0 d p although the obtained results have an improvable structure it is considered that it provides a reasonable accuracy and is useable to simulate the present experimental setup of the hydroelasticity phenomenon fig 12 presents the water height comparisons between the experimental measurements and numerical computations of the present sph model at p1 the comparison of the numerical computation with experimental measurements is highly compatible at p2 and p3 it is observed that there is good agreement between the results except for little differentiations especially at the initial stages caused by wave front velocity and shape 5 2 calculation of young s modulus of the rubber like elastic plate determination of the mechanic properties of the rubber like elastic solid used in the experiments accurately is essential to the right consideration for the performance of the sph fem method for this purpose the deformations of the rubber like material under the self weight were experimentally measured at the four different points using open source code tracker https physlets org tracker the code was calibrated with the rigid wall length 0 15m and related deflections are calculated according to this calibration the problem can be defined as a classic cantilever beam under the self weight and it was assumed that rubber like material behaves like linear elastic the deformation values in fig 13 were measured using the reference axis which started from the top side of the rubber thickness therefore the deformation values in table 3 using for the calculation of young s modulus of the rubber like material were calculated by subtracting the half value of the rubber thickness 3 5 mm from these values the young s modules providing these deformation values are calculated using the euler bernoulli beam theory which can be written as 15 w x q x 2 6 l 2 4 l x x 2 24 e i where w x is the deflection at the specific position x along the length of the beam l starting from the fixed end q is the uniformly distributed load e is young s modulus i is the second moment of area of the beam s cross section as described in section 2 the elastic plate has the dimensions 0 125m in length 0 097m in width and 0 007m in thickness the density of the rubber like material is 1250 kg m3 it can be observed that the calculated values of young s modulus for all measurement points are about 4 mpa therefore assuming young s modulus of the rubber like material used in this study as 4 mpa is a reasonable approximation all mechanic characteristics of the rubber like material used in the analysis were presented in table 4 5 3 interaction of the dam break flow with an elastic sluice gate in this section the interaction of the dam break flow with an elastic sluice gate was investigated experimentally and numerically the coupled sph fem method was used for numerical modeling of the phenomenon the experimental analysis shows that the phenomenon can be modeled as two dimensional therefore the 2d simulation of the phenomenon was performed with 2 s analysis time elastic deformations of the rubber like material and time evolution of water levels at various points were used for comparisons of the experimental and numerical results 5 3 1 experimental results the experimental process was recorded using two different cameras and frames for 2s time were presented in fig 14 the phenomenon includes high dynamics impacts and violent free surface flow movements therefore testing of the experimental repeatability gains importance for this purpose the experiment was conducted by two times and obtained deformation values of the elastic plate for four different points were compared the comparison results were shown in fig 15 after the sudden removal of the rigid plate the dam break flow wave front started to propagate towards the downstream the first contact between the dam break flow and solid boundaries occurred at about 0 23s this impact which can be defined as the dynamic generated a sudden deformation on elastic boundaries then a relaxation on the solid body was observed until the second impact moment by the second contact at about 0 37s another dynamic deformation occurred for a short period and the generation of hydraulic jump and the spilling type wave break was observed shortly after that time while a part of the dam break waves started to reflect towards upstream the other part traveled towards downstream of the elastic solid by the raising of the water level behind the elastic solid static impacts became more dominant at the pressure forces that enforce the solid boundaries the plate reached maximum deformation under the static forces and then a relaxation was observed depending on the water level behind the gate by the time furthermore as expected some leakage occurred between the rigid walls and the elastic plate edges fig 14 it can be expected that leakage causes some pressure reduction on the solid boundaries but it is considered that this effect is limited dynamic deformations between 0 2s and 0 4s and vibrations between the 0 4s 0 8 s at four measurement points are compatible in both of two repeated experimental measurements also measurements of the water level evolution by the time were compared for repeated two experiments and results were shown in fig 16 the measurement points p1 is at the upstream and p2 and p3 are in behind and front of the elastic plate at p1 where relatively lower fluctuations occurred on the flow free surface the results of the two experimental measurements are highly compatible at p2 and p3 where relatively higher fluctuations occurred the agreement between the experimental measurements is reasonable except for little deviations these results prove the stability of the experiment in the context of the experimental repeatability and exhibit the usability of the presented experimental data as a benchmark case 5 3 2 comparisons of the experimental measurements with sph fem results numerical analysis of the phenomenon was performed using the present sph fem model of ls dyna for 2s while the fluid phase of the problem is modeled with the sph using the parameters in section 5 1 the solid phase with the mechanical properties presented in section 5 2 is based on the fem the frames of the numerical and experimental results at various time steps are shown in fig 17 with pressure von mises stress fields for fluid and solid subdomains respectively the measured and computed horizontal displacements of the elastic plate are plotted in fig 18 it is observed that both dynamic and static impacts of the phenomenon are reproduced by the current sph fem model with reasonable accuracy however it is drawn attention that the oscillations on the solid plate caused by complex fluid motion with hydraulic jump and wave breaking generate a little differentiation between the experimental and numerical results at t 0 45 0 8s the present numerical model results show higher oscillations on the plate displacement in this period than the experimental one the possible reason can be the parametric sensitivity of sph discussed in section 5 1 therefore a detailed parametric study is needed to investigate the effects of the parameters of the sph model on the plate oscillations for the present phenomenon in addition to this the air cavity formed at the violent free surface motion of the hydraulic jump and wave breaking may cause significant changes in the plate oscillations while the present sph model has a single phase of fluid the effect of the air cavity on the numerical results can be investigated using two phase numerical models also as reported in section 5 3 1 some leakage occurred between the elastic plate and rigid walls of the rectangular tank during the experiments whereas this situation does not cause a significant effect on the main deformation characteristics of the elastic plate it could be a reason for the differentiation of oscillating discussed above the pressure stressyy fields for fluid and solid sub domains at various times are shown in fig 19 in which stressyy represents the stress component along the y axis from fig 19 it can be seen clearly that the present sph fem method provided a smooth pressure stress field in the numerical computations the comparison results of the water level evolution by the time between the experimental measurements and numerical computations are presented in fig 20 in addition to this water levels at three measurement points for the previous case without gate are also presented in the figure at p1 located upstream it is observed that the presented numerical model reproduced the experimental measurements with reasonable accuracy except for a phase difference in the reflection wave at the numerical computation wave propagation velocity is lower than the experimental one and this caused a little delay at the rise of the water level also compared to the dam break case without the gate it is not observed a distinctive difference between the experimental results until the reflection wave at p2 it is observed that the present sph fem model captures reasonable accuracy except for a little deviation between the experimental measurements and numerical computations in the water height at about 1 2s caused by reflection wave front shape in the numerical model results the wave crest is not as apparent as the experimental one also it is observed that the presence of the gate did not generate a significant effect on the water height data until the reflection wave reaches this point after that point the water height decreased in the case without the gate while an increase occurred with the reflection wave in the case with the gate at p3 it is observed that little fluctuations occurred in the experimental results caused by the contact between the free surface of fluid and plate these fluctuations are not dominant in the numerical results as well as the experiments however there is a reasonable accuracy between the experimental and numerical results for the case without the gate as expected water height remains at higher levels than the case with the gate 6 conclusions this paper presents a newly designed experimental setup based on the interaction between the dam break flow and an elastic sluice gate in the context of the hydroelasticity problems the present experimental setup involves a dam break flow with hydraulic jump and spilling type wave break and the interaction of this flow with an elastic sluice gate with these dynamics it is considered that the presented setup is a useful benchmark case to investigate the efficiency of the numerical methods in the modeling of hydroelasticity problems as the experimental measurements the deformation of the elastic plate at the four different points and the water level evolution by the time calculated from digital video images were used the experiment was repeated two times to ensure the stability and accuracy of the experimental measurements and it was observed that compared measurements showed well agreement the present phenomenon was also numerically simulated using the coupled sph fem model of ls dyna in which the fluid phase is based on the sph whereas the solid phase fem the solution accuracy of the present sph model in the modeling of free surface flows was investigated using the experimental and numerical results of a well known dam break case and an experimental study of the dam break flow over the dry bed results demonstrated that the present sph model showed a reasonable accuracy in the modeling of the fluid motions then the method was coupled fem using a penalty based contact algorithm of ls dyna and used to simulate the presented hydroelasticity phenomenon finally the obtained numerical computations were compared with experimental data and it was observed that the present sph fem model of ls dyna reproduced the experimental data with reasonable accuracy however it should be noted that the present coupling procedure is featured by the absence of any boundary treatment scheme using the sph formalism i e the sph kernel support remains truncated and the continuity equation is not affected by this fluid solid coupling in future works the effect of the present coupling scheme on the numerical results can be investigated by using different numerical methods and formulations credit authorship contribution statement ada yilmaz

20732,this paper provides a numerical investigation into the effect of the wavy leading edge on the flow structures and noise of a hydrofoil naca0012 hydrofoils with straight and wavy leading edges denoted by sle and wle respectively are simulated the simulations are performed using the large eddy simulation approach to obtain the near field unsteady flow properties and the ffowcs williams hawkings equation to predict far field noise the numerical results at reynolds number of 2 5 10 5 show that the fluctuating amplitude of the lift and drag coefficient decreases after the wavy structure is applied to the leading edge and the flow field around the hydrofoil is changed due to the streamwise vortices generated in each trough by the pressure gradient of the leading edge in addition the wavy leading edge can effectively reduce or even eliminate the tonal noise of the foil without significantly changing the noise directivity moreover the effect of inlet velocities on noise reduction is studied with three different velocities 1 2 5 and 4 8 m s it is found that at the higher velocity of the three the wle has a better inhibition effect on lift fluctuation and a better noise reduction effect keywords hydrodynamic noise reduction flow structure wavy leading edge computational fluid dynamics ffowcs williams hawkings equation 1 introduction hydrodynamic noise of underwater vehicle is a serious problem in many engineering applications its reduction and monitoring is a very important aspect of the performance of underwater acoustic system and it can be used for ship habitability of crew and underwater organisms the impact of noise from modern marine civilization on marine ecosystems is often neglected but it is beginning to be considered as a problem worthy of further study a foil is one of the most widely used components in various structures like propeller and vehicle appendages so the research on hydrofoil noise reduction is of great significance the aim of the present study is to investigate the mechanisms of hydrodynamic noise from the foil and measures for noise reduction in recent years wavy leading edge modifications on foils have attracted extensive attentions as a new passive control technique the wavy leading edge wle was inspired by the leading edge tubercles of the humpback whale which are believed to help the whale to execute rolls and loops under water in particular at high attack angles wle has become the focus of much research to explore its benefits in terms of improved aerodynamic and or hydrodynamic performance the idea of applying wle on foil was firstly presented by marine biologists fish and battle 1995 in 1995 following the investigations of fish and battle many researchers studied the aerodynamic characteristics of the wavy leading edge foil the aerodynamic performance capabilities of the flippers with the addition of the leading edge tubercles were studied by miklosovic et al 2004 in a wind tunnel the presence of the tubercles delays stall to higher angle by about 40 increases maximum lift by 6 and decreases drag up to 32 their experimental were corroborated by the numerical simulation performed by carreira pedro and kobayashi 2008 through the des detached eddy simulation method guerreiro and sousa 2012 experimentally examined the effect of reynolds numbers on the flow over the wle and indicated that the lift force of the wle case is less sensitive to reynolds numbers in comparison to the baseline model yoon et al 2011 numerically investigated the effect of wavy leading edge with different waviness ratio on the hydrodynamic characteristics for flow around the wing over a wide range of angles of attack hansen et al 2016 investigated the formation and evolution of streamwise vortices at a low reynolds number of r e 2230 through experimental and numerical study it shows that the formation of streamwise vortices is related to the pressure gradient at the leading edge and the performance of a foil with tubercles is slightly better than that of an unmodified foil according to the investigation from custodio 2007 the flow past each protuberance is periodic and symmetric at small attack angles but when some critical attack angle is exceeded the flow field is no longer periodic from peak to peak and valley to valley but is now bi periodic this phenomenon is also reported to occur computationally by câmara and sousa 2013 wei et al 2015 2019 experimentally studied leading edge tubercles performances for r e 1 4 1 0 4 and showed that the leading edge tubercles can mitigate flow separation and streamwise counter rotating vortex pairs are generated over tubercles the wle has attracted great attention for its possible wide applications e g wind turbine zhang and wu 2012 huang et al 2015 delta wings goruney and rockwell 2009 chen and wang 2014 micro aviation vehicles guerreiro and sousa 2012 xingwei et al 2013 and rudders paul et al 2010 the noise reduction with wle has been the subject of many experimental hansen et al 2010 narayanan et al 2015 chaitanya et al 2017 juknevicius and chong 2018 numerical lau et al 2013 kim et al 2016 casalino et al 2019 and theoretical lyu and azarpeyvand 2017 mathews and peake 2018 studies hansen et al hansen et al 2010 experimentally studied the effect of wavy leading edge on laminar boundary layer noise of naca0021 airfoil it was found that increasing the amplitude and decreasing the wavelength can improve noise reduction effect narayanan et al 2015 provides an experimental investigation into the use of leading edge le serrations as a means of reducing the broadband noise generated due to the interaction between the airfoil s le and impinging turbulence it was observed that the sound power reduction level is sensitive to the amplitude of the le serrations but less sensitive to the serration wavelength chaitanya et al 2017 investigated the effectiveness of sinusoidal leading edge serrations on airfoils for the reduction of the noise generated by the interaction with turbulent flow an optimum serration wavelength was identified whereby maximum noise reductions are obtained corresponding to when the transverse integral length scale is approximately one fourth the serration wavelength kim et al 2016 investigated the reduction of ati airfoil turbulence interaction noise by using a wle geometry subjected to impinging turbulence that is synthetically generated in the upstream zone freestream mach number of 0 24 based on high order accurate compressible euler simulations with a flat plate airfoil casalino et al 2019 applied the sinusoidal serrations to the leading edge of the vanes of a realistic fan stage and reported the influence of the serrations on the acoustic far field and noise power level lyu and azarpeyvand 2017 provided results that the destructive sound interference is the primary noise reduction mechanism of the leading edge serration and the leading edge serration can effectively reduce the far field noise at even high mach numbers the aforementioned discussions demonstrate that the wle is a effective treatment for improving the aerodynamic performance and reducing noise however most of the previous studies have focused on the air and there have been few studies on underwater conditions considering the great difference in compressibility and viscosity between water and air it is necessary to study the underwater noise reduction application of the wle and its noise reduction mechanism this paper is structured and written in the following order the numerical methods for flow field and acoustic field used in this study are introduced in section 2 in section 3 the hydrofoil model and the computational setup are presented the hydrodynamic and the hydroacoustic results are discussed in section 4 in section 5 the effect of inlet velocity on noise reduction is presented finally some conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 numerical methodology large eddy simulations les were performed first to simulation hydrodynamic characteristics and sound pressure levels at the observer points were then calculated from the fluctuating surface pressure on the hydrofoils based on the ffowcs williams and hawkings fw h equation 2 1 numerical method for flow field large eddy simulation method is a turbulent numerical simulation method between direct numerical simulation dns and unsteady reynold s averaged navier stokes urans which can capture accurate flow characteristics such as vortex shedding and can obtain more accurate flow field results which is suitable for the flow field calculation of hydrodynamic noise problems large eddy simulation theory divides turbulence into large scale and small scale eddies by spatial filtering large scale eddies dominate the transport of momentum and energy while small scale eddies are mainly responsible for the dissipation of turbulent energy in les large scale eddies are directly simulated and the influence of small scale eddies on large scale eddies motion is simulated through subgrid scale sgs stress model the filtered continuity and reynold s averaged navier stokes equations are given as follows 1 ρ t

smagorinsky 1963 lilly 1992 2 2 far field noise prediction the acoustic analogy employed within the current work is that of williams and hawkings 1969 who extended the analogies of lighthill 1952 and curle 1955 to consider the presence of a surface in arbitrary motion the fw h acoustic analogy equation can be written in the following frequency domain form 3 1 a 0 2 2 p t 2 2 p 2 x i x j t i j h f

to ensure the accuracy of cfd combined with acoustic analogy in predicting flow noise jacob s wind tunnel experiment on interference noise of cylindrical airfoil was used as a jacob et al 2005 and the calculated results were compared with the experimental results the experiment was carried out in the large anechoic wind tunnel at ecole centrale de lyon and the set up of the experiment is shown in fig 1 in the reference configuration a symmetric naca0012 foil chord c 100 mm at zero angle of attack was located one chord downstream of a circular rod d 10 mm with both extending by 300 mm in the spanwise direction the inlet velocity is 72 m s and the noise test point is 1 85 m above the airfoil center in the mid pan plane the previous numerical investigations performed on the rod airfoil configuration investigated that the sound radiated by the rod airfoil configuration could be computed on a reduced spanwise length lower than the coherence length eltaweel and wang 2011 therefore a reduced span length of 36 mm is used in the present study and the periodic boundary condition is imposed in the spanwise direction the computational domain and boundary conditions are shown in fig 2 and the grid around the rod and airfoil is shown in fig 3 in jacob s experiment the spanwise length of cylinder and airfoil is 30 d in this paper the spanwise length is 3 6 d in order to compare with the experimental results it is necessary to correct the sound pressure level of the numerical results in this paper we adopt the spanwise correction formula of trigonometric function with correlation function as follow 4 spl e x p spl s i n 10 log 10 3 l e x p l c 3 l s i n l c l c l s i n 5 spl e x p spl s i n 20 log 10 l c l s i n 10 log 10 3 l e x p l c 3 l c l s i n l s i n l c l e x p 6 spl e

c is the spanwise coherence length for the shedding frequency in the present study l c is equal to 6d therefore the spanwise correction is 12 096 db according to eq 5 the numerical simulation result is compared with jacob s experiments and eltaweel s eltaweel and wang 2011 and giret s giret et al 2012 results as shown in fig 4 it can be seen from the comparison that the simulation results are in good agreement with the experiments and the peak noise and frequency are captured accurately because of the limits of computer performance the spl at low frequency band is not agreement greatly with the experiment 3 hydrofoil models and computational set up 3 1 hydrofoil models the wavy leading edge foil was presented in fig 5 the outline is the naca0012 hydrofoil profile with an average chord c of 100 mm and a span of 36 mm the wavy leading edge is in the form of sinusoidal profile of wavelength w 8 mm and amplitude a 2 mm 3 2 computational set up and boundary conditions the computational domain and boundary conditions are illustrated in fig 6 a the foil is located at the origin of the coordinate system and the x y z represent the streamwise crosswise and spanwise directions respectively the computational domain extends from 6 c to 8 c in the streamwise direction and from 6 c to 6 c in the crosswise direction the spanwise length is equal to 36 mm the spanwise side boundaries are set as the periodic boundary condition the velocity inlet is used for the inlet with the velocity u 2 5 m s corresponding to a reynolds number re of 2 5 10 5 and the pressure outlet is set for the outlet a no slip boundary condition is applied on the foil surface as shown in fig 6 a c grid topology with structured hexahedral elements is constructed for the computational domain in this paper les is adopted to simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics which requires a very fine near wall spacing with y 1 the grid expansion ratio perpendicular to the wall direction is 1 1 to ensure that there are enough grid nodes in the boundary layer the mesh around the leading and trailing edge is refined and the total number of nodes of sle and wle are 3 826 400 and 5 122 008 respectively the spatially filtered navier stokes equations are solved using the semi implicit method for simplec algorithm the discrete format of spatial gradient terms is element based least squares method the discrete scheme of momentum equation is a bounded central difference scheme bounded second order implicit scheme is used to solve transient formulas the subgrid scale eddy viscosity is computed by the smagorinsky lilly model the time step is 2 1 0 5 s in this paper 3 3 grid independence and accuracy test hexahedral grids are employed to discretize the computational domain a grid independence study is conducted on the sle and wle foil by examining the drag coefficient of three different meshing schemes the drag coefficient c d at the angle of attack of zero was calculated by 7 c d f d 1 2 ρ u 2 c l where l is the spanwise length of the foil and f d is the drag force in order to check the influence of grid resolution three different computational grids g1 to g3 have been considered for sle and wle respectively in table 1 the difference of drag coefficient in g2 and g3 is 0 61 for sle and 1 2 for the wle case g2 is selected for sle and wle case in view of the accuracy of calculations and computational efficiency for both cases 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrodynamic results the drag coefficient is calculated according to eq 7 and the lift coefficient is defined as follow 8 c l f l 1 2 ρ u 2 c l where f l is the lift force fig 7 shows time histories of the hydrodynamic force coefficients of the sle and wle case at the flow time 1 0 1 1 s form the figure it can be seen that the curves of the drag and lift coefficient for the sle case fluctuate periodically for the wle case the lift coefficient curve slightly fluctuates at random along a fixed value and the fluctuation amplitude of the wle case is significantly lower than that of sle case the average lift coefficients of sle and wle are close to each other both approximate to 0 compared with sle the drag coefficient of the wle case no longer fluctuates periodically and the drag value decreases obviously from the instantaneous drag and lift coefficients we proceed to compute the power spectral density psd of them as shown in fig 8 it is seen that the psds of drag and lift coefficient of the sle have a sharp peak around a frequency of 283 2 and 140 8 hz respectively while the wle can suppress the tonal component the reduction of the unsteady force can be associated with the flow separation and vortex shedding which is consistent with the flow features that have been found and shown in section 4 3 contours of pressure distribution on foil suction surface are shown in fig 9 from the figure it can be seen that a large spanwise pressure gradient is produced by the wle along the span a periodicity of the pressure distribution along the span is observed for the wle case with a low pressure region located just downstream of the wavy leading edge trough the pressure gradient at the peak and trough promotes the flow of fluid to the trough and forms a spanwise flow there is a strong pressure gradient near the leading edge which will result in streamwise vortices between wle peaks as shown in fig 18 figs 10 and 11 show the flow and normal velocity contours of the sle and wle case on the plane z 18 mm respectively as can be seen from fig 10 the addition of wle changes the velocity attenuation mode of sle in flow direction and reduces the velocity gradient in the wake of the foil in fig 11 the velocity fluctuation of the wle model in the y direction is significantly reduced at the leading edge compared with the sle and the normal velocity attenuation mode in the wake is changed while the velocity gradient of fluid in the wake decreases the decrease of the velocity fluctuation intensity in the neighborhood of the trailing edge is essentially due to the control of vortex shedding mode by the wle fig 12 is the contours of instantaneous velocity in normal direction on the plane x 5 mm because the hydrofoils with and without wle are both symmetrical when the fluid flows through the leading edge of the foil the velocity of the two sides of the foil is uniform and symmetrical in the direction perpendicular to the incoming flow under the two conditions the fluid above the foil possesses positive wall normal velocity whilst below the foil the wall normal velocity is mostly negative unlike the sle case after the fluid flows through the wle foil the normal velocity increases at the bottom of the trough due to the restriction of the wall on the leading edge fig 13 is the contours of instantaneous velocity in spanwise direction on plane x 5 mm with the addition of wavy leading edge the foil has a spanwise velocity gradient and the spanwise velocity on both sides of the trough is reversed therefore there is a pair of counter rotating vortices in each trough both the normal and spanwise velocity distributions of the wle case show periodicity along the leading edge 4 2 acoustic results the far field noise is calculated by solving the ffowcs williams and hawkings fw h equation due to the low mach number the contribution of quadrupole sources is not very significant thus only the solid foil surface is chosen as noise source the sound pressure level spl spectra by fast fourier transform fft at the observer points are computed sound pressure level in the far field is defined in the following equation 9 spl f 10 log s p p f p r e f 2 where s p p f is the sound pressure psd power spectral density and p r e f 1 1 0 6 pa is the reference acoustic pressure underwater the distribution of acoustic observer points is shown in fig 14 the seven observer points are located on the mid section of the foil z 18 mm and the distance from the center of the foil is r 1 m the comparison of sound pressure level spectra generated by sle and wle case with a frequency step size of 20 hz at the seven observer points are illustrated in fig 15 it is observed that the sound pressure levels at point 1 and 7 are very low the wle has the effect of noise reduction compared with sle case at point 1 when the frequency is between 500 2000 hz for observation point 7 the noise reduction effect of wle is obvious in the frequency range of 300 2000 hz for the sle case the peak noise frequencies at the four observation points 2 6 are the same all of which are 139 88 hz corresponding to the characteristic frequency of lift coefficient f 140 8 hz the peak noise at observation point 4 is the largest which is 72 76 db it can also be observed that there is a second peak at frequency 437 12 hz about three times of the frequency of lift coefficient therefore the foil tonal noise is associated with the vortex shedding process and the von kármán vortex street is shed with the same frequency as the tonal noise compared with the sle case the tonal noise of the wle case is reduced significantly at all the four observe points 2 6 it can been seen from fig 15 that there is almost no tonal noise at the four observe points when the frequency is lower than 110 hz wle will increase the hydrofoil noise but when the frequency is higher than 110 hz wle will obviously inhibit the hydrofoil noise the trend of the spl spectrum of wle case is the same with sle condition in middle and high frequency the overall sound pressure level oaspl directivity pattern is shown in fig 16 as can be seen the wavy leading edge does not change the directivity pattern of the basic foil the results show that oaspls around the wle at the seven observe points are below those of sle 10 5724 13 257 db the oaspl reduction of wle at three points 0 1 m 1 m and 1 85 m away from the foil mid span and mid chord is shown in table 2 it can be seen that the oaspl reduction increases with the distance away from the foil at 1 85 m the noise reduction reached a maximum of 11 224 db 4 3 flow features analysis fig 17 shows the iso surface of zero streamwise velocity on upper surface the iso surface is the position where the flow direction reverses thus shows the interface between the attached and separated flow regions the light blue areas indicate separated flow regions and the dark blue areas represent the attached regions it can be seen that the flow separation of sle is characterized by laminar separation after the introduction of the wle the flow tends to remain attached to the behind the peak and the separation is limited to the different regions behind the trough the reduced size of the separation region explains the improved aerodynamic performance the contour of streamwise vorticity for wle is shown in fig 18 and streamwise vortices over four different streamwise slices x c 0 05 0 15 0 3 0 6 are shown in the figure it can been seen that the wle can induce counter rotating streamwise vortex pairs in each trough and the magnitude of the streamwise vorticity decreases with distance from the leading edge increases as a result of this low momentum fluid particles near the wall surface deflect and are transported from peak to trough the near wall region above the peak is filled with high momentum fluid transported downward from the upper region of the boundary layer explaining why the first separation occurred behind the trough the instantaneous flow structures for the sle and wle are shown in fig 19 these are represented by the iso surface of the q criterion which is colored by the streamwise velocity the q criterion is defined as 10 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where ω is the vorticity and s is the rate of strain as shown in fig 19 a for the sle case laminar boundary layers develop to tube shaped wake vortices while for the wle case the shedding vortices evolve into finely divided vortices in the wake fig 19 b shows the comparison of the vortices on the suction surface of sle and wle it can be observed that compared with the sle case the shedding vortices for wle are no longer in the same position in the spanwise direction but are distributed in a wavy shape and finally break and separate into small vortices as a result it can be concluded that the addition of the wle will break up the large spanwise coherent structures into smaller ones for the sle case the flow separation is characterized by laminar separation and the wake vortices are mainly large scale tubular vortices which induce the periodic fluctuating forces acting on the hydrofoil so there is a tonal noise whose frequency is corresponding to the characteristic frequency of the lift when a wavy structure is applied to the leading edge a pressure gradient along the span will be generated and a low pressure spot will appear after the trough which makes the fluid flow from the peak to the trough and generate counter rotating streamwise vortices in each trough the generation of the streamwise vortices enhances the exchange of momentum in the boundary layer affects the stability of the boundary layer makes the separation of the boundary layer restricted behind the trough and makes large vortices decompose into small vortices therefore the periodicity of hydrodynamic force fluctuation is destroved and the tonal noise as well as the acceptance of the boundary layer to external acoustic excitation are reduced 5 effect of inlet velocity on noise reduction in this section results from different inlet velocities 1 2 5 and 4 8 m s are considered to study the effect of velocity on noise reduction of wle the summary of results is presented in tables 3 and 4 in addition the time histories of lift and drag coefficients of sle and wle at u 1 m s and u 4 8 m s are shown in fig 20 from tables 3 and 4 it can be seen that the mean and rms root mean square values of the drag coefficient is equal science the fluctuation of drag coefficient is very small and almost negligible for the sle case the mean and rms values of the drag coefficient decrease with the increase of velocity and rms value of the lift coefficient increase with velocity for the wle case the mean and rms values of the drag coefficient also decrease with the increase of velocity which is consistent with that of sle the rms value of the lift coefficient increase with the inflow velocity at the velocity of 1 m s the mean and rms value of the drag coefficient of wle is increased compared to sle when the velocity is increased to 2 5 and 4 8 m s the mean and rms values of the drag coefficient are reduced by 3 05 and 11 76 respectively at the three speeds the rms value of the lift coefficient is significantly reduced which is reduced by 0 0105 0 0154 and 0 0179 respectively the time histories of lift and drag coefficients for sle and wle case at the three velocities are shown in figs 7 and 20 from the figures it can be seen that the lift coefficient fluctuation of wle is significantly lower than that of sle case which is consistent with the conclusions drawn from the table above comparing the lift coefficient of sle at different velocities it can be seen that the period of the lift coefficient decreases with the increase of the velocity which means that the period of vortex shedding from the trailing edge is shorten as the same of the velocity 2 5 m s the psds of the lift coefficient at the velocity 1 m s and 4 8 m s are also computed as shown in fig 21 at the velocity of 1 m s the vortex shedding period is 0 01905s and the corresponding characteristic frequency is 52 49 hz when the velocity is increased to 2 5 m s the characteristic frequency of the shedding vortex becomes 140 8 hz when the velocity reaches 4 8 m s the vortex shedding is more frequent and the characteristic frequency is 292 hz it can also be founded that when the velocity increases from 1 to 4 8 m s the suppression of lift coefficient fluctuation by wle also increases from fig 22 it can be seen that the sound pressure levels at the three velocities are dominated by tonal noise as the velocity increases the sle sound pressure level increases and the peak frequency shifts back the peak frequency of the spl at u 1 m s is 54 04 hz which is basically the same as the shedding frequency of the vortices at high frequencies the spl spectrum has a hump structure and the peak noise is about 11 19 db at 1334 23 hz when the velocity is increased to 2 5 m s the main tonal noise is 72 76 db at 139 88 hz and the second tonal noise is 52 04 db at 437 12 hz there is no hump structure at high frequency compared with 1 m s the spl of the baseline foil at 2 5 m s increases significantly at medium and low frequencies when the velocity reaches 4 8 m s the peak noise of the main tonal noise and the secondary tonal noise increase to 88 53 db and 68 25 db respectively the main difference between spl spectrum at 4 8 m s and 2 5 m s is the increase of peak noise the spls of wle at three velocities are shown in fig 23 it can be seen that the wavy leading edge can totally suppress tonal noise and display as turbulent boundary layer broadband noise features however the sound pressure level spectrum of wle with velocity 1 m s still has a hump structure at high frequencies and the wavy leading edge can hardly suppress this noise the oaspl reduction of wle at the five points with three different inflow velocities is shown in table 5 as can be seen from the figure oaspl is reduced 6 205 db at 1m s the noise reduction of wle case is 10 888 db at a velocity of 2 5 m s when the inflow velocity increases to 4 8 m s the oaspl is decreased by 12 871 db due to the action of wavy leading edge from the table it can been seen that the decrease of oaspl increases with the increase of velocity 6 conclusions in this paper a hybrid les fw h acoustic analogy method has been applied to study the effect of wavy leading edge wle on hydrodynamic performance and flow noise at the zero angle of attack at r e 2 5 1 0 5 the hydrofoils with straight leading edge sle and wavy leading edge are presented firstly the hydrodynamic coefficients and flow structures of the sle and wle cases are investigated then the underwater noise of the wle case is predicted and compared with that of the sle case furthermore the association between the flow physics and noise reduction is analyzed finally the effect of the inflow velocity on noise reduction of wle is studied with three different velocities u 1 m s u 2 5 m s and u 4 8 m s the following conclusions are made based our numerical results 1 different from the periodic fluctuation of sle the lift and drag coefficients of wle fluctuate freely along a fixed value and the fluctuation amplitudes decrease in addition the application of the wle causes the pressure gradient along the spanwise direction of the hydrofoil causes the fluid to flow from peak to trough and changes the attenuation mode of the fluid velocity in the wake 2 benefiting from the addition of wle the tonal noise of sle is effectively reduced or even eliminated and the broadband noise is also reduced to a certain extent the addition of wle reduces the oaspl of sle by at least 10 5724 db but has no effect on the directivity of the oaspl of sle 3 for the sle the flow separation is characterized by laminar separation and the fluid develops to tube shaped vortices in the wake of the foil the existence of wle induces counter rotating streamwise vortex pairs in each trough which enhances the momentum exchange in the boundary layer limits the flow separation behind the trough and makes large vortices decompose into small vortices thus the fluctuation of lift and drag coefficient is decreased and the noise is effectively reduced 4 the effect of inlet velocities on noise reduction is studied the noise performance at three velocities of 1 m s 2 5 m s and 4 8 m s was simulated separately it is investigated that at the higher one of the three velocities wle has a better inhibition effect on lift coefficient fluctuation and has a better noise reduction effect

20732,this paper provides a numerical investigation into the effect of the wavy leading edge on the flow structures and noise of a hydrofoil naca0012 hydrofoils with straight and wavy leading edges denoted by sle and wle respectively are simulated the simulations are performed using the large eddy simulation approach to obtain the near field unsteady flow properties and the ffowcs williams hawkings equation to predict far field noise the numerical results at reynolds number of 2 5 10 5 show that the fluctuating amplitude of the lift and drag coefficient decreases after the wavy structure is applied to the leading edge and the flow field around the hydrofoil is changed due to the streamwise vortices generated in each trough by the pressure gradient of the leading edge in addition the wavy leading edge can effectively reduce or even eliminate the tonal noise of the foil without significantly changing the noise directivity moreover the effect of inlet velocities on noise reduction is studied with three different velocities 1 2 5 and 4 8 m s it is found that at the higher velocity of the three the wle has a better inhibition effect on lift fluctuation and a better noise reduction effect keywords hydrodynamic noise reduction flow structure wavy leading edge computational fluid dynamics ffowcs williams hawkings equation 1 introduction hydrodynamic noise of underwater vehicle is a serious problem in many engineering applications its reduction and monitoring is a very important aspect of the performance of underwater acoustic system and it can be used for ship habitability of crew and underwater organisms the impact of noise from modern marine civilization on marine ecosystems is often neglected but it is beginning to be considered as a problem worthy of further study a foil is one of the most widely used components in various structures like propeller and vehicle appendages so the research on hydrofoil noise reduction is of great significance the aim of the present study is to investigate the mechanisms of hydrodynamic noise from the foil and measures for noise reduction in recent years wavy leading edge modifications on foils have attracted extensive attentions as a new passive control technique the wavy leading edge wle was inspired by the leading edge tubercles of the humpback whale which are believed to help the whale to execute rolls and loops under water in particular at high attack angles wle has become the focus of much research to explore its benefits in terms of improved aerodynamic and or hydrodynamic performance the idea of applying wle on foil was firstly presented by marine biologists fish and battle 1995 in 1995 following the investigations of fish and battle many researchers studied the aerodynamic characteristics of the wavy leading edge foil the aerodynamic performance capabilities of the flippers with the addition of the leading edge tubercles were studied by miklosovic et al 2004 in a wind tunnel the presence of the tubercles delays stall to higher angle by about 40 increases maximum lift by 6 and decreases drag up to 32 their experimental were corroborated by the numerical simulation performed by carreira pedro and kobayashi 2008 through the des detached eddy simulation method guerreiro and sousa 2012 experimentally examined the effect of reynolds numbers on the flow over the wle and indicated that the lift force of the wle case is less sensitive to reynolds numbers in comparison to the baseline model yoon et al 2011 numerically investigated the effect of wavy leading edge with different waviness ratio on the hydrodynamic characteristics for flow around the wing over a wide range of angles of attack hansen et al 2016 investigated the formation and evolution of streamwise vortices at a low reynolds number of r e 2230 through experimental and numerical study it shows that the formation of streamwise vortices is related to the pressure gradient at the leading edge and the performance of a foil with tubercles is slightly better than that of an unmodified foil according to the investigation from custodio 2007 the flow past each protuberance is periodic and symmetric at small attack angles but when some critical attack angle is exceeded the flow field is no longer periodic from peak to peak and valley to valley but is now bi periodic this phenomenon is also reported to occur computationally by câmara and sousa 2013 wei et al 2015 2019 experimentally studied leading edge tubercles performances for r e 1 4 1 0 4 and showed that the leading edge tubercles can mitigate flow separation and streamwise counter rotating vortex pairs are generated over tubercles the wle has attracted great attention for its possible wide applications e g wind turbine zhang and wu 2012 huang et al 2015 delta wings goruney and rockwell 2009 chen and wang 2014 micro aviation vehicles guerreiro and sousa 2012 xingwei et al 2013 and rudders paul et al 2010 the noise reduction with wle has been the subject of many experimental hansen et al 2010 narayanan et al 2015 chaitanya et al 2017 juknevicius and chong 2018 numerical lau et al 2013 kim et al 2016 casalino et al 2019 and theoretical lyu and azarpeyvand 2017 mathews and peake 2018 studies hansen et al hansen et al 2010 experimentally studied the effect of wavy leading edge on laminar boundary layer noise of naca0021 airfoil it was found that increasing the amplitude and decreasing the wavelength can improve noise reduction effect narayanan et al 2015 provides an experimental investigation into the use of leading edge le serrations as a means of reducing the broadband noise generated due to the interaction between the airfoil s le and impinging turbulence it was observed that the sound power reduction level is sensitive to the amplitude of the le serrations but less sensitive to the serration wavelength chaitanya et al 2017 investigated the effectiveness of sinusoidal leading edge serrations on airfoils for the reduction of the noise generated by the interaction with turbulent flow an optimum serration wavelength was identified whereby maximum noise reductions are obtained corresponding to when the transverse integral length scale is approximately one fourth the serration wavelength kim et al 2016 investigated the reduction of ati airfoil turbulence interaction noise by using a wle geometry subjected to impinging turbulence that is synthetically generated in the upstream zone freestream mach number of 0 24 based on high order accurate compressible euler simulations with a flat plate airfoil casalino et al 2019 applied the sinusoidal serrations to the leading edge of the vanes of a realistic fan stage and reported the influence of the serrations on the acoustic far field and noise power level lyu and azarpeyvand 2017 provided results that the destructive sound interference is the primary noise reduction mechanism of the leading edge serration and the leading edge serration can effectively reduce the far field noise at even high mach numbers the aforementioned discussions demonstrate that the wle is a effective treatment for improving the aerodynamic performance and reducing noise however most of the previous studies have focused on the air and there have been few studies on underwater conditions considering the great difference in compressibility and viscosity between water and air it is necessary to study the underwater noise reduction application of the wle and its noise reduction mechanism this paper is structured and written in the following order the numerical methods for flow field and acoustic field used in this study are introduced in section 2 in section 3 the hydrofoil model and the computational setup are presented the hydrodynamic and the hydroacoustic results are discussed in section 4 in section 5 the effect of inlet velocity on noise reduction is presented finally some conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 numerical methodology large eddy simulations les were performed first to simulation hydrodynamic characteristics and sound pressure levels at the observer points were then calculated from the fluctuating surface pressure on the hydrofoils based on the ffowcs williams and hawkings fw h equation 2 1 numerical method for flow field large eddy simulation method is a turbulent numerical simulation method between direct numerical simulation dns and unsteady reynold s averaged navier stokes urans which can capture accurate flow characteristics such as vortex shedding and can obtain more accurate flow field results which is suitable for the flow field calculation of hydrodynamic noise problems large eddy simulation theory divides turbulence into large scale and small scale eddies by spatial filtering large scale eddies dominate the transport of momentum and energy while small scale eddies are mainly responsible for the dissipation of turbulent energy in les large scale eddies are directly simulated and the influence of small scale eddies on large scale eddies motion is simulated through subgrid scale sgs stress model the filtered continuity and reynold s averaged navier stokes equations are given as follows 1 ρ t

defined as l s m i n κ d c s v 1 3 where κ is the von kármán constant d is the distance to the closest wall and v is the volume of the computational cell the smagorinsky constant c s is equal to 0 1 smagorinsky 1963 lilly 1992 2 2 far field noise prediction the acoustic analogy employed within the current work is that of williams and hawkings 1969 who extended the analogies of lighthill 1952 and curle 1955 to consider the presence of a surface in arbitrary motion the fw h acoustic analogy equation can be written in the following frequency domain form 3 1 a 0 2 2 p t 2 2 p 2 x i x j t i j h f

to ensure the accuracy of cfd combined with acoustic analogy in predicting flow noise jacob s wind tunnel experiment on interference noise of cylindrical airfoil was used as a jacob et al 2005 and the calculated results were compared with the experimental results the experiment was carried out in the large anechoic wind tunnel at ecole centrale de lyon and the set up of the experiment is shown in fig 1 in the reference configuration a symmetric naca0012 foil chord c 100 mm at zero angle of attack was located one chord downstream of a circular rod d 10 mm with both extending by 300 mm in the spanwise direction the inlet velocity is 72 m s and the noise test point is 1 85 m above the airfoil center in the mid pan plane the previous numerical investigations performed on the rod airfoil configuration investigated that the sound radiated by the rod airfoil configuration could be computed on a reduced spanwise length lower than the coherence length eltaweel and wang 2011 therefore a reduced span length of 36 mm is used in the present study and the periodic boundary condition is imposed in the spanwise direction the computational domain and boundary conditions are shown in fig 2 and the grid around the rod and airfoil is shown in fig 3 in jacob s experiment the spanwise length of cylinder and airfoil is 30 d in this paper the spanwise length is 3 6 d in order to compare with the experimental results it is necessary to correct the sound pressure level of the numerical results in this paper we adopt the spanwise correction formula of trigonometric function with correlation function as follow 4 spl e x p spl s i n 10 log 10 3 l e x p l c 3 l s i n l c l c l s i n 5 spl e x p spl s i n 20 log 10 l c l s i n 10 log 10 3 l e x p l c 3 l c l s i n l s i n l c l e x p 6 spl e x p spl s i n 20 log 10 l e x p l s i n 10 log 10 3 l c l e x p 3 l c l s i n l e x p l c where l s i m is the spanwise extent in the simulation l e x p is the spanwise length in the experiment and l c is the spanwise coherence length for the shedding frequency in the present study l c is equal to 6d therefore the spanwise correction is 12 096 db according to eq 5 the numerical simulation result is compared with jacob s experiments and eltaweel s eltaweel and wang 2011 and giret s giret et al 2012 results as shown in fig 4 it can be seen from the comparison that the simulation results are in good agreement with the experiments and the peak noise and frequency are captured accurately because of the limits of computer performance the spl at low frequency band is not agreement greatly with the experiment 3 hydrofoil models and computational set up 3 1 hydrofoil models the wavy leading edge foil was presented in fig 5 the outline is the naca0012 hydrofoil profile with an average chord c of 100 mm and a span of 36 mm the wavy leading edge is in the form of sinusoidal profile of wavelength w 8 mm and amplitude a 2 mm 3 2 computational set up and boundary conditions the computational domain and boundary conditions are illustrated in fig 6 a the foil is located at the origin of the coordinate system and the x y z represent the streamwise crosswise and spanwise directions respectively the computational domain extends from 6 c to 8 c in the streamwise direction and from 6 c to 6 c in the crosswise direction the spanwise length is equal to 36 mm the spanwise side boundaries are set as the periodic boundary condition the velocity inlet is used for the inlet with the velocity u 2 5 m s corresponding to a reynolds number re of 2 5 10 5 and the pressure outlet is set for the outlet a no slip boundary condition is applied on the foil surface as shown in fig 6 a c grid topology with structured hexahedral elements is constructed for the computational domain in this paper les is adopted to simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics which requires a very fine near wall spacing with y 1 the grid expansion ratio perpendicular to the wall direction is 1 1 to ensure that there are enough grid nodes in the boundary layer the mesh around the leading and trailing edge is refined and the total number of nodes of sle and wle are 3 826 400 and 5 122 008 respectively the spatially filtered navier stokes equations are solved using the semi implicit method for simplec algorithm the discrete format of spatial gradient terms is element based least squares method the discrete scheme of momentum equation is a bounded central difference scheme bounded second order implicit scheme is used to solve transient formulas the subgrid scale eddy viscosity is computed by the smagorinsky lilly model the time step is 2 1 0 5 s in this paper 3 3 grid independence and accuracy test hexahedral grids are employed to discretize the computational domain a grid independence study is conducted on the sle and wle foil by examining the drag coefficient of three different meshing schemes the drag coefficient c d at the angle of attack of zero was calculated by 7 c d f d 1 2 ρ u 2 c l where l is the spanwise length of the foil and f d is the drag force in order to check the influence of grid resolution three different computational grids g1 to g3 have been considered for sle and wle respectively in table 1 the difference of drag coefficient in g2 and g3 is 0 61 for sle and 1 2 for the wle case g2 is selected for sle and wle case in view of the accuracy of calculations and computational efficiency for both cases 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrodynamic results the drag coefficient is calculated according to eq 7 and the lift coefficient is defined as follow 8 c l f l 1 2 ρ u 2 c l where f l is the lift force fig 7 shows time histories of the hydrodynamic force coefficients of the sle and wle case at the flow time 1 0 1 1 s form the figure it can be seen that the curves of the drag and lift coefficient for the sle case fluctuate periodically for the wle case the lift coefficient curve slightly fluctuates at random along a fixed value and the fluctuation amplitude of the wle case is significantly lower than that of sle case the average lift coefficients of sle and wle are close to each other both approximate to 0 compared with sle the drag coefficient of the wle case no longer fluctuates periodically and the drag value decreases obviously from the instantaneous drag and lift coefficients we proceed to compute the power spectral density psd of them as shown in fig 8 it is seen that the psds of drag and lift coefficient of the sle have a sharp peak around a frequency of 283 2 and 140 8 hz respectively while the wle can suppress the tonal component the reduction of the unsteady force can be associated with the flow separation and vortex shedding which is consistent with the flow features that have been found and shown in section 4 3 contours of pressure distribution on foil suction surface are shown in fig 9 from the figure it can be seen that a large spanwise pressure gradient is produced by the wle along the span a periodicity of the pressure distribution along the span is observed for the wle case with a low pressure region located just downstream of the wavy leading edge trough the pressure gradient at the peak and trough promotes the flow of fluid to the trough and forms a spanwise flow there is a strong pressure gradient near the leading edge which will result in streamwise vortices between wle peaks as shown in fig 18 figs 10 and 11 show the flow and normal velocity contours of the sle and wle case on the plane z 18 mm respectively as can be seen from fig 10 the addition of wle changes the velocity attenuation mode of sle in flow direction and reduces the velocity gradient in the wake of the foil in fig 11 the velocity fluctuation of the wle model in the y direction is significantly reduced at the leading edge compared with the sle and the normal velocity attenuation mode in the wake is changed while the velocity gradient of fluid in the wake decreases the decrease of the velocity fluctuation intensity in the neighborhood of the trailing edge is essentially due to the control of vortex shedding mode by the wle fig 12 is the contours of instantaneous velocity in normal direction on the plane x 5 mm because the hydrofoils with and without wle are both symmetrical when the fluid flows through the leading edge of the foil the velocity of the two sides of the foil is uniform and symmetrical in the direction perpendicular to the incoming flow under the two conditions the fluid above the foil possesses positive wall normal velocity whilst below the foil the wall normal velocity is mostly negative unlike the sle case after the fluid flows through the wle foil the normal velocity increases at the bottom of the trough due to the restriction of the wall on the leading edge fig 13 is the contours of instantaneous velocity in spanwise direction on plane x 5 mm with the addition of wavy leading edge the foil has a spanwise velocity gradient and the spanwise velocity on both sides of the trough is reversed therefore there is a pair of counter rotating vortices in each trough both the normal and spanwise velocity distributions of the wle case show periodicity along the leading edge 4 2 acoustic results the far field noise is calculated by solving the ffowcs williams and hawkings fw h equation due to the low mach number the contribution of quadrupole sources is not very significant thus only the solid foil surface is chosen as noise source the sound pressure level spl spectra by fast fourier transform fft at the observer points are computed sound pressure level in the far field is defined in the following equation 9 spl f 10 log s p p f p r e f 2 where s p p f is the sound pressure psd power spectral density and p r e f 1 1 0 6 pa is the reference acoustic pressure underwater the distribution of acoustic observer points is shown in fig 14 the seven observer points are located on the mid section of the foil z 18 mm and the distance from the center of the foil is r 1 m the comparison of sound pressure level spectra generated by sle and wle case with a frequency step size of 20 hz at the seven observer points are illustrated in fig 15 it is observed that the sound pressure levels at point 1 and 7 are very low the wle has the effect of noise reduction compared with sle case at point 1 when the frequency is between 500 2000 hz for observation point 7 the noise reduction effect of wle is obvious in the frequency range of 300 2000 hz for the sle case the peak noise frequencies at the four observation points 2 6 are the same all of which are 139 88 hz corresponding to the characteristic frequency of lift coefficient f 140 8 hz the peak noise at observation point 4 is the largest which is 72 76 db it can also be observed that there is a second peak at frequency 437 12 hz about three times of the frequency of lift coefficient therefore the foil tonal noise is associated with the vortex shedding process and the von kármán vortex street is shed with the same frequency as the tonal noise compared with the sle case the tonal noise of the wle case is reduced significantly at all the four observe points 2 6 it can been seen from fig 15 that there is almost no tonal noise at the four observe points when the frequency is lower than 110 hz wle will increase the hydrofoil noise but when the frequency is higher than 110 hz wle will obviously inhibit the hydrofoil noise the trend of the spl spectrum of wle case is the same with sle condition in middle and high frequency the overall sound pressure level oaspl directivity pattern is shown in fig 16 as can be seen the wavy leading edge does not change the directivity pattern of the basic foil the results show that oaspls around the wle at the seven observe points are below those of sle 10 5724 13 257 db the oaspl reduction of wle at three points 0 1 m 1 m and 1 85 m away from the foil mid span and mid chord is shown in table 2 it can be seen that the oaspl reduction increases with the distance away from the foil at 1 85 m the noise reduction reached a maximum of 11 224 db 4 3 flow features analysis fig 17 shows the iso surface of zero streamwise velocity on upper surface the iso surface is the position where the flow direction reverses thus shows the interface between the attached and separated flow regions the light blue areas indicate separated flow regions and the dark blue areas represent the attached regions it can be seen that the flow separation of sle is characterized by laminar separation after the introduction of the wle the flow tends to remain attached to the behind the peak and the separation is limited to the different regions behind the trough the reduced size of the separation region explains the improved aerodynamic performance the contour of streamwise vorticity for wle is shown in fig 18 and streamwise vortices over four different streamwise slices x c 0 05 0 15 0 3 0 6 are shown in the figure it can been seen that the wle can induce counter rotating streamwise vortex pairs in each trough and the magnitude of the streamwise vorticity decreases with distance from the leading edge increases as a result of this low momentum fluid particles near the wall surface deflect and are transported from peak to trough the near wall region above the peak is filled with high momentum fluid transported downward from the upper region of the boundary layer explaining why the first separation occurred behind the trough the instantaneous flow structures for the sle and wle are shown in fig 19 these are represented by the iso surface of the q criterion which is colored by the streamwise velocity the q criterion is defined as 10 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where ω is the vorticity and s is the rate of strain as shown in fig 19 a for the sle case laminar boundary layers develop to tube shaped wake vortices while for the wle case the shedding vortices evolve into finely divided vortices in the wake fig 19 b shows the comparison of the vortices on the suction surface of sle and wle it can be observed that compared with the sle case the shedding vortices for wle are no longer in the same position in the spanwise direction but are distributed in a wavy shape and finally break and separate into small vortices as a result it can be concluded that the addition of the wle will break up the large spanwise coherent structures into smaller ones for the sle case the flow separation is characterized by laminar separation and the wake vortices are mainly large scale tubular vortices which induce the periodic fluctuating forces acting on the hydrofoil so there is a tonal noise whose frequency is corresponding to the characteristic frequency of the lift when a wavy structure is applied to the leading edge a pressure gradient along the span will be generated and a low pressure spot will appear after the trough which makes the fluid flow from the peak to the trough and generate counter rotating streamwise vortices in each trough the generation of the streamwise vortices enhances the exchange of momentum in the boundary layer affects the stability of the boundary layer makes the separation of the boundary layer restricted behind the trough and makes large vortices decompose into small vortices therefore the periodicity of hydrodynamic force fluctuation is destroved and the tonal noise as well as the acceptance of the boundary layer to external acoustic excitation are reduced 5 effect of inlet velocity on noise reduction in this section results from different inlet velocities 1 2 5 and 4 8 m s are considered to study the effect of velocity on noise reduction of wle the summary of results is presented in tables 3 and 4 in addition the time histories of lift and drag coefficients of sle and wle at u 1 m s and u 4 8 m s are shown in fig 20 from tables 3 and 4 it can be seen that the mean and rms root mean square values of the drag coefficient is equal science the fluctuation of drag coefficient is very small and almost negligible for the sle case the mean and rms values of the drag coefficient decrease with the increase of velocity and rms value of the lift coefficient increase with velocity for the wle case the mean and rms values of the drag coefficient also decrease with the increase of velocity which is consistent with that of sle the rms value of the lift coefficient increase with the inflow velocity at the velocity of 1 m s the mean and rms value of the drag coefficient of wle is increased compared to sle when the velocity is increased to 2 5 and 4 8 m s the mean and rms values of the drag coefficient are reduced by 3 05 and 11 76 respectively at the three speeds the rms value of the lift coefficient is significantly reduced which is reduced by 0 0105 0 0154 and 0 0179 respectively the time histories of lift and drag coefficients for sle and wle case at the three velocities are shown in figs 7 and 20 from the figures it can be seen that the lift coefficient fluctuation of wle is significantly lower than that of sle case which is consistent with the conclusions drawn from the table above comparing the lift coefficient of sle at different velocities it can be seen that the period of the lift coefficient decreases with the increase of the velocity which means that the period of vortex shedding from the trailing edge is shorten as the same of the velocity 2 5 m s the psds of the lift coefficient at the velocity 1 m s and 4 8 m s are also computed as shown in fig 21 at the velocity of 1 m s the vortex shedding period is 0 01905s and the corresponding characteristic frequency is 52 49 hz when the velocity is increased to 2 5 m s the characteristic frequency of the shedding vortex becomes 140 8 hz when the velocity reaches 4 8 m s the vortex shedding is more frequent and the characteristic frequency is 292 hz it can also be founded that when the velocity increases from 1 to 4 8 m s the suppression of lift coefficient fluctuation by wle also increases from fig 22 it can be seen that the sound pressure levels at the three velocities are dominated by tonal noise as the velocity increases the sle sound pressure level increases and the peak frequency shifts back the peak frequency of the spl at u 1 m s is 54 04 hz which is basically the same as the shedding frequency of the vortices at high frequencies the spl spectrum has a hump structure and the peak noise is about 11 19 db at 1334 23 hz when the velocity is increased to 2 5 m s the main tonal noise is 72 76 db at 139 88 hz and the second tonal noise is 52 04 db at 437 12 hz there is no hump structure at high frequency compared with 1 m s the spl of the baseline foil at 2 5 m s increases significantly at medium and low frequencies when the velocity reaches 4 8 m s the peak noise of the main tonal noise and the secondary tonal noise increase to 88 53 db and 68 25 db respectively the main difference between spl spectrum at 4 8 m s and 2 5 m s is the increase of peak noise the spls of wle at three velocities are shown in fig 23 it can be seen that the wavy leading edge can totally suppress tonal noise and display as turbulent boundary layer broadband noise features however the sound pressure level spectrum of wle with velocity 1 m s still has a hump structure at high frequencies and the wavy leading edge can hardly suppress this noise the oaspl reduction of wle at the five points with three different inflow velocities is shown in table 5 as can be seen from the figure oaspl is reduced 6 205 db at 1m s the noise reduction of wle case is 10 888 db at a velocity of 2 5 m s when the inflow velocity increases to 4 8 m s the oaspl is decreased by 12 871 db due to the action of wavy leading edge from the table it can been seen that the decrease of oaspl increases with the increase of velocity 6 conclusions in this paper a hybrid les fw h acoustic analogy method has been applied to study the effect of wavy leading edge wle on hydrodynamic performance and flow noise at the zero angle of attack at r e 2 5 1 0 5 the hydrofoils with straight leading edge sle and wavy leading edge are presented firstly the hydrodynamic coefficients and flow structures of the sle and wle cases are investigated then the underwater noise of the wle case is predicted and compared with that of the sle case furthermore the association between the flow physics and noise reduction is analyzed finally the effect of the inflow velocity on noise reduction of wle is studied with three different velocities u 1 m s u 2 5 m s and u 4 8 m s the following conclusions are made based our numerical results 1 different from the periodic fluctuation of sle the lift and drag coefficients of wle fluctuate freely along a fixed value and the fluctuation amplitudes decrease in addition the application of the wle causes the pressure gradient along the spanwise direction of the hydrofoil causes the fluid to flow from peak to trough and changes the attenuation mode of the fluid velocity in the wake 2 benefiting from the addition of wle the tonal noise of sle is effectively reduced or even eliminated and the broadband noise is also reduced to a certain extent the addition of wle reduces the oaspl of sle by at least 10 5724 db but has no effect on the directivity of the oaspl of sle 3 for the sle the flow separation is characterized by laminar separation and the fluid develops to tube shaped vortices in the wake of the foil the existence of wle induces counter rotating streamwise vortex pairs in each trough which enhances the momentum exchange in the boundary layer limits the flow separation behind the trough and makes large vortices decompose into small vortices thus the fluctuation of lift and drag coefficient is decreased and the noise is effectively reduced 4 the effect of inlet velocities on noise reduction is studied the noise performance at three velocities of 1 m s 2 5 m s and 4 8 m s was simulated separately it is investigated that at the higher one of the three velocities wle has a better inhibition effect on lift coefficient fluctuation and has a better noise reduction effect

20733,risk analysis is regarded as one of the most critical research topics in maritime industry due to the nature of work validation of risk analysis is a significant challenge for safety researchers this paper aims to address the gap by utilising the power of bayesian network method under fuzzy logic environment while bayesian network provides a compact representation of a joint probability distribution fuzzy logic tackles with vagueness and ambiguity in pra probabilistic risk assessment the validation and sensitivity analyses are performed under various conditions to improve the accuracy of findings three different axioms are tested to validate the results the proposed method is applied for the risk modelling of ship collision in narrow waters besides its theoretical background the paper is expected to help safety researchers validate their results the maritime safety professionals safety inspectors dpas superintendents and ship owners can also benefit from the paper to identify and minimise the potential risks for ship collision in narrow waters keywords ship collision fuzzy bayesian network validation sensitivity analysis risk analysis 1 introduction maritime transportation not only plays a critical role in the continuity of trade between the seas and transoceanic countries but also contributes to the growth of global economies maritime transportation offers the most favourable price advantage in transporting bulk cargo petroleum products food products container cargoes etc compared to other modes of transportation in 2020 although maritime transportation provides a wide range of advantages it also faces several challenges such as piracy adverse weather dangerous waterways that will affect the safety of the ship crew and passengers and environment for sustainable shipping safe and environmentally friendly approaches are established where more advanced operational technologies and modern management styles are integrated into the operations of relevant shipping stakeholders international shipping companies shipyards ports and terminals akyuz and celik 2014 maritime stakeholders always aim to minimise potential risks and to prevent marine environmental pollution and commodity losses by increasing safety at sea to achieve these aims various international rules and regulations have been adopted over the years the international maritime organization imo one of the united nations un subsidiaries was established in 1948 and held its first meeting in 1958 to enhance maritime safety along with 40 conventions and protocols various codes and recommendations have been implemented in different time periods and areas to increase safety and security at sea as well as to prevent marine pollution from ships the key imo conventions can be listed as international convention for the safety of life at sea solas 74 international convention on standard of training certification and watchkeeping for seafarers stcw 78 and the convention on the prevention of maritime pollution marpol 73 78 and convention on the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colreg rules which have great impact on maritime safety in terms of safe navigation and prevent collision at sea the violations of colreg rules or their improper usage are one of the significant contributors to risk of collision at sea celik and akyuz 2016 supervisory and enforcement agencies such as independent class organisations flag states and port states have a right to inspect whether ships comply with requirements of conventions to increase safety at sea maritime safety regulations are generally revised or entered into force generally after a serious maritime accident although reactive this approach has provided a basis for safety management of similar types of ships on the other hand ports and ships have high risks due to changing environmental factors notteboom and lam 2014 risks need to be evaluated for new ships by using up to date techniques risk assessment which is one of the most effective ways to identify manage and reduce potential risks includes identification of hazards that may pose harms for people environment and property qualitative methods are sufficient to assess the frequency and consequences of hazards in maritime while more detailed quantitative methods may be required in other situations quantitative risk assessment qra is a useful and effective approach to design proactive safety strategies understanding the risks in maritime transportation is an important part of enhancing safety at sea most of the authors in the literature have conducted valuable studies such as sarıalioğlu et al 2020 shuen tai ung 2019 lam and lassa 2017 gul et al 2017 akyildiz and mentes 2017 chai et al 2017 zhen et al 2017 goerlandt and montewka 2015 türkoğlu and menteş 2014 in this context the maritime industry has begun to develop a formal safety assessment as a proactive approach to regulations imo introduced formal safety assessment fsa in order to perform a systematic process for risk analyses the fsa guideline involves five main processes hazard identification risk analysis risk control options cost benefit assessment and recommendations imo 2002 although fsa provides necessary guidelines about the risk assessment it does not provide a specific risk analysis tool therefore safety researchers in the shipping industry have been developing new approaches by using new methods and tools gul et al 2017 the economic losses caused by accidents at sea are reviewed by allianz s safety and shipping review report 2019 take into consideration more than 230000 marine insurance claims between july 2013 and july 2018 it is stated that the total value of claims in the marine industry was 10 billion and for insurers the cause of the most expensive losses was sinking collision accidents which accounted for 16 of all claims corresponding to more than 1 5 billion dollars agcs 2019 according to the statistics of the marine accidents from the canadian transportation safety board tsb the most common type of marine accidents between 2007 and 2016 was a collision there were 2649 casualties corresponding to 30 20 occurrence rate tsb 2017 analysing collision cases will contribute to the reduction of future accidents for this reason a number of researchers have studied collisions cases by using different methods huang and van gelder 2020 zhang and meng 2019 sotiralis et al 2016 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 the bayesian network bn model is widely used in risk analysis in maritime transportation trucco et al 2008 although considerable research on maritime risk analyses has been undertaken in the past decade those dedicated to bn have so far remained limited the bn gives better performance compared to other techniques since it is capable of modelling multi state variables causes of errors dependencies and belief updating bobbio et al 2001 the bn is a robust graphical inference model that can be used for a comprehensive accident scenario modelling by considering the interactions between potential causes of the accident and potential consequences of the situational safety barriers zarei et al 2019a b in this context the aim of this paper is to validate ship collision risk in narrow waters under fuzzy bayesian networks since the bn provides graphical inference of root causes fuzzy logic deals with uncertainty and vagueness in decision making validation and sensitivity analyses are performed under various conditions to improve the accuracy of findings the method is applied for accident scenario and risk modelling of ship collision in narrow waters in this context the paper is organised as follows this section gives aim scope and context of the paper as well as brief literature review about maritime risk analysis section 2 introduces the methodology while section 3 performs empirical risk analysis and validation by using fuzzy bn method fbn section 4 presents the findings of the research and finally section 5 highlights the key conclusions and makes suggestions for further research 2 methodology this section provides details about the fbn methodology in this context fig 1 presents the conceptual framework of the methodology 2 1 bayesian network the bayesian networks bn can be used as models for the safety evaluation of complex systems it provides a flexible and powerful graphical structure in a probabilistic approach liu et al 2020 khakzad et al 2011 neapolitan 2004 in the bn the relationships of the variables with each other are shown using directed acyclic arrows and variables are called nodes fig 2 shows structure of the bn a bn is composed of the topological structure including network nodes and directed links and the conditional probabilities table cpts of each node the network structure consisting of nodes presented variables and directed arrows representing the probabilistic causal dependence among the variables pearl 1988 in the relationships between nodes the child node is directed to the node which the arrows are directed to and the parent node is the node which the arrows come from pristrom et al 2016 the quantitative part of the bayesian network deals with the probability tables of variables in the system the probability tables include probabilities conditional probabilities and the posterior probabilities derived from them if the probability belongs to the root node this is called marginal unconditional probability in theory conditional probability table and the marginal probability of root nodes may be formulated using statistical data expert judgement or a combination of them weber et al 2012 bayesian networks inference principle is dependent on the bayes probability theory this approach is about probability calculation in essence algorithms of inference are based on the following equations mahadevan et al 2001 the joint probability distribution of a set of variables u x 1 x 2 x n as 1 p u i 1 n p x i p a x i marginal probability of x i is calculated as where p a x i is the parent set of variables 2 x i p x i x j j i p u posterior updated probabilities can be calculated when new pieces of evidence or information of variables e are given as 3 p u e p u e p e p u e u p u e 2 2 fuzzy bayesian network fbn in order to achieve significant results from the bayesian network assigning the probabilities of the nodes in the network structure is a significant step for this reason there are several ways to assign the prior and conditional probabilities of the nodes the purpose of the fuzzy set theory proposed by zadeh 1965 is to handling managing modelling dealing with uncertainty by using linguistic values in the decision making process the fbn has been developed to obtain the probability values of the nodes in networks in the absence of statistical data or inadequate data following steps show the details of the methodology 2 2 1 obtaining possibilities from the expert judgement in this study expert evaluation is used an expert group is a heterogeneous group that consists of oceangoing master academician and safety inspector maritime experts who have worked actively in different positions in various sectors in the maritime industry for many years assess the prior and conditional probability of nodes on ship collisions at this stage a weighting process is carried out considering the professional qualifications operational experience and training levels of the chosen experts to reflect the differences in assessment a different score from 0 to 5 is given to each expert hsu and chen 1994 the calculation of the weight scores of the experts is applied based on equation 4 rajakarunakaran et al 2015 4 weighting factor of expert w μ weighting score of the expert sum of all experts weighting scores 2 2 2 fuzzification fuzzy membership represents the uncertainty in expert evaluation by taking numbers between 0 and 1 there are different types of fuzzy memberships in the literature the most common one is triangular and trapezoid membership functions ren et al 2009 trapezoid and triangular fuzzy numbers are generally used by safety researchers since they are capable of measuring the sensitivity between linguistic variables than other fuzzy members in this context this paper utilises the trapezoidal and triangular fuzzy number for capturing prior and conditional probability values following equations provide the details 5 μ a ˇ x 0 x a 1 x a 1 a 2 a 1 a 1 x a 2 1 a 2 x a 3 a 4 x a 4 a 3 a 3 x a 4 0 x a 4 in this paper a linguistic scale consisting of seven terms was chosen for expert knowledge elicitation for the uncertainty of nodes table 1 fig 3 shows fuzzy rating and membership functions for triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers the reason for selecting the 7 level scale is that the memory capacity of people is seven plus minus two parts it means that the appropriate number of comparisons for a human being can be between 5 and 9 huang et al 2001 the linguistic scale is used to evaluate the probability distribution of uncertainty which consists of the terms such as very high high medium high medium medium low low and very low vh h mh m ml l vl 2 2 3 aggregating obtained fuzzy possibilities since the experience and knowledge of experts are different in a heterogeneous group it addresses various interpretations and decisions about uncertainty in the bn it is important to gather the data captured from the expert evaluation and to reconcile the opinions hsu and chen 1994 proposed an algorithm for combining evaluation of homogeneous and heterogeneous expert groups r 1 r 2 a pair of expert opinions s u v r 1 r 2 the degree of agreement similarity

results in this section the fbn is applied to perform an empirical risk analysis for a real case ship to ship collision accident in narrow waters then the validation of ship collision risk is performed 3 1 narrative ship to ship collision in narrow waters the collision occurred between an oil tanker and a bulk carrier at the english channel on july 2017 the tanker ship departed from antwerp and was sailing to nigeria the bulk carrier ship was sailing from amsterdam to columbia as the bulk carrier ship was on passage in the south west traffic lane of the dover strait traffic separation scheme tss the tanker ship crossed into the south west lane of the tss at the time of the accident visibility was good it was a clear night bridge team of tanker ship consisted of the master second officer and two a bs the master had the con and had set the engine telegraph to the full ahead bulk carrier s bridge team consisted of the master second officer and an ab maib 2018 the master had the con and he had instructed the second officer to obtain the required information from the authority the bulk carrier was in ballast condition and the oil tanker was loaded the bulk carrier ship had overtaken the tanker ship on her starboard side but later the master of the bulk carrier decided to alter course the port side in order to pass by the port side of the tanker while the bulk carrier was altering to port the master of the tanker ships continued to monitor another ship which was now bearing fine on tanker s port bow at a distance of 0 65 nm the second officer urged the master to take avoiding action by altering course to the starboard the master of the bulk carrier got into the panic and altered course of the ship to port side thereafter bulk carrier s starboard bow severely struck the port side of the tanker ship although both ships were severely damaged the accident did not result in any death injuries or marine pollution maib 2018 fig 4 is depicting trajectories of both vessels during accident according to the accident investigation report the following contributing factors for the collision were important human error management and organisation errors 3 2 empirical risk analysis in this part empirical risk analysis is performed for the ship to ship collision that occurred at dover strait in the study 35 root nodes are effective in the realisation of the leaf node in bn the definitions conditions and relationships are created by considering the following items collision investigation reports expert evaluation an expert group of 7 people and literature review during the initial phase of creating the bn the expert evaluation is made by taking into account the opinions of the seven experts and fig 5 illustrates bn graph accordingly the values of the variables and conditions in the last stage of updated bn were taken from seven experts who provided the most consistent evaluations among the experts table 2 shows the details of maritime experts and weighting scores rajakarunakaran et al 2015 lavasani et al 2015 in the weighting process the experts professional qualifications professional experience at sea and shore and educational levels are considered different score values between 0 and 5 are given to each expert to reveal the differences in the evaluation table 3 shows the data for the weighting calculations of the experts a genle program is employed to use this data for modelling the bayes network before using the genle program linguistic expressions obtained from expert opinions are fuzzified through trapezoidal and triangle fuzzy members then the fuzzified values are aggregated and defuzzified table 4 shows a sample how to apply fuzzy calculation for root node 1 ineffective communication with engine room due to page limitation transactions given above are compiled in ms office excel to be suitable for the usage in the genle program based on various variables selected on the model sensitivity analyses are performed and the results are examined in a node with two conditions the probability evaluation of n parent necessitates 2 n condition in order to prevent repeating evaluation of probabilities during the assessment of experts the decomposition method is employed thus the experts are not required to answer so many questions for various combinations to address this concern the method i e decomposition introduced by kim and pearl 1983 and modified by chin et al 2009 is used the prior probabilities of the root nodes in the bayesian network obtained by experts evaluations are given in table 5 likewise the experts provide fuzzy conditional probabilities of the intermediate and leaf nodes an example of the conditional probabilities is presented in table 6 that provides the conditional probabilities considering the communication failure internal communication failure and external communication failure which are the parent nodes in this paper just one of the cpts of intermediate nodes is submitted in table 6 because of the limited space 3 3 scenario analysis in addition to the current situation three hypothetical scenario analyses namely the best case the worst case and real case scenarios are carried out after the entire model and data is transferred to the genle program the results of the scenario analyses are presented in table 7 for the states of the 35 root nodes selected for the three scenarios in the analysis of the best case scenario scenario 1 the desired conditions of the first level root nodes are taken into consideration in order to determine the lowest level of collision risk and the prior probability of these nodes conditions is chosen as 100 in the analysis of the worst case scenario scenario 2 the undesired conditions of the first level root nodes are considered in order to determine the highest level of collision risk and the prior probability of these nodes condition is chosen as 100 in the analysis of the real case scenario scenario 3 the prior probabilities of the undesired states of the nodes that caused the collision are chosen as 100 and the positive states of the nodes that had no effect on the collision are also chosen as 100 when the scenarios are examined as illustrated in table 7 scenario 2 has the highest probability of 98 for risk of collision due to the undesired conditions on the other hand scenario 1 has the lowest probability of 5 for risk of collision due to the desired conditions the probability of scenario 3 for risk of collision appears to be 45 due to the combination of best and worst conditions for nodes of the real case scenario 3 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is an essential tool in the probabilistic risk analysis through sensitivity analysis it is aimed to illustrate to what extent the performance of each risk factor has a contribution to the occurrence of a bayesian structure failure zhang et al 2014 the sensitivity analysis determines which of the variables in the model has the greatest impact on the target node and the variables are ranked in order of importance for their effects marcot 2012 the sensitivity analysis in the bayesian network reveals the effect of changes in the root nodes and intermediate nodes hosted by the network to the higher level child nodes or leaf node some variables are chosen from the different levels of the network structure to review the risk of collision further the values of the prior probability of the variables are changed hence the probabilities of the change of variables in the model can be observed kabir et al 2016 fig 6 shows results of sensitivity analysis for the bn in the view of fig 6 manoeuvring navigational actions failure detection risk of collision communication failure are the major contributing variables for risk of collision 3 5 validation validation is an essential part of the method to provide a reasonable amount of confidence in the outcomes produced in this paper a sensitivity analysis to validate the established model has been developed and implemented there are three axioms that should be satisfied li et al 2014 rathnayaka et al 2012 wang et al 2011 yang et al 2009 axiom 1 a certain degree of increase decrease in each parent node s prior probabilities should without doubt lead to a relative increase decrease in the child node s posterior probabilities table 8 axiom 2 different rates of increase applied to the parent node s prior probabilities should have a consistent impact on the child node fig 7 axiom 3 taking into account child nodes having more than one parent assume x and y the combined effect of parent x and parent y should always be stronger than the sole effect of parent x or the sole effect of parent y separately table 9 three axiom tests are performed for child nodes in the bn structure thus the validity of the system is verified 3 6 comparison with fault tree analysis fta in order to compare the results obtained by fuzzy bayesian method the fault tree analysis is used since it is capable of calculating the top event te of risk defined in the system the fta is a robust risk analysis method commonly used in safety and reliability engineering to capture how the system process can fail sarıalioğlu et al 2020 sahin 2017 there are basic events ie and intermediate events ie which are connecting with logic gates and leading to the te arici et al 2020 kuzu et al 2019 lavasani et al 2015 in the fta the te is the most significant event in the system process and the consequences of which are potentially harm to the human and environment in this case the te is risk analysis for ship collision in narrow waters the fta involves a couple of application steps to determine risk of the te in the system process i defining the te ie and be in the system ii constructing the ft diagram including logic gates and or iii obtaining occurrence probability of be iv calculating occurrence probability of the te v assessing mcs minimal cut set in the system process the following equations are used to calculate the occurrence probability of the te akyuz et al 2020 the equation of the and gate for the be 13 q t j 1 m q j t the equation of the or gate for the be 14 q t 1 j 1 m 1 q j t in the equations q j t gives the failure probability of basic event j when j 1 to m and q t denotes the failure probability of the te due to all basic events in the light of above explanation the fault tree diagram is constructed on the basis of the bn diagram to compare the results the root nodes are converted to the basic events be and intermediate nodes are converted to intermediate events ie in the ft accordingly table 10 shows description and event codes in the ft diagram in the view of above description and event codes in the ft the diagram is created basis on bn diagram fig 8 shows ft diagram for risk analysis of ship collision in narrow waters the occurrence probabilities of bes in the ft has taken from table 5 the occurrence probability of te risk analysis of ship collision in narrow waters risk is calculated by using equation 13 and 14 the result is found 3 80 e1 38 which is almost similar with fuzzy bn approach the fta verifies that the finding of the fuzzy bn 4 findings and extended discussions in the view of findings the risk of a ship to ship collision is increasing in narrow waters since the occurrence probability of collision risk is found 0 45 in the real time case study as depicted in fig 9 since severity of consequences risk of ship to ship collision in narrow waters is considered high according to the consensus of maritime experts the risk is categorized in red block 2a which states high risk according to the risk matrix introduced by noroozi et al 2014 see table 11 this paper analysed the relations and effects of conflict causing variables in the risk of a collision under bayesian networks in the view of bn diagram the most important root node contributing to the ship collision is inadequate communication with other ship external as illustrated in fig 10 the variation of leaf node occurrence probability in the network is 9 the second significant root node is insufficient ism procedure implementation and the variation of leaf node occurrence probability in the network is 8 the third one is insufficient manning at bridge where variation of leaf node occurrence probability in the network is 6 respectively rudder propeller system failure restricted visibility and insufficient distribution role responsibility are the other main contributing root nodes which are having the variation of leaf node occurrence probability in the network is 5 the rest of root nodes are relatively less effects on the leaf nodes on the other hand fig 11 show cpt results it proves that manoeuvring navigational actions failure intermediate node poses a serious adverse effect on ship collision in narrow waters since it has the highest effect likewise detection failure of collision risk has the second highest effect on the ship collision risk according to the figure communication failure and brm failure intermediate nodes have relatively significant effect on ship collision risk in narrow water the fig 12 illustrates combined effect of intermediate nodes variations to risk of collision in narrow waters for instance in case manoeuvring navigational actions failure and detection failure of collision risk are existing simultaneously the risk of ship collision in narrow water is increasing significantly likewise manoeuvring navigational actions failure and communication failure combination of intermediate nodes has also significant impact on the ship collision risk the third critical intermediate nodes combination is detection failure of collision risk and communication failure in order to decrease occurrence probability of collision risk in intermediate level the manoeuvring navigational actions failure should be prevented to achieve this purpose the colreg rules must be properly applied by oow passage plan must be correctly prepared and implemented and collision avoidance manoeuvring including rudder and engine order must be performed according to good seamanship practice the communication failure must be prevented by implementing smcp standard marine communication phrases in correct manner and providing effective internal communication in bridge team since it poses a significant effect on risk of ship collision 5 conclusion validation is one of the significant parts of the probabilistic risk assessment pra in maritime transportation kwag et al 2018 the pra based framework assists in identifying risk consistent incidents and a critical path for the convenient nomination of resources to improve the validation there are a few studies related to the validation effectively applied in pra this paper deals primarily with the validation of ship collision risk under fuzzy bayesian networks the bn approach is capable of directed acyclic graph an analysis of ship collision risk in narrow waters is performed to demonstrate the model and to validate results the validation and sensitivity analysis are performed to improve the accuracy of findings through the bayesian network the variables leading to risk of collision in narrow waters are determined and analysed in different scenarios the effect of variables through the collision is calculated by performing sensitivity analysis in the view of findings the occurrence of collision risk in narrow water navigation is found high as per noroozi et al risk matrix 2014 the results show that manoeuvring navigational actions failure and detection failure of collision risk as intermediate nodes inadequate communication with other ship and insufficient ism procedure implementation as root nodes have the highest impact on collision risk in narrow waters in conclusion the results of this research can be utilised by the safety researchers as well as maritime safety professionals to reduce the risk of collision in narrow waters the maritime safety professionals who are analysing networks under risk assessment is capable of predicting risk levels of variables in this context the bayesian networks allows safety professionals and safety researchers to capture the changes in collision accident risk when variables occur under different conditions the proposed approach does not moderate challenges in line with model form uncertainty due to experiment to implementation boost babuska et al 2008 the research will require further

20733,risk analysis is regarded as one of the most critical research topics in maritime industry due to the nature of work validation of risk analysis is a significant challenge for safety researchers this paper aims to address the gap by utilising the power of bayesian network method under fuzzy logic environment while bayesian network provides a compact representation of a joint probability distribution fuzzy logic tackles with vagueness and ambiguity in pra probabilistic risk assessment the validation and sensitivity analyses are performed under various conditions to improve the accuracy of findings three different axioms are tested to validate the results the proposed method is applied for the risk modelling of ship collision in narrow waters besides its theoretical background the paper is expected to help safety researchers validate their results the maritime safety professionals safety inspectors dpas superintendents and ship owners can also benefit from the paper to identify and minimise the potential risks for ship collision in narrow waters keywords ship collision fuzzy bayesian network validation sensitivity analysis risk analysis 1 introduction maritime transportation not only plays a critical role in the continuity of trade between the seas and transoceanic countries but also contributes to the growth of global economies maritime transportation offers the most favourable price advantage in transporting bulk cargo petroleum products food products container cargoes etc compared to other modes of transportation in 2020 although maritime transportation provides a wide range of advantages it also faces several challenges such as piracy adverse weather dangerous waterways that will affect the safety of the ship crew and passengers and environment for sustainable shipping safe and environmentally friendly approaches are established where more advanced operational technologies and modern management styles are integrated into the operations of relevant shipping stakeholders international shipping companies shipyards ports and terminals akyuz and celik 2014 maritime stakeholders always aim to minimise potential risks and to prevent marine environmental pollution and commodity losses by increasing safety at sea to achieve these aims various international rules and regulations have been adopted over the years the international maritime organization imo one of the united nations un subsidiaries was established in 1948 and held its first meeting in 1958 to enhance maritime safety along with 40 conventions and protocols various codes and recommendations have been implemented in different time periods and areas to increase safety and security at sea as well as to prevent marine pollution from ships the key imo conventions can be listed as international convention for the safety of life at sea solas 74 international convention on standard of training certification and watchkeeping for seafarers stcw 78 and the convention on the prevention of maritime pollution marpol 73 78 and convention on the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colreg rules which have great impact on maritime safety in terms of safe navigation and prevent collision at sea the violations of colreg rules or their improper usage are one of the significant contributors to risk of collision at sea celik and akyuz 2016 supervisory and enforcement agencies such as independent class organisations flag states and port states have a right to inspect whether ships comply with requirements of conventions to increase safety at sea maritime safety regulations are generally revised or entered into force generally after a serious maritime accident although reactive this approach has provided a basis for safety management of similar types of ships on the other hand ports and ships have high risks due to changing environmental factors notteboom and lam 2014 risks need to be evaluated for new ships by using up to date techniques risk assessment which is one of the most effective ways to identify manage and reduce potential risks includes identification of hazards that may pose harms for people environment and property qualitative methods are sufficient to assess the frequency and consequences of hazards in maritime while more detailed quantitative methods may be required in other situations quantitative risk assessment qra is a useful and effective approach to design proactive safety strategies understanding the risks in maritime transportation is an important part of enhancing safety at sea most of the authors in the literature have conducted valuable studies such as sarıalioğlu et al 2020 shuen tai ung 2019 lam and lassa 2017 gul et al 2017 akyildiz and mentes 2017 chai et al 2017 zhen et al 2017 goerlandt and montewka 2015 türkoğlu and menteş 2014 in this context the maritime industry has begun to develop a formal safety assessment as a proactive approach to regulations imo introduced formal safety assessment fsa in order to perform a systematic process for risk analyses the fsa guideline involves five main processes hazard identification risk analysis risk control options cost benefit assessment and recommendations imo 2002 although fsa provides necessary guidelines about the risk assessment it does not provide a specific risk analysis tool therefore safety researchers in the shipping industry have been developing new approaches by using new methods and tools gul et al 2017 the economic losses caused by accidents at sea are reviewed by allianz s safety and shipping review report 2019 take into consideration more than 230000 marine insurance claims between july 2013 and july 2018 it is stated that the total value of claims in the marine industry was 10 billion and for insurers the cause of the most expensive losses was sinking collision accidents which accounted for 16 of all claims corresponding to more than 1 5 billion dollars agcs 2019 according to the statistics of the marine accidents from the canadian transportation safety board tsb the most common type of marine accidents between 2007 and 2016 was a collision there were 2649 casualties corresponding to 30 20 occurrence rate tsb 2017 analysing collision cases will contribute to the reduction of future accidents for this reason a number of researchers have studied collisions cases by using different methods huang and van gelder 2020 zhang and meng 2019 sotiralis et al 2016 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 the bayesian network bn model is widely used in risk analysis in maritime transportation trucco et al 2008 although considerable research on maritime risk analyses has been undertaken in the past decade those dedicated to bn have so far remained limited the bn gives better performance compared to other techniques since it is capable of modelling multi state variables causes of errors dependencies and belief updating bobbio et al 2001 the bn is a robust graphical inference model that can be used for a comprehensive accident scenario modelling by considering the interactions between potential causes of the accident and potential consequences of the situational safety barriers zarei et al 2019a b in this context the aim of this paper is to validate ship collision risk in narrow waters under fuzzy bayesian networks since the bn provides graphical inference of root causes fuzzy logic deals with uncertainty and vagueness in decision making validation and sensitivity analyses are performed under various conditions to improve the accuracy of findings the method is applied for accident scenario and risk modelling of ship collision in narrow waters in this context the paper is organised as follows this section gives aim scope and context of the paper as well as brief literature review about maritime risk analysis section 2 introduces the methodology while section 3 performs empirical risk analysis and validation by using fuzzy bn method fbn section 4 presents the findings of the research and finally section 5 highlights the key conclusions and makes suggestions for further research 2 methodology this section provides details about the fbn methodology in this context fig 1 presents the conceptual framework of the methodology 2 1 bayesian network the bayesian networks bn can be used as models for the safety evaluation of complex systems it provides a flexible and powerful graphical structure in a probabilistic approach liu et al 2020 khakzad et al 2011 neapolitan 2004 in the bn the relationships of the variables with each other are shown using directed acyclic arrows and variables are called nodes fig 2 shows structure of the bn a bn is composed of the topological structure including network nodes and directed links and the conditional probabilities table cpts of each node the network structure consisting of nodes presented variables and directed arrows representing the probabilistic causal dependence among the variables pearl 1988 in the relationships between nodes the child node is directed to the node which the arrows are directed to and the parent node is the node which the arrows come from pristrom et al 2016 the quantitative part of the bayesian network deals with the probability tables of variables in the system the probability tables include probabilities conditional probabilities and the posterior probabilities derived from them if the probability belongs to the root node this is called marginal unconditional probability in theory conditional probability table and the marginal probability of root nodes may be formulated using statistical data expert judgement or a combination of them weber et al 2012 bayesian networks inference principle is dependent on the bayes probability theory this approach is about probability calculation in essence algorithms of inference are based on the following equations mahadevan et al 2001 the joint probability distribution of a set of variables u x 1 x 2 x n as 1 p u i 1 n p x i p a x i marginal probability of x i is calculated as where p a x i is the parent set of variables 2 x i p x i x j j i p u posterior updated probabilities can be calculated when new pieces of evidence or information of variables e are given as 3 p u e p u e p e p u e u p u e 2 2 fuzzy bayesian network fbn in order to achieve significant results from the bayesian network assigning the probabilities of the nodes in the network structure is a significant step for this reason there are several ways to assign the prior and conditional probabilities of the nodes the purpose of the fuzzy set theory proposed by zadeh 1965 is to handling managing modelling dealing with uncertainty by using linguistic values in the decision making process the fbn has been developed to obtain the probability values of the nodes in networks in the absence of statistical data or inadequate data following steps show the details of the methodology 2 2 1 obtaining possibilities from the expert judgement in this study expert evaluation is used an expert group is a heterogeneous group that consists of oceangoing master academician and safety inspector maritime experts who have worked actively in different positions in various sectors in the maritime industry for many years assess the prior and conditional probability of nodes on ship collisions at this stage a weighting process is carried out considering the professional qualifications operational experience and training levels of the chosen experts to reflect the differences in assessment a different score from 0 to 5 is given to each expert hsu and chen 1994 the calculation of the weight scores of the experts is applied based on equation 4 rajakarunakaran et al 2015 4 weighting factor of expert w μ weighting score of the expert sum of all experts weighting scores 2 2 2 fuzzification fuzzy membership represents the uncertainty in expert evaluation by taking numbers between 0 and 1 there are different types of fuzzy memberships in the literature the most common one is triangular and trapezoid membership functions ren et al 2009 trapezoid and triangular fuzzy numbers are generally used by safety researchers since they are capable of measuring the sensitivity between linguistic variables than other fuzzy members in this context this paper utilises the trapezoidal and triangular fuzzy number for capturing prior and conditional probability values following equations provide the details 5 μ a ˇ x 0 x a 1 x a 1 a 2 a 1 a 1 x a 2 1 a 2 x a 3 a 4 x a 4 a 3 a 3 x a 4 0 x a 4 in this paper a linguistic scale consisting of seven terms was chosen for expert knowledge elicitation for the uncertainty of nodes table 1 fig 3 shows fuzzy rating and membership functions for triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers the reason for selecting the 7 level scale is that the memory capacity of people is seven plus minus two parts it means that the appropriate number of comparisons for a human being can be between 5 and 9 huang et al 2001 the linguistic scale is used to evaluate the probability distribution of uncertainty which consists of the terms such as very high high medium high medium medium low low and very low vh h mh m ml l vl 2 2 3 aggregating obtained fuzzy possibilities since the experience and knowledge of experts are different in a heterogeneous group it addresses various interpretations and decisions about uncertainty in the bn it is important to gather the data captured from the expert evaluation and to reconcile the opinions hsu and chen 1994 proposed an algorithm for combining evaluation of homogeneous and heterogeneous expert groups r 1 r 2 a pair of expert opinions s u v r 1 r 2 the degree of agreement similarity

experts e u u 1 to m according to this approach a 1 a 11 a 12 a 13 a 14 and a 2 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 24 constitute two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers then the degree of similarity between two fuzzy numbers can be obtained by the defined similarity function 6 s a 1 a 2 1 1 4 i 1 4 a 1 i a 2 i step ii calculation of aa average agreement by m experts as follows 7 a a e u 1 m 1 u v m s a u a v step iii

and there is a homogeneous distribution among the experts when β 1 the expert has the same degree of consensus coefficient cc as the significance of weight in our study β 0 5 is taken it is important to give the β an appropriate value by the decision maker qiao et al 2020 zarei et al 2019a b şakar and zorba 2017 step v the aggregated result r a g value of the expert opinions is calculated as follows 10 r a g c c e 1 r 1 c c e 2 r 2 c c e m r m the next step is to defuzzify the aggregated expert judgment triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are transformed into crisp numbers under fuzzy sets 2 2 4 defuzzification to inference in the bayesian network it is necessary to convert the fuzzy numbers to crisp numbers peng cheng et al 2012 fuzzy prior probabilities and conditional probabilities are converted to crisp numbers such as fuzzy possibility score fps by using eq 11 defuzzification methods include mean maximum membership centroid method weighted average method the centre of the largest area and the centre of sums wang 1997 in the study fuzzy possibility values of each uncertainty are calculated by using the centre of area coa method because of its simplicity

results in this section the fbn is applied to perform an empirical risk analysis for a real case ship to ship collision accident in narrow waters then the validation of ship collision risk is performed 3 1 narrative ship to ship collision in narrow waters the collision occurred between an oil tanker and a bulk carrier at the english channel on july 2017 the tanker ship departed from antwerp and was sailing to nigeria the bulk carrier ship was sailing from amsterdam to columbia as the bulk carrier ship was on passage in the south west traffic lane of the dover strait traffic separation scheme tss the tanker ship crossed into the south west lane of the tss at the time of the accident visibility was good it was a clear night bridge team of tanker ship consisted of the master second officer and two a bs the master had the con and had set the engine telegraph to the full ahead bulk carrier s bridge team consisted of the master second officer and an ab maib 2018 the master had the con and he had instructed the second officer to obtain the required information from the authority the bulk carrier was in ballast condition and the oil tanker was loaded the bulk carrier ship had overtaken the tanker ship on her starboard side but later the master of the bulk carrier decided to alter course the port side in order to pass by the port side of the tanker while the bulk carrier was altering to port the master of the tanker ships continued to monitor another ship which was now bearing fine on tanker s port bow at a distance of 0 65 nm the second officer urged the master to take avoiding action by altering course to the starboard the master of the bulk carrier got into the panic and altered course of the ship to port side thereafter bulk carrier s starboard bow severely struck the port side of the tanker ship although both ships were severely damaged the accident did not result in any death injuries or marine pollution maib 2018 fig 4 is depicting trajectories of both vessels during accident according to the accident investigation report the following contributing factors for the collision were important human error management and organisation errors 3 2 empirical risk analysis in this part empirical risk analysis is performed for the ship to ship collision that occurred at dover strait in the study 35 root nodes are effective in the realisation of the leaf node in bn the definitions conditions and relationships are created by considering the following items collision investigation reports expert evaluation an expert group of 7 people and literature review during the initial phase of creating the bn the expert evaluation is made by taking into account the opinions of the seven experts and fig 5 illustrates bn graph accordingly the values of the variables and conditions in the last stage of updated bn were taken from seven experts who provided the most consistent evaluations among the experts table 2 shows the details of maritime experts and weighting scores rajakarunakaran et al 2015 lavasani et al 2015 in the weighting process the experts professional qualifications professional experience at sea and shore and educational levels are considered different score values between 0 and 5 are given to each expert to reveal the differences in the evaluation table 3 shows the data for the weighting calculations of the experts a genle program is employed to use this data for modelling the bayes network before using the genle program linguistic expressions obtained from expert opinions are fuzzified through trapezoidal and triangle fuzzy members then the fuzzified values are aggregated and defuzzified table 4 shows a sample how to apply fuzzy calculation for root node 1 ineffective communication with engine room due to page limitation transactions given above are compiled in ms office excel to be suitable for the usage in the genle program based on various variables selected on the model sensitivity analyses are performed and the results are examined in a node with two conditions the probability evaluation of n parent necessitates 2 n condition in order to prevent repeating evaluation of probabilities during the assessment of experts the decomposition method is employed thus the experts are not required to answer so many questions for various combinations to address this concern the method i e decomposition introduced by kim and pearl 1983 and modified by chin et al 2009 is used the prior probabilities of the root nodes in the bayesian network obtained by experts evaluations are given in table 5 likewise the experts provide fuzzy conditional probabilities of the intermediate and leaf nodes an example of the conditional probabilities is presented in table 6 that provides the conditional probabilities considering the communication failure internal communication failure and external communication failure which are the parent nodes in this paper just one of the cpts of intermediate nodes is submitted in table 6 because of the limited space 3 3 scenario analysis in addition to the current situation three hypothetical scenario analyses namely the best case the worst case and real case scenarios are carried out after the entire model and data is transferred to the genle program the results of the scenario analyses are presented in table 7 for the states of the 35 root nodes selected for the three scenarios in the analysis of the best case scenario scenario 1 the desired conditions of the first level root nodes are taken into consideration in order to determine the lowest level of collision risk and the prior probability of these nodes conditions is chosen as 100 in the analysis of the worst case scenario scenario 2 the undesired conditions of the first level root nodes are considered in order to determine the highest level of collision risk and the prior probability of these nodes condition is chosen as 100 in the analysis of the real case scenario scenario 3 the prior probabilities of the undesired states of the nodes that caused the collision are chosen as 100 and the positive states of the nodes that had no effect on the collision are also chosen as 100 when the scenarios are examined as illustrated in table 7 scenario 2 has the highest probability of 98 for risk of collision due to the undesired conditions on the other hand scenario 1 has the lowest probability of 5 for risk of collision due to the desired conditions the probability of scenario 3 for risk of collision appears to be 45 due to the combination of best and worst conditions for nodes of the real case scenario 3 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is an essential tool in the probabilistic risk analysis through sensitivity analysis it is aimed to illustrate to what extent the performance of each risk factor has a contribution to the occurrence of a bayesian structure failure zhang et al 2014 the sensitivity analysis determines which of the variables in the model has the greatest impact on the target node and the variables are ranked in order of importance for their effects marcot 2012 the sensitivity analysis in the bayesian network reveals the effect of changes in the root nodes and intermediate nodes hosted by the network to the higher level child nodes or leaf node some variables are chosen from the different levels of the network structure to review the risk of collision further the values of the prior probability of the variables are changed hence the probabilities of the change of variables in the model can be observed kabir et al 2016 fig 6 shows results of sensitivity analysis for the bn in the view of fig 6 manoeuvring navigational actions failure detection risk of collision communication failure are the major contributing variables for risk of collision 3 5 validation validation is an essential part of the method to provide a reasonable amount of confidence in the outcomes produced in this paper a sensitivity analysis to validate the established model has been developed and implemented there are three axioms that should be satisfied li et al 2014 rathnayaka et al 2012 wang et al 2011 yang et al 2009 axiom 1 a certain degree of increase decrease in each parent node s prior probabilities should without doubt lead to a relative increase decrease in the child node s posterior probabilities table 8 axiom 2 different rates of increase applied to the parent node s prior probabilities should have a consistent impact on the child node fig 7 axiom 3 taking into account child nodes having more than one parent assume x and y the combined effect of parent x and parent y should always be stronger than the sole effect of parent x or the sole effect of parent y separately table 9 three axiom tests are performed for child nodes in the bn structure thus the validity of the system is verified 3 6 comparison with fault tree analysis fta in order to compare the results obtained by fuzzy bayesian method the fault tree analysis is used since it is capable of calculating the top event te of risk defined in the system the fta is a robust risk analysis method commonly used in safety and reliability engineering to capture how the system process can fail sarıalioğlu et al 2020 sahin 2017 there are basic events ie and intermediate events ie which are connecting with logic gates and leading to the te arici et al 2020 kuzu et al 2019 lavasani et al 2015 in the fta the te is the most significant event in the system process and the consequences of which are potentially harm to the human and environment in this case the te is risk analysis for ship collision in narrow waters the fta involves a couple of application steps to determine risk of the te in the system process i defining the te ie and be in the system ii constructing the ft diagram including logic gates and or iii obtaining occurrence probability of be iv calculating occurrence probability of the te v assessing mcs minimal cut set in the system process the following equations are used to calculate the occurrence probability of the te akyuz et al 2020 the equation of the and gate for the be 13 q t j

codes in the ft the diagram is created basis on bn diagram fig 8 shows ft diagram for risk analysis of ship collision in narrow waters the occurrence probabilities of bes in the ft has taken from table 5 the occurrence probability of te risk analysis of ship collision in narrow waters risk is calculated by using equation 13 and 14 the result is found 3 80 e1 38 which is almost similar with fuzzy bn approach the fta verifies that the finding of the fuzzy bn 4 findings and extended discussions in the view of findings the risk of a ship to ship collision is increasing in narrow waters since the occurrence probability of collision risk is found 0 45 in the real time case study as depicted in fig 9 since severity of consequences risk of ship to ship collision in narrow waters is considered high according to the consensus of maritime experts the risk is categorized in red block 2a which states high risk according to the risk matrix introduced by noroozi et al 2014 see table 11 this paper analysed the relations and effects of conflict causing variables in the risk of a collision under bayesian networks in the view of bn diagram the most important root node contributing to the ship collision is inadequate communication with other ship external as illustrated in fig 10 the variation of leaf node occurrence probability in the network is 9 the second significant root node is insufficient ism procedure implementation and the variation of leaf node occurrence probability in the network is 8 the third one is insufficient manning at bridge where variation of leaf node occurrence probability in the network is 6 respectively rudder propeller system failure restricted visibility and insufficient distribution role responsibility are the other main contributing root nodes which are having the variation of leaf node occurrence probability in the network is 5 the rest of root nodes are relatively less effects on the leaf nodes on the other hand fig 11 show cpt results it proves that manoeuvring navigational actions failure intermediate node poses a serious adverse effect on ship collision in narrow waters since it has the highest effect likewise detection failure of collision risk has the second highest effect on the ship collision risk according to the figure communication failure and brm failure intermediate nodes have relatively significant effect on ship collision risk in narrow water the fig 12 illustrates combined effect of intermediate nodes variations to risk of collision in narrow waters for instance in case manoeuvring navigational actions failure and detection failure of collision risk are existing simultaneously the risk of ship collision in narrow water is increasing significantly likewise manoeuvring navigational actions failure and communication failure combination of intermediate nodes has also significant impact on the ship collision risk the third critical intermediate nodes combination is detection failure of collision risk and communication failure in order to decrease occurrence probability of collision risk in intermediate level the manoeuvring navigational actions failure should be prevented to achieve this purpose the colreg rules must be properly applied by oow passage plan must be correctly prepared and implemented and collision avoidance manoeuvring including rudder and engine order must be performed according to good seamanship practice the communication failure must be prevented by implementing smcp standard marine communication phrases in correct manner and providing effective internal communication in bridge team since it poses a significant effect on risk of ship collision 5 conclusion validation is one of the significant parts of the probabilistic risk assessment pra in maritime transportation kwag et al 2018 the pra based framework assists in identifying risk consistent incidents and a critical path for the convenient nomination of resources to improve the validation there are a few studies related to the validation effectively applied in pra this paper deals primarily with the validation of ship collision risk under fuzzy bayesian networks the bn approach is capable of directed acyclic graph an analysis of ship collision risk in narrow waters is performed to demonstrate the model and to validate results the validation and sensitivity analysis are performed to improve the accuracy of findings through the bayesian network the variables leading to risk of collision in narrow waters are determined and analysed in different scenarios the effect of variables through the collision is calculated by performing sensitivity analysis in the view of findings the occurrence of collision risk in narrow water navigation is found high as per noroozi et al risk matrix 2014 the results show that manoeuvring navigational actions failure and detection failure of collision risk as intermediate nodes inadequate communication with other ship and insufficient ism procedure implementation as root nodes have the highest impact on collision risk in narrow waters in conclusion the results of this research can be utilised by the safety researchers as well as maritime safety professionals to reduce the risk of collision in narrow waters the maritime safety professionals who are analysing networks under risk assessment is capable of predicting risk levels of variables in this context the bayesian networks allows safety professionals and safety researchers to capture the changes in collision accident risk when variables occur under different conditions the proposed approach does not moderate challenges in line with model form uncertainty due to experiment to implementation boost babuska et al 2008 the research will require further

20734,more and more successful applications of rans tool to obtain hydrodynamic derivatives or coefficients for ship manoeuvring prediction have been reported in recent years however to obtain all required hydrodynamic derivatives from pure rans simulations will be very time consuming due to many cases especially considering dynamic ship motions in water surface and real rotating propeller with dynamic grid approach this might be one of the limiting factors to apply rans tool for ship manoeuvring prediction widely although the relevant numerical methods have been demonstrated to be of acceptable accuracy in many respects so that it is quite necessary to explore the appropriate strategies when applying rans tool for ship manoeuvring prediction consequently balancing prediction accuracy and time cost as far as possible in this study we use the own expanded rans solver to simulate a series of captive model tests for the oil tanker kvlcc2 assumptions of double body flow and body force propeller are introduced during the simulations in order to reduce computational time hydrodynamic derivatives are determined by regression analysis to the computed hydrodynamic forces and free running turning test and zig zag test are simulated by using these derivatives the rans method and the whole procedure of manoeuvring prediction are described in this article the main purpose is to check the applicability of the expanded rans solver and to confirm the effectiveness of whole procedure of manoeuvring prediction it shows that the derivatives from rans can be used for manoeuvring prediction at least for kvlcc2 and the present strategy of ship manoeuvring prediction is quite promising in the respect of the balance of prediction efficiency and accuracy keywords manoeuvring prediction captive model test hydrodynamic derivatives rans openfoam 1 introduction the resolutions about energy efficiency design index eedi and energy efficiency operation index eeoi from international maritime organization imo put forward a higher request for ship design on one hand it should be necessary to use lower power equipment for reduction of energy consumption on the other hand the newly designed ship must have enough performance to cope with extreme environment for navigation safety to accurately evaluate ship performance becomes even more important than before at the initial stage of design helping reach a balance between safety and lower energy consumption as the continuous development of research methods and the increasing demand for high performance ships ship manoeuvrability has attracted much attention worldwide in recent years there are typically two strategies for evaluating ship manoeuvrability by physical model test in tank one is to perform free running tests that provides directly characteristic parameters e g tactical diameter overshoot angle etc to assess ship manoeuvring behaviour the other is based on system simulation for the later ship motion equations in which the hydrodynamic forces and moments are approximated by formulas with hydrodynamic derivatives or coefficients are solved to simulate free running tests hydrodynamic derivatives can be obtained by conducting a series of captive model tests in towing tank however since model tests are costly they are usually used in the later phase of design process after the final hull form is almost certain in order to estimate manoeuvrability at the initial stage of ship design a more effective way historically was to simulate free running tests using empirical hydrodynamic derivatives the prediction accuracy depends significantly on the similarity of targeted ship to parent ship from whom the empirical data are obtained certainly the final goal of ship manoeuvring prediction is for full scale ship in real navigation environment rather than for the model scale one for this the derivatives from model tests have to be corrected because of scale effects for example jing et al 2021 presented a study on the manoeuvring prediction of a full scale ship by using mmg type mathematical model with considering the effects of waves wind and current where mmg is the acronym of japan mathematical model group the application of computational fluid dynamics cfd to ship manoeuvring prediction has become popular during past three decades the cfd accuracy has been demonstrated to be acceptable for most cases when simulating captive model tests and free running model tests for example cura hochbaum 1998 developed a reynolds averaged naiver stokes rans code to simulate the turbulence around a ship in ship fixed coordinate system although the effects of free surface were neglected i e double body flow the computed results for the considered ships in static circular motion and static drift motion in calm water generally showed close agreements with available experimental data carrica et al 2006 presented a verification and validation study for a surface combatant in dynamic planar motion mechanism pmm motions the work demonstrated that the code cfdship iowa with overset grid approach and single phase level set approach to be of satisfactory accuracy in most aspects yao et al 2016 conducted rans simulations of static drift motion static circular motion and dynamic pure sway motion for an oil tanker in calm water on the openfoam platform the predicted hydrodynamic forces and moments and the flow at propeller plane were compared with available data the results showed acceptable agreements with experimental data other than these many other works in relevant to the rans simulation of captive ship model test were reported as well in history all studies indicated that rans accuracy was acceptable for most cases that have shown a promising prospect in the application of ship manoeuvring prediction however only a few scholars have attempted to use the derivatives which were purely determined by rans simulations for manoeuvring simulation for example cura hochbaum 2006 predicted manoeuvring behaviour of a ship model based on the derivatives determined by means of virtual captive model test a similar study was also done by simonsen et al 2012 who performed the standard deep water imo manoeuvring simulations for a container ship model with the hydrodynamic coefficients obtained from both rans simulation and experiment although a few simplifications were introduced in their approaches in order to reduce computational time the final results of free running simulation were satisfactory compared with experimental data more recently sukas et al 2021 employed a mmg type model to predict the manoeuvrability of a container ship with twisted rudder in the study most hydrodynamic coefficients such as derivatives of bare hull and a few hull propeller rudder interaction coefficients were determined by rans computations the study showed a very successful application of rans tool in ship manoeuvring prediction direct simulations of free running ship manoeuvres have been possible by rans as well the wave condition can be even considered for example carrica et al 2013 carried out overset rans simulations of turning and zig zag manoeuvres for a ship in calm water and in waves the study benefits from the advantages that the dynamic overset grid approach enables to solve the coupled equations of rans and six degrees of freedom dof ship motion however the simulations remain highly time consuming so far in present study manoeuvring predictions are performed for an oil tanker by using an abkowitz type mathematical model the prediction mainly follows the international towing tanker conference ittc recommended procedures and guidelines 2011 the derivatives are determined by using the own expanded rans solver on openfoam platform since double body flow and body force propeller are introduced in rans simulations computational time is greatly reduced the relevant methods and considerations are described and discussed in this article the main purpose is to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the whole strategy employed and to confirm the prediction accuracy of the final ship manoeuvre 2 ship motion equations and mathematical model a ship fixed coordinate system o x y z is used to describe the ship motion the origin o is located at the intersection of mid ship sections and undisturbed free surface x axis towards bow y axis towards starboard and z axis towards keel in this study we just consider 3 dof motion of the ship in horizontal plane according to newton s law the motion equations can be written as 1a m u v r x g r 2 x 1b m v u r x g r y 1c i z r m x g v u r n where x y and n are longitudinal force side force and yaw moment respectively m is ship mass u and v are translational velocities along x axis and y axis respectively r is turning rate about z axis x g is x coordinate of the centre of gravity and i z is inertial moment with respect to z axis the dot over quantity denotes the operation of derivation with respect to time an abkowitz type model abokowitz 1964 is employed to approximate the hydrodynamic forces and moment on the right side of eq 1 the used model has the following expressions 2a x x u δ u x u u δ u 2 x u u u δ u 3 x u u x v v x v v v 2 x v v v v 3 x r r x r r r 2 x r r r r 3 x δ δ x δ δ δ 2 x δ δ δ δ 3 x u u δ δ u 2 δ x u δ δ δ u δ 2 x v r v r

the ship speed being taken as the expansion point of taylor series to determine the hydrodynamic derivatives in eq 2 rans simulations are carried out to compute the hydrodynamic forces on the ship in captive motions as mentioned 3 rans method 3 1 mathematical equations and numerical discretization under the assumption of incompressible newtonian fluid the conservation equations of mass continuity equation and momentum rans equations in the ship fixed frame of reference can be written in tensor notation as 3 u i x i 0 4 u i t u i u j x j f i 1 ρ p x i x j ν u i x j u j x i u i u j u i t ε i j k ω j u k ε i j k ω j ε k m n ω m ω n 2 ε i j k ω j u k ε i j k ω j t x k where x i x y z and u i u v w are independent coordinates and flow velocity components u i u v w and ω i p q r are ship translational and angular velocity components in the ship fixed system p is dynamic pressure ε i j k is permutation symbol f i is body force per unit mass and u i u j is the specific reynolds stress tensor which is expressed under bousinesq s eddy viscosity hypothesis as 5 u i u j ν t u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j k where ν t is eddy viscosity δ i j is kronecker symbol and k is turbulent kinetic energy the last four terms in eq 4 stem from inertial motions of ship they are translational acceleration force per unit mass centrifugal force per unit mass coriolis force per unit mass and angular acceleration force per unit mass from left to right respectively a module is programed into openfoam to compute the four terms explicitly the ship motion variables are prescribed during the simulation and the module will be activated when using the rans solver to simulate the turbulence around ship the k ω sst turbulence model menter 2003 without wall functions is employed to approximate the eddy viscosity in eq 5 where sst is the acronym of shear stress transport and ω is specific dissipation rate since the model transport equations can be found everywhere and have been already described in a previous publication yao et al 2016 they are not repeated here note that for steady flow relative to ship the time related terms in above equations are all vanished although dynamic grid approaches such as overset and sliding grid have been available to simulate the rotating motion of propeller the term f i is still used to approximate the effects of rotating propeller on flow in this study the disadvantage when using real propeller is that the simulation requires a small time step to ensure enough accuracy e g at least 200 time steps per revolution is required that makes the time cost for flow simulation around hull rudder propeller system unacceptable however the idea behind body force propeller is to distribute body force inside a cylinder instead of real rotating propeller where the body force distribution depends on the averaged force distribution on the disk during one propeller revolution so that body force propeller allows a large time step in use how to deal with propeller is quite important in rans for highly efficient ship manoeuvring prediction in this study a rather simple body force propeller is used to approximate the rotating effects of propeller on flow a new module to compute the body force distribution has also been implemented in openfoam for this purpose the axial and tangential components of force distribution on propeller disk are prescribed by the following formulas e g stern et al 1988 6 f b x a x r 1 r 7 f b θ a θ r 1 r r 1 r h r h where 8 r r r h 1 r h r r r p r h r h r p 9 a x 15 8 t π δ p 3 r h 4 r p r p r h 10 a θ 15 8 q π δ p r p 3 r h 4 r p r p r h with t and q the propeller thrust and torque r p propeller radius r h hub radius δ p thickness of propeller disk and r radius the body force region is limited inside a cylinder with volume defined by r p r h and δ p i e π r p 2 r h 2 δ p a x and a θ are solved analytically via the integration of the body force over the volume i e 11 t f b x d v 12 q r f b θ d v where t and q are computed by making use of the open water curves of propeller advance ratio is defined by 13 j u 1 ω 0 n d p where ω 0 is wake fraction in straight ahead motion n is propeller revolution rate and d p is propeller diameter once t and q are known the body force distribution on the disk is determined uniquely actually for different t and q the pattern of body force distribution on the disk is same but the magnitude changes fig 1 presents an example of the body force distribution as seen both axial force and tangential force are zero values at root and tip and the distribution is of circumferential symmetry the body force propeller cannot produce side force and vertical force although they are usually of small value compared with the total side force acting on hull rudder propeller system the simple body force propeller can approximate well the propeller effects on hull and rudder as shown in the work by yao 2015 nevertheless it cannot predict correctly the effects of rudder and hull on propeller as the force distribution is assumed to be always axisymmetric regardless of the influences of drift angle and rudder deflection in addition the influence of ship longitudinal velocity is taken into account in a rather simple manner i e use eq 13 to estimate thrust even so the present work will demonstrate the body force propeller remains a very good alternative in use the rans solver in openfoam is based on a finite volume technique which permits use of arbitrary polyhedral grids including hexahedron tetrahedron prism etc a suite of basic discretization schemes and solution algorithms are available in present applications a second order upwind difference scheme uds and a central difference scheme cds are selected to approximate the convective terms and diffusive terms respectively a second order backward scheme is applied for time discretization turbulence is discretized with the second order uds the systems of linear equations resulting from the discretization are solved by using iterative solvers here gauss seidel relaxation for velocity k and ω generalized geometric multi grid gamg for pressure the pimple algorithm which merges piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators and simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithms is applied to couple the mass and momentum equations 3 2 grid and boundary conditions the software hexpress is used to generate computational grid the domain is limited by a box which ranges from 2 l p p to 1 5 l p p along ship length direction from 1 5 l p p to 1 5 l p p along beam direction and from 0 to 1 0 l p p along vertical direction fig 2 shows a sample grid for the oil tanker named kvlcc2 whose rudder horn is simplified for a better grid quality since free surface is seen as a rigid plane a symmetric boundary condition is imposed at the boundary z 0 on hull and rudder surfaces the flow has to satisfy no slip condition i e u i is zero ω is specified to 6 ν β 1 y w 2 where β 1 0 075 is a constant and y w is the distance to wall surface k is specified to 0 since no turbulence occurs at walls the usual slip condition is imposed at the water bottom boundary z 1 0 l p p for the four side boundaries in principle the free stream flow velocity k and ω are given at the windward boundaries inlets where water enters the domain the flow can be expected to be undisturbed provided the inlet boundaries are enough far away from the ship a new boundary condition to compute the free stream flow velocity has been implemented into openfoam as far as ship linear velocity vector u v w and rotating angler velocity vector p q r are given the free stream flow velocity at the mesh centres on a boundary can be calculated by the expression of the free stream flow velocity relative to ship i e u r y v r x 0 the free stream values of k and ω at inlet boundaries are estimated by the following formulas k i n 3 2 i t u i n 2 ω i n k i n 1 2 c μ 1 4 l s where i t here given to 5 is the turbulent intensity as a fraction of mean flow velocity u i n c μ 0 09 is a constant and l s is the turbulent length scale often close to cell size if the far field boundaries locate on the leeward side where water exits the domain they are treated as outlets where pressure is specified to zero and the neumann boundary condition is applied for k ω and flow velocity wall functions are not employed as mentioned so that the grid has to satisfy the use condition of ω based turbulence models i e the dimensionless distance to wall y should be less than 1 as recommended by wilcox 2006 for this thin body fitted mesh layers are attached to ship surface and the thickness of first layer is adjusted to meet the condition via a few precomputations in addition the situation of big ship small rudder should get attention their reynolds numbers are quite different for example if froude number is 0 142 for the kvlcc2 model with 2 9091 m long the reynolds number based on ship length is 2 21 10 6 while the rudder reynolds number based on rudder breadth is 5 97 10 4 which is estimated without considering wake so that the ω based turbulence models for low reynolds number flow i e without wall functions may be more appropriate for the rudder flow simulation 4 application and analysis 4 1 ship data and computational cases manoeuvring prediction is performed for the oil tanker kvlcc2 as mentioned which is the second version hull of a very large crude oil carrier vlcc designed by korea research institute of ships ocean engineering kriso it is a widely used benchmark ship for validation of cfd and manoeuvring prediction method the full scale ship is not built a variety of measured data about captive model test and free running model test are available from the workshop on verification and validation of ship manoeuvring simulation methods simman national maritime research institute nmri from japan carried out a series of captive model tests for the kvlcc2 model with scale ratio 1 110 maritime research institute netherlands marin carried out free running turning test and zig zag test for the model with scale ratio 1 45 714 during present rans simulations the model size accords with the one used by nmri the available principal particulars are listed in table 1 note that the propeller used by marin does not satisfy geometric similarity in order to obtain the derivatives in eq 2 a series of virtual captive model tests are performed by the expanded rans solver as described in previous section the virtual static tests are summarized in table 2 for acceleration derivatives dynamic pure surge pure sway and pure yaw are simulated as well they are defined by surge u u 0 δ u m a x cos 2 π t m t v 0 m s r 0 rad s s w a y u u 0 v v m a x cos 2 π t m t r 0 rad s y a w u u 0 v 0 m s r r m a x cos 2 π t m t where δ u m a x v m a x and r m a x are motion amplitudes t m is motion period the motion parameters are listed in table 3 where δ u m a x δ u m a x u 0 v m a x v m a x u 0 and r m a x r m a x l p p u 0 are non dimension motion amplitude of surge sway and yaw respectively 4 2 grid dependence analysis grid dependence analysis is firstly carried out coarse grids medium grids and fine grids are generated by systematically doubling cell size in three dimension for each case of rudder deflection the cell number is around 0 17 million for all coarse grids around 1 05 million for medium grids and around 7 54 million for find grids all grids satisfy the use condition of without wall functions i e y 1 by adjusting the thickness of first mesh layer surrounding hull and rudder the computed results for kvlcc2 in static straight ahead motion with rudder deflection and f n 0 142 are plotted in fig 3 the forces and moment have been made non dimensional by 1 2 ρ u 2 l p p 2 and 1 2 ρ u 2 l p p 3 respectively the resulting curves on the coarse grids show a relative large difference from the ones on the medium grids and fine grids especially for the longitudinal force acting on the hull and rudder i e x h r the results on the medium grids and fine grids on the whole come very close the side forces y on the medium grid and fine grid with 35 rudder deflection decrease considerably that indicates the flow separates strongly however the separation may be overestimated as the measured data does not show the rapid decrease during the simulations the thrust by body force propeller equals to ship resistance for the ship in straight ahead motion with zero rudder angle and it keeps unchanged for all rudder deflections that is to say the effects of rudder deflection on propeller thrust are neglected when using the simple body force propeller as mentioned the trend of x h r remain quite consistent with measured data even though they are all underestimated the underestimation may most probably be due to the neglect of free surface effects the comparison of the flows based on the coarse grid and fine grid for 35 rudder deflection with starboard side is shown in fig 4 the effects of grid density for 35 rudder deflection with port side are compared in fig 5 as well the arrows represent the vectors consisting of axial and transversal flow velocity the arrows of main flow point towards port side due to the rotating effects of body force propeller right handed rotation in general the flow features predicted by using the fine grid and coarse grid are similar nevertheless the coarse grid leads to a more numerical dissipation as the flow velocity decreases faster the vortex behind the rudder captured by the coarse grid displays a weaker strength as compared in fig 5 the static drift motion is also considered for the grid dependency analysis the coarse grid medium grid and fine grid without rudder deflection are used to compute the hydrodynamic forces and moment for the ship model in static drift motion with β 8 the results are listed in table 4 the change of force or moment becomes smaller as refining grid the difference between x h r on medium grid and fine grid is around 2 03 for y or n the difference is less than 2 according to above analyses the medium grids with around 1 05 million cells are selected for other cases only around 1 5 4 h are required to reach the convergence result for each case when running on a small workstation with using 8 processors several workstations with 16 24 processors are used and all static simulations can be completed within one week 4 3 rans results and hydrodynamic derivatives the computed results for kvlcc2 in static drift motion are shown in fig 6 the computed side forces and yaw moments are compared with available experimental data from nmri the comparison indicates the side forces and yaw moments are in general underestimated at non zero drift angles the computations can reach very high accuracy at β 8 as the error is generally less than 3 however most errors for yaw moment at β 16 are more than 10 fig 7 presents a comparison of the results for kvlcc2 in static circle motion with experimental data the comparison displays a same trend in terms of numerical accuracy as shown from the comparison for static drift cases that the accuracy is higher when motion amplitude is smaller at r 0 4 errors are in general less than 2 at r 0 8 the maximum error is more than 10 the computed results for the cases of combined static drift motion and static circular motion are shown in fig 8 for these cases the rudder is not defected most results are quite close to experimental data as observed the results of straight ahead motion with rudder deflection are presented in fig 9 the purpose of these computations is to determine the coupled derivatives of u and δ e g y u δ and n u δ the force or moment coefficients become smaller when froude number decreases when f n 0 05 the side force and yaw moment reduce a lot at δ 35 that indicates flow separates strongly the rans results shown in figs 6 9 are regressed by polynomials to obtain the corresponding derivatives the polynomials are expressed as f x 1 x 2 a 0 a 10 x 1 a 20 x 1 2 a 30 x 1 3 a 01 x 2 a 02 x 2 2 a 03 x 2 3 a 11 x 1 x 2 14 a 12 x 1 x 2 2 a 21 x 1 2 x 2 the derivatives are finally determined by comparing above formulas with the modelling expressions i e eq 2 note that the coefficients of longitudinal force shown in figs 6 8 are just for x h r without propeller thrust as mentioned in the simulations of static drift motion circle motion and circle motion with drift the thrust by body force propeller is assumed to be constant and equal to ship resistance in straight ahead motion with f n 0 142 i e without considering the effects of drift angle rudder deflection and yaw rate on propeller thrust this means regressions on x h r or on x will result in same derivatives since the derivatives depend on the change trend of results but not the absolute values however the coefficients of longitudinal force shown in fig 9 are of total force since four ship velocities are considered in the simulations of straight ahead motion and propeller thrust depends on ship velocity the regression for this case must be performed for the total longitudinal force with thrust the virtual dynamic motion tests are carried out to obtain acceleration derivatives the medium grid with zero rudder angle is used during the simulations the ship model keeps straight ahead motion with f n 0 142 initially until the flow reaches steady state then after a transitional time from straight ahead motion to harmonic oscillation motion surge sway and yaw starts during the transitional time ship velocity and acceleration in horizontal plane are prescribed by polynomials the purpose is to enable ship motion smooth transition avoiding possible computational divergence the time step is 0 06 s corresponding to 200 time steps per motion period ten outer loop iterations are performed in each time step the time traces of longitudinal force side force and yaw moment reach stable oscillation in half motion period after the harmonic oscillation motion starts it costs around one day to complete one period simulation the computed time histories of longitudinal force side force and yaw moment for pure surge pure sway and pure yaw in one period are shown in fig 10 the time histories are regressed by fifth order fourier series the reconstructed curves are presented in fig 10 as well the acceleration derivative can be then calculated by using the resulting coefficients of fourier series for each case the approach can be found in the literature by yao et al 2018 it should be noted that we just consider one amplitude and one period for each computation of dynamic case this consideration may be of negligible influence on the linear derivatives determined as reported by yoon 2009 the linear derivatives by single run method of pmm test were similar with that by multiple run method in the latter several pmm motion amplitudes were selected in this work we just perform the virtual dynamic tests to determine the corresponding linear acceleration derivatives as mentioned the resulting all derivatives are summarized in table 5 they will be used for manoeuver simulations a few linear derivatives are compared with experimental data as shown in table 6 the agreement is quite satisfactory most errors are less than 5 4 4 manoeuvre simulation the imo international maritime organization standard free running tests are simulated by solving eq 1 with the derivatives listed in table 5 the fourth order runge kutta scheme is applied to discretise the acceleration terms the virtual tests cover turning test zig zag test and inverse spiral test the simulated results for 35 rudder deflection with both starboard side and port side are shown in fig 11 the experimental data from marin is plotted in the figure too both simulated trajectory and turning rate agree fairly well with experimental data the resulting characteristic parameters are compared with the experimental ones as presented in table 7 the maximum error is around 6 89 for tactical diameter and most errors are under 5 the zig zag results from simulation and experiment are compared in figs 12 15 the simulated time histories of heading angle rudder angle and turning rate are very consistent with experimental data the maximum error of first overshoot angle is less than 1 5 as seen in table 8 the simulated periods of 20 20 test and 20 20 test are visibly overestimated whereas the periods are slightly underestimated for 10 10 test and 10 10 test this is most possible due to the less accuracy of the derivatives regarding of longitudinal velocity the thrust produced by the body force propeller should not be so accurate during rans simulations even though the final predictions of manoeuver reach very good agreements with experimental data the comparisons indicate the application of the rans tool for determining derivatives and the procedure for manoeuvring prediction work well at least for kvlcc2 according to equilibrium condition i e u v r 0 the motion equations of the ship in steady turning motion read m v r x g r 2 x u δ u x u u δ u 2 x u

rans tool for predicting ship manoeuvring the major time cost mainly stems from two aspects free surface flow and real rotating propeller especially amounts of simulations have to be considered to determine the required derivatives in this work we try to use the own expanded rans solver based on openfoam to determine ship derivatives and to predict ship manoeuvring using these derivatives for the rans solver there are three implements 1 a module is programed to compute the inertial forces in the rans equations expressed in ship fixed coordinate system 2 a new dirichlet boundary condition is implemented to specify flow velocity relative to a manoeuvring ship in the ship fixed coordinate system as well 3 a module of body force propeller is implemented the expanded rans method and the whole prediction procedure of ship manoeuvring has been described in order to reduce computational time the assumptions of double body flow and body force propeller are employed during the rans simulations the main purpose is to investigate the final accuracy of manoeuver simulation so as to check the applicability of the expanded rans solver and to confirm the effectiveness of prediction procedure it is found that the derivatives determined by pure rans simulation can be used for manoeuvring prediction at least for kvlcc2 and the whole procedure are acceptable as the simulated results of turning test and zig zag test show very high accuracy compared with experimental data the present work may be valuable in reference for the application of rans tool for ship manoeuvring prediction in regard of the balance of prediction accuracy and efficiency as it requires less than one week to complete the prediction for a ship in present application however only a low speed ship is considered in present application the free surface effects on the derivatives of high speed ships need to be investigated in the future the impacts of free surface on some hydrodynamic derivatives

20734,more and more successful applications of rans tool to obtain hydrodynamic derivatives or coefficients for ship manoeuvring prediction have been reported in recent years however to obtain all required hydrodynamic derivatives from pure rans simulations will be very time consuming due to many cases especially considering dynamic ship motions in water surface and real rotating propeller with dynamic grid approach this might be one of the limiting factors to apply rans tool for ship manoeuvring prediction widely although the relevant numerical methods have been demonstrated to be of acceptable accuracy in many respects so that it is quite necessary to explore the appropriate strategies when applying rans tool for ship manoeuvring prediction consequently balancing prediction accuracy and time cost as far as possible in this study we use the own expanded rans solver to simulate a series of captive model tests for the oil tanker kvlcc2 assumptions of double body flow and body force propeller are introduced during the simulations in order to reduce computational time hydrodynamic derivatives are determined by regression analysis to the computed hydrodynamic forces and free running turning test and zig zag test are simulated by using these derivatives the rans method and the whole procedure of manoeuvring prediction are described in this article the main purpose is to check the applicability of the expanded rans solver and to confirm the effectiveness of whole procedure of manoeuvring prediction it shows that the derivatives from rans can be used for manoeuvring prediction at least for kvlcc2 and the present strategy of ship manoeuvring prediction is quite promising in the respect of the balance of prediction efficiency and accuracy keywords manoeuvring prediction captive model test hydrodynamic derivatives rans openfoam 1 introduction the resolutions about energy efficiency design index eedi and energy efficiency operation index eeoi from international maritime organization imo put forward a higher request for ship design on one hand it should be necessary to use lower power equipment for reduction of energy consumption on the other hand the newly designed ship must have enough performance to cope with extreme environment for navigation safety to accurately evaluate ship performance becomes even more important than before at the initial stage of design helping reach a balance between safety and lower energy consumption as the continuous development of research methods and the increasing demand for high performance ships ship manoeuvrability has attracted much attention worldwide in recent years there are typically two strategies for evaluating ship manoeuvrability by physical model test in tank one is to perform free running tests that provides directly characteristic parameters e g tactical diameter overshoot angle etc to assess ship manoeuvring behaviour the other is based on system simulation for the later ship motion equations in which the hydrodynamic forces and moments are approximated by formulas with hydrodynamic derivatives or coefficients are solved to simulate free running tests hydrodynamic derivatives can be obtained by conducting a series of captive model tests in towing tank however since model tests are costly they are usually used in the later phase of design process after the final hull form is almost certain in order to estimate manoeuvrability at the initial stage of ship design a more effective way historically was to simulate free running tests using empirical hydrodynamic derivatives the prediction accuracy depends significantly on the similarity of targeted ship to parent ship from whom the empirical data are obtained certainly the final goal of ship manoeuvring prediction is for full scale ship in real navigation environment rather than for the model scale one for this the derivatives from model tests have to be corrected because of scale effects for example jing et al 2021 presented a study on the manoeuvring prediction of a full scale ship by using mmg type mathematical model with considering the effects of waves wind and current where mmg is the acronym of japan mathematical model group the application of computational fluid dynamics cfd to ship manoeuvring prediction has become popular during past three decades the cfd accuracy has been demonstrated to be acceptable for most cases when simulating captive model tests and free running model tests for example cura hochbaum 1998 developed a reynolds averaged naiver stokes rans code to simulate the turbulence around a ship in ship fixed coordinate system although the effects of free surface were neglected i e double body flow the computed results for the considered ships in static circular motion and static drift motion in calm water generally showed close agreements with available experimental data carrica et al 2006 presented a verification and validation study for a surface combatant in dynamic planar motion mechanism pmm motions the work demonstrated that the code cfdship iowa with overset grid approach and single phase level set approach to be of satisfactory accuracy in most aspects yao et al 2016 conducted rans simulations of static drift motion static circular motion and dynamic pure sway motion for an oil tanker in calm water on the openfoam platform the predicted hydrodynamic forces and moments and the flow at propeller plane were compared with available data the results showed acceptable agreements with experimental data other than these many other works in relevant to the rans simulation of captive ship model test were reported as well in history all studies indicated that rans accuracy was acceptable for most cases that have shown a promising prospect in the application of ship manoeuvring prediction however only a few scholars have attempted to use the derivatives which were purely determined by rans simulations for manoeuvring simulation for example cura hochbaum 2006 predicted manoeuvring behaviour of a ship model based on the derivatives determined by means of virtual captive model test a similar study was also done by simonsen et al 2012 who performed the standard deep water imo manoeuvring simulations for a container ship model with the hydrodynamic coefficients obtained from both rans simulation and experiment although a few simplifications were introduced in their approaches in order to reduce computational time the final results of free running simulation were satisfactory compared with experimental data more recently sukas et al 2021 employed a mmg type model to predict the manoeuvrability of a container ship with twisted rudder in the study most hydrodynamic coefficients such as derivatives of bare hull and a few hull propeller rudder interaction coefficients were determined by rans computations the study showed a very successful application of rans tool in ship manoeuvring prediction direct simulations of free running ship manoeuvres have been possible by rans as well the wave condition can be even considered for example carrica et al 2013 carried out overset rans simulations of turning and zig zag manoeuvres for a ship in calm water and in waves the study benefits from the advantages that the dynamic overset grid approach enables to solve the coupled equations of rans and six degrees of freedom dof ship motion however the simulations remain highly time consuming so far in present study manoeuvring predictions are performed for an oil tanker by using an abkowitz type mathematical model the prediction mainly follows the international towing tanker conference ittc recommended procedures and guidelines 2011 the derivatives are determined by using the own expanded rans solver on openfoam platform since double body flow and body force propeller are introduced in rans simulations computational time is greatly reduced the relevant methods and considerations are described and discussed in this article the main purpose is to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the whole strategy employed and to confirm the prediction accuracy of the final ship manoeuvre 2 ship motion equations and mathematical model a ship fixed coordinate system o x y z is used to describe the ship motion the origin o is located at the intersection of mid ship sections and undisturbed free surface x axis towards bow y axis towards starboard and z axis towards keel in this study we just consider 3 dof motion of the ship in horizontal plane according to newton s law the motion equations can be written as 1a m u v r x g r 2 x 1b m v u r x g r y 1c i z r m x g v u r n where x y and n are longitudinal force side force and yaw moment respectively m is ship mass u and v are translational velocities along x axis and y axis respectively r is turning rate about z axis x g is x coordinate of the centre of gravity and i z is inertial moment with respect to z axis the dot over quantity denotes the operation of derivation with respect to time an abkowitz type model abokowitz 1964 is employed to approximate the hydrodynamic forces and moment on the right side of eq 1 the used model has the following expressions 2a x x u δ u x u u δ u 2 x u u u δ u 3 x u u x v v x v v v 2 x v v v v 3 x r r x r r r 2 x r r r r 3 x δ δ x δ δ δ 2 x δ δ δ δ 3 x u u δ δ u 2 δ x u δ δ δ u δ 2 x v r v r

the ship speed being taken as the expansion point of taylor series to determine the hydrodynamic derivatives in eq 2 rans simulations are carried out to compute the hydrodynamic forces on the ship in captive motions as mentioned 3 rans method 3 1 mathematical equations and numerical discretization under the assumption of incompressible newtonian fluid the conservation equations of mass continuity equation and momentum rans equations in the ship fixed frame of reference can be written in tensor notation as 3 u i x i 0 4 u i t u i u j x j f i 1 ρ p x i x j ν u i x j u j x i u i u j u i t ε i j k ω j u k ε i j k ω j ε k m n ω m ω n 2 ε i j k ω j u k ε i j k ω j t x k where x i x y z and u i u v w are independent coordinates and flow velocity components u i u v w and ω i p q r are ship translational and angular velocity components in the ship fixed system p is dynamic pressure ε i j k is permutation symbol f i is body force per unit mass and u i u j is the specific reynolds stress tensor which is expressed under bousinesq s eddy viscosity hypothesis as 5 u i u j ν t u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j k where ν t is eddy viscosity δ i j is kronecker symbol and k is turbulent kinetic energy the last four terms in eq 4 stem from inertial motions of ship they are translational acceleration force per unit mass centrifugal force per unit mass coriolis force per unit mass and angular acceleration force per unit mass from left to right respectively a module is programed into openfoam to compute the four terms explicitly the ship motion variables are prescribed during the simulation and the module will be activated when using the rans solver to simulate the turbulence around ship the k ω sst turbulence model menter 2003 without wall functions is employed to approximate the eddy viscosity in eq 5 where sst is the acronym of shear stress transport and ω is specific dissipation rate since the model transport equations can be found everywhere and have been already described in a previous publication yao et al 2016 they are not repeated here note that for steady flow relative to ship the time related terms in above equations are all vanished although dynamic grid approaches such as overset and sliding grid have been available to simulate the rotating motion of propeller the term f i is still used to approximate the effects of rotating propeller on flow in this study the disadvantage when using real propeller is that the simulation requires a small time step to ensure enough accuracy e g at least 200 time steps per revolution is required that makes the time cost for flow simulation around hull rudder propeller system unacceptable however the idea behind body force propeller is to distribute body force inside a cylinder instead of real rotating propeller where the body force distribution depends on the averaged force distribution on the disk during one propeller revolution so that body force propeller allows a large time step in use how to deal with propeller is quite important in rans for highly efficient ship manoeuvring prediction in this study a rather simple body force propeller is used to approximate the rotating effects of propeller on flow a new module to compute the body force distribution has also been implemented in openfoam for this purpose the axial and tangential components of force distribution on propeller disk are prescribed by the following formulas e g stern et al 1988 6 f b x a x r 1 r 7 f b θ a θ r 1 r r 1 r h r h where 8 r r r h 1 r h r r r p r h r h r p 9 a x 15 8 t π δ p 3 r h 4 r p r p r h 10 a θ 15 8 q π δ p r p 3 r h 4

defined by r p r h and δ p i e π r p 2 r h 2 δ p a x and a θ are solved analytically via the integration of the body force over the volume i e 11 t f b x d v 12 q r f b θ d v where t and q are computed by making use of the open water curves of propeller advance ratio is defined by 13 j u 1 ω 0 n d p where ω 0 is wake fraction in straight ahead motion n is propeller revolution rate and d p is propeller diameter once t and q are known the body force distribution on the disk is determined uniquely actually for different t and q the pattern of body force distribution on the disk is same but the magnitude changes fig 1 presents an example of the body force distribution as seen both axial force and tangential force are zero values at root and tip and the distribution is of circumferential symmetry the body force propeller cannot produce side force and vertical force although they are usually of small value compared with the total side force acting on hull rudder propeller system the simple body force propeller can approximate well the propeller effects on hull and rudder as shown in the work by yao 2015 nevertheless it cannot predict correctly the effects of rudder and hull on propeller as the force distribution is assumed to be always axisymmetric regardless of the influences of drift angle and rudder deflection in addition the influence of ship longitudinal velocity is taken into account in a rather simple manner i e use eq 13 to estimate thrust even so the present work will demonstrate the body force propeller remains a very good alternative in use the rans solver in openfoam is based on a finite volume technique which permits use of arbitrary polyhedral grids including hexahedron tetrahedron prism etc a suite of basic discretization schemes and solution algorithms are available in present applications a second order upwind difference scheme uds and a central difference scheme cds are selected to approximate the convective terms and diffusive terms respectively a second order backward scheme is applied for time discretization turbulence is discretized with the second order uds the systems of linear equations resulting from the discretization are solved by using iterative solvers here gauss seidel relaxation for velocity k and ω generalized geometric multi grid gamg for pressure the pimple algorithm which merges piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators and simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithms is applied to couple the mass and momentum equations 3 2 grid and boundary conditions the software hexpress is used to generate computational grid the domain is limited by a box which ranges from 2 l p p to 1 5 l p p along ship length direction from 1 5 l p p to 1 5 l p p along beam direction and from 0 to 1 0 l p p along vertical direction fig 2 shows a sample grid for the oil tanker named kvlcc2 whose rudder horn is simplified for a better grid quality since free surface is seen as a rigid plane a symmetric boundary condition is imposed at the boundary z 0 on hull and rudder surfaces the flow has to satisfy no slip condition i e u i is zero ω is specified to 6 ν β 1 y w 2 where β 1 0 075 is a constant and y w is the distance to wall surface k is specified to 0 since no turbulence occurs at walls the usual slip condition is imposed at the water bottom boundary z 1 0 l p p for the four side boundaries in principle the free stream flow velocity k and ω are given at the windward boundaries inlets where water enters the domain the flow can be expected to be undisturbed provided the inlet boundaries are enough far away from the ship a new boundary condition to compute the free stream flow velocity has been implemented into openfoam as far as ship linear velocity vector u v w and rotating angler velocity vector p q r are given the free stream flow velocity at the mesh centres on a boundary can be calculated by the expression of the free stream flow velocity relative to ship i e u r y v r x 0 the free stream values of k and ω at inlet boundaries are estimated by the following formulas k i n 3 2 i t u i n 2 ω i n k i n 1 2 c μ 1 4 l s where i t here given to 5 is the turbulent intensity as a fraction of mean flow velocity u i n c μ 0 09 is a constant and l s is the turbulent length scale often close to cell size if the far field boundaries locate on the leeward side where water exits the domain they are treated as outlets where pressure is specified to zero and the neumann boundary condition is applied for k ω and flow velocity wall functions are not employed as mentioned so that the grid has to satisfy the use condition of ω based turbulence models i e the dimensionless distance to wall y should be less than 1 as recommended by wilcox 2006 for this thin body fitted mesh layers are attached to ship surface and the thickness of first layer is adjusted to meet the condition via a few precomputations in addition the situation of big ship small rudder should get attention their reynolds numbers are quite different for example if froude number is 0 142 for the kvlcc2 model with 2 9091 m long the reynolds number based on ship length is 2 21 10 6 while the rudder reynolds number based on rudder breadth is 5 97 10 4 which is estimated without considering wake so that the ω based turbulence models for low reynolds number flow i e without wall functions may be more appropriate for the rudder flow simulation 4 application and analysis 4 1 ship data and computational cases manoeuvring prediction is performed for the oil tanker kvlcc2 as mentioned which is the second version hull of a very large crude oil carrier vlcc designed by korea research institute of ships ocean engineering kriso it is a widely used benchmark ship for validation of cfd and manoeuvring prediction method the full scale ship is not built a variety of measured data about captive model test and free running model test are available from the workshop on verification and validation of ship manoeuvring simulation methods simman national maritime research institute nmri from japan carried out a series of captive model tests for the kvlcc2 model with scale ratio 1 110 maritime research institute netherlands marin carried out free running turning test and zig zag test for the model with scale ratio 1 45 714 during present rans simulations the model size accords with the one used by nmri the available principal particulars are listed in table 1 note that the propeller used by marin does not satisfy geometric similarity in order to obtain the derivatives in eq 2 a series of virtual captive model tests are performed by the expanded rans solver as described in previous section the virtual static tests are summarized in table 2 for acceleration derivatives dynamic pure surge pure sway and pure yaw are simulated as well they are defined by surge u u 0 δ u m a x cos 2 π t m t v 0 m s r 0 rad s s w a y u u 0 v v m a x cos 2 π t m t r 0 rad s y a w u u 0 v 0 m s r r m a x cos 2 π t m t where δ u m a x v m a x and r m a x are motion amplitudes t m is motion period the motion parameters are listed in table 3 where δ u m a x δ u m a x u 0 v m a x v m a x u 0 and r m a x r m a x l p p u 0 are non dimension motion amplitude of surge sway and yaw respectively 4 2 grid dependence analysis grid dependence analysis is firstly carried out coarse grids medium grids and fine grids are generated by systematically doubling cell size in three dimension for each case of rudder deflection the cell number is around 0 17 million for all coarse grids around 1 05 million for medium grids and around 7 54 million for find grids all grids satisfy the use condition of without wall functions i e y 1 by adjusting the thickness of first mesh layer surrounding hull and rudder the computed results for kvlcc2 in static straight ahead motion with rudder deflection and f n 0 142 are plotted in fig 3 the forces and moment have been made non dimensional by 1 2 ρ u 2 l p p 2 and 1 2 ρ u 2 l p p 3 respectively the resulting curves on the coarse grids show a relative large difference from the ones on the medium grids and fine grids especially for the longitudinal force acting on the hull and rudder i e x h r the results on the medium grids and fine grids on the whole come very close the side forces y on the medium grid and fine grid with 35 rudder deflection decrease considerably that indicates the flow separates strongly however the separation may be overestimated as the measured data does not show the rapid decrease during the simulations the thrust by body force propeller equals to ship resistance for the ship in straight ahead motion with zero rudder angle and it keeps unchanged for all rudder deflections that is to say the effects of rudder deflection on propeller thrust are neglected when using the simple body force propeller as mentioned the trend of x h r remain quite consistent with measured data even though they are all underestimated the underestimation may most probably be due to the neglect of free surface effects the comparison of the flows based on the coarse grid and fine grid for 35 rudder deflection with starboard side is shown in fig 4 the effects of grid density for 35 rudder deflection with port side are compared in fig 5 as well the arrows represent the vectors consisting of axial and transversal flow velocity the arrows of main flow point towards port side due to the rotating effects of body force propeller right handed rotation in general the flow features predicted by using the fine grid and coarse grid are similar nevertheless the coarse grid leads to a more numerical dissipation as the flow velocity decreases faster the vortex behind the rudder captured by the coarse grid displays a weaker strength as compared in fig 5 the static drift motion is also considered for the grid dependency analysis the coarse grid medium grid and fine grid without rudder deflection are used to compute the hydrodynamic forces and moment for the ship model in static drift motion with β 8 the results are listed in table 4 the change of force or moment becomes smaller as refining grid the difference between x h r on medium grid and fine grid is around 2 03 for y or n the difference is less than 2 according to above analyses the medium grids with around 1 05 million cells are selected for other cases only around 1 5 4 h are required to reach the convergence result for each case when running on a small workstation with using 8 processors several workstations with 16 24 processors are used and all static simulations can be completed within one week 4 3 rans results and hydrodynamic derivatives the computed results for kvlcc2 in static drift motion are shown in fig 6 the computed side forces and yaw moments are compared with available experimental data from nmri the comparison indicates the side forces and yaw moments are in general underestimated at non zero drift angles the computations can reach very high accuracy at β 8 as the error is generally less than 3 however most errors for yaw moment at β 16 are more than 10 fig 7 presents a comparison of the results for kvlcc2 in static circle motion with experimental data the comparison displays a same trend in terms of numerical accuracy as shown from the comparison for static drift cases that the accuracy is higher when motion amplitude is smaller at r 0 4 errors are in general less than 2 at r 0 8 the maximum error is more than 10 the computed results for the cases of combined static drift motion and static circular motion are shown in fig 8 for these cases the rudder is not defected most results are quite close to experimental data as observed the results of straight ahead motion with rudder deflection are presented in fig 9 the purpose of these computations is to determine the coupled derivatives of u and δ e g y u δ and n u δ the force or moment coefficients become smaller when froude number decreases when f n 0 05 the side force and yaw moment reduce a lot at δ 35 that indicates flow separates strongly the rans results shown in figs 6 9 are regressed by polynomials to obtain the corresponding derivatives the polynomials are expressed as f x 1 x 2 a 0 a 10 x 1 a 20 x 1 2 a 30 x 1 3 a 01 x 2 a 02 x 2 2 a 03 x 2 3 a 11 x 1 x 2 14 a 12 x 1 x 2 2 a 21 x 1 2 x 2 the derivatives are finally determined by comparing above formulas with the modelling expressions i e eq 2 note that the coefficients of longitudinal force shown in figs 6 8 are just for x h r without propeller thrust as mentioned in the simulations of static drift motion circle motion and circle motion with drift the thrust by body force propeller is assumed to be constant and equal to ship resistance in straight ahead motion with f n 0 142 i e without considering the effects of drift angle rudder deflection and yaw rate on propeller thrust this means regressions on x h r or on x will result in same derivatives since the derivatives depend on the change trend of results but not the absolute values however the coefficients of longitudinal force shown in fig 9 are of total force since four ship velocities are considered in the simulations of straight ahead motion and propeller thrust depends on ship velocity the regression for this case must be performed for the total longitudinal force with thrust the virtual dynamic motion tests are carried out to obtain acceleration derivatives the medium grid with zero rudder angle is used during the simulations the ship model keeps straight ahead motion with f n 0 142 initially until the flow reaches steady state then after a transitional time from straight ahead motion to harmonic oscillation motion surge sway and yaw starts during the transitional time ship velocity and acceleration in horizontal plane are prescribed by polynomials the purpose is to enable ship motion smooth transition avoiding possible computational divergence the time step is 0 06 s corresponding to 200 time steps per motion period ten outer loop iterations are performed in each time step the time traces of longitudinal force side force and yaw moment reach stable oscillation in half motion period after the harmonic oscillation motion starts it costs around one day to complete one period simulation the computed time histories of longitudinal force side force and yaw moment for pure surge pure sway and pure yaw in one period are shown in fig 10 the time histories are regressed by fifth order fourier series the reconstructed curves are presented in fig 10 as well the acceleration derivative can be then calculated by using the resulting coefficients of fourier series for each case the approach can be found in the literature by yao et al 2018 it should be noted that we just consider one amplitude and one period for each computation of dynamic case this consideration may be of negligible influence on the linear derivatives determined as reported by yoon 2009 the linear derivatives by single run method of pmm test were similar with that by multiple run method in the latter several pmm motion amplitudes were selected in this work we just perform the virtual dynamic tests to determine the corresponding linear acceleration derivatives as mentioned the resulting all derivatives are summarized in table 5 they will be used for manoeuver simulations a few linear derivatives are compared with experimental data as shown in table 6 the agreement is quite satisfactory most errors are less than 5 4 4 manoeuvre simulation the imo international maritime organization standard free running tests are simulated by solving eq 1 with the derivatives listed in table 5 the fourth order runge kutta scheme is applied to discretise the acceleration terms the virtual tests cover turning test zig zag test and inverse spiral test the simulated results for 35 rudder deflection with both starboard side and port side are shown in fig 11 the experimental data from marin is plotted in the figure too both simulated trajectory and turning rate agree fairly well with experimental data the resulting characteristic parameters are compared with the experimental ones as presented in table 7 the maximum error is around 6 89 for tactical diameter and most errors are under 5 the zig zag results from simulation and experiment are compared in figs 12 15 the simulated time histories of heading angle rudder angle and turning rate are very consistent with experimental data the maximum error of first overshoot angle is less than 1 5 as seen in table 8 the simulated periods of 20 20 test and 20 20 test are visibly overestimated whereas the periods are slightly underestimated for 10 10 test and 10 10 test this is most possible due to the less accuracy of the derivatives regarding of longitudinal velocity the thrust produced by the body force propeller should not be so accurate during rans simulations even though the final predictions of manoeuver reach very good agreements with experimental data the comparisons indicate the application of the rans tool for determining derivatives and the procedure for manoeuvring prediction work well at least for kvlcc2 according to equilibrium condition i e u v r 0 the motion equations of the ship in steady turning motion read m v r x g r 2 x u δ u x u u δ u 2 x u

rans tool for predicting ship manoeuvring the major time cost mainly stems from two aspects free surface flow and real rotating propeller especially amounts of simulations have to be considered to determine the required derivatives in this work we try to use the own expanded rans solver based on openfoam to determine ship derivatives and to predict ship manoeuvring using these derivatives for the rans solver there are three implements 1 a module is programed to compute the inertial forces in the rans equations expressed in ship fixed coordinate system 2 a new dirichlet boundary condition is implemented to specify flow velocity relative to a manoeuvring ship in the ship fixed coordinate system as well 3 a module of body force propeller is implemented the expanded rans method and the whole prediction procedure of ship manoeuvring has been described in order to reduce computational time the assumptions of double body flow and body force propeller are employed during the rans simulations the main purpose is to investigate the final accuracy of manoeuver simulation so as to check the applicability of the expanded rans solver and to confirm the effectiveness of prediction procedure it is found that the derivatives determined by pure rans simulation can be used for manoeuvring prediction at least for kvlcc2 and the whole procedure are acceptable as the simulated results of turning test and zig zag test show very high accuracy compared with experimental data the present work may be valuable in reference for the application of rans tool for ship manoeuvring prediction in regard of the balance of prediction accuracy and efficiency as it requires less than one week to complete the prediction for a ship in present application however only a low speed ship is considered in present application the free surface effects on the derivatives of high speed ships need to be investigated in the future the impacts of free surface on some hydrodynamic derivatives should be non negligible credit authorship contribution statement jianxi yao conceptualization methodology software writing review editing formal analysis visualization writing original draft
