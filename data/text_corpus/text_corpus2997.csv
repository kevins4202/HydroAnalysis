14985,considering the increasing demand for desalination plants and their byproduct brine this study investigated a humidification dehumidification hdh system for treating membrane distillation generated real high salinity brine using low grade heat 45 70 to explore its feasibility for sustainable energy efficient minimal liquid discharge a novel super hydrophilic fabric was adopted for accelerated humidification and its impact on brine droplet miscarriage characteristics was evaluated the influence of the operating fluid thermal properties cycle 1 air preheating cycle 2 air and brine dual fluid preheating and cycle 3 air post heating after humidification on the brine treatment efficiency energy consumption and chemical quality of freshwater produced was analyzed in detail to establish their characteristic nexus it was identified that during humidification increasing the brine temperature up to 55 influenced its ionic mobility thereby promoting efficient separation of the salts minerals and contributing to achieving better freshwater quality furthermore although cycle 3 exhibited improved system thermal efficiency gained output ratio equal to 1 77 its non preheated air contributed to a negative effect of the reduced humidity ratio 17 g kg leading to a lower freshwater productivity of 67 than that of cycle 2 29 g kg and 70 the present study also illustrates a novel effect of evaporative deposition occurring due to air water interaction on the fabric humidifier surface with an exploration of its effect on reducing freshwater chemical quality the freshwater generated from optimum thermal cycle 2 exhibited reduced ph by 63 sodium 99 9 chloride 99 9 toxic boron 99 7 and other chemical contaminants thereby satisfying the major international water reuse

scarcity has caused more deaths than floods during the past decade 2009 2019 miletto 2021 this stresses the urgency of finding sustainable and alternative solutions for global freshwater generation and management desalination has emerged as a proven technology to overcome the worldwide freshwater deficit with over 300 million people dependent on it to satisfy their basic needs ida water security handbook 2019 globally more than 19 000 active desalination plants produce 100 million m3 day of freshwater chen et al 2021b with an estimated expansion capacity exceeding 200 million m3 day by 2030 mavukkandy et al 2019 most established desalination technologies such as multi stage flashing msf reverse osmosis ro adsorption desalination ng et al 2013 and multi effect distillation med have a freshwater generation or process efficiency of 50 with the remaining concentrated half rejected in the form of brine shahzad et al 2017 owing to the rapid increase in the number of desalination plants the recent global brine production rate has increased to a significant figure of approximately 141 5 million m3 day 51 8 billion m3 year which is 50 higher than the desalinated freshwater production jones et al 2019 root 2019 in addition conventional brine disposal methods have adverse effects on the environment affecting both land and aquatic livelihood panagopoulos and haralambous 2020a petersen et al 2018 therefore with increasing concerns regarding desirable brine disposal methods and stringent norms zero liquid discharge zld and minimal liquid discharge mld processes have recently gained significance as effective means for concentrated brine treatment panagopoulos and haralambous 2020b thermal based zld systems comprise two components a brine concentrator and a brine crystallizer the concentrator concentrates the feed brine increasing its salinity while the crystallizer separates the salts from the concentrated brine through a crystallization process although zld can achieve 100 freshwater recovery it is characterized by a high cost complex design lu et al 2017 and the use of crystallizers which consume a significant amount of energy to recover a small portion of the salts from the concentrated brine chen et al 2021b therefore from an energy consumption and economic viewpoint mld is comparatively more sustainable than zld with a water recovery efficiency of 95 cipolletta et al 2021 the prime characteristics of a sustainable and enduring brine treatment technology are its response adaptability to the treated brine quality and non brine related system conditions operating temperature energy consumption and cost el cham et al 2020 with no complex requirements for pre or post treatment thermal based mld technology outperforms membranes in satisfying the above characteristics with direct utilization of brine ghalavand et al 2021 onishi et al 2021 even established membrane based technologies such as ro and electrodialysis ed suffer from scaling fouling issues due to the high salinity of brine and flux decrement caused by concentration polarization collectively limiting their usability to low salinity brine treatment panagopoulos and haralambous 2020b note that thermal based technologies such as msf med spray dryer sd vapor compression evaporation vce wind aided intensified evaporation waiv ohmic evaporator oe evaporation pond and solar still account for almost 70 of the total installed desalination capacity especially in middle eastern countries which generate 50 of the global desalinated water ashraf et al 2022 among the above technologies msf and med are the ones predominantly adopted for thermal based desalination panagopoulos et al 2019 their recent integration with advanced devices and hybrid mechanisms has enabled their use for realizing efficient brine treatment processes for example msf coupled with a crystallizer and a membrane distillation md module has contributed to accomplish an enhanced water recovery rate of 89 which is notably better than either technology employed separately von eiff et al 2021 however the maximum thermal efficiency was achieved with 40 stages which require a high initial capital investment along with a large space similarly the integration of med with a crystallizer resulted in efficient brine treatment with reduced specific thermal energy consumption 680 to 288 kj kg attained by increasing the number of stages from 3 to 10 chen et al 2021b the above technologies involve multi stage operation with a crystallizer which increases the cost and energy input in addition the structures are built of austenitic stainless steel which suffers from corrosion issues due to the use of high total dissolved solids tds brine containing a high concentration of chlorine which results in material constraints deyab 2019 the alternative highly corrosion resistant alloys further raise the system cost panagopoulos et al 2019 sds developed to replace conventional crystallizers also feature high energy consumption for brine treatment 52 64 kwh m3 with respect to other thermal technologies along with the need for specialized pre treatment to eliminate salt impurities panagopoulos and haralambous 2020a concerning the vce process a high quality distillate is produced with low electric energy consumption in the range of 10 45 kwh m3 however its high investment capital and maintenance cost resulting from the corrosion of the compressor must be taken into account arafat 2017 waiv technology was developed as an alternative to a less efficient evaporation pond it aimed at increasing the brine evaporation rate using wetted surfaces which could contribute to an enhanced rate of water recovery and salts although the waiv technology s evaporation rate was 50 90 higher than that of evaporation pond with reduced land space and cost waiv technology causes groundwater pollution due to brine leaching cipolletta et al 2021 in contrast oe technology is efficient enough for the treatment of high salinity brines containing tds exceeding 80 000 ppm with a significant water recovery rate of 81 93 5 however this technology requires a complex integration of the temperature and electric field distribution setup for the evaporation of brine this contributes to hinder the process control with limited adoption leading to a lack of in depth data for large scale implementation sakr and liu 2014 thus globally it can be concluded that the above thermal based technologies can be categorized as 1 those that demand high energy and 2 those that require expensive specialized construction materials to overcome the issues of corrosion scaling or involve the adoption of complex monitoring components for customized process control unlike the aforementioned thermal based technologies the humidification dehumidification hdh technique has been widely adopted over the past decade owing to its established advantages such as moderate operating temperature 80 and pressure 1 bar simple system construction with low cost local materials and easy operation with an evaporation condensation mechanism that does not require complex supplies for monitoring and maintenance santosh et al 2019a furthermore the advantage of integrating hdh systems with low grade heat sources has attracted interest in the development of cost and energy efficient hybrid systems for decentralized fresh and potable water production santosh et al 2020 2019b researchers have focused on the effective utilization of low grade waste heat rejected from heating ventilation and air conditioning units santosh et al 2022a and solar pv panels anand et al 2021 for simultaneous freshwater production through a hybrid hdh process it is identified that effective heat recovery contributes to the overall performance improvement of these preinstalled systems owing to the aforementioned significant merits and its better suitability for treating high salinity water dehghani et al 2019 hdh technology is also recently adopted for brine treatment analysis of a hybrid hdh med vce zld system indicated that coupling hdh with the med vce technique contributed to a 10 cost reduction in brine water treatment along with a 12 decline in the produced freshwater environmental impact ghofrani and moosavi 2020a similarly coupling a heat pump with the brine recirculation mechanism in hdh systems has been identified to efficiently contribute to brine water treatment and freshwater recovery ghofrani and moosavi 2020b analysis of the integration of hdh systems with brine crystallizers indicated that the hdh technique aided in reducing the initial cost heat and electrical energy consumption by 58 59 and 56 respectively chen et al 2021a however note that the above hdh based research studies involved the production of freshwater at the cost of steam refrigerant or brine crystallizers which contribute to a major share of the energy and economics and demand auxiliary dedicated monitoring devices these factors hinder the adoption of hybrid techniques thus limiting their large scale practicality panagopoulos and haralambous 2020b therefore considering the present perspective and advantages of mld over zld the principal objective of the present study was to evaluate the technical feasibility of the hdh technique for conversion of brine water into freshwater recently it was identified that the hdh technique is efficient in producing freshwater with reduced salt and ionic concentrations even with the direct utilization of seawater at ambient temperature 25 and latent heat recovery santosh et al 2022b however the maximum humidity ratio increment achieved with the utilization of hydrophobic humidifier material was limited to 16 2 g kg under optimum conditions in order to achieve better humidification the present work involved the utilization of super hydrophilic fiber coolmax fabric as a humidifier while all the previously reported hdh systems focus only on treating seawater or domestic wastewater santosh et al 2022a xu et al 2022 the significant merit and novelty of the research hereby reported is the utilization of real brine generated from membrane distillation system thereby evaluating the feasibility of adopting energy and cost effective hdh process for mld applications furthermore narayan et al 2010b theoretically identified the improvement in the heat recovery potential of moist air over dry air motivated by the same the present work is a novel attempt to experimentally comprehend the hdh performance based on different thermal processes and its effect on the brine treatment efficiency energy consumption and produced water quality was analyzed in detail to establish their characteristic nexus in summary the specific objectives of the present work include i to evaluate the hdh thermal performance improvement with the adoption of a fiber based humidifier ii to investigate the feasibility of hdh technology for treating real membrane distillation generated brine and iii experimentally establish a nexus between the different thermal process i e utilization of moist and dry air and its low grade heat recovery potential thus the reported results highlight the benefits of designing and adopting low grade heat powered hdh systems as mld technology for local treatment of high salinity brines produced from desalination plants 2 system and material description the schematics of three different thermal cycles i e air preheating cycle 1 air and water dual fluid preheating cycle 2 and air post heating after humidification cycle 3 adopted for the treatment of brine using an hdh process powered by low grade heat energy are depicted in fig a1 appendix a in supplementary material its simplified version is depicted in fig 1 further a photograph of the experimental setup is shown in fig 2 the major system components include a humidifier unit finned tube heat exchange dehumidifier unit low grade heat air cum water preheater heat exchanger based heating unit frequency regulated air blower 164 w and brine micro pump 5500 rpm max for fluid circulation the dimensions of both the humidifier and dehumidifier units were kept identical l w h 13 cm 13 cm 33 cm to achieve maximum hdh effect during brine and air interaction across their active surface areas the humidifier unit was loaded with non woven polyester based hydrophilic coolmax fabric henceforth hydrophilic fiber purchased online from a local dealer fabric factory owing to its characteristics which include high water absorption capacity diffusivity and moisture evaporation rate xu et al 2017 compared to other fabric materials duan et al 2022 apart from these superior characteristics practical advantages such as commercial availability high durability easy cleaning replacement simple construction and slender thickness 0 5 mm in the present study which reduce the thermal resistance with an improved heat transfer rate xu et al 2021 make this hydrophilic fabric particularly suitable for localized cost effective brine treatment applications unlike conventional humidifiers that operate through direct interaction of air and water media which could contribute to brine droplet carry away with subsequent mixing in the produced freshwater li and zhang 2016 fabric humidifiers aid in preventing such miscarriage thus safeguarding the dehumidifier metal components from scaling corrosion issues along with the simultaneous production of high quality freshwater santosh et al 2022a therefore around sixty four customized hollow hydrophilic fiber structures l d 33 cm 1 cm were fabricated for convenient accommodation in the humidifier unit with a total active surface area of 0 13 m2 as shown in fig a 2 appendix a supplementary material the hydrophilic fibers were longitudinally placed at an equal distance 0 5 cm inside the humidifier unit with the support of a guiding helical spring and mesh structure fig 2 in addition to stable positioning and construction of the hydrophilic fibers the stainless steel helical spring also aid in realizing smooth transport of air inside their hollow gaps contributing to the effective interaction of air and brine during the humidification process the dehumidifier unit was equipped with copper tubes containing mounted aluminum fins for an effective dehumidification process the freshwater generation rate at the bottom of the dehumidifier unit was constantly monitored using an electronic weighing machine cuw6200hx with an accuracy of 1 make cas and the complete experimental setup was properly insulated with rubber foam to prevent convective and radiative heat losses 3 experimentation as mentioned earlier the present study aimed to utilize low grade heat energy for brine treatment through an hdh process owing to the material employed for fabricating hdh systems polycarbonate plastic and instrumental constraints the preheating low grade waste heat temperature ranges of the air and brine were maintained at 50 70 and 45 55 respectively furthermore closed air circulation was adopted owing to its enhanced thermal efficiency compared to open air circulation yuan and zhang 2007 the initial experiments were directed toward the optimization of the brine flow rate ṁb with an initial air preheated temperature ta of 70 across the humidifier inlet followed by airflow rate ṁa optimization thus for optimum values of ṁb and ṁa the effect of the air preheating temperature 50 70 was evaluated thermal cycle 1 fig 1 a finally for the above optimum values the effect of the additional brine preheating temperature tb in the range of 45 55 i e air and brine dual fluid preheating thermal cycle 2 fig 1 b on the thermal performance of the hdh system was examined to comparatively evaluate the efficient heat recovery potential of the air under dry and moist conditions the air post heating process involved heating the air after humidification across the humidifier exit thermal cycle 3 fig 1 c regarding thermodynamics it was identified that the heat recovery potential of moist air in an hdh process is better than that of dry air narayan et al 2010b however to the best of the authors knowledge its practical characteristics are yet to be explored and the present study was extended to estimate its effect on brine treatment for all the aforementioned thermal cycles the effect of the thermal characteristics on the chemical quality of the treated brine was analyzed in detail to identify the optimum thermal cycle in terms of both energy utilization and treatment quality concerning thermal cycle 1 the experimental process initially involved preheating the air to the desired temperature using a low grade heat preheater thus making it hot and dry subsequently it was passed through a humidifier unit packed with a hydrophilic fiber humidifier upon interaction with the feed brine the air was humidified resulting in a decrease and increase in temperature and relative humidity ϕ respectively this saturated air upon interaction with the coolant across the dehumidifier resulted in freshwater generation on the surface of the tubes owing to condensation or latent heat extraction thus dehumidifying it interestingly direct utilization of brine generated from a membrane distillation system was considered in this study as a coolant at ambient temperature 25 with no auxiliary cooling mechanism santosh et al 2022b to make the entire process energy and cost efficient the dehumidified air from the dehumidifier exit was recirculated in successive cycles by using an air duct as shown in fig 2 furthermore the concentrated brine and generated freshwater were collected at the base of the humidifier and dehumidifier units thus making the entire process a closed air open water cycle regarding thermal cycle 2 the process involved additional preheating of the brine across the humidifier entry to evaluate its potential effect on the system s thermal characteristics unlike cycle 2 thermal cycle 3 focused on the preheating of humidified air across the humidifier exit to evaluate the heat recovery potential of moist air and its effect on brine treatment quality all experiments were performed under steady state conditions for a continuous 8 h duration and with interconnected brine flow from the dehumidifier to the humidifier to achieve the dual benefit of latent heat extraction with simultaneous brine preheating the fabric humidifier was initially air dried and then cleaned between each experiment for the removal of the salt deposit on its surface and effective operation for the subsequent cycle 4 instrumentation and chemical analysis the temperature at various locations of the hdh system as shown in fig a 1 b was measured throughout the experiments including the temperature of the hot dry air across the blower s entry s9 exit s1 and humidifier s entry s2 as well as the humidified air temperature across the humidifier s3 to s6 and dehumidifier s entry s7 exit s8 using temperature probe sensors accuracy 0 1 the brine temperature was measured using a similar type of sensor s10 s13 hx92b omega transmitters accuracy 2 5 were utilized to measure the relative humidity of the operating air medium across the humidifier r1 r2 and dehumidifier r3 r4 units the velocity and flow rate of air and brine were monitored using a kimo ctv110 air velocity transmitter v accuracy 3 and rotameter respectively furthermore the quantity of freshwater produced across the dehumidifier unit was measured continuously using an electronic weighing machine cuw6200hx accuracy 1 all the aforementioned sensors and devices were calibrated prior to usage and were connected to a customized data acquisition system that provided constant monitoring and storage of the data at regular intervals of 2 s to evaluate the brine treatment capability of the developed system for different thermal cycles a water quality analysis was performed for the feed brine and generated freshwater a detailed physical analysis was carried out to evaluate inherent properties such as salinity ph total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec furthermore chemical analysis was focused on the rate of decrement in the major legitimate ions including na mg2 ca2 k and sr using atomic absorption spectrometric aas analysis along with the evaluation of other anions and cations using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms and ion chromatography techniques to explore the influence of different hdh processes thermal cycles on brine treatment quality a detailed chemical analysis of freshwater generated from the three cycles was also carried out for investigating the anions cations and other legitimate ions using the aforementioned techniques immediately after production to avoid faulty results due to water contamination 5 thermal performance assessment to evaluate the energy effectiveness of the developed system in terms of low grade heat utilization various thermal performance evaluation factors were considered as discussed in this section 5 1 low grade heat energy utilization factor the low grade heat energy utilization ability or thermal efficiency of the hdh system for converting brine into freshwater can be expressed in terms of the heat utilization factor huf or gained output ratio gor as follows yuan and zhang 2007 1 h u f or g o r m f γ q i n where ṁf γ and qin are the freshwater generation rate condensation latent heat and low grade heat thermal energy input to the system 5 2 electrical energy utilization factor the electrical energy utilization factor euf or electrical efficiency is the ratio of hourly system efficiency in converting brine into freshwater termed as productivity i e ṁf and its corresponding electrical energy consumption e this is an important factor that represents the instantaneous electrical energy utilized by the hdh system for brine treatment it is evaluated as follows santosh et al 2020 2 e u f m f e 5 3 humidification capacity factor the thermal characteristics of the air medium across the humidifier unit vary according to the different preheating or thermal cycles adopted this subsequently contributes to a distinction in the humidification capacity which can be expressed in terms of the humidification capacity factor hcf determined as follows ahmed et al 2017 3 h c f i m a ω a h o u t ω a h i n γ q i n where i represents thermal cycle 1 2 or 3 ṁa is the mass flow rate of air ωa h out and ωa h in are the corresponding relative humidity ratios across the exit and entry of the fabric humidifier unit it is noteworthy that the hcf is the direct indication of the humidification rate i e a value of hcf 0 indicates nil humidification and it is dependent on the increase in the relative humidity ratio across the humidifier exit based on the different thermal cycles adopted the thermal energy input to the fabric humidifier unit qin can be expressed as follows 4 q i n m a h a h e a t o u t h a h e a t i n m b c p b t b h e a t o u t t b h e a t i n where ṁb and cpb are the mass flow rate and specific heat of the feed brine and ha heat out and ha heat in represent the air enthalpy after and before the preheating process similarly tb heat out and tb heat in represent the brine temperature after and before the preheating procedure for cycle 1 m b c p b t b h e a t o u t t b h e a t i n is nil as it involves only air preheating also t b h e a t o u t t b h i n for cycles 2 and 3 where t b h i n represents the brine temperature across the humidifier inlet 5 4 humidifier effectiveness factor the humidification rate or effectiveness of the fabric humidifier varies with the thermal characteristics of the processed air achieved through different thermal cycles this can be accounted for in terms of the humidifier effectiveness factor εhi as follows qasem et al 2019 5 ε h i ω a h o u t ω a h i n ω a h o u t s ω a h i n where ω a h o u t s is the humidity ratio when the humidified air across the humidifier exit is saturated i e 100 this indicates that the maximum achievable εhi is 1 which corresponds to 100 humidification efficiency 5 5 dehumidifier effectiveness factor similar to the humidifier the dehumidifier effectiveness εdhi accounted for different thermal cycles as follows ahmed et al 2017 6 ε d h i ω a d h i n ω a d h o u t ω a d h i n ω a s t b d h i n where ωa dh in and ωa dh out are the corresponding humidity ratios across the entry and exit points of the dehumidifier unit respectively furthermore ω a s t b d h i n is the humidity ratio of the saturated air at a temperature equal to tb dh in 5 6 heat capacity ratio factor the humidification process involves both heat and mass transfers which contribute to the humidity ratio characteristics of the air the humidity ratio further influences the humidified air enthalpy rate which can be accounted based on the heat capacity ratio factor hcr as follows miller and lienhard 2013 narayan et al 2013a 7 h c r δ h b r i n e max δ h a i r max where δ h b r i n e max and δ h a i r max are the maximum enthalpy rate difference across the cold brine and hot air sides respectively expressed as follows 8 δ h b r i n e max m b c p b t a h i n t b h i n 9 δ h a i r max m a c p a t a h i n t b h i n where cpa and ta h in are the specific heat of the air and its temperature at the humidifier inlet respectively in the present context hcr can be utilized to evaluate the reliability or stability of the fabric humidifier for varying thermal characteristics across the hdh system with variations in the thermal cycles it is noteworthy that a heat and mass exchange process is balanced at hcr 1 the point at which the entropy production is also minimum narayan et al 2010a 5 7 water recovery factor as the present work focuses on mld technology water recovery rate or water recovery factor wrf is also accounted for the different thermal cycles adopted defined as the ratio of produced freshwater mass flow to the feed brine mass flow indicated as 10 w r f m f m b the details of the standard instrumental error table a1 and experimental uncertainty table a2 are presented in appendix a 6 results and discussion a series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the brine treatment feasibility of the developed system and identify the optimum conditions for maximum freshwater productivity the initial experimentation was focused on the adoption of only air preheating cycle 1 and optimization of ṁb ranging from 0 3 to 2 1 l min with initial t a h i n and ṁa of 70 and 3 5 kg min respectively the brine inlet across the dehumidifier was maintained at ambient temperature 25 for all the thermal cycles for the optimum value of ṁb the analysis was extended to identify the optimum values of ṁa and t a h i n in the respective ranges of 1 5 3 5 kg min and 50 70 thus for the aforementioned optimum parameters the effect of t b h e a t i n in the range of 45 55 on the thermal performance and brine treatment quality was evaluated i e cycle 2 furthermore considering the efficient theoretical heat recovery potential of moist air over dry air narayan et al 2010b experiments were conducted with post heating of the air after humidification cycle 3 and its effects on the system thermal characteristics and chemical quality of freshwater produced were evaluated therefore this section highlights the main results achieved with the above experiments and the influence of various governing parameters on the thermal performance and chemical quality of the generated freshwater 6 1 evaluation of thermal characteristics through system optimization 6 1 1 effect of brine mass flow rate ṁb on hdh thermal characteristics the characteristic thermal variation in the humidifier section as a function of ṁb is shown in fig 3 a a minimum air temperature drop δta h and relative humidity rise δϕa h of 18 and 42 were measured for a low value of ṁb of 0 3 l min and initial ṁa of 3 5 kg min as mentioned earlier with an increase in the flow rate up to 1 2 l min the percentage increase in δta h and δϕa h was 52 and 34 equivalent to the actual temperature drop and relative humidity rise of 28 and 59 respectively these maximum values contributed to a maximum humidity ratio rise δωa h of 8 g kg for ṁb equal to 1 2 l min although a further increase in ṁb contributed to an increase in δta h owing to efficient heat transfer from air to brine across the wet surface area of the hydrophilic fiber humidifier it also resulted in a decreasing trend in δϕa h fig 3 a this can be attributed to the inefficient mass transfer across the humidifier unit at higher ṁb the optimum flow rate of air and fluid that leads to the maximum heat and mass transfer across the humidifier unit of any hdh system is highly dependent on its configuration and the type of humidifier material adopted xu et al 2019 thus a reduced mass transfer resulted in a decreasing trend of δωa h at higher ṁb 1 5 up to 2 1 l min the freshwater productivity and dehumidifier thermal characteristics for varying ṁb are shown in fig 3 b with an increase in ṁb to 1 2 l min increasing and decreasing trends of the air temperature drop denoted as an absolute value δta dh and brine temperature rise δtb dh were identified respectively a maximum δta dh of 15 was measured for ṁb equal to 1 2 l min with a corresponding value of δtb dh of 10 although a decreasing trend in δtb dh was identified with an increase in ṁb from 0 3 to 1 2 l min the equivalent increase in the freshwater productivity could be attributed to the corresponding increase first in δϕa h and then in δωa h during the humidification process fig 3 a in addition the increasing humidity consequently contributed to a lower air temperature across the dehumidifier inlet which aided in maintaining a lower surface temperature on the dehumidifier tubes thus collectively assisting in attaining a better condensation of the humidified air therefore a maximum brine conversion rate of 890 ml h was achieved for ṁb equal to 1 2 l min in line with the humidification characteristics however note that although δta h was comparatively higher at higher ṁb 1 5 up to 2 1 l min fig 3 a the corresponding lower δωa h influenced the dehumidification potential resulting in reduced brine conversion rate i e freshwater productivity as inferred from fig 3 b in other words the humidification rate that influences the freshwater productivity is significantly dependent on the mass ratio across the humidifier unit defined as the ratio of ṁb to ṁa and this characteristic is both system and process specific including the attributes of the humidifier material utilized hussain soomro et al 2022 thus maximum productivity was identified at an optimum value of ṁb of 1 2 l min 6 1 2 analysis of brine treatment efficiency with variation in air mass flow rate ṁa the influence of ṁa on the thermal performance and brine conversion efficiency for an optimum value of ṁb of 1 2 l min is shown in fig 4 fig 4 a depicts the variation in the prime parameters across the hydrophilic fiber humidifier it can be inferred that the increasing ṁa contributed to effective heat transfer resulting in an increasing trend of humidified air temperature at the humidifier exit ta h out subsequently a decreasing trend in the relative humidity of humidified air ϕa h out was observed however a maximum δωa h of 8 g kg was reached for ṁa equal to 3 5 kg min contributing to a maximum brine conversion rate of 890 ml h as shown in fig 4 b owing to the combined effect of ta h out and ϕa h out an increasing trend in δωa h was identified for an increase in ṁa note the dominant influence of ṁa on the hdh thermal characteristics from the drastic increase in the temperature drop δta dh and rise δtb dh in the air and brine fluids across the dehumidifier unit fig 4 b owing to the effective heat transfer across the dehumidifier with an increase in ṁa a maximum increase in δtb dh of 5 0 and 10 was reached for minimum and maximum ṁa values of 2 and 3 5 kg min respectively thus for ṁa equal to 3 5 kg min the higher temperature brine from the dehumidifier reached the hydrophilic fiber humidifier unit and subsequently interacted with the air medium contributing to efficient humidification with higher δωa h which substantiates the results shown in fig 4 a therefore the dehumidification or condensation of the saturated air containing brine was identified to be mainly influenced by ṁa it is to be mentioned that the maximum ṁa was limited to 3 5 kg min owing to the system s equipment limitations also note that although values of ṁa below 2 kg min contributed to realizing efficient humidification the dehumidification was not satisfactory owing to the inefficient interaction of the humidified air on the dehumidifier s tube surface which could be attributed to the reduction in air velocity caused by the densely packed hydrophilic fiber in the humidifier unit 6 1 3 effect of air inlet temperature across the hydrophilic fiber humidifier ta h in thermal cycle 1 on brine treatment efficiency the air temperature at the inlet of the hydrophilic fiber humidifier ta h in mainly influences the evaporation rate of brine which subsequently controls the rate of freshwater productivity across the dehumidifier therefore the influence of ta h in on brine treatment thermal efficiency was evaluated considering a temperature range of 50 70 for optimum values of ṁb and ṁa of 1 2 l min and 3 5 kg min within the system s equipment limitations respectively i e those of air preheating thermal cycle 1 a steady increase in δta h and δϕa h was identified with an increase in ta h in as shown in fig 5 a indicating the prime influence of air temperature on the brine evaporation rate a maximum relative humidity rise of 59 accompanied by an air temperature drop of 28 c were measured for a high value of ta h in of 70 collectively contributing to a high value of δωa h of 8 g kg which indicates a better brine evaporation rate compared to lower values of ta h in this can be attributed to the better heat and mass transfer achieved between the air and brine across the surface of the hydrophilic fiber humidifier leading to better brine evaporation at a high ta h in subsequently higher and lower freshwater productivities of 890 and 496 ml h were achieved with ta h in equal to 70 and 50 c respectively in addition an increasing trend in δta dh and δtb dh was identified with an increase in ta h in indicating efficient heat transfer between the humidified air and brine inside the dehumidifier tubes at high ta h in this confirms the insight that at higher values of ta h in ta h out also aids in realizing efficient heat transfer to the brine inside the dehumidifier tubes which were subsequently sprayed i e at tb h in the temperature of the brine at the humidifier inlet on the surface of the hydrophilic fiber humidifier thereby contributing to higher ωa h out and resulting in higher freshwater productivity this can be visualized by comparing fig 5 a and 5 b a higher rate of brine evaporation and subsequent freshwater productivity was achieved at ta h in equal to 70 6 1 4 effect of brine preheating thermal cycle 2 on system performance from the results of the system behavior for varying ta h in it can be inferred that tb h in influences ωa h out which further plays a major role in the brine treatment efficiency or conversion rate therefore to enhance the evaporation rate of brine across the humidifier a dual fluid preheating technique thermal cycle 2 was adopted santosh et al 2019a the brine was preheated using low grade heat energy range of 45 55 before its entry into the hydrophilic fiber humidifier unit from fig 6 a it can be inferred that an increase in tb h in caused an increasing trend in ta h out and ϕa h out however a comparison of figs 5 a and 6 a indicates that at an optimum value of ta h in of 70 the preheating of brine to 45 50 and 55 contributed to a significant increase in δωa h by 121 17 g kg 233 25 g kg and 280 29 g kg respectively owing to higher values of ta h out and ϕa h out achieved by effective humidification across the hydrophilic fiber surface subsequently during dehumidification freshwater productivities of 1485 1790 and 2100 ml h were achieved for values of tb h in of 45 50 and 55 c respectively which were 67 101 and 136 higher than the brine conversion rate achieved for the same ta h in of 70 in the case of thermal cycle 1 in addition comparing figs 5 b and 6 b it can be seen that a higher δtb dh was achievable in the case of thermal cycle 2 for all the values of ta h in considered this can contribute to reducing the energy requirement for brine preheating 6 1 5 effect of air post heating after humidification thermal cycle 3 on system performance thermal cycle 3 focused on the process of heating humidified air to evaluate the low grade heat recovery potential of moist air and its effect on brine treatment quality to establish a fair comparison between thermal cycles 2 and 3 the experiments involved heating humidified air to an identical optimum temperature of 70 across the humidifier exit ta h out or dehumidifier inlet ta dh in with brine preheated in the range of 45 55 at the humidifier entry thus achieving a dual fluid heating process similar to thermal cycle 2 the characteristic variation in thermal cycle 3 is shown in fig 7 considering the humidifier thermal characteristics owing to the closed air circulation of the dehumidified air from the dehumidifier exit to the hydrophilic fiber humidifier entry the relative humidity of the dehumidified air ϕa dh out in the range of 91 92 contributed to having a lower ta h in the range 37 42 versus 70 in thermal cycle 2 when this comparatively low temperature humidified air interacted with the high temperature preheated brine 45 55 across the humidifier efficient heat transfer on the hydrophilic fiber surface resulted in an increase in the air temperature with values of ta h out of 39 44 and 46 for values of tb h in of 45 50 and 55 respectively as shown in fig 7 a note that unlike the previous cycles which resulted in a temperature drop of the air across the humidifier exit a temperature rise was identified in thermal cycle 3 because of the brine interaction at comparatively higher temperature thus the heating post humidification process cycle 3 contributed to two thermodynamic advantages namely heat recovery from the preheated brine by lower temperature air ta dh out during humidification and lower energy spent for the temperature rise of the saturated air cycle 3 compared to preheated air cycle 2 in other words it is more likely that the energy required to raise the temperature of the higher temperature more saturated air be less than that of comparatively less saturated air narayan et al 2010b owing to the non preheating air recirculation the relative humidity of the air medium ϕa h out also increased to a maximum of 99 9 for all values of tb h in considered fig 7 a however comparing figs 6 a and 7 a it can be inferred that although cycle 3 aided in achieving efficient heat transfer or low grade heat recovery the above characteristics ta h out and ϕa h out lowered the value of δωa h 11 g kg 14 g kg and 17 g kg for values of tb h in of 45 50 and 55 respectively indicating that the preheated air at higher temperature cycle 2 could efficiently sustain higher moisture compared to non preheated air during humidification therefore low values of δωa h resulted in lower freshwater productivity as indicated in fig 7 b compared to cycle 2 similar to the humidifier heating humidified air also contributed to efficient heat transfer across the dehumidifier unit this was evident from the higher values of δta dh and δtb dh fig 7b in the case of thermal cycle 3 compared to those of cycle 2 fig 6b thus it was identified that although thermal cycle 3 contributed to efficient heat transfer across both the humidifier and dehumidifier units as inferred theoretically by narayan et al 2010b the mass transfer rate was affected across the humidifier owing to the lower moisture holding capacity of the non preheated air medium leading to a negative effect of reduction in δωa h that reduced the maximum brine conversion rate for thermal cycle 3 2010 ml h compared to thermal cycle 2 2100 ml h nevertheless the significantly higher values of δta dh and δtb dh in thermal cycle 3 improved the overall cyclic thermal efficiency as discussed in the subsequent section 6 1 6 performance comparison of different thermal cycles a system performance comparison in terms of the optimum conditions of brine treatment based on thermal characteristics and performance evaluation factors for the different thermal cycles adopted is shown in fig 8 a and b respectively comparing the main humidification parameters which include ϕa h out and δωa h it can be inferred that the maximum values of δωa h of 8 29 and 17 g kg were reached for thermal cycles 1 for optimum values of ṁb ṁa and ta h in of 1 2 l min 3 5 kg min and 70 respectively 2 and 3 for the aforementioned optimum conditions plus the optimum value of tb h in of 55 respectively the significant increase in δωa h for the different thermal cycles can be mainly attributed to the influence of the increase in ϕa h out for thermal cycles 1 74 5 2 89 1 and 3 99 9 along with the effect of ta h out however comparing the brine conversion performance the maximum freshwater productivity of 2100 ml h was achieved with thermal cycle 2 followed by thermal cycle 3 2010 ml h and 1 890 ml h as discussed earlier the better productivity of thermal cycles 2 and 3 was due to the considerable increase in δωa h achieved by the dual fluid preheating process furthermore the decrease in the productivity of thermal cycle 3 compared to that of 2 was due to the decrease in δωa h as a result of adopting the non preheated air cycle as discussed earlier fig 7a however the above process was identified to be thermally efficient with a maximum gor or huf of 1 77 compared to thermal cycles 1 0 14 and 2 1 57 as shown in fig 8 a this can be attributed to the comparatively lower thermal energy input qin eqs 1 and 4 or efficient low grade heat recovery potential i e energy required to raise the temperature of the air to 70 for low temperature moist air across the humidifier exit in thermal cycle 3 further as the water recovery rate or wrf is dependent on the freshwater productivity eq 10 it was identified to be 0 30 0 70 and 0 67 for the thermal cycles 1 2 and 3 respectively a comparison of the various humidifier and dehumidifier performance evaluation factors for the different thermal cycles is shown in fig 8 b given that the euf is dependent on the brine conversion rate its trend was similar to that of the freshwater productivity with a maximum euf of 9 1 kg kwh achieved for thermal cycle 2 followed by cycles 3 and 1 8 9 and 3 9 kg kwh respectively interestingly although thermal cycle 3 exhibited a significant decrease 2 in its electric efficiency euf its thermal efficiency huf was dominant 13 indicating efficient low grade heat energy utilization considering the variation in the performance of the hydrophilic fiber humidifier in contributing to the brine treatment process the trends of hcf and εh indicate that the maximum humidification potential of the hydrophilic fiber humidifier occurred during thermal cycle 3 with maximum hcf and εh of 8 41 and 0 99 followed by cycles 2 and 1 in addition to the inherent potential of the hydrophilic fiber humidifier this can be attributed to the effect of varying the thermal characteristics with respect to the thermal cycles of the air ta h in and ϕa h in and brine tb h in across the humidifier unit and its effect on the varying thermal energy input for preheating the operating fluids in a closed cycle setup thus it is inferred that the variation in the thermal characteristics of the air in the hdh process can significantly contribute to the exploitation of the humidifier s maximum humidification potential and overall energy consumption i e thermal cycle 3 however these process dependent thermal characteristics also influence the dehumidifier performance based on the properties of the air across its inlet as recognized from the varying εdh values a maximum value of εdh of 0 78 was measured for thermal cycle 2 followed by cycles 3 0 64 and 1 0 43 despite the higher value of εh for thermal cycle 3 its reduced εdh compared with that of thermal cycle 2 can be attributed to the lower value of δωa h in the former case furthermore a constant hcr value of 1 43 which is closer to the balanced condition of hcr 1 for the three thermal cycles indicates humidification reliability or stability of the fabric humidifier for efficient heat and mass transfer between the air and brine media irrespective of the varying thermal characteristics across the humidifier unit for different thermal cycles narayan et al 2010a the various relevant thermal parameters brine conversion rate and performance metrics are summarized and compared in table 1 also note that the adoption of a fiber based hydrophilic humidifier significantly improved the hdh process thermal efficiency with better humidification characteristics compared to a similar process thermal cycle 2 with a hydrophobic plastic humidifier santosh et al 2022b the humidity ratio increment across the humidifier unit was 56 with fabric humidifier thereby contributing to improved freshwater productivity and gor by 67 and 64 compared to pvc δωa h 16 3 g kg ṁf 1398 ml h and gor 0 97 in addition to the materialistic characteristics of the fabric humidifier the better δωa h can also be attributed to a higher optimum feed flow rate 1 2 l min in the present work compared to 0 9 l min in the earlier reported work with a pvc humidifier thus it can be inferred that variation in the humidifier s materialistic characteristic also contribute to a distinct system s optimum parameters and productivity this indicates that the phenomenon of hdh process optimization is system specific that is dependent on the materialistic and process parameters such as the type of humidifier material adopted air and feed characteristics across the hdh system nevertheless it is inferred that the adoption of a hydrophilic humidifier significantly improved the hdh performance compared to hydrophobic packing owing to its inherent water affinity property leading to improved wet surface area for efficient interaction between air and feed 6 1 7 energy consumption comparison with previous literature as the present work also focuses on evaluating the feasibility of hdh technology for sustainable energy efficient mld process a comparison of the present system s specific thermal energy consumption with that of similarly reported hdh systems treating seawater brine and wastewater is made in fig 9 based on the data extracted from shah et al 2022 with the thermal energy input qin eq 4 of 0 84 kw and 0 71 kw for the better thermal cycles 2 and 3 the specific thermal energy consumption was accounted to be approximately 840 kwh m3 and 710 kwh m3 respectively it is inferred that the present system was energy efficient compared to a majority of the experimentally evaluated hdh systems despite using high salinity feed owing to the utilization of low grade heat energy further comparing the specific thermal energy consumption between thermal cycles 2 and 3 despite its lower freshwater productivity thermal cycle 3 was energy efficient owing to the thermodynamic advantages discussed earlier under section 6 1 4 that contributed to lower qin however the higher specific thermal energy consumption compared to santosh et al 2020 and chang et al 2014 fig 9 could be attributed to the decrease in the partial vapor pressure of the high salinity feed brine in the present work that demands higher qin for achieving the desired temperature compared to low salinity feed seawater in the aforementioned studies spinnler 2019 in other words the high salinity feed demands higher qin that is required to improve the temperature induced vapor pressure to overcome the salinity induced vapor pressure reduction for effective evaporation in addition to this effect the underestimation of experimental thermal loss could have contributed to lower specific thermal energy consumption in the earlier reported theoretical studies nevertheless the present study experimentally indicated that the air post heating after humidification thermal cycle 3 contributes to reduced specific thermal energy consumption compared to the preheating mechanism thermal cycle 2 6 2 evaluation of chemical characteristics 6 2 1 effect of hdh thermal characteristics on the chemical quality of brine treatment it is of prime importance to evaluate the chemical quality of the freshwater produced to assess the efficiency of the hdh process in treating desalination brine and estimate its reusability given that the present study focused on improving both physical and chemical qualities of brine water a detailed chemical analysis was conducted at the korea research institute of ships ocean engineering the results of the various physical and chemical parameters of the freshwater produced from the different thermal cycles considered in this study are summarized in table 2 the quality of the base seawater and brine before and after the membrane distillation process feed brine used in the present study and the freshwater produced from hdh thermal cycles 1 2 and 3 were broadly compared with the latest and updated water reusable guidelines postulated by the environmental protection agency epa of the united states food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations world health organization who and other major standards such as the australian guideline for water recycling agwr for irrigation purposes jeong et al 2016 shoushtarian and negahban azar 2020 the conclusion is that both physical and chemical properties of the brine i e feed increased significantly after the membrane distillation process indicating its inherent potential against adverse effects that could be caused to the environment if not properly treated i e using hdh technology in the present study note that the constituents were similar to those of brine generated from currently operating centralized ro desalination plants omerspahic et al 2022 panagopoulos 2022 thus the results of the present study could also be applied to improve the efficiency of the treatment of the brine generated from the dominant ro desalination technology which accounts for approximately 69 of the total desalination capacity worldwide ihsanullah et al 2021 physical examination revealed a clear color change in the freshwater produced from the three thermal cycles along with the removal of a musty odor from the feed brine further chemical analysis indicated that the freshwater generated from thermal cycle 2 possessed comparatively minimum contaminants in particular the major factors of ph tds and ec indicating efficient removal of salts and dissolved solids from the feed brine compared to thermal cycles 1 and 3 concerning the chemical characteristics of thermal cycles 2 and 3 note that although thermal cycle 2 exhibited a higher evaporation rate with improved moist air to dry air ratio i e δωa h of 29 g kg table 1 than thermal cycle 3 17 g kg its chemical quality was better this phenomenon could be attributed to two reasons firstly in the case of thermal cycle 2 during humidification the hypersaline feed brine interacted with the preheated air at a temperature of 70 across the surface of the fabric humidifier during this the brine would have undergone better separation of the ions at the air feed interface thereby contributing to better quality evaporation or moisture in the humidified air with left behind or deposition of the contaminants ions on the surface of the fabric humidifier this mechanism is termed evaporative deposition as depicted in fig 1 kim et al 2021 while the mechanism of evaporative deposition was previously reported in colloidal droplets liu et al 2022 2019 yu et al 2017 the present study revealed its novel influence on the chemical quality of the freshwater produced applicable to thermal based brine treatment technologies conversely in thermal cycle 3 the feed brine at the same 55 interacted with the non preheated lower temperature 42 re circulated air that limits the ionic separation efficiency across the air feed interface on the fabric humidifier therefore subsequently thermal cycle 3 would have contributed to poor chemical moisture quality with evaporated contaminants or ions compared to cycle 2 in fact the ionic separation mechanism across the air salt solution interface has been earlier investigated by jungwirth and douglas 2002 and it was identified to be temperature dependent generally humidified air constitutes a combination of both moist and non condensable dry air narayan et al 2013b when the chemically poor quality humidified air in cycle 3 reached the dehumidifier unit it condensates into freshwater thereby influencing its chemical nature thus the effect of air temperature at the air feed interface influenced the ionic separation efficiency thereby affecting the chemical quality of the humidified air and subsequently the freshwater generated from it during dehumidification secondly as mentioned earlier humidified air constitutes a combination of both moist and non condensable dry air when the poor quality humidified air is heated during the post heating process it undergoes a decrease in its moisture level as evident from the decrease in the relative humidity of the air from a value of ϕa h out of 99 9 to that of ϕa dh in of 72 6 in the case of optimum thermal cycle 3 after the post heating process in this case the poor chemical quality is further aggravated due to a reduction in the moisture level or humidity ratio available for dehumidification therefore during dehumidification of the humidified air with a lower humidity ratio the evaporated contaminants or ions increase their influence or decrease the per liter chemical quality of freshwater produced while it is not apparent what vapor contaminants contributed to higher tds and ec because of the satisfactory reduction in the major ions table 2 that requires further investigation the reduction in the moisture level was evident from the decrease in the relative humidity of the air after post heating as discussed earlier in this regard it is worth mentioning that the humidifier section was equipped with wire mesh mist eliminators to prevent the miscarriage of the brine droplets therefore the freshwater quality could have not been affected by the brine droplet miscarriage further comparing the δωa h for thermal cycles 2 29 g kg and 3 17 g kg table 1 it is evident that the moist air to dry air ratio in cycle 3 is 41 lower than cycle 2 contributing to the maximum influence of vapor contaminants in thermal cycle 3 evident from its corresponding chemical quality of freshwater generated furthermore even for a unit hour operation of the hdh thermal cycle 3 which was the case of the present study a considerable reduction in the chemical quality of the freshwater generated was identified if this hdh cycle is adopted for round the clock operation as in the case of conventional brine treatment systems the chemical quality of the freshwater generated would be significantly affected with respect to that resulting from cycle 2 as inferred from the above results it is also to be mentioned that further investigation is required for evaluating the long term usability of the adopted fabric humidifier due to the effect of evaporative deposition however the least efficient hdh cycle for removing salts and toxic ions from brine was concluded to be thermal cycle 1 table 2 this is because the increase in the brine temperature in the case of thermal cycles 2 and 3 through brine preheating contributed to an increase in its ionic mobility fondriest environmental inc 2014 roy et al 2017 leading to faster and more efficient separation of the salts and minerals across the air water surface thereby preventing an elevated miscarriage of contaminants in the moist humidified air this can also be attributed to the minor effect of the variation in the physical parameters of brine that is increase and decrease in volume and density respectively owing to the increase in its temperature tb h in during preheating the brine in thermal cycle 1 exhibited a comparatively lower temperature leading to a lower volume and higher density per unit area fluid earth 2022 therefore its interaction with preheated air during humidification contributed to a higher salt carriage per unit volume from the air water surface leading to higher contaminants in thermal cycle 1 during dehumidification thus the aforementioned effects collectively resulted in a reduced chemical quality of freshwater generation during dehumidification the effect of ionic mobility between thermal cycles 2 and 3 was also elucidated the higher ionic mobility in cycle 2 owing to a higher mean temperature across the humidifier section due to preheated air and preheated brine interaction could have resulted in better quality of freshwater compared to cycle 3 which involves the interaction of preheated brine with the non preheated air medium therefore it can be concluded that the hdh and operating fluid thermal characteristics have a strong influence on the quality of the brine treatment or freshwater produced furthermore considering the materialistic characteristics of the hydrophilic fiber humidifier adopted no significant scaling fouling issues were identified during the entire experimentation of 600 h this signifies the fabric humidifier s stability and re usability for the brine treatment process however as earlier mentioned the fabric humidifier was air dried and then cleaned between each experiment for the removal of the salt deposit on its surface owing to evaporative deposition and for its effective operation during the subsequent cycles 6 2 2 improving the quality of freshwater generated while approaching zld the two major by products generated from desalination brine treatment using the proposed hdh process are freshwater and concentrated brine fig 2 first regarding freshwater although the experimented single stage hdh process optimum thermal cycle 2 efficiently reduced the ph reduction rate of 63 as well as toxic ions such as sodium chloride and boron reduction rates of 99 9 99 9 and 99 7 and other chemical contaminants satisfying the major global water reuse standards table 2 it was not efficient enough to reduce the tds and ec limits however note that the proposed single stage hdh process thermal cycle 2 was sufficient to reduce the tds and ec values by 89 6 and 89 8 respectively indicating its potential for efficient contaminant removal therefore the adoption of the dual stage hdh process with re utilization of the generated freshwater as feed can significantly aid in satisfying the tds and ec limits of global water reuse standards furthermore the hourly freshwater generated for thermal cycles 1 2 and 3 was 30 70 and 67 respectively owing to the variation in thermal characteristics as discussed earlier second the major objective of the present study was to identify energy and cost efficient alternative solutions for treating desalination brine thus the second byproduct i e concentrated brine can be utilized to generate additional freshwater along with the production of salt crystals using a spray type hdh process minier matar et al 2016 or cyclonic separators elhashimi et al 2022 aiming at a circular economy and zld given that hdh is emerging as an attractive brine treatment technology shah et al 2022 and significant efforts are being carried out for the effective treatment of brine through thermal based processes the present study which is a primary part of the research on exploring the nexus between the thermal characteristics and chemical quality of brine treatment is anticipated to be highly beneficial in aiding the adoption of hdh processes with and without the combination of other cost effective techniques liu et al 2020 for treating desalination brine 7 conclusions an experimental investigation of a hydrophilic fiber based hdh system for treating real membrane distillation generated brine using low grade heat 45 70 was conducted to explore its feasibility for mld different thermal cycles were adopted based on the preheating mechanism cycle 1 air preheating 2 air and brine dual fluid preheating and 3 air post heating after humidification and their effects on the system thermal characteristics and chemical quality of freshwater produced were explored the significant findings of this study are summarized as follows concerning thermal efficiency gor the order of performance was identified as thermal cycle 3 1 77 2 1 57 1 0 14 however concerning freshwater productivity performance the order was thermal cycle 2 70 3 67 1 30 owing to the negative effect on the reduction in the humidity ratio during humidification δωa h with the non preheated air usage in cycle 3 increasing the temperature of the brine contributed to an improvement in its ionic mobility at higher temperatures 55 which aided in faster and efficient separation of the salts and minerals across the air water surface preventing the elevated miscarriage of contaminated brine droplets in humidified moist air thus better freshwater quality was achieved in thermal cycles 2 and 3 interaction of the preheated air at a higher temperature 70 with the brine aided in efficient ionic separation across the air feed interface in cycle 3 contributing to better humidified air quality concurrently with improved condensate chemical quality during dehumidification therefore the order of chemical quality of the freshwater produced was as follows thermal cycle 2 3 1 highlighting the effect of thermal characteristics on the freshwater chemical quality although the proposed single stage hdh process efficiently aided in reducing the ph by 63 as well as toxic ions such as sodium chloride and boron by 99 9 99 9 and 99 7 and other chemical contaminants satisfying the major global water reuse standards it was not efficient enough to reduce the tds and ec limits however the adoption of a dual stage hdh process can reduce the above constituents as the reduction rates of the tds and ec limits of the present system were 89 6 and 89 8 respectively given that hdh is an emerging brine treatment technology the present study provides useful information on the characteristic nexus between the thermal properties of the operating fluids and the chemical quality of freshwater produced from desalination brine future work from the present study will focus on reducing the freshwater tds and ec limits along with the evaluation of the

14985,considering the increasing demand for desalination plants and their byproduct brine this study investigated a humidification dehumidification hdh system for treating membrane distillation generated real high salinity brine using low grade heat 45 70 to explore its feasibility for sustainable energy efficient minimal liquid discharge a novel super hydrophilic fabric was adopted for accelerated humidification and its impact on brine droplet miscarriage characteristics was evaluated the influence of the operating fluid thermal properties cycle 1 air preheating cycle 2 air and brine dual fluid preheating and cycle 3 air post heating after humidification on the brine treatment efficiency energy consumption and chemical quality of freshwater produced was analyzed in detail to establish their characteristic nexus it was identified that during humidification increasing the brine temperature up to 55 influenced its ionic mobility thereby promoting efficient separation of the salts minerals and contributing to achieving better freshwater quality furthermore although cycle 3 exhibited improved system thermal efficiency gained output ratio equal to 1 77 its non preheated air contributed to a negative effect of the reduced humidity ratio 17 g kg leading to a lower freshwater productivity of 67 than that of cycle 2 29 g kg and 70 the present study also illustrates a novel effect of evaporative deposition occurring due to air water interaction on the fabric humidifier surface with an exploration of its effect on reducing freshwater chemical quality the freshwater generated from optimum thermal cycle 2 exhibited reduced ph by 63 sodium 99 9 chloride 99 9 toxic boron 99 7 and other chemical contaminants thereby satisfying the major international water reuse

scarcity has caused more deaths than floods during the past decade 2009 2019 miletto 2021 this stresses the urgency of finding sustainable and alternative solutions for global freshwater generation and management desalination has emerged as a proven technology to overcome the worldwide freshwater deficit with over 300 million people dependent on it to satisfy their basic needs ida water security handbook 2019 globally more than 19 000 active desalination plants produce 100 million m3 day of freshwater chen et al 2021b with an estimated expansion capacity exceeding 200 million m3 day by 2030 mavukkandy et al 2019 most established desalination technologies such as multi stage flashing msf reverse osmosis ro adsorption desalination ng et al 2013 and multi effect distillation med have a freshwater generation or process efficiency of 50 with the remaining concentrated half rejected in the form of brine shahzad et al 2017 owing to the rapid increase in the number of desalination plants the recent global brine production rate has increased to a significant figure of approximately 141 5 million m3 day 51 8 billion m3 year which is 50 higher than the desalinated freshwater production jones et al 2019 root 2019 in addition conventional brine disposal methods have adverse effects on the environment affecting both land and aquatic livelihood panagopoulos and haralambous 2020a petersen et al 2018 therefore with increasing concerns regarding desirable brine disposal methods and stringent norms zero liquid discharge zld and minimal liquid discharge mld processes have recently gained significance as effective means for concentrated brine treatment panagopoulos and haralambous 2020b thermal based zld systems comprise two components a brine concentrator and a brine crystallizer the concentrator concentrates the feed brine increasing its salinity while the crystallizer separates the salts from the concentrated brine through a crystallization process although zld can achieve 100 freshwater recovery it is characterized by a high cost complex design lu et al 2017 and the use of crystallizers which consume a significant amount of energy to recover a small portion of the salts from the concentrated brine chen et al 2021b therefore from an energy consumption and economic viewpoint mld is comparatively more sustainable than zld with a water recovery efficiency of 95 cipolletta et al 2021 the prime characteristics of a sustainable and enduring brine treatment technology are its response adaptability to the treated brine quality and non brine related system conditions operating temperature energy consumption and cost el cham et al 2020 with no complex requirements for pre or post treatment thermal based mld technology outperforms membranes in satisfying the above characteristics with direct utilization of brine ghalavand et al 2021 onishi et al 2021 even established membrane based technologies such as ro and electrodialysis ed suffer from scaling fouling issues due to the high salinity of brine and flux decrement caused by concentration polarization collectively limiting their usability to low salinity brine treatment panagopoulos and haralambous 2020b note that thermal based technologies such as msf med spray dryer sd vapor compression evaporation vce wind aided intensified evaporation waiv ohmic evaporator oe evaporation pond and solar still account for almost 70 of the total installed desalination capacity especially in middle eastern countries which generate 50 of the global desalinated water ashraf et al 2022 among the above technologies msf and med are the ones predominantly adopted for thermal based desalination panagopoulos et al 2019 their recent integration with advanced devices and hybrid mechanisms has enabled their use for realizing efficient brine treatment processes for example msf coupled with a crystallizer and a membrane distillation md module has contributed to accomplish an enhanced water recovery rate of 89 which is notably better than either technology employed separately von eiff et al 2021 however the maximum thermal efficiency was achieved with 40 stages which require a high initial capital investment along with a large space similarly the integration of med with a crystallizer resulted in efficient brine treatment with reduced specific thermal energy consumption 680 to 288 kj kg attained by increasing the number of stages from 3 to 10 chen et al 2021b the above technologies involve multi stage operation with a crystallizer which increases the cost and energy input in addition the structures are built of austenitic stainless steel which suffers from corrosion issues due to the use of high total dissolved solids tds brine containing a high concentration of chlorine which results in material constraints deyab 2019 the alternative highly corrosion resistant alloys further raise the system cost panagopoulos et al 2019 sds developed to replace conventional crystallizers also feature high energy consumption for brine treatment 52 64 kwh m3 with respect to other thermal technologies along with the need for specialized pre treatment to eliminate salt impurities panagopoulos and haralambous 2020a concerning the vce process a high quality distillate is produced with low electric energy consumption in the range of 10 45 kwh m3 however its high investment capital and maintenance cost resulting from the corrosion of the compressor must be taken into account arafat 2017 waiv technology was developed as an alternative to a less efficient evaporation pond it aimed at increasing the brine evaporation rate using wetted surfaces which could contribute to an enhanced rate of water recovery and salts although the waiv technology s evaporation rate was 50 90 higher than that of evaporation pond with reduced land space and cost waiv technology causes groundwater pollution due to brine leaching cipolletta et al 2021 in contrast oe technology is efficient enough for the treatment of high salinity brines containing tds exceeding 80 000 ppm with a significant water recovery rate of 81 93 5 however this technology requires a complex integration of the temperature and electric field distribution setup for the evaporation of brine this contributes to hinder the process control with limited adoption leading to a lack of in depth data for large scale implementation sakr and liu 2014 thus globally it can be concluded that the above thermal based technologies can be categorized as 1 those that demand high energy and 2 those that require expensive specialized construction materials to overcome the issues of corrosion scaling or involve the adoption of complex monitoring components for customized process control unlike the aforementioned thermal based technologies the humidification dehumidification hdh technique has been widely adopted over the past decade owing to its established advantages such as moderate operating temperature 80 and pressure 1 bar simple system construction with low cost local materials and easy operation with an evaporation condensation mechanism that does not require complex supplies for monitoring and maintenance santosh et al 2019a furthermore the advantage of integrating hdh systems with low grade heat sources has attracted interest in the development of cost and energy efficient hybrid systems for decentralized fresh and potable water production santosh et al 2020 2019b researchers have focused on the effective utilization of low grade waste heat rejected from heating ventilation and air conditioning units santosh et al 2022a and solar pv panels anand et al 2021 for simultaneous freshwater production through a hybrid hdh process it is identified that effective heat recovery contributes to the overall performance improvement of these preinstalled systems owing to the aforementioned significant merits and its better suitability for treating high salinity water dehghani et al 2019 hdh technology is also recently adopted for brine treatment analysis of a hybrid hdh med vce zld system indicated that coupling hdh with the med vce technique contributed to a 10 cost reduction in brine water treatment along with a 12 decline in the produced freshwater environmental impact ghofrani and moosavi 2020a similarly coupling a heat pump with the brine recirculation mechanism in hdh systems has been identified to efficiently contribute to brine water treatment and freshwater recovery ghofrani and moosavi 2020b analysis of the integration of hdh systems with brine crystallizers indicated that the hdh technique aided in reducing the initial cost heat and electrical energy consumption by 58 59 and 56 respectively chen et al 2021a however note that the above hdh based research studies involved the production of freshwater at the cost of steam refrigerant or brine crystallizers which contribute to a major share of the energy and economics and demand auxiliary dedicated monitoring devices these factors hinder the adoption of hybrid techniques thus limiting their large scale practicality panagopoulos and haralambous 2020b therefore considering the present perspective and advantages of mld over zld the principal objective of the present study was to evaluate the technical feasibility of the hdh technique for conversion of brine water into freshwater recently it was identified that the hdh technique is efficient in producing freshwater with reduced salt and ionic concentrations even with the direct utilization of seawater at ambient temperature 25 and latent heat recovery santosh et al 2022b however the maximum humidity ratio increment achieved with the utilization of hydrophobic humidifier material was limited to 16 2 g kg under optimum conditions in order to achieve better humidification the present work involved the utilization of super hydrophilic fiber coolmax fabric as a humidifier while all the previously reported hdh systems focus only on treating seawater or domestic wastewater santosh et al 2022a xu et al 2022 the significant merit and novelty of the research hereby reported is the utilization of real brine generated from membrane distillation system thereby evaluating the feasibility of adopting energy and cost effective hdh process for mld applications furthermore narayan et al 2010b theoretically identified the improvement in the heat recovery potential of moist air over dry air motivated by the same the present work is a novel attempt to experimentally comprehend the hdh performance based on different thermal processes and its effect on the brine treatment efficiency energy consumption and produced water quality was analyzed in detail to establish their characteristic nexus in summary the specific objectives of the present work include i to evaluate the hdh thermal performance improvement with the adoption of a fiber based humidifier ii to investigate the feasibility of hdh technology for treating real membrane distillation generated brine and iii experimentally establish a nexus between the different thermal process i e utilization of moist and dry air and its low grade heat recovery potential thus the reported results highlight the benefits of designing and adopting low grade heat powered hdh systems as mld technology for local treatment of high salinity brines produced from desalination plants 2 system and material description the schematics of three different thermal cycles i e air preheating cycle 1 air and water dual fluid preheating cycle 2 and air post heating after humidification cycle 3 adopted for the treatment of brine using an hdh process powered by low grade heat energy are depicted in fig a1 appendix a in supplementary material its simplified version is depicted in fig 1 further a photograph of the experimental setup is shown in fig 2 the major system components include a humidifier unit finned tube heat exchange dehumidifier unit low grade heat air cum water preheater heat exchanger based heating unit frequency regulated air blower 164 w and brine micro pump 5500 rpm max for fluid circulation the dimensions of both the humidifier and dehumidifier units were kept identical l w h 13 cm 13 cm 33 cm to achieve maximum hdh effect during brine and air interaction across their active surface areas the humidifier unit was loaded with non woven polyester based hydrophilic coolmax fabric henceforth hydrophilic fiber purchased online from a local dealer fabric factory owing to its characteristics which include high water absorption capacity diffusivity and moisture evaporation rate xu et al 2017 compared to other fabric materials duan et al 2022 apart from these superior characteristics practical advantages such as commercial availability high durability easy cleaning replacement simple construction and slender thickness 0 5 mm in the present study which reduce the thermal resistance with an improved heat transfer rate xu et al 2021 make this hydrophilic fabric particularly suitable for localized cost effective brine treatment applications unlike conventional humidifiers that operate through direct interaction of air and water media which could contribute to brine droplet carry away with subsequent mixing in the produced freshwater li and zhang 2016 fabric humidifiers aid in preventing such miscarriage thus safeguarding the dehumidifier metal components from scaling corrosion issues along with the simultaneous production of high quality freshwater santosh et al 2022a therefore around sixty four customized hollow hydrophilic fiber structures l d 33 cm 1 cm were fabricated for convenient accommodation in the humidifier unit with a total active surface area of 0 13 m2 as shown in fig a 2 appendix a supplementary material the hydrophilic fibers were longitudinally placed at an equal distance 0 5 cm inside the humidifier unit with the support of a guiding helical spring and mesh structure fig 2 in addition to stable positioning and construction of the hydrophilic fibers the stainless steel helical spring also aid in realizing smooth transport of air inside their hollow gaps contributing to the effective interaction of air and brine during the humidification process the dehumidifier unit was equipped with copper tubes containing mounted aluminum fins for an effective dehumidification process the freshwater generation rate at the bottom of the dehumidifier unit was constantly monitored using an electronic weighing machine cuw6200hx with an accuracy of 1 make cas and the complete experimental setup was properly insulated with rubber foam to prevent convective and radiative heat losses 3 experimentation as mentioned earlier the present study aimed to utilize low grade heat energy for brine treatment through an hdh process owing to the material employed for fabricating hdh systems polycarbonate plastic and instrumental constraints the preheating low grade waste heat temperature ranges of the air and brine were maintained at 50 70 and 45 55 respectively furthermore closed air circulation was adopted owing to its enhanced thermal efficiency compared to open air circulation yuan and zhang 2007 the initial experiments were directed toward the optimization of the brine flow rate ṁb with an initial air preheated temperature ta of 70 across the humidifier inlet followed by airflow rate ṁa optimization thus for optimum values of ṁb and ṁa the effect of the air preheating temperature 50 70 was evaluated thermal cycle 1 fig 1 a finally for the above optimum values the effect of the additional brine preheating temperature tb in the range of 45 55 i e air and brine dual fluid preheating thermal cycle 2 fig 1 b on the thermal performance of the hdh system was examined to comparatively evaluate the efficient heat recovery potential of the air under dry and moist conditions the air post heating process involved heating the air after humidification across the humidifier exit thermal cycle 3 fig 1 c regarding thermodynamics it was identified that the heat recovery potential of moist air in an hdh process is better than that of dry air narayan et al 2010b however to the best of the authors knowledge its practical characteristics are yet to be explored and the present study was extended to estimate its effect on brine treatment for all the aforementioned thermal cycles the effect of the thermal characteristics on the chemical quality of the treated brine was analyzed in detail to identify the optimum thermal cycle in terms of both energy utilization and treatment quality concerning thermal cycle 1 the experimental process initially involved preheating the air to the desired temperature using a low grade heat preheater thus making it hot and dry subsequently it was passed through a humidifier unit packed with a hydrophilic fiber humidifier upon interaction with the feed brine the air was humidified resulting in a decrease and increase in temperature and relative humidity ϕ respectively this saturated air upon interaction with the coolant across the dehumidifier resulted in freshwater generation on the surface of the tubes owing to condensation or latent heat extraction thus dehumidifying it interestingly direct utilization of brine generated from a membrane distillation system was considered in this study as a coolant at ambient temperature 25 with no auxiliary cooling mechanism santosh et al 2022b to make the entire process energy and cost efficient the dehumidified air from the dehumidifier exit was recirculated in successive cycles by using an air duct as shown in fig 2 furthermore the concentrated brine and generated freshwater were collected at the base of the humidifier and dehumidifier units thus making the entire process a closed air open water cycle regarding thermal cycle 2 the process involved additional preheating of the brine across the humidifier entry to evaluate its potential effect on the system s thermal characteristics unlike cycle 2 thermal cycle 3 focused on the preheating of humidified air across the humidifier exit to evaluate the heat recovery potential of moist air and its effect on brine treatment quality all experiments were performed under steady state conditions for a continuous 8 h duration and with interconnected brine flow from the dehumidifier to the humidifier to achieve the dual benefit of latent heat extraction with simultaneous brine preheating the fabric humidifier was initially air dried and then cleaned between each experiment for the removal of the salt deposit on its surface and effective operation for the subsequent cycle 4 instrumentation and chemical analysis the temperature at various locations of the hdh system as shown in fig a 1 b was measured throughout the experiments including the temperature of the hot dry air across the blower s entry s9 exit s1 and humidifier s entry s2 as well as the humidified air temperature across the humidifier s3 to s6 and dehumidifier s entry s7 exit s8 using temperature probe sensors accuracy 0 1 the brine temperature was measured using a similar type of sensor s10 s13 hx92b omega transmitters accuracy 2 5 were utilized to measure the relative humidity of the operating air medium across the humidifier r1 r2 and dehumidifier r3 r4 units the velocity and flow rate of air and brine were monitored using a kimo ctv110 air velocity transmitter v accuracy 3 and rotameter respectively furthermore the quantity of freshwater produced across the dehumidifier unit was measured continuously using an electronic weighing machine cuw6200hx accuracy 1 all the aforementioned sensors and devices were calibrated prior to usage and were connected to a customized data acquisition system that provided constant monitoring and storage of the data at regular intervals of 2 s to evaluate the brine treatment capability of the developed system for different thermal cycles a water quality analysis was performed for the feed brine and generated freshwater a detailed physical analysis was carried out to evaluate inherent properties such as salinity ph total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec furthermore chemical analysis was focused on the rate of decrement in the major legitimate ions including na mg2 ca2 k and sr using atomic absorption spectrometric aas analysis along with the evaluation of other anions and cations using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms and ion chromatography techniques to explore the influence of different hdh processes thermal cycles on brine treatment quality a detailed chemical analysis of freshwater generated from the three cycles was also carried out for investigating the anions cations and other legitimate ions using the aforementioned techniques immediately after production to avoid faulty results due to water contamination 5 thermal performance assessment to evaluate the energy effectiveness of the developed system in terms of low grade heat utilization various thermal performance evaluation factors were considered as discussed in this section 5 1 low grade heat energy utilization factor the low grade heat energy utilization ability or thermal efficiency of the hdh system for converting brine into freshwater can be expressed in terms of the heat utilization factor huf or gained output ratio gor as follows yuan and zhang 2007 1 h u f or g o r m f γ q i n where ṁf γ and qin are the freshwater generation rate condensation latent heat and low grade heat thermal energy input to the system 5 2 electrical energy utilization factor the electrical energy utilization factor euf or electrical efficiency is the ratio of hourly system efficiency in converting brine into freshwater termed as productivity i e ṁf and its corresponding electrical energy consumption e this is an important factor that represents the instantaneous electrical energy utilized by the hdh system for brine treatment it is evaluated as follows santosh et al 2020 2 e u f m f e 5 3 humidification capacity factor the thermal characteristics of the air medium across the humidifier unit vary according to the different preheating or thermal cycles adopted this subsequently contributes to a distinction in the humidification capacity which can be expressed in terms of the humidification capacity factor hcf determined as follows ahmed et al 2017 3 h c f i m a ω a h o u t ω a h i n γ q i n where i represents thermal cycle 1 2 or 3 ṁa is the mass flow rate of air ωa h out and ωa h in are the corresponding relative humidity ratios across the exit and entry of the fabric humidifier unit it is noteworthy that the hcf is the direct indication of the humidification rate i e a value of hcf 0 indicates nil humidification and it is dependent on the increase in the relative humidity ratio across the humidifier exit based on the different thermal cycles adopted the thermal energy input to the fabric humidifier unit qin can be expressed as follows 4 q i n m a h a h e a t o u t h a h e a t i n m b c p b t b h e a t o u t t b h e a t i n where ṁb and cpb are the mass flow rate and specific heat of the feed brine and ha heat out and ha heat in represent the air enthalpy after and before the preheating process similarly tb heat out and tb heat in represent the brine temperature after and before the preheating procedure for cycle 1 m b c p b t b h e a t o u t t b h e a t i n is nil as it involves only air preheating also t b h e a t o u t t b h i n for cycles 2 and 3 where t b h i n represents the brine temperature across the humidifier inlet 5 4 humidifier effectiveness factor the humidification rate or effectiveness of the fabric humidifier varies with the thermal characteristics of the processed air achieved through different thermal cycles this can be accounted for in terms of the humidifier effectiveness factor εhi as follows qasem et al 2019 5 ε h i ω a h o u t ω a h i n ω a h o u t s ω a h i n where ω a h o u t s is the humidity ratio when the humidified air across the humidifier exit is saturated i e 100 this indicates that the maximum achievable εhi is 1 which corresponds to 100 humidification efficiency 5 5 dehumidifier effectiveness factor similar to the humidifier the dehumidifier effectiveness εdhi accounted for different thermal cycles as follows ahmed et al 2017 6 ε d h i ω a d h i n ω a d h o u t ω a d h i n ω a s t b d h i n where ωa dh in and ωa dh out are the corresponding humidity ratios across the entry and exit points of the dehumidifier unit respectively furthermore ω a s t b d h i n is the humidity ratio of the saturated air at a temperature equal to tb dh in 5 6 heat capacity ratio factor the humidification process involves both heat and mass transfers which contribute to the humidity ratio characteristics of the air the humidity ratio further influences the humidified air enthalpy rate which can be accounted based on the heat capacity ratio factor hcr as follows miller and lienhard 2013 narayan et al 2013a 7 h c r δ h b r i n e max δ h a i r max where δ h b r i n e max and δ h a i r max are the maximum enthalpy rate difference across the cold brine and hot air sides respectively expressed as follows 8 δ h b r i n e max m b c p b t a h i n t b h i n 9 δ h a i r max m a c p a t a h i n t b h i n where cpa and ta h in are the specific heat of the air and its temperature at the humidifier inlet respectively in the present context hcr can be utilized to evaluate the reliability or stability of the fabric humidifier for varying thermal characteristics across the hdh system with variations in the thermal cycles it is noteworthy that a heat and mass exchange process is balanced at hcr 1 the point at which the entropy production is also minimum narayan et al 2010a 5 7 water recovery factor as the present work focuses on mld technology water recovery rate or water recovery factor wrf is also accounted for the different thermal cycles adopted defined as the ratio of produced freshwater mass flow to the feed brine mass flow indicated as 10 w r f m f m b the details of the standard instrumental error table a1 and experimental uncertainty table a2 are presented in appendix a 6 results and discussion a series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the brine treatment feasibility of the developed system and identify the optimum conditions for maximum freshwater productivity the initial experimentation was focused on the adoption of only air preheating cycle 1 and optimization of ṁb ranging from 0 3 to 2 1 l min with initial t a h i n and ṁa of 70 and 3 5 kg min respectively the brine inlet across the dehumidifier was maintained at ambient temperature 25 for all the thermal cycles for the optimum value of ṁb the analysis was extended to identify the optimum values of ṁa and t a h i n in the respective ranges of 1 5 3 5 kg min and 50 70 thus for the aforementioned optimum parameters the effect of t b h e a t i n in the range of 45 55 on the thermal performance and brine treatment quality was evaluated i e cycle 2 furthermore considering the efficient theoretical heat recovery potential of moist air over dry air narayan et al 2010b experiments were conducted with post heating of the air after humidification cycle 3 and its effects on the system thermal characteristics and chemical quality of freshwater produced were evaluated therefore this section highlights the main results achieved with the above experiments and the influence of various governing parameters on the thermal performance and chemical quality of the generated freshwater 6 1 evaluation of thermal characteristics through system optimization 6 1 1 effect of brine mass flow rate ṁb on hdh thermal characteristics the characteristic thermal variation in the humidifier section as a function of ṁb is shown in fig 3 a a minimum air temperature drop δta h and relative humidity rise δϕa h of 18 and 42 were measured for a low value of ṁb of 0 3 l min and initial ṁa of 3 5 kg min as mentioned earlier with an increase in the flow rate up to 1 2 l min the percentage increase in δta h and δϕa h was 52 and 34 equivalent to the actual temperature drop and relative humidity rise of 28 and 59 respectively these maximum values contributed to a maximum humidity ratio rise δωa h of 8 g kg for ṁb equal to 1 2 l min although a further increase in ṁb contributed to an increase in δta h owing to efficient heat transfer from air to brine across the wet surface area of the hydrophilic fiber humidifier it also resulted in a decreasing trend in δϕa h fig 3 a this can be attributed to the inefficient mass transfer across the humidifier unit at higher ṁb the optimum flow rate of air and fluid that leads to the maximum heat and mass transfer across the humidifier unit of any hdh system is highly dependent on its configuration and the type of humidifier material adopted xu et al 2019 thus a reduced mass transfer resulted in a decreasing trend of δωa h at higher ṁb 1 5 up to 2 1 l min the freshwater productivity and dehumidifier thermal characteristics for varying ṁb are shown in fig 3 b with an increase in ṁb to 1 2 l min increasing and decreasing trends of the air temperature drop denoted as an absolute value δta dh and brine temperature rise δtb dh were identified respectively a maximum δta dh of 15 was measured for ṁb equal to 1 2 l min with a corresponding value of δtb dh of 10 although a decreasing trend in δtb dh was identified with an increase in ṁb from 0 3 to 1 2 l min the equivalent increase in the freshwater productivity could be attributed to the corresponding increase first in δϕa h and then in δωa h during the humidification process fig 3 a in addition the increasing humidity consequently contributed to a lower air temperature across the dehumidifier inlet which aided in maintaining a lower surface temperature on the dehumidifier tubes thus collectively assisting in attaining a better condensation of the humidified air therefore a maximum brine conversion rate of 890 ml h was achieved for ṁb equal to 1 2 l min in line with the humidification characteristics however note that although δta h was comparatively higher at higher ṁb 1 5 up to 2 1 l min fig 3 a the corresponding lower δωa h influenced the dehumidification potential resulting in reduced brine conversion rate i e freshwater productivity as inferred from fig 3 b in other words the humidification rate that influences the freshwater productivity is significantly dependent on the mass ratio across the humidifier unit defined as the ratio of ṁb to ṁa and this characteristic is both system and process specific including the attributes of the humidifier material utilized hussain soomro et al 2022 thus maximum productivity was identified at an optimum value of ṁb of 1 2 l min 6 1 2 analysis of brine treatment efficiency with variation in air mass flow rate ṁa the influence of ṁa on the thermal performance and brine conversion efficiency for an optimum value of ṁb of 1 2 l min is shown in fig 4 fig 4 a depicts the variation in the prime parameters across the hydrophilic fiber humidifier it can be inferred that the increasing ṁa contributed to effective heat transfer resulting in an increasing trend of humidified air temperature at the humidifier exit ta h out subsequently a decreasing trend in the relative humidity of humidified air ϕa h out was observed however a maximum δωa h of 8 g kg was reached for ṁa equal to 3 5 kg min contributing to a maximum brine conversion rate of 890 ml h as shown in fig 4 b owing to the combined effect of ta h out and ϕa h out an increasing trend in δωa h was identified for an increase in ṁa note the dominant influence of ṁa on the hdh thermal characteristics from the drastic increase in the temperature drop δta dh and rise δtb dh in the air and brine fluids across the dehumidifier unit fig 4 b owing to the effective heat transfer across the dehumidifier with an increase in ṁa a maximum increase in δtb dh of 5 0 and 10 was reached for minimum and maximum ṁa values of 2 and 3 5 kg min respectively thus for ṁa equal to 3 5 kg min the higher temperature brine from the dehumidifier reached the hydrophilic fiber humidifier unit and subsequently interacted with the air medium contributing to efficient humidification with higher δωa h which substantiates the results shown in fig 4 a therefore the dehumidification or condensation of the saturated air containing brine was identified to be mainly influenced by ṁa it is to be mentioned that the maximum ṁa was limited to 3 5 kg min owing to the system s equipment limitations also note that although values of ṁa below 2 kg min contributed to realizing efficient humidification the dehumidification was not satisfactory owing to the inefficient interaction of the humidified air on the dehumidifier s tube surface which could be attributed to the reduction in air velocity caused by the densely packed hydrophilic fiber in the humidifier unit 6 1 3 effect of air inlet temperature across the hydrophilic fiber humidifier ta h in thermal cycle 1 on brine treatment efficiency the air temperature at the inlet of the hydrophilic fiber humidifier ta h in mainly influences the evaporation rate of brine which subsequently controls the rate of freshwater productivity across the dehumidifier therefore the influence of ta h in on brine treatment thermal efficiency was evaluated considering a temperature range of 50 70 for optimum values of ṁb and ṁa of 1 2 l min and 3 5 kg min within the system s equipment limitations respectively i e those of air preheating thermal cycle 1 a steady increase in δta h and δϕa h was identified with an increase in ta h in as shown in fig 5 a indicating the prime influence of air temperature on the brine evaporation rate a maximum relative humidity rise of 59 accompanied by an air temperature drop of 28 c were measured for a high value of ta h in of 70 collectively contributing to a high value of δωa h of 8 g kg which indicates a better brine evaporation rate compared to lower values of ta h in this can be attributed to the better heat and mass transfer achieved between the air and brine across the surface of the hydrophilic fiber humidifier leading to better brine evaporation at a high ta h in subsequently higher and lower freshwater productivities of 890 and 496 ml h were achieved with ta h in equal to 70 and 50 c respectively in addition an increasing trend in δta dh and δtb dh was identified with an increase in ta h in indicating efficient heat transfer between the humidified air and brine inside the dehumidifier tubes at high ta h in this confirms the insight that at higher values of ta h in ta h out also aids in realizing efficient heat transfer to the brine inside the dehumidifier tubes which were subsequently sprayed i e at tb h in the temperature of the brine at the humidifier inlet on the surface of the hydrophilic fiber humidifier thereby contributing to higher ωa h out and resulting in higher freshwater productivity this can be visualized by comparing fig 5 a and 5 b a higher rate of brine evaporation and subsequent freshwater productivity was achieved at ta h in equal to 70 6 1 4 effect of brine preheating thermal cycle 2 on system performance from the results of the system behavior for varying ta h in it can be inferred that tb h in influences ωa h out which further plays a major role in the brine treatment efficiency or conversion rate therefore to enhance the evaporation rate of brine across the humidifier a dual fluid preheating technique thermal cycle 2 was adopted santosh et al 2019a the brine was preheated using low grade heat energy range of 45 55 before its entry into the hydrophilic fiber humidifier unit from fig 6 a it can be inferred that an increase in tb h in caused an increasing trend in ta h out and ϕa h out however a comparison of figs 5 a and 6 a indicates that at an optimum value of ta h in of 70 the preheating of brine to 45 50 and 55 contributed to a significant increase in δωa h by 121 17 g kg 233 25 g kg and 280 29 g kg respectively owing to higher values of ta h out and ϕa h out achieved by effective humidification across the hydrophilic fiber surface subsequently during dehumidification freshwater productivities of 1485 1790 and 2100 ml h were achieved for values of tb h in of 45 50 and 55 c respectively which were 67 101 and 136 higher than the brine conversion rate achieved for the same ta h in of 70 in the case of thermal cycle 1 in addition comparing figs 5 b and 6 b it can be seen that a higher δtb dh was achievable in the case of thermal cycle 2 for all the values of ta h in considered this can contribute to reducing the energy requirement for brine preheating 6 1 5 effect of air post heating after humidification thermal cycle 3 on system performance thermal cycle 3 focused on the process of heating humidified air to evaluate the low grade heat recovery potential of moist air and its effect on brine treatment quality to establish a fair comparison between thermal cycles 2 and 3 the experiments involved heating humidified air to an identical optimum temperature of 70 across the humidifier exit ta h out or dehumidifier inlet ta dh in with brine preheated in the range of 45 55 at the humidifier entry thus achieving a dual fluid heating process similar to thermal cycle 2 the characteristic variation in thermal cycle 3 is shown in fig 7 considering the humidifier thermal characteristics owing to the closed air circulation of the dehumidified air from the dehumidifier exit to the hydrophilic fiber humidifier entry the relative humidity of the dehumidified air ϕa dh out in the range of 91 92 contributed to having a lower ta h in the range 37 42 versus 70 in thermal cycle 2 when this comparatively low temperature humidified air interacted with the high temperature preheated brine 45 55 across the humidifier efficient heat transfer on the hydrophilic fiber surface resulted in an increase in the air temperature with values of ta h out of 39 44 and 46 for values of tb h in of 45 50 and 55 respectively as shown in fig 7 a note that unlike the previous cycles which resulted in a temperature drop of the air across the humidifier exit a temperature rise was identified in thermal cycle 3 because of the brine interaction at comparatively higher temperature thus the heating post humidification process cycle 3 contributed to two thermodynamic advantages namely heat recovery from the preheated brine by lower temperature air ta dh out during humidification and lower energy spent for the temperature rise of the saturated air cycle 3 compared to preheated air cycle 2 in other words it is more likely that the energy required to raise the temperature of the higher temperature more saturated air be less than that of comparatively less saturated air narayan et al 2010b owing to the non preheating air recirculation the relative humidity of the air medium ϕa h out also increased to a maximum of 99 9 for all values of tb h in considered fig 7 a however comparing figs 6 a and 7 a it can be inferred that although cycle 3 aided in achieving efficient heat transfer or low grade heat recovery the above characteristics ta h out and ϕa h out lowered the value of δωa h 11 g kg 14 g kg and 17 g kg for values of tb h in of 45 50 and 55 respectively indicating that the preheated air at higher temperature cycle 2 could efficiently sustain higher moisture compared to non preheated air during humidification therefore low values of δωa h resulted in lower freshwater productivity as indicated in fig 7 b compared to cycle 2 similar to the humidifier heating humidified air also contributed to efficient heat transfer across the dehumidifier unit this was evident from the higher values of δta dh and δtb dh fig 7b in the case of thermal cycle 3 compared to those of cycle 2 fig 6b thus it was identified that although thermal cycle 3 contributed to efficient heat transfer across both the humidifier and dehumidifier units as inferred theoretically by narayan et al 2010b the mass transfer rate was affected across the humidifier owing to the lower moisture holding capacity of the non preheated air medium leading to a negative effect of reduction in δωa h that reduced the maximum brine conversion rate for thermal cycle 3 2010 ml h compared to thermal cycle 2 2100 ml h nevertheless the significantly higher values of δta dh and δtb dh in thermal cycle 3 improved the overall cyclic thermal efficiency as discussed in the subsequent section 6 1 6 performance comparison of different thermal cycles a system performance comparison in terms of the optimum conditions of brine treatment based on thermal characteristics and performance evaluation factors for the different thermal cycles adopted is shown in fig 8 a and b respectively comparing the main humidification parameters which include ϕa h out and δωa h it can be inferred that the maximum values of δωa h of 8 29 and 17 g kg were reached for thermal cycles 1 for optimum values of ṁb ṁa and ta h in of 1 2 l min 3 5 kg min and 70 respectively 2 and 3 for the aforementioned optimum conditions plus the optimum value of tb h in of 55 respectively the significant increase in δωa h for the different thermal cycles can be mainly attributed to the influence of the increase in ϕa h out for thermal cycles 1 74 5 2 89 1 and 3 99 9 along with the effect of ta h out however comparing the brine conversion performance the maximum freshwater productivity of 2100 ml h was achieved with thermal cycle 2 followed by thermal cycle 3 2010 ml h and 1 890 ml h as discussed earlier the better productivity of thermal cycles 2 and 3 was due to the considerable increase in δωa h achieved by the dual fluid preheating process furthermore the decrease in the productivity of thermal cycle 3 compared to that of 2 was due to the decrease in δωa h as a result of adopting the non preheated air cycle as discussed earlier fig 7a however the above process was identified to be thermally efficient with a maximum gor or huf of 1 77 compared to thermal cycles 1 0 14 and 2 1 57 as shown in fig 8 a this can be attributed to the comparatively lower thermal energy input qin eqs 1 and 4 or efficient low grade heat recovery potential i e energy required to raise the temperature of the air to 70 for low temperature moist air across the humidifier exit in thermal cycle 3 further as the water recovery rate or wrf is dependent on the freshwater productivity eq 10 it was identified to be 0 30 0 70 and 0 67 for the thermal cycles 1 2 and 3 respectively a comparison of the various humidifier and dehumidifier performance evaluation factors for the different thermal cycles is shown in fig 8 b given that the euf is dependent on the brine conversion rate its trend was similar to that of the freshwater productivity with a maximum euf of 9 1 kg kwh achieved for thermal cycle 2 followed by cycles 3 and 1 8 9 and 3 9 kg kwh respectively interestingly although thermal cycle 3 exhibited a significant decrease 2 in its electric efficiency euf its thermal efficiency huf was dominant 13 indicating efficient low grade heat energy utilization considering the variation in the performance of the hydrophilic fiber humidifier in contributing to the brine treatment process the trends of hcf and εh indicate that the maximum humidification potential of the hydrophilic fiber humidifier occurred during thermal cycle 3 with maximum hcf and εh of 8 41 and 0 99 followed by cycles 2 and 1 in addition to the inherent potential of the hydrophilic fiber humidifier this can be attributed to the effect of varying the thermal characteristics with respect to the thermal cycles of the air ta h in and ϕa h in and brine tb h in across the humidifier unit and its effect on the varying thermal energy input for preheating the operating fluids in a closed cycle setup thus it is inferred that the variation in the thermal characteristics of the air in the hdh process can significantly contribute to the exploitation of the humidifier s maximum humidification potential and overall energy consumption i e thermal cycle 3 however these process dependent thermal characteristics also influence the dehumidifier performance based on the properties of the air across its inlet as recognized from the varying εdh values a maximum value of εdh of 0 78 was measured for thermal cycle 2 followed by cycles 3 0 64 and 1 0 43 despite the higher value of εh for thermal cycle 3 its reduced εdh compared with that of thermal cycle 2 can be attributed to the lower value of δωa h in the former case furthermore a constant hcr value of 1 43 which is closer to the balanced condition of hcr 1 for the three thermal cycles indicates humidification reliability or stability of the fabric humidifier for efficient heat and mass transfer between the air and brine media irrespective of the varying thermal characteristics across the humidifier unit for different thermal cycles narayan et al 2010a the various relevant thermal parameters brine conversion rate and performance metrics are summarized and compared in table 1 also note that the adoption of a fiber based hydrophilic humidifier significantly improved the hdh process thermal efficiency with better humidification characteristics compared to a similar process thermal cycle 2 with a hydrophobic plastic humidifier santosh et al 2022b the humidity ratio increment across the humidifier unit was 56 with fabric humidifier thereby contributing to improved freshwater productivity and gor by 67 and 64 compared to pvc δωa h 16 3 g kg ṁf 1398 ml h and gor 0 97 in addition to the materialistic characteristics of the fabric humidifier the better δωa h can also be attributed to a higher optimum feed flow rate 1 2 l min in the present work compared to 0 9 l min in the earlier reported work with a pvc humidifier thus it can be inferred that variation in the humidifier s materialistic characteristic also contribute to a distinct system s optimum parameters and productivity this indicates that the phenomenon of hdh process optimization is system specific that is dependent on the materialistic and process parameters such as the type of humidifier material adopted air and feed characteristics across the hdh system nevertheless it is inferred that the adoption of a hydrophilic humidifier significantly improved the hdh performance compared to hydrophobic packing owing to its inherent water affinity property leading to improved wet surface area for efficient interaction between air and feed 6 1 7 energy consumption comparison with previous literature as the present work also focuses on evaluating the feasibility of hdh technology for sustainable energy efficient mld process a comparison of the present system s specific thermal energy consumption with that of similarly reported hdh systems treating seawater brine and wastewater is made in fig 9 based on the data extracted from shah et al 2022 with the thermal energy input qin eq 4 of 0 84 kw and 0 71 kw for the better thermal cycles 2 and 3 the specific thermal energy consumption was accounted to be approximately 840 kwh m3 and 710 kwh m3 respectively it is inferred that the present system was energy efficient compared to a majority of the experimentally evaluated hdh systems despite using high salinity feed owing to the utilization of low grade heat energy further comparing the specific thermal energy consumption between thermal cycles 2 and 3 despite its lower freshwater productivity thermal cycle 3 was energy efficient owing to the thermodynamic advantages discussed earlier under section 6 1 4 that contributed to lower qin however the higher specific thermal energy consumption compared to santosh et al 2020 and chang et al 2014 fig 9 could be attributed to the decrease in the partial vapor pressure of the high salinity feed brine in the present work that demands higher qin for achieving the desired temperature compared to low salinity feed seawater in the aforementioned studies spinnler 2019 in other words the high salinity feed demands higher qin that is required to improve the temperature induced vapor pressure to overcome the salinity induced vapor pressure reduction for effective evaporation in addition to this effect the underestimation of experimental thermal loss could have contributed to lower specific thermal energy consumption in the earlier reported theoretical studies nevertheless the present study experimentally indicated that the air post heating after humidification thermal cycle 3 contributes to reduced specific thermal energy consumption compared to the preheating mechanism thermal cycle 2 6 2 evaluation of chemical characteristics 6 2 1 effect of hdh thermal characteristics on the chemical quality of brine treatment it is of prime importance to evaluate the chemical quality of the freshwater produced to assess the efficiency of the hdh process in treating desalination brine and estimate its reusability given that the present study focused on improving both physical and chemical qualities of brine water a detailed chemical analysis was conducted at the korea research institute of ships ocean engineering the results of the various physical and chemical parameters of the freshwater produced from the different thermal cycles considered in this study are summarized in table 2 the quality of the base seawater and brine before and after the membrane distillation process feed brine used in the present study and the freshwater produced from hdh thermal cycles 1 2 and 3 were broadly compared with the latest and updated water reusable guidelines postulated by the environmental protection agency epa of the united states food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations world health organization who and other major standards such as the australian guideline for water recycling agwr for irrigation purposes jeong et al 2016 shoushtarian and negahban azar 2020 the conclusion is that both physical and chemical properties of the brine i e feed increased significantly after the membrane distillation process indicating its inherent potential against adverse effects that could be caused to the environment if not properly treated i e using hdh technology in the present study note that the constituents were similar to those of brine generated from currently operating centralized ro desalination plants omerspahic et al 2022 panagopoulos 2022 thus the results of the present study could also be applied to improve the efficiency of the treatment of the brine generated from the dominant ro desalination technology which accounts for approximately 69 of the total desalination capacity worldwide ihsanullah et al 2021 physical examination revealed a clear color change in the freshwater produced from the three thermal cycles along with the removal of a musty odor from the feed brine further chemical analysis indicated that the freshwater generated from thermal cycle 2 possessed comparatively minimum contaminants in particular the major factors of ph tds and ec indicating efficient removal of salts and dissolved solids from the feed brine compared to thermal cycles 1 and 3 concerning the chemical characteristics of thermal cycles 2 and 3 note that although thermal cycle 2 exhibited a higher evaporation rate with improved moist air to dry air ratio i e δωa h of 29 g kg table 1 than thermal cycle 3 17 g kg its chemical quality was better this phenomenon could be attributed to two reasons firstly in the case of thermal cycle 2 during humidification the hypersaline feed brine interacted with the preheated air at a temperature of 70 across the surface of the fabric humidifier during this the brine would have undergone better separation of the ions at the air feed interface thereby contributing to better quality evaporation or moisture in the humidified air with left behind or deposition of the contaminants ions on the surface of the fabric humidifier this mechanism is termed evaporative deposition as depicted in fig 1 kim et al 2021 while the mechanism of evaporative deposition was previously reported in colloidal droplets liu et al 2022 2019 yu et al 2017 the present study revealed its novel influence on the chemical quality of the freshwater produced applicable to thermal based brine treatment technologies conversely in thermal cycle 3 the feed brine at the same 55 interacted with the non preheated lower temperature 42 re circulated air that limits the ionic separation efficiency across the air feed interface on the fabric humidifier therefore subsequently thermal cycle 3 would have contributed to poor chemical moisture quality with evaporated contaminants or ions compared to cycle 2 in fact the ionic separation mechanism across the air salt solution interface has been earlier investigated by jungwirth and douglas 2002 and it was identified to be temperature dependent generally humidified air constitutes a combination of both moist and non condensable dry air narayan et al 2013b when the chemically poor quality humidified air in cycle 3 reached the dehumidifier unit it condensates into freshwater thereby influencing its chemical nature thus the effect of air temperature at the air feed interface influenced the ionic separation efficiency thereby affecting the chemical quality of the humidified air and subsequently the freshwater generated from it during dehumidification secondly as mentioned earlier humidified air constitutes a combination of both moist and non condensable dry air when the poor quality humidified air is heated during the post heating process it undergoes a decrease in its moisture level as evident from the decrease in the relative humidity of the air from a value of ϕa h out of 99 9 to that of ϕa dh in of 72 6 in the case of optimum thermal cycle 3 after the post heating process in this case the poor chemical quality is further aggravated due to a reduction in the moisture level or humidity ratio available for dehumidification therefore during dehumidification of the humidified air with a lower humidity ratio the evaporated contaminants or ions increase their influence or decrease the per liter chemical quality of freshwater produced while it is not apparent what vapor contaminants contributed to higher tds and ec because of the satisfactory reduction in the major ions table 2 that requires further investigation the reduction in the moisture level was evident from the decrease in the relative humidity of the air after post heating as discussed earlier in this regard it is worth mentioning that the humidifier section was equipped with wire mesh mist eliminators to prevent the miscarriage of the brine droplets therefore the freshwater quality could have not been affected by the brine droplet miscarriage further comparing the δωa h for thermal cycles 2 29 g kg and 3 17 g kg table 1 it is evident that the moist air to dry air ratio in cycle 3 is 41 lower than cycle 2 contributing to the maximum influence of vapor contaminants in thermal cycle 3 evident from its corresponding chemical quality of freshwater generated furthermore even for a unit hour operation of the hdh thermal cycle 3 which was the case of the present study a considerable reduction in the chemical quality of the freshwater generated was identified if this hdh cycle is adopted for round the clock operation as in the case of conventional brine treatment systems the chemical quality of the freshwater generated would be significantly affected with respect to that resulting from cycle 2 as inferred from the above results it is also to be mentioned that further investigation is required for evaluating the long term usability of the adopted fabric humidifier due to the effect of evaporative deposition however the least efficient hdh cycle for removing salts and toxic ions from brine was concluded to be thermal cycle 1 table 2 this is because the increase in the brine temperature in the case of thermal cycles 2 and 3 through brine preheating contributed to an increase in its ionic mobility fondriest environmental inc 2014 roy et al 2017 leading to faster and more efficient separation of the salts and minerals across the air water surface thereby preventing an elevated miscarriage of contaminants in the moist humidified air this can also be attributed to the minor effect of the variation in the physical parameters of brine that is increase and decrease in volume and density respectively owing to the increase in its temperature tb h in during preheating the brine in thermal cycle 1 exhibited a comparatively lower temperature leading to a lower volume and higher density per unit area fluid earth 2022 therefore its interaction with preheated air during humidification contributed to a higher salt carriage per unit volume from the air water surface leading to higher contaminants in thermal cycle 1 during dehumidification thus the aforementioned effects collectively resulted in a reduced chemical quality of freshwater generation during dehumidification the effect of ionic mobility between thermal cycles 2 and 3 was also elucidated the higher ionic mobility in cycle 2 owing to a higher mean temperature across the humidifier section due to preheated air and preheated brine interaction could have resulted in better quality of freshwater compared to cycle 3 which involves the interaction of preheated brine with the non preheated air medium therefore it can be concluded that the hdh and operating fluid thermal characteristics have a strong influence on the quality of the brine treatment or freshwater produced furthermore considering the materialistic characteristics of the hydrophilic fiber humidifier adopted no significant scaling fouling issues were identified during the entire experimentation of 600 h this signifies the fabric humidifier s stability and re usability for the brine treatment process however as earlier mentioned the fabric humidifier was air dried and then cleaned between each experiment for the removal of the salt deposit on its surface owing to evaporative deposition and for its effective operation during the subsequent cycles 6 2 2 improving the quality of freshwater generated while approaching zld the two major by products generated from desalination brine treatment using the proposed hdh process are freshwater and concentrated brine fig 2 first regarding freshwater although the experimented single stage hdh process optimum thermal cycle 2 efficiently reduced the ph reduction rate of 63 as well as toxic ions such as sodium chloride and boron reduction rates of 99 9 99 9 and 99 7 and other chemical contaminants satisfying the major global water reuse standards table 2 it was not efficient enough to reduce the tds and ec limits however note that the proposed single stage hdh process thermal cycle 2 was sufficient to reduce the tds and ec values by 89 6 and 89 8 respectively indicating its potential for efficient contaminant removal therefore the adoption of the dual stage hdh process with re utilization of the generated freshwater as feed can significantly aid in satisfying the tds and ec limits of global water reuse standards furthermore the hourly freshwater generated for thermal cycles 1 2 and 3 was 30 70 and 67 respectively owing to the variation in thermal characteristics as discussed earlier second the major objective of the present study was to identify energy and cost efficient alternative solutions for treating desalination brine thus the second byproduct i e concentrated brine can be utilized to generate additional freshwater along with the production of salt crystals using a spray type hdh process minier matar et al 2016 or cyclonic separators elhashimi et al 2022 aiming at a circular economy and zld given that hdh is emerging as an attractive brine treatment technology shah et al 2022 and significant efforts are being carried out for the effective treatment of brine through thermal based processes the present study which is a primary part of the research on exploring the nexus between the thermal characteristics and chemical quality of brine treatment is anticipated to be highly beneficial in aiding the adoption of hdh processes with and without the combination of other cost effective techniques liu et al 2020 for treating desalination brine 7 conclusions an experimental investigation of a hydrophilic fiber based hdh system for treating real membrane distillation generated brine using low grade heat 45 70 was conducted to explore its feasibility for mld different thermal cycles were adopted based on the preheating mechanism cycle 1 air preheating 2 air and brine dual fluid preheating and 3 air post heating after humidification and their effects on the system thermal characteristics and chemical quality of freshwater produced were explored the significant findings of this study are summarized as follows concerning thermal efficiency gor the order of performance was identified as thermal cycle 3 1 77 2 1 57 1 0 14 however concerning freshwater productivity performance the order was thermal cycle 2 70 3 67 1 30 owing to the negative effect on the reduction in the humidity ratio during humidification δωa h with the non preheated air usage in cycle 3 increasing the temperature of the brine contributed to an improvement in its ionic mobility at higher temperatures 55 which aided in faster and efficient separation of the salts and minerals across the air water surface preventing the elevated miscarriage of contaminated brine droplets in humidified moist air thus better freshwater quality was achieved in thermal cycles 2 and 3 interaction of the preheated air at a higher temperature 70 with the brine aided in efficient ionic separation across the air feed interface in cycle 3 contributing to better humidified air quality concurrently with improved condensate chemical quality during dehumidification therefore the order of chemical quality of the freshwater produced was as follows thermal cycle 2 3 1 highlighting the effect of thermal characteristics on the freshwater chemical quality although the proposed single stage hdh process efficiently aided in reducing the ph by 63 as well as toxic ions such as sodium chloride and boron by 99 9 99 9 and 99 7 and other chemical contaminants satisfying the major global water reuse standards it was not efficient enough to reduce the tds and ec limits however the adoption of a dual stage hdh process can reduce the above constituents as the reduction rates of the tds and ec limits of the present system were 89 6 and 89 8 respectively given that hdh is an emerging brine treatment technology the present study provides useful information on the characteristic nexus between the thermal properties of the operating fluids and the chemical quality of freshwater produced from desalination brine future work from the present study will focus on reducing the freshwater tds and ec limits along with the evaluation of the

14986,different reactive oxygen species ros tend to attack specific sites on pollutants leading to the formation of intermediates with different toxic effects therefore regulating the directional transformation of ros is a new effective approach for safe degradation of refractory organic compounds in wastewater however the regulation mechanism and transformation path of ros remain unclear in this work the dissolved oxygen do content was controlled by aeration to generate different ros through the activation of o2 on the calcined cucofe ldh cucofe 300 ros quantitative experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance proved that o2 was mainly activated to superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 under low do concentration 0 231 mmol l o2 o2 1o2 with the increasing of do concentration 0 606 mmol l o2 was inclined to convert into hydroxyl radicals oh o2 o2 h2o2 oh the density functional theory and function model of active sites utilization and do concentration built a solid proof for ros conversion mechanism that increasing the do concentration promotes the increase of active sites utilization on the cucofe 300 system that is the o2 was more prone to convert to oh not 1o2 in thermodynamics under high active sites utilization condition hence the ros generation was controlled by regulating do concentration and the nontoxic degradation pathway of ciprofloxacin was well designed this work is dedicated to the in depth exploration of the mechanism between do concentration and ros conversion which provides an extremely flexible low energy consumption and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment method in a new perspective graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aops molecular oxygen controllable transformation of ros calcined layered double hydroxides low energy consumption refractory organic compounds data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the refractory organics in the wastewater are known to bring serious threats to the aquatic environment because of its strong toxicity and high persistence so reducing the toxicity of refractory organic wastewater during degradation process is always an urgent issue in worldwide delavar et al 2022 advanced oxidation processes aops technology has been widely used in the restoration of such wastewater however it is usually necessary to add strong oxidants e g h2o2 persulfate or input energy e g light electricity to facilitate catalytic oxidation processes for the generation of reactive oxygen species ros e g oh 1o2 in most aops technology rueda márquez et al 2016 ling et al 2017 sinha et al 2019 these approaches promote the generation of abundant ros for efficiently degrading organic pollutants at the expense of higher energy consumption and environment pollution lee et al 2016 from the perspective of low costing and environmentally friendly the green and inexpensive oxidants and corresponding aops technologies at room condition are needed molecular oxygen o2 is a nontoxic non polluting and cheap oxidant offering many advantages over other oxidants towards the direction of high selectivity sustainability and efficiency in the field of refractory organic wastewater treatment chen et al 2018 guo et al 2022 activated o2 can stimulate the production of ros including 1o2 oh o2 and h2o2 which are key factors of the organic compound degradation process xu et al 2022a li et al 2020 nevertheless the transformation from o2 to ros is complex and diverse generally speaking in the view of electron transfer activating o2 to form o2 always originate from an electron transfer process woodham et al 2013 the conversion of o2 to 1o2 is the process of losing electrons while the conversion of o2 to h2o2 and oh is the process of gaining electrons nosaka and nosaka 2017 therefore regulating the electronic state of o2 is an important means for the directional formation of 1o2 or oh with strong oxidized property moreover considering that the 1o2 and oh tended to attack different sites on molecule of organic pollutants which leads to different ecotoxicity of intermediates li et al 2021 liang et al 2022 thus how to regulate the formation process of specific ros 1o2 and oh through activating o2 is significant for guiding the effective and safe degradation of refractory organics many researchers have put their effort into changing the structure of catalyst to control the transition path of ros for example the interplanar spacing of cu coordinated carbon nitride electrode was altered to activate o2 and selectively form oh and 1o2 feng et al 2021 the number of aromatic rings in triazine based conjugated polymers was cut to reduce the exciton activation energy for the purpose of prompting o2 activation to produce more o2 instead of 1o2 yan et al 2022 however sacrificing structural stability to achieve ros directional conversion will affect the cycling performance of catalysts it seems that the directional transformation of ros by controlling the oxidation conditions is an effective strategy to solve the problems zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 but now the mechanism for regulating the generation of oh and 1o2 via activating o2 by controlling the oxidation conditions still lacks a rational explanation layered double hydroxides ldhs are characterized by abundant surface oxygen containing functional groups defect sites and two dimensional structure which is of advantage to form plenty of catalytic active sites it is worth mentioning that the ros of cucofe ldh system varies with the o2 concentration of catalytic oxidation environment in our previous research wang et al 2022 thus ldhs materials have great potential for harmless degradation of organic pollutants by controlling the oxidation conditions to achieve ros directional conversion without sacrificing catalyst structure in this study a novel cucofe ldh catalyst cucofe 300 with abundant oxygen active sites was well designed through calcination the differences of various ros that generated via controlling the dissolved oxygen do concentration in cucofe 300 system were quantitatively analyzed and the degradation performance and process of ciprofloxacin cip were taken as indicators the conversion pathways of ros and the activation mechanism of o2 under different do concentrations were investigated by functional relationship model and density functional theory dft this work provided an important reference for the harmless degradation of refractory organics in wastewater under mild conditions 2 experimental section 2 1 synthesis of catalyst cucofe ldh was synthesized by co precipitation method briefly mixed metal salt solution was prepared by adding cu no3 2 3h2o 0 02 mol co no3 2 6h2o 0 02 mol and fe no3 3 9h2o 0 02 mol to 100 ml of deionized water meantime naoh 0 12 mol and na2co3 0 01 mol were mixed with 100 ml of deionized water to prepare the alkaline solution the metal salt solution and alkali solution were slowly dropped into the three necked flask for co precipitation reaction and the ph and temperature were kept at 8 5 0 1 and 60 c during the process respectively after the reaction finished the suspension was stirred constantly for 30 min and then aged at 60 c for 24 h finally the product was washed several times by deionized water and ethanol and dried at 80 c for 12 h the cucofe ldh samples were obtained after grinding and passing through a 180 mesh screen the cucofe ldo catalyst was prepared by calcining cucofe ldh under the protection of n2 in a quartz tube furnace which at different calcination temperatures 200 300 400 and 500 c represented cucofe 200 cucofe 300 cucofe 400 and cucofe 500 respectively 2 2 catalytic performance the cip degradation experiments were carried out in 200 ml conical flask the aeration tube containing air adjust air the ventilation rate of air and n2 was 3 1 or pure oxygen was immersed in the solution before the reaction in catalytic wet oxidation process the catalyst was dispersed in cip solution to initiate the reaction 1 ml of the suspension was taken at predetermined time intervals and filtered through a 0 22 μm nitrocellulose membrane with methanol as the quencher in the reaction three parallel experiments were carried out for each group of samples 2 3 analytical method the concentration of cip was determined using high performance liquid chromatography hplc system agilent u s a equipped with a uv detector uv 2489 at 278 nm and an sb c18 reverse phase column 250 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm the mobile phase acetonitrile water ph 3 mixed solution 20 80 v v containing 0 1 of phosphoric acid and the flow rate was set to 1 0 ml min 1 nie et al 2022 benzoic acid ba was used as a molecular probe to detect oh concentration ba could react with oh to form p hba and the oh concentration was determined by p hba concentration according to the equation oh p hba 5 87 the p hba concentration was measured by hplc with a uv detector at 270 nm the mobile phase was water acetonitrile 85 15 v v and the flow rate was 0 2 ml min jiang et al 2020 nitrotetrazolium blue chloride nbt was used as the molecular probe for o2 the yellow nbt was reduced to blue formazan under the influence of o2 and the nitrotetrazolium blue chloride formula of concentration of o2 was o2 formazan 4 the changes of nbt concentration was measured with uv vis spectrophotometer at 259 nm goto et al 2004 huang et al 2015 the 1 3 diphenylisobenzofuran dpbf was considered as an indicator of 1o2 the chemical reaction molar ratio between 1o2 and dpbf was 1 1 and the changes of dpbf concentration was measured at the wavelength of 410 nm jiang et al 2020 the concentration of h2o2 was tested by the fluorescent peroxidase method and the changes of fluorescence intensity were detected under the excitation wavelength of 350 nm zhan et al 2020 text s1 provided the specific operation details and analysis methods other details including chemicals characterization techniques and dft calculation method were given in text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantitative analysis of ros generally oxygen vacancies ovs were thought to be important active sites to improve catalytic properties of catalyst cai et al 2020 in our previous studies the mechanism of ovs as the active site for activating o2 on cucofe ldh based modified materials was systematically and comprehensively studied wang et al 2022 2020a herein a simpler method for producing abundant ovs on cucofe ldh catalyst via calcination was provided to achieve the generation and transformation of ros the prepared samples under different calcination temperature were characterized using various analytical instruments the complete descriptions were shown in text s3 supplementary figs s1 6 the results demonstrated that the content of ovs in cucofe ldh after calcination was significantly increased especially in cucofe 300 therefore cucofe 300 was selected as optimal catalyst for the follow up experiments in order to explore the capacity of cucofe 300 to activate o2 and confirm the source of ros under different do concentration various gasses air and oxygen was fed into the cucofe 300 systems and the ros content in different atmospheres was quantitatively analyzed fig 1 a e without aeration do concentration was 0 13 mmol l only a small amount of o2 was detected within 240 min and the concentration was 0 042 mmol l supplementary figs s7 8 the concentration of oh o2 1o2 and h2o2 increased rapidly with the continuous introduction of air and the do concentration reached up to 0 231 mmol l fig 1a within 240 min the concentrations of oh o2 1o2 and h2o2 were 0 028 0 341 0 279 and 0 054 mmol l respectively compared with no aeration condition the concentration of o2 increased by 8 12 times after the introduction of air fig 1c obviously trace oh appeared after air was introduced and the concentration of 1o2 was 9 96 times than that of oh in air atmosphere fig 1b and d subsequently a certain amount of n2 was introduced to adjust air atmosphere to explore the critical do concentration of oh generation when the do concentration was 0 172 mmol l the concentrations of o2 and 1o2 were 0 17 and 0 134 mmol l respectively while oh and h2o2 were almost undetectable fig 1e with the continuous supply of pure oxygen do concentration reached its maximum value 0 606 mmol l and the concentrations of oh o2 1o2 and h2o2 increased to 0 209 0 876 0 318 and 0 239 mmol l respectively compared with no aeration condition the concentration of o2 increased by 20 86 times after pure oxygen was introduced in addition as shown in fig 1f the concentrations of oh o2 1o2 and h2o2 in pure oxygen atmosphere were increased by 7 46 2 57 1 14 and 4 43 times respectively compared with exposure to air atmosphere the above results showed that only a small amount of o2 could be produced without aeration and no oh was detected in air atmosphere ros mainly consisted of o2 and 1o2 and a small quantity of oh when the do concentration was adjusted to 0 172 mmol l o2 was almost activated to o2 and 1o2 meanwhile if pure oxygen was introduced o2 tended to be converted into o2 and oh the amount of ros generated varies significantly in various gas environments indicating that the ros in the cucofe 300 system was mainly evolved from o2 nevertheless the o2 activation efficiency on cucofe ldh in air atmosphere or pure o2 atmosphere was almost the same supplementary fig s9 lower than that of cucofe 300 in air atmosphere or pure o2 atmosphere which might be attributed to the low content of active sites on cucofe ldh supplementary fig s1b electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra were further used to verify the changes of ros under different do concentrations chen et al 2022 only low dmpo o2 signal was found under no aeration condition supplementary fig s10 in addition the results of the aeration conditions were shown in fig 1g i in the air cucofe 300 system epr signal increased significantly especially dmpo o2 and temp 1o2 signals when adjusted the do content in the air atmosphere the dmpo oh signal was disappeared at this moment only the dmpo o2 and temp 1o2 signals were detected in the o2 cucofe 300 system the epr signal was further larger stronger than that of the air cucofe 300 system among them dmpo oh and dmpo o2 signals changed significantly with only a slight change on the temp 1o2 signal the results of epr tests were basically consistent with the quantitative analysis of ros in view of this the species and quantities of ros generation were indeed affected by the variation of do concentration taking the air atmosphere as an example the ability of cucofe 300 for activating o2 under room condition was described intuitively the content of 1o2 generated through activating o2 on cucofe 300 catalyst was more abundant than other oxidants and corresponding aops such as input of external energy or addition of strong oxidants supplementary table s1 xu et al 2022b zheng et al 2022 yang et al 2022 3 2 the relationship between cip degradation and ros the ability of cucofe 300 to activate o2 for ros generation was reflected by the degradation performance of cip as shown in supplementary fig s11 in terms of cip degradation performance cucofe 300 was superior to pristine cucofe ldh and cucofe ldh under other calcination temperatures 200 400 and 500 c demonstrating that the degradation of cip was positively correlated with the oxygen active sites content on the catalyst besides cip could not be self degraded under air or pure oxygen condition supplementary fig s12 and cucofe 300 was also difficult to activate o2 for the effective degradation of cip without aeration supplementary fig s13 in fig 2 a after the do concentration was increased to 0 231 mmol l by introducing air into the system the degradation efficiency of cip reaches 82 5 in pure oxygen environment the cip degradation efficiency was up to 90 0 however with a decline in do concentration in air atmosphere the degradation efficiency of cip was dropped to 60 7 which well confirmed the point that the cip degradation was closely related to the content of ros under different do concentration conditions in fig 2b all of cip degradation curves all fitted the same pseudo first order reaction kinetics model compared with the system without aeration the reaction rates k in air adjust air and pure oxygen atmosphere system were increased by 7 21 3 28 and 8 69 times respectively the k of o2 cucofe 300 system was 1 20 times higher than that of air cucofe 300 system although the degradation efficiency of cip in pure oxygen atmosphere was better than that in air atmosphere the increased reaction rate was far less prominent as the generation ratio of ros fig 1f for this purpose the mineralization rate of cip in air cucofe 300 and o2 cucofe 300 system was investigated fig 2c the mineralization rate of cip in o2 cucofe 300 system was 54 1 within 4 h which was significantly higher than that in air cucofe 300 system 35 5 the higher mineralization rate of cip was due to more oh generated in the o2 cucofe 300 system probably oh was more embedded to deeply minimize the cip liu et al 2021 the effects of environmental factors on the cip degradation by cucofe 300 for activating o2 were discussed such as ph coexisting anions and humic acid ha as shown in fig 2d air cucofe 300 exhibited excellent degradation performance on cip in a wide ph range 4 11 and the degradation rate was above 75 interestingly the degradation performance of cip in acidic conditions was slightly greater than that in alkaline conditions which might be relevant to the redox potential of o2 studies have shown that the redox potential of o2 o2 was higher in acidic conditions than that in alkaline environments which makes o2 easier to convert into o2 in acidic conditions nosaka and nosaka 2017 therefore the production of o2 at ph 4 and 11 was detected as shown in supplementary fig s14 the content of o2 in degradation process at ph 4 0 386 mmol l and ph 11 0 292 mmol l strengthened the idea that o2 plays an important role in the reaction system moreover a similar phenomenon existed in o2 cucofe 300 system supplementary fig s15 as shown in supplementary fig s16 since ph value higher than 8 35 the surface of the catalyst gradually became negative charge the distribution of positive charge at the active site on the cucofe 300 was influenced which was adverse to cip degradation in catalytic process co existing anions no3 cl h2po4 etc always react with oh to form weaker radicals affecting the degradation efficiency of pollutants luo et al 2019 gao et al 2020 as a proof of concept the degradation efficiency of cip was studied in air cucofe 300 system with different anions fig 2e encouragingly even when cl no3 so4 2 concentrations were up to 10 g l the cip degradation efficiency by the air cucofe 300 system remained at a high level approximately 78 6 as previously mentioned the air cucofe 300 system was dominated by o2 and 1o2 which ensures high degradation efficiency this phenomenon was particularly evident in the adjust air atmosphere ros that included only o2 and 1o2 supplementary fig s17 on the contrary the degradation performance of cip was greatly inhibited by h2po4 and hco3 ascribe to the reaction with o2 kifle et al 2022 yang et al 2019 proving that o2 was important in the air cucofe 300 system it was worth noting that the inhibition effect of h2po4 on cip degradation was stronger than that of hco3 which might be attributed to a higher reaction rate between h2po4 and o2 li et al 2022 due to the large amount of oh was generated in the o2 cucofe 300 system cip degradation efficiency was inhibited in high salt environments supplementary fig s18 furthermore degradation efficiency of cip was slightly inhibited by humic acid ha fig 2f which might be attributed to the competitive response of ros between ha and cip xiong et al 2021 not only that the cip degradation experiments showed that air cucofe 300 system has good adaptability in various water environments supplementary fig s19 the treatment performance of the air cucofe 300 system was conducted on secondary effluent from the local pharmaceutical factory cod 1870 mg l and the chloride salt concentration 40 g l after 24 h the cod removal rate of organic wastewater was almost 48 4 which has good applicability supplementary fig s20 in addition the test results showed that the metal ion leaching of catalyst did not exceed environmental safety limits supplementary fig s21 from the perspective of energy consumption and treatment efficiency air cucofe 300 system superior to the traditional aops which demonstrated a good applicability in actual refractory organic wastewater treatment 3 3 transformation pathway identification of ros to further identify the main ros and explore the mechanism of o2 activation by cucofe 300 the quenching test of active species were carried out with specific scavengers in the air cucofe 300 system fig 3 a the reaction process was slightly inhibited by tert butanol tba oh scavenger zhu et al 2018 indicating that oh was not an important ros in the system azide 20 mm as a quencher of 1o2 huang et al 2019 greatly inhibited the degradation of cip in the air cucofe 300 system the cip degradation efficiency decreased to 31 3 which demonstrated that 1o2 was the primary ros besides in order to verify the optimum concentration of quencher the inhibitory effect of various azide concentrations on cip degradation was tested as shown in supplementary fig s22 20 mm azide was sufficient to inhibit 1o2 in the reaction system when benzoquinone bq o2 scavenger was added guo et al 2016 the degradation efficiency of cip decreased to 37 5 proving that o2 has a significant effect on cip degradation conversely it was generally believed that the o2 with low redox potential was insufficient to react with cip in aqueous solution hayyan et al 2016 to explain the phenomenon in our study azide and bq were added in the air cucofe 300 system simultaneously the inhibition degreed was nearly identical to the situation that azide existed in system alone that is the o2 actually as precursor of 1o2 but not directly reacted with cip furthermore cr2o7 2 as an electron quencher also obviously restrained the degradation of cip zhou et al 2021 which mean that the conversion from o2 to ros was an electron transfer process the pathways of o2 to o2 and 1o2 were cut off by quenching electrons and which eventually lead to cip degradation was obstructed in the pure o2 atmosphere fig 3b the degradation efficiency of cip was strongly influence by tba and azide than that when the tba or azide was tested alone which confirmed that both oh and 1o2 were the main ros in the o2 cucofe 300 system moreover the inhibition effect of tba was a little higher than that of azide although the amount of 1o2 formed in the o2 cucofe 300 system was more than oh the oxidation ability of oh was stronger than 1o2 which reflected the dominance of oh in the pure o2 atmosphere the cip adsorption performance on cucofe 300 in both air atmosphere and pure o2 atmosphere were about 22 when the catalytic reaction process was totally inhibited by azide and tba also the inhibition phenomenon appeared after bq and cr2o7 2 were introduced indicating that the conversion of ros in the o2 cucofe 300 system was also an electron transfer process epr technology was used to detect the formation and transition paths of ros as shown in fig 3c the signals intensity of the temp 1o2 adducts was sharply reduced with the addition of bq whether in the air cucofe 300 system or o2 cucofe 300 system which demonstrated convincingly that o2 was an important precursor of 1o2 beside because o2 was not of course the only precursor of 1o2 in the complex catalytic reaction process and which was part of the reason that the diffraction signals of temp 1o2 adducts remained weak after bq was added further proved that the inhibitory effect of azide was superior to that of bq combined quenching experiment the formation steps of 1o2 were proposed in eqs 1 2 the signals intensity of dmpo oh adducts was also severely weakened when bq or horseradish peroxidase hrp h2o2 quencher was added in o2 cucofe 300 system fig 3d demonstrating that both o2 and h2o2 were precursors of oh wang et al 2020b wu et al 2020 meanwhile with the addition of bq the h2o2 content decreased from 0 239 to 0 029 mmol l in the o2 cucofe 300 system which mean that o2 was an important precursor not just for the 1o2 but also for the h2o2 supplementary fig s23 eqs 3 4 1 o 2 e o 2 2 o 2 1 o 2 e 3 o 2 e 2 h h 2 o 2 4 h 2 o 2 e oh o h dft was used to explain the reason why o2 was the precursor of other ros and with the highest content in the cucofe 300 system based on the sensitivity of the active sites to oxygen the charge transfer of the active sites in the cucofe 300 model was predicted by charge density difference as shown in fig 3e the ovs was a defect structure with positive charge and the electron originated from the ovs on cucofe 300 an obvious electron accumulation and depletion process was observed on active sites the electrons were transferred from neighboring area to the metal oxygen bonding region leading to strong electronic perturbations around the active sites on cucofe 300 which provided the essential conditions for the conversion from o2 to o2 referring to fig 3f the single active site was constructed by removing an oxygen atom from the surface of cucofe 300 and optimized to the ground state as shown in supplementary fig s24 o2 was adsorbed on the active site and then activated the o o bond length of oxygen molecules was stretched from 1 209 å to 1 26 å which was exactly equal to the theoretical length of o2 1 26 å in summary after receiving electrons the o2 was transferred to o2 and released subsequently the o2 was further converted to 1o2 or oh with the increase of do concentration owing to the strong oxidizing properties of 1o2 and oh the degradation performance and mineralization rate of cip were satisfactory in the cucofe 300 system 3 4 the influencing of do concentration on the transformation of ros considering that the ros content was closely related to the do concentration in the cucofe 300 system hereby the generation and conversion mechanism of ros was identified by establishing the dft model and functional relationship of active sites utilization and do concentration particularly the active sites utilization represents the proportion of active sites participating in the catalytic reaction details of the equations were shown in text s4 and supplementary fig s25 in fig 4 a the active sites utilization was 37 28 without oh generation in the adjust air cucofe 300 system with the increase of do concentration the active sites utilization was increased to 77 91 in the air cucofe 300 system and the generation quantity of ros was significantly higher than that of the adjust air cucofe 300 system and a certain amount of oh was generated as the utilization rate approached 100 0 the oh concentration significantly increased in the o2 cucofe 300 system this was attributed to the fact that the active sites act as an electron donor and undergoes a slow electron transfer process in low utilization state the o2 was activated to o2 and cannot get enough electrons to convert into h2o2 resulting in a large amount of 1o2 to be generated o2 o2 1o2 after the pure o2 was introduced in the system the increasing do concentrations promotes the increase of active sites utilization more and more electron donors participate in the reaction effectively accelerate the electron transfer process which prompt o2 to gain electrons and convert to h2o2 thus forming oh o2 o2 h2o2 oh the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was usually used to evaluate the electron transfer ability of catalyst in the fig 4b the electron transport capacity on the cucofe 300 surface was improved with the increasing of do concentration the inner ring radius was 35 1 ω in the pure o2 atmosphere which was significantly lower than that of the air atmosphere 84 7 ω and adjust air atmosphere 119 6 ω respectively indicating that the electrons on the cucofe 300 surface were easier to transform and migrate in the pure o2 atmosphere dft calculations were used to further corroborate the phenomena fig 4c the growing do concentration enhances the chemical potential of the reaction system which makes the conversion of o2 to 1o2 was easier with a lower energy barrier and the conversion of o2 to h2o2 was also accelerated by its higher free energy this was consistent with the phenomenon of higher ros concentration in pure o2 atmosphere in fact the conversion of o2 to h2o2 and oh was more advantageous than the conversion of o2 to 1o2 in thermodynamics under the premise of high active sites utilization and electron donor involved in the reaction and this was also the reason why ros was transformed by regulating do concentration it should be noted that the release energy of active sites was 2 89 ev supplementary fig s24 which far exceeded the energy needed by the conversion from o2 to 1o2 2 48 ev thus satisfies the large generation of 1o2 owing to the energy losses on the active site may cause the deactivation of the active center on the catalyst which impacts the cycle life therefore the cycle performance of cucofe 300 under air and pure o2 atmosphere was studied overall based on the appropriate active sites utilization the cip degradation was maintained a high capacity in the air cucofe 300 system after multiple cycles fig 5 the degradation efficiency decreased after the 6th and 9th cycles due to the filling of active sites with o2 but more than 90 of the catalytic activity could be recovered by re calcination 300 c 1 h which attributed to the energy recovery in active sites the o2 covered in the active sites were activated and the active sites were able to expose again although the high active sites utilization leads to higher cip mineralization in the o2 cucofe 300 system the cucofe 300 was prone to deactivation supplementary fig s26 in comparison the air cucofe 300 system was more suitable for the actual wastewater treatment furthermore the energy consumption of the air cucofe 300 system was evaluated by electric energy per order of pollutant removal ee o and the corresponding were attached in fig 5 more detailed descriptions in the text s5 and supplementary table s2 the ee o of the air cucofe 300 system was 0 010 kwh l 1 and the total ee o of five cycles was 0 080 kwh l 1 at room condition compared with most of advanced oxidation technologies that reported before table 1 our study proposed a novel aops technological system with low energy consumption and no chemical additives for degrading refractory organics efficiently through the combination of cucofe 300 catalyst and do which has an extensive application prospects in water pollution control 3 5 safe degradation of ciprofloxacin the intermediates of cip were analyzed by ultrafast liquid chromatography mass spectrometer lc ms technique to better evaluate the safe degradation pathway of cip by cucofe 300 in the o2 cucofe 300 system air cucofe 300 system and adjust air cucofe 300 system a total of 17 possible structures and mass to charge ratios m z were detected listed in supplementary fig s27 the fig 2 has already shown that the main ros in the adjust air cucofe 300 system was 1o2 while 1o2 and oh coexist in the o2 cucofe 300 system so the intermediate products under the attack of 1o2 or oh could be well distinguished moreover the bond breaking and the location of reaction sites of cip were further confirmed by dft calculation supplementary fig s28 the piperazine ring and c f bond were the main attack sites of 1o2 and the degradation process of cip were planned in the air cucofe 300 system and adjust air cucofe 300 system respectively supplementary figs s29 s30 most importantly the attack products of 1o2 and oh were separated in the pure o2 atmosphere and there might be three types of cip degradation pathways fig 6 in pathway i the c atom on the piperazine ring was attacked by 1o2 and undergone a ring opening reaction to form p1 m z 362 and p2 m z 334 and subsequently oxidized by 1o2 to form p3 m z 306 and p4 m z 292 in the next step the n h bond on the piperazine ring structure of p4 was attacked by 1o2 to form n o bond leading to form p5 m z 293 structure and further defluorinated to form p6 m z 275 in addition the no bond on p5 could also be attacked by oh to form p9 m z 263 in pathway ii the c atom on the piperazine ring was attacked by oh and became p7 m z 348 and p8 m z 364 and further ring opened to form p9 the c o bond and cc bond on p9 were jointly attacked by oh and 1o2 and then converted to p10 m z 227 finally p10 was oxidized to p16 m z 168 with small molecular weight in pathway iii the first oxidation reaction occurred on the c f bond which was oxidized to the c o h bond and formed p11 m z 330 then the c o h bond was removed forming p12 m z 313 after that p13 m z 304 p14 m z 288 p15 m z 175 and p16 were formed successively under the attack of oh finally both intermediates p6 and p16 were oxidized to co2 and h2o besides the toxicity of intermediates during cip degradation process was evaluated specifically the ecological structure activity relationship ecosar was used to evaluate the acute and chronic toxicity of cip intermediates on three trophic levels of aquatic organisms including fish daphnia and green algae liang et al 2022 the corresponding concentrations were listed in supplementary table s3 taking the acute toxicity test on daphnia lc50 as an example supplementary supplementary fig s31 in the ecotoxicity tests 12 of the 16 intermediate products were identified as nontoxic and only the intermediates p9 p10 p15 and p16 were identified as low toxic in addition the ecotoxicity of 1o2 attacked products p1 p6 were nontoxic and ecotoxicity was lower than cip and oh attacked products combined with the above research results the attack products of 1o2 with nontoxic but 1o2 dominated reaction would hardly to achieve effective mineralization rate of cip the introduction of oh can effectively improve the mineralization rate but increase the ecotoxicity of water bodies therefore from the perspective of harmless degradation of cip air was introduced into cucofe 300 system first to form many 1o2 attacked products and then a certain amount of o2 was introduced to form oh to pursue a higher cip mineralization rate with accompanied by the formation of nontoxic products such as p7 p8 and p11 supplementary supplementary fig s32 this method provided an important reference for the safe degradation of refractory organics in wastewater treatment 4 conclusion in summary the improvement of active sites utilization directly affects the participation of electron donors and facilitates the electron transfer efficiency on the catalyst surface thereby changing the relationship between electron gain and loss and further affecting the transfer process of ros it is also the reason that the cucofe 300 catalyst can effectively activate o2 to generate abundant ros at room conditions and the types and quantities of ros can be transformed directionally by adjusting the do concentration therefore a safe degradation process of cip can be achieved via controlling the transformation pathway of ros this study provides an extremely flexible low energy consumption and environmentally

14986,different reactive oxygen species ros tend to attack specific sites on pollutants leading to the formation of intermediates with different toxic effects therefore regulating the directional transformation of ros is a new effective approach for safe degradation of refractory organic compounds in wastewater however the regulation mechanism and transformation path of ros remain unclear in this work the dissolved oxygen do content was controlled by aeration to generate different ros through the activation of o2 on the calcined cucofe ldh cucofe 300 ros quantitative experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance proved that o2 was mainly activated to superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 under low do concentration 0 231 mmol l o2 o2 1o2 with the increasing of do concentration 0 606 mmol l o2 was inclined to convert into hydroxyl radicals oh o2 o2 h2o2 oh the density functional theory and function model of active sites utilization and do concentration built a solid proof for ros conversion mechanism that increasing the do concentration promotes the increase of active sites utilization on the cucofe 300 system that is the o2 was more prone to convert to oh not 1o2 in thermodynamics under high active sites utilization condition hence the ros generation was controlled by regulating do concentration and the nontoxic degradation pathway of ciprofloxacin was well designed this work is dedicated to the in depth exploration of the mechanism between do concentration and ros conversion which provides an extremely flexible low energy consumption and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment method in a new perspective graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aops molecular oxygen controllable transformation of ros calcined layered double hydroxides low energy consumption refractory organic compounds data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the refractory organics in the wastewater are known to bring serious threats to the aquatic environment because of its strong toxicity and high persistence so reducing the toxicity of refractory organic wastewater during degradation process is always an urgent issue in worldwide delavar et al 2022 advanced oxidation processes aops technology has been widely used in the restoration of such wastewater however it is usually necessary to add strong oxidants e g h2o2 persulfate or input energy e g light electricity to facilitate catalytic oxidation processes for the generation of reactive oxygen species ros e g oh 1o2 in most aops technology rueda márquez et al 2016 ling et al 2017 sinha et al 2019 these approaches promote the generation of abundant ros for efficiently degrading organic pollutants at the expense of higher energy consumption and environment pollution lee et al 2016 from the perspective of low costing and environmentally friendly the green and inexpensive oxidants and corresponding aops technologies at room condition are needed molecular oxygen o2 is a nontoxic non polluting and cheap oxidant offering many advantages over other oxidants towards the direction of high selectivity sustainability and efficiency in the field of refractory organic wastewater treatment chen et al 2018 guo et al 2022 activated o2 can stimulate the production of ros including 1o2 oh o2 and h2o2 which are key factors of the organic compound degradation process xu et al 2022a li et al 2020 nevertheless the transformation from o2 to ros is complex and diverse generally speaking in the view of electron transfer activating o2 to form o2 always originate from an electron transfer process woodham et al 2013 the conversion of o2 to 1o2 is the process of losing electrons while the conversion of o2 to h2o2 and oh is the process of gaining electrons nosaka and nosaka 2017 therefore regulating the electronic state of o2 is an important means for the directional formation of 1o2 or oh with strong oxidized property moreover considering that the 1o2 and oh tended to attack different sites on molecule of organic pollutants which leads to different ecotoxicity of intermediates li et al 2021 liang et al 2022 thus how to regulate the formation process of specific ros 1o2 and oh through activating o2 is significant for guiding the effective and safe degradation of refractory organics many researchers have put their effort into changing the structure of catalyst to control the transition path of ros for example the interplanar spacing of cu coordinated carbon nitride electrode was altered to activate o2 and selectively form oh and 1o2 feng et al 2021 the number of aromatic rings in triazine based conjugated polymers was cut to reduce the exciton activation energy for the purpose of prompting o2 activation to produce more o2 instead of 1o2 yan et al 2022 however sacrificing structural stability to achieve ros directional conversion will affect the cycling performance of catalysts it seems that the directional transformation of ros by controlling the oxidation conditions is an effective strategy to solve the problems zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 but now the mechanism for regulating the generation of oh and 1o2 via activating o2 by controlling the oxidation conditions still lacks a rational explanation layered double hydroxides ldhs are characterized by abundant surface oxygen containing functional groups defect sites and two dimensional structure which is of advantage to form plenty of catalytic active sites it is worth mentioning that the ros of cucofe ldh system varies with the o2 concentration of catalytic oxidation environment in our previous research wang et al 2022 thus ldhs materials have great potential for harmless degradation of organic pollutants by controlling the oxidation conditions to achieve ros directional conversion without sacrificing catalyst structure in this study a novel cucofe ldh catalyst cucofe 300 with abundant oxygen active sites was well designed through calcination the differences of various ros that generated via controlling the dissolved oxygen do concentration in cucofe 300 system were quantitatively analyzed and the degradation performance and process of ciprofloxacin cip were taken as indicators the conversion pathways of ros and the activation mechanism of o2 under different do concentrations were investigated by functional relationship model and density functional theory dft this work provided an important reference for the harmless degradation of refractory organics in wastewater under mild conditions 2 experimental section 2 1 synthesis of catalyst cucofe ldh was synthesized by co precipitation method briefly mixed metal salt solution was prepared by adding cu no3 2 3h2o 0 02 mol co no3 2 6h2o 0 02 mol and fe no3 3 9h2o 0 02 mol to 100 ml of deionized water meantime naoh 0 12 mol and na2co3 0 01 mol were mixed with 100 ml of deionized water to prepare the alkaline solution the metal salt solution and alkali solution were slowly dropped into the three necked flask for co precipitation reaction and the ph and temperature were kept at 8 5 0 1 and 60 c during the process respectively after the reaction finished the suspension was stirred constantly for 30 min and then aged at 60 c for 24 h finally the product was washed several times by deionized water and ethanol and dried at 80 c for 12 h the cucofe ldh samples were obtained after grinding and passing through a 180 mesh screen the cucofe ldo catalyst was prepared by calcining cucofe ldh under the protection of n2 in a quartz tube furnace which at different calcination temperatures 200 300 400 and 500 c represented cucofe 200 cucofe 300 cucofe 400 and cucofe 500 respectively 2 2 catalytic performance the cip degradation experiments were carried out in 200 ml conical flask the aeration tube containing air adjust air the ventilation rate of air and n2 was 3 1 or pure oxygen was immersed in the solution before the reaction in catalytic wet oxidation process the catalyst was dispersed in cip solution to initiate the reaction 1 ml of the suspension was taken at predetermined time intervals and filtered through a 0 22 μm nitrocellulose membrane with methanol as the quencher in the reaction three parallel experiments were carried out for each group of samples 2 3 analytical method the concentration of cip was determined using high performance liquid chromatography hplc system agilent u s a equipped with a uv detector uv 2489 at 278 nm and an sb c18 reverse phase column 250 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm the mobile phase acetonitrile water ph 3 mixed solution 20 80 v v containing 0 1 of phosphoric acid and the flow rate was set to 1 0 ml min 1 nie et al 2022 benzoic acid ba was used as a molecular probe to detect oh concentration ba could react with oh to form p hba and the oh concentration was determined by p hba concentration according to the equation oh p hba 5 87 the p hba concentration was measured by hplc with a uv detector at 270 nm the mobile phase was water acetonitrile 85 15 v v and the flow rate was 0 2 ml min jiang et al 2020 nitrotetrazolium blue chloride nbt was used as the molecular probe for o2 the yellow nbt was reduced to blue formazan under the influence of o2 and the nitrotetrazolium blue chloride formula of concentration of o2 was o2 formazan 4 the changes of nbt concentration was measured with uv vis spectrophotometer at 259 nm goto et al 2004 huang et al 2015 the 1 3 diphenylisobenzofuran dpbf was considered as an indicator of 1o2 the chemical reaction molar ratio between 1o2 and dpbf was 1 1 and the changes of dpbf concentration was measured at the wavelength of 410 nm jiang et al 2020 the concentration of h2o2 was tested by the fluorescent peroxidase method and the changes of fluorescence intensity were detected under the excitation wavelength of 350 nm zhan et al 2020 text s1 provided the specific operation details and analysis methods other details including chemicals characterization techniques and dft calculation method were given in text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantitative analysis of ros generally oxygen vacancies ovs were thought to be important active sites to improve catalytic properties of catalyst cai et al 2020 in our previous studies the mechanism of ovs as the active site for activating o2 on cucofe ldh based modified materials was systematically and comprehensively studied wang et al 2022 2020a herein a simpler method for producing abundant ovs on cucofe ldh catalyst via calcination was provided to achieve the generation and transformation of ros the prepared samples under different calcination temperature were characterized using various analytical instruments the complete descriptions were shown in text s3 supplementary figs s1 6 the results demonstrated that the content of ovs in cucofe ldh after calcination was significantly increased especially in cucofe 300 therefore cucofe 300 was selected as optimal catalyst for the follow up experiments in order to explore the capacity of cucofe 300 to activate o2 and confirm the source of ros under different do concentration various gasses air and oxygen was fed into the cucofe 300 systems and the ros content in different atmospheres was quantitatively analyzed fig 1 a e without aeration do concentration was 0 13 mmol l only a small amount of o2 was detected within 240 min and the concentration was 0 042 mmol l supplementary figs s7 8 the concentration of oh o2 1o2 and h2o2 increased rapidly with the continuous introduction of air and the do concentration reached up to 0 231 mmol l fig 1a within 240 min the concentrations of oh o2 1o2 and h2o2 were 0 028 0 341 0 279 and 0 054 mmol l respectively compared with no aeration condition the concentration of o2 increased by 8 12 times after the introduction of air fig 1c obviously trace oh appeared after air was introduced and the concentration of 1o2 was 9 96 times than that of oh in air atmosphere fig 1b and d subsequently a certain amount of n2 was introduced to adjust air atmosphere to explore the critical do concentration of oh generation when the do concentration was 0 172 mmol l the concentrations of o2 and 1o2 were 0 17 and 0 134 mmol l respectively while oh and h2o2 were almost undetectable fig 1e with the continuous supply of pure oxygen do concentration reached its maximum value 0 606 mmol l and the concentrations of oh o2 1o2 and h2o2 increased to 0 209 0 876 0 318 and 0 239 mmol l respectively compared with no aeration condition the concentration of o2 increased by 20 86 times after pure oxygen was introduced in addition as shown in fig 1f the concentrations of oh o2 1o2 and h2o2 in pure oxygen atmosphere were increased by 7 46 2 57 1 14 and 4 43 times respectively compared with exposure to air atmosphere the above results showed that only a small amount of o2 could be produced without aeration and no oh was detected in air atmosphere ros mainly consisted of o2 and 1o2 and a small quantity of oh when the do concentration was adjusted to 0 172 mmol l o2 was almost activated to o2 and 1o2 meanwhile if pure oxygen was introduced o2 tended to be converted into o2 and oh the amount of ros generated varies significantly in various gas environments indicating that the ros in the cucofe 300 system was mainly evolved from o2 nevertheless the o2 activation efficiency on cucofe ldh in air atmosphere or pure o2 atmosphere was almost the same supplementary fig s9 lower than that of cucofe 300 in air atmosphere or pure o2 atmosphere which might be attributed to the low content of active sites on cucofe ldh supplementary fig s1b electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra were further used to verify the changes of ros under different do concentrations chen et al 2022 only low dmpo o2 signal was found under no aeration condition supplementary fig s10 in addition the results of the aeration conditions were shown in fig 1g i in the air cucofe 300 system epr signal increased significantly especially dmpo o2 and temp 1o2 signals when adjusted the do content in the air atmosphere the dmpo oh signal was disappeared at this moment only the dmpo o2 and temp 1o2 signals were detected in the o2 cucofe 300 system the epr signal was further larger stronger than that of the air cucofe 300 system among them dmpo oh and dmpo o2 signals changed significantly with only a slight change on the temp 1o2 signal the results of epr tests were basically consistent with the quantitative analysis of ros in view of this the species and quantities of ros generation were indeed affected by the variation of do concentration taking the air atmosphere as an example the ability of cucofe 300 for activating o2 under room condition was described intuitively the content of 1o2 generated through activating o2 on cucofe 300 catalyst was more abundant than other oxidants and corresponding aops such as input of external energy or addition of strong oxidants supplementary table s1 xu et al 2022b zheng et al 2022 yang et al 2022 3 2 the relationship between cip degradation and ros the ability of cucofe 300 to activate o2 for ros generation was reflected by the degradation performance of cip as shown in supplementary fig s11 in terms of cip degradation performance cucofe 300 was superior to pristine cucofe ldh and cucofe ldh under other calcination temperatures 200 400 and 500 c demonstrating that the degradation of cip was positively correlated with the oxygen active sites content on the catalyst besides cip could not be self degraded under air or pure oxygen condition supplementary fig s12 and cucofe 300 was also difficult to activate o2 for the effective degradation of cip without aeration supplementary fig s13 in fig 2 a after the do concentration was increased to 0 231 mmol l by introducing air into the system the degradation efficiency of cip reaches 82 5 in pure oxygen environment the cip degradation efficiency was up to 90 0 however with a decline in do concentration in air atmosphere the degradation efficiency of cip was dropped to 60 7 which well confirmed the point that the cip degradation was closely related to the content of ros under different do concentration conditions in fig 2b all of cip degradation curves all fitted the same pseudo first order reaction kinetics model compared with the system without aeration the reaction rates k in air adjust air and pure oxygen atmosphere system were increased by 7 21 3 28 and 8 69 times respectively the k of o2 cucofe 300 system was 1 20 times higher than that of air cucofe 300 system although the degradation efficiency of cip in pure oxygen atmosphere was better than that in air atmosphere the increased reaction rate was far less prominent as the generation ratio of ros fig 1f for this purpose the mineralization rate of cip in air cucofe 300 and o2 cucofe 300 system was investigated fig 2c the mineralization rate of cip in o2 cucofe 300 system was 54 1 within 4 h which was significantly higher than that in air cucofe 300 system 35 5 the higher mineralization rate of cip was due to more oh generated in the o2 cucofe 300 system probably oh was more embedded to deeply minimize the cip liu et al 2021 the effects of environmental factors on the cip degradation by cucofe 300 for activating o2 were discussed such as ph coexisting anions and humic acid ha as shown in fig 2d air cucofe 300 exhibited excellent degradation performance on cip in a wide ph range 4 11 and the degradation rate was above 75 interestingly the degradation performance of cip in acidic conditions was slightly greater than that in alkaline conditions which might be relevant to the redox potential of o2 studies have shown that the redox potential of o2 o2 was higher in acidic conditions than that in alkaline environments which makes o2 easier to convert into o2 in acidic conditions nosaka and nosaka 2017 therefore the production of o2 at ph 4 and 11 was detected as shown in supplementary fig s14 the content of o2 in degradation process at ph 4 0 386 mmol l and ph 11 0 292 mmol l strengthened the idea that o2 plays an important role in the reaction system moreover a similar phenomenon existed in o2 cucofe 300 system supplementary fig s15 as shown in supplementary fig s16 since ph value higher than 8 35 the surface of the catalyst gradually became negative charge the distribution of positive charge at the active site on the cucofe 300 was influenced which was adverse to cip degradation in catalytic process co existing anions no3 cl h2po4 etc always react with oh to form weaker radicals affecting the degradation efficiency of pollutants luo et al 2019 gao et al 2020 as a proof of concept the degradation efficiency of cip was studied in air cucofe 300 system with different anions fig 2e encouragingly even when cl no3 so4 2 concentrations were up to 10 g l the cip degradation efficiency by the air cucofe 300 system remained at a high level approximately 78 6 as previously mentioned the air cucofe 300 system was dominated by o2 and 1o2 which ensures high degradation efficiency this phenomenon was particularly evident in the adjust air atmosphere ros that included only o2 and 1o2 supplementary fig s17 on the contrary the degradation performance of cip was greatly inhibited by h2po4 and hco3 ascribe to the reaction with o2 kifle et al 2022 yang et al 2019 proving that o2 was important in the air cucofe 300 system it was worth noting that the inhibition effect of h2po4 on cip degradation was stronger than that of hco3 which might be attributed to a higher reaction rate between h2po4 and o2 li et al 2022 due to the large amount of oh was generated in the o2 cucofe 300 system cip degradation efficiency was inhibited in high salt environments supplementary fig s18 furthermore degradation efficiency of cip was slightly inhibited by humic acid ha fig 2f which might be attributed to the competitive response of ros between ha and cip xiong et al 2021 not only that the cip degradation experiments showed that air cucofe 300 system has good adaptability in various water environments supplementary fig s19 the treatment performance of the air cucofe 300 system was conducted on secondary effluent from the local pharmaceutical factory cod 1870 mg l and the chloride salt concentration 40 g l after 24 h the cod removal rate of organic wastewater was almost 48 4 which has good applicability supplementary fig s20 in addition the test results showed that the metal ion leaching of catalyst did not exceed environmental safety limits supplementary fig s21 from the perspective of energy consumption and treatment efficiency air cucofe 300 system superior to the traditional aops which demonstrated a good applicability in actual refractory organic wastewater treatment 3 3 transformation pathway identification of ros to further identify the main ros and explore the mechanism of o2 activation by cucofe 300 the quenching test of active species were carried out with specific scavengers in the air cucofe 300 system fig 3 a the reaction process was slightly inhibited by tert butanol tba oh scavenger zhu et al 2018 indicating that oh was not an important ros in the system azide 20 mm as a quencher of 1o2 huang et al 2019 greatly inhibited the degradation of cip in the air cucofe 300 system the cip degradation efficiency decreased to 31 3 which demonstrated that 1o2 was the primary ros besides in order to verify the optimum concentration of quencher the inhibitory effect of various azide concentrations on cip degradation was tested as shown in supplementary fig s22 20 mm azide was sufficient to inhibit 1o2 in the reaction system when benzoquinone bq o2 scavenger was added guo et al 2016 the degradation efficiency of cip decreased to 37 5 proving that o2 has a significant effect on cip degradation conversely it was generally believed that the o2 with low redox potential was insufficient to react with cip in aqueous solution hayyan et al 2016 to explain the phenomenon in our study azide and bq were added in the air cucofe 300 system simultaneously the inhibition degreed was nearly identical to the situation that azide existed in system alone that is the o2 actually as precursor of 1o2 but not directly reacted with cip furthermore cr2o7 2 as an electron quencher also obviously restrained the degradation of cip zhou et al 2021 which mean that the conversion from o2 to ros was an electron transfer process the pathways of o2 to o2 and 1o2 were cut off by quenching electrons and which eventually lead to cip degradation was obstructed in the pure o2 atmosphere fig 3b the degradation efficiency of cip was strongly influence by tba and azide than that when the tba or azide was tested alone which confirmed that both oh and 1o2 were the main ros in the o2 cucofe 300 system moreover the inhibition effect of tba was a little higher than that of azide although the amount of 1o2 formed in the o2 cucofe 300 system was more than oh the oxidation ability of oh was stronger than 1o2 which reflected the dominance of oh in the pure o2 atmosphere the cip adsorption performance on cucofe 300 in both air atmosphere and pure o2 atmosphere were about 22 when the catalytic reaction process was totally inhibited by azide and tba also the inhibition phenomenon appeared after bq and cr2o7 2 were introduced indicating that the conversion of ros in the o2 cucofe 300 system was also an electron transfer process epr technology was used to detect the formation and transition paths of ros as shown in fig 3c the signals intensity of the temp 1o2 adducts was sharply reduced with the addition of bq whether in the air cucofe 300 system or o2 cucofe 300 system which demonstrated convincingly that o2 was an important precursor of 1o2 beside because o2 was not of course the only precursor of 1o2 in the complex catalytic reaction process and which was part of the reason that the diffraction signals of temp 1o2 adducts remained weak after bq was added further proved that the inhibitory effect of azide was superior to that of bq combined quenching experiment the formation steps of 1o2 were proposed in eqs 1 2 the signals intensity of dmpo oh adducts was also severely weakened when bq or horseradish peroxidase hrp h2o2 quencher was added in o2 cucofe 300 system fig 3d demonstrating that both o2 and h2o2 were precursors of oh wang et al 2020b wu et al 2020 meanwhile with the addition of bq the h2o2 content decreased from 0 239 to 0 029 mmol l in the o2 cucofe 300 system which mean that o2 was an important precursor not just for the 1o2 but also for the h2o2 supplementary fig s23 eqs 3 4 1 o 2 e o 2 2 o 2 1 o 2 e 3 o 2 e 2 h h 2 o 2 4 h 2 o 2 e oh o h dft was used to explain the reason why o2 was the precursor of other ros and with the highest content in the cucofe 300 system based on the sensitivity of the active sites to oxygen the charge transfer of the active sites in the cucofe 300 model was predicted by charge density difference as shown in fig 3e the ovs was a defect structure with positive charge and the electron originated from the ovs on cucofe 300 an obvious electron accumulation and depletion process was observed on active sites the electrons were transferred from neighboring area to the metal oxygen bonding region leading to strong electronic perturbations around the active sites on cucofe 300 which provided the essential conditions for the conversion from o2 to o2 referring to fig 3f the single active site was constructed by removing an oxygen atom from the surface of cucofe 300 and optimized to the ground state as shown in supplementary fig s24 o2 was adsorbed on the active site and then activated the o o bond length of oxygen molecules was stretched from 1 209 å to 1 26 å which was exactly equal to the theoretical length of o2 1 26 å in summary after receiving electrons the o2 was transferred to o2 and released subsequently the o2 was further converted to 1o2 or oh with the increase of do concentration owing to the strong oxidizing properties of 1o2 and oh the degradation performance and mineralization rate of cip were satisfactory in the cucofe 300 system 3 4 the influencing of do concentration on the transformation of ros considering that the ros content was closely related to the do concentration in the cucofe 300 system hereby the generation and conversion mechanism of ros was identified by establishing the dft model and functional relationship of active sites utilization and do concentration particularly the active sites utilization represents the proportion of active sites participating in the catalytic reaction details of the equations were shown in text s4 and supplementary fig s25 in fig 4 a the active sites utilization was 37 28 without oh generation in the adjust air cucofe 300 system with the increase of do concentration the active sites utilization was increased to 77 91 in the air cucofe 300 system and the generation quantity of ros was significantly higher than that of the adjust air cucofe 300 system and a certain amount of oh was generated as the utilization rate approached 100 0 the oh concentration significantly increased in the o2 cucofe 300 system this was attributed to the fact that the active sites act as an electron donor and undergoes a slow electron transfer process in low utilization state the o2 was activated to o2 and cannot get enough electrons to convert into h2o2 resulting in a large amount of 1o2 to be generated o2 o2 1o2 after the pure o2 was introduced in the system the increasing do concentrations promotes the increase of active sites utilization more and more electron donors participate in the reaction effectively accelerate the electron transfer process which prompt o2 to gain electrons and convert to h2o2 thus forming oh o2 o2 h2o2 oh the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was usually used to evaluate the electron transfer ability of catalyst in the fig 4b the electron transport capacity on the cucofe 300 surface was improved with the increasing of do concentration the inner ring radius was 35 1 ω in the pure o2 atmosphere which was significantly lower than that of the air atmosphere 84 7 ω and adjust air atmosphere 119 6 ω respectively indicating that the electrons on the cucofe 300 surface were easier to transform and migrate in the pure o2 atmosphere dft calculations were used to further corroborate the phenomena fig 4c the growing do concentration enhances the chemical potential of the reaction system which makes the conversion of o2 to 1o2 was easier with a lower energy barrier and the conversion of o2 to h2o2 was also accelerated by its higher free energy this was consistent with the phenomenon of higher ros concentration in pure o2 atmosphere in fact the conversion of o2 to h2o2 and oh was more advantageous than the conversion of o2 to 1o2 in thermodynamics under the premise of high active sites utilization and electron donor involved in the reaction and this was also the reason why ros was transformed by regulating do concentration it should be noted that the release energy of active sites was 2 89 ev supplementary fig s24 which far exceeded the energy needed by the conversion from o2 to 1o2 2 48 ev thus satisfies the large generation of 1o2 owing to the energy losses on the active site may cause the deactivation of the active center on the catalyst which impacts the cycle life therefore the cycle performance of cucofe 300 under air and pure o2 atmosphere was studied overall based on the appropriate active sites utilization the cip degradation was maintained a high capacity in the air cucofe 300 system after multiple cycles fig 5 the degradation efficiency decreased after the 6th and 9th cycles due to the filling of active sites with o2 but more than 90 of the catalytic activity could be recovered by re calcination 300 c 1 h which attributed to the energy recovery in active sites the o2 covered in the active sites were activated and the active sites were able to expose again although the high active sites utilization leads to higher cip mineralization in the o2 cucofe 300 system the cucofe 300 was prone to deactivation supplementary fig s26 in comparison the air cucofe 300 system was more suitable for the actual wastewater treatment furthermore the energy consumption of the air cucofe 300 system was evaluated by electric energy per order of pollutant removal ee o and the corresponding were attached in fig 5 more detailed descriptions in the text s5 and supplementary table s2 the ee o of the air cucofe 300 system was 0 010 kwh l 1 and the total ee o of five cycles was 0 080 kwh l 1 at room condition compared with most of advanced oxidation technologies that reported before table 1 our study proposed a novel aops technological system with low energy consumption and no chemical additives for degrading refractory organics efficiently through the combination of cucofe 300 catalyst and do which has an extensive application prospects in water pollution control 3 5 safe degradation of ciprofloxacin the intermediates of cip were analyzed by ultrafast liquid chromatography mass spectrometer lc ms technique to better evaluate the safe degradation pathway of cip by cucofe 300 in the o2 cucofe 300 system air cucofe 300 system and adjust air cucofe 300 system a total of 17 possible structures and mass to charge ratios m z were detected listed in supplementary fig s27 the fig 2 has already shown that the main ros in the adjust air cucofe 300 system was 1o2 while 1o2 and oh coexist in the o2 cucofe 300 system so the intermediate products under the attack of 1o2 or oh could be well distinguished moreover the bond breaking and the location of reaction sites of cip were further confirmed by dft calculation supplementary fig s28 the piperazine ring and c f bond were the main attack sites of 1o2 and the degradation process of cip were planned in the air cucofe 300 system and adjust air cucofe 300 system respectively supplementary figs s29 s30 most importantly the attack products of 1o2 and oh were separated in the pure o2 atmosphere and there might be three types of cip degradation pathways fig 6 in pathway i the c atom on the piperazine ring was attacked by 1o2 and undergone a ring opening reaction to form p1 m z 362 and p2 m z 334 and subsequently oxidized by 1o2 to form p3 m z 306 and p4 m z 292 in the next step the n h bond on the piperazine ring structure of p4 was attacked by 1o2 to form n o bond leading to form p5 m z 293 structure and further defluorinated to form p6 m z 275 in addition the no bond on p5 could also be attacked by oh to form p9 m z 263 in pathway ii the c atom on the piperazine ring was attacked by oh and became p7 m z 348 and p8 m z 364 and further ring opened to form p9 the c o bond and cc bond on p9 were jointly attacked by oh and 1o2 and then converted to p10 m z 227 finally p10 was oxidized to p16 m z 168 with small molecular weight in pathway iii the first oxidation reaction occurred on the c f bond which was oxidized to the c o h bond and formed p11 m z 330 then the c o h bond was removed forming p12 m z 313 after that p13 m z 304 p14 m z 288 p15 m z 175 and p16 were formed successively under the attack of oh finally both intermediates p6 and p16 were oxidized to co2 and h2o besides the toxicity of intermediates during cip degradation process was evaluated specifically the ecological structure activity relationship ecosar was used to evaluate the acute and chronic toxicity of cip intermediates on three trophic levels of aquatic organisms including fish daphnia and green algae liang et al 2022 the corresponding concentrations were listed in supplementary table s3 taking the acute toxicity test on daphnia lc50 as an example supplementary supplementary fig s31 in the ecotoxicity tests 12 of the 16 intermediate products were identified as nontoxic and only the intermediates p9 p10 p15 and p16 were identified as low toxic in addition the ecotoxicity of 1o2 attacked products p1 p6 were nontoxic and ecotoxicity was lower than cip and oh attacked products combined with the above research results the attack products of 1o2 with nontoxic but 1o2 dominated reaction would hardly to achieve effective mineralization rate of cip the introduction of oh can effectively improve the mineralization rate but increase the ecotoxicity of water bodies therefore from the perspective of harmless degradation of cip air was introduced into cucofe 300 system first to form many 1o2 attacked products and then a certain amount of o2 was introduced to form oh to pursue a higher cip mineralization rate with accompanied by the formation of nontoxic products such as p7 p8 and p11 supplementary supplementary fig s32 this method provided an important reference for the safe degradation of refractory organics in wastewater treatment 4 conclusion in summary the improvement of active sites utilization directly affects the participation of electron donors and facilitates the electron transfer efficiency on the catalyst surface thereby changing the relationship between electron gain and loss and further affecting the transfer process of ros it is also the reason that the cucofe 300 catalyst can effectively activate o2 to generate abundant ros at room conditions and the types and quantities of ros can be transformed directionally by adjusting the do concentration therefore a safe degradation process of cip can be achieved via controlling the transformation pathway of ros this study provides an extremely flexible low energy consumption and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment method for refractory organic compounds in a new perspective supplementary materials supplementary material associated with this article can be found in the online

14987,anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox offered an energy efficient option for nitrogen removal from wastewater granular activated carbon gac addition has been reported that improved biomass immobilization but the role of gac in anammox reactors has not been sufficiently revealed in this study it was observed that gac addition in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor led to the significantly shortened anammox enrichment time shortened by 45 days than the reactor without gac addition the nitrogen removal rate was 0 83 kg n m3 day versus 0 76 kg n m3 day in gac and non gac reactors respectively after 255 days operation acyl homoserine lactone ahl quorum sensing signal molecule c8 hsl had comparable concentrations in both anammox reactors whereas the signal molecule c12 hsl was more pervasive in the reactor containing gac than the reactor without gac microbial analysis revealed distinct anammox development in both reactors with candidatus brocadia predominant in the reactor that did not contain gac and candidatus kuenenia predominant in the reactor that contained gac denitrification bacteria likely supported anammox metabolism in both reactors the analyses of microbial functions suggested that ahl dependent quorum sensing was enhanced with the addition of gac and that gac possibly augmented the extracellular electron transfer eet dependent anammox reaction graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox extracellular electron transfer granular activated carbon microbial cross feeding quorum sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen removal from wastewater is critical to maintaining a healthy ecosystem kończak and huber 2022 compared to conventional energy intensive nitrification denitrification processes treatments with anammox require less oxygen and no organic carbon source cao et al 2019 however the low growth rate and high sensitivity to the environment of anammox bacteria pose challenges in engineering applications of the anammox process wang et al 2022 anammox start up requires a long duration especially when anammox seed is not provided the retention and adaptation of anammox bacteria to the ambient environment is critical for effective applications of anammox it has been reported that the addition of granular activated carbon gac can facilitate anammox reactor start up and enhance nitrogen removal performance because their high specific surface area and hydrophobicity favour anammox biofilm colonization adams et al 2020 s yang et al 2021 w zhang et al 2015 gu et al 2020 reported that the gac packed anammox moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr achieved a 0 4 kg n m3 day total nitrogen removal rate nrr in 60 days which outcompeted the performance of mbbrs packed with nonwoven fabrics plastic and polyurethane sponge carriers liang et al 2022 found that gac addition promoted re granulation of the disintegrated anammox hydroxyapatite sludge at low phosphate condition which ensured an effective nitrogen removal of 88 at a nrr of 8 5 kg n m3 day similarly zhang et al 2015 utilized gac as nucleus and achieved fast granulation of anammox sludge within only 38 days in an anammox expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor however the underlying mechanisms of gac in anammox development may have been overlooked for instance gac addition might induce distinct niche for the survival and enrichment of anammox bacteria y yang et al 2021 the microenvironment and the prolonged biomass retention of gac biofilm might enable complex nitrogen cycles microbial cross feeding in which one species lives off the metabolic products of another species in the anammox community has been shown to increase bacterial growth zhao et al 2018 in addition quorum sensing qs a system by which bacteria regulate cell population density in accordance with molecular communication between cells has been associated with anammox development microbial communication regulated by qs signal molecules such as acyl homoserine lactone ahl bis 3 5 cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate c di gmp and diffusible signal factor dsf have been reported in anammox bioreactors guo et al 2021 tang et al 2018a the ahl dependent quorum sensing was reported to promote the microbial aggregations biofilm formation and activities and excretion of redox substances e g c type cytochrome flavin liu et al 2022 the synthesis and degradation of qs molecules could be affected by exogenous additives e g the addition of nano zero valent iron nzvi improved the c di gmp synthesis facilitated the formation of sludge particles and improved the nitrogen removal efficiency in an anammox bioreactor wang et al 2021 recently extracellular electron transfer has been observed in anammox bacterial communities shaw et al 2020 xu et al 2022 demonstrated that biochar addition in an anammox system improved nitrogen removal and electron transfer capability that was mediated by redox extracellular polymeric substances eps until now the above mentioned mechanisms in gac amended anammox systems remain largely uninvestigated the present study was carried out with two uasb reactors with one reactor supplemented with gac and one without the objective of this work is to explore the fundamental mechanisms associated with gac addition during anammox reactor start up our research focus encompassed gac induced nitrogen metabolism quorum sensing microbial community dynamics and extracellular electron transfer in anammox development 2 materials and methods 2 1

began could be due to the intensive cell lysis that occurred when microbes shifted from heterotrophic to autotrophic metabolism and the cod supported heterotrophic growth that competed with anammox adams et al 2020 chamchoi and nitisoravut 2007 chen et al 2012 nh4 n concentrations were higher in the effluent 52 9 2 0 mg l than in the influent 50 0 1 3 mg l in the lag phase fig 1a no2 n removal

sharp decreases in effluent nh4 n concentrations during this phase influent nh4 n concentrations were maintained at 50 mg l and no2 n increased from 50 mg l to 60 mg l effluent concentrations of nh4 n 3 5 mg l no2 n 0 9 mg l and 9 5 mg l no3 n were achieved at the end of the propagation phase on day 195 which correspondingly generated nh4 n no2 n and total n removal efficiencies of 93 1 98 4 and 87

elevation phase day 196 255 in r1 and the influent nh4 n and no2 n concentrations increased from 50 mg l to 198 mg l and from 60 mg l to 240 mg l respectively effluent nh4 n and no2 n concentrations were 0 15 5 mg l and 0 13 5 mg l respectively during this time no3 n concentrations increased with increasing n removal and reached 40 7 0 3 mg l when the influent nh4 n concentration reached 198 mg l at the end of r1 operation the total nlr reached 0 88 0 00 kg n m3 day the total nrr reached 0 76 0 01 kg n m3 day and nh4 n no2 n and total n removal efficiencies were 94 3 1 7 95 2 0 4 and 85 9 0 8 respectively fig 1c and 1f it was noticed that the nh4 n removal began when soluble cod concentrations in the effluent attributed to cell debris and cell metabolites decreased to 0 7 mg l fig 1e this might correspond to an anammox suitable environment with less competition from heterotrophs throughout the anammox start up process the ph of the effluent 7 3 0 2 7 7 0 3 was higher than the influent 6 9 0 2 table 1 due first to the denitrification and then to the anammox reactions the δ no₂ n δ nh₄ n ratio and the δ no3 n δ nh₄ n ratio was 1 16 1 36 and 0 19 0 24 respectively in the nlr elevation phase these ratios are comparable with reported values strous et al 1998 zhang et al 2010 3 1 2 nitrogen dynamics in the reactor with gac the lag phase lasted for 112 days in r2 with gac addition as shown in fig 1b and 1d only no2 n removal was observed and nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations in the r2 effluent showed trends similar to the trends observed in r1 during the lag phase nh4 n removal was first observed on day 113 nh4 n no2 n and total n removal efficiencies reached 92 98 6 and 87 9 with effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations of 4 mg l 0 9 mg l and 9 1 mg l respectively on day 136 at the end of the propagation phase nlrs were 0 2 0 23 kg n m3 day during the first two operational phases and the nrr reached 0 2 kg n m3 day at the end of the propagation phase from day 137 to day 255 influent nh4 n concentrations increased from 50 mg l to 220 mg l no2 n concentrations increased from 60 mg l to 268 mg l effluent nh4 n and no2 n concentrations were 0 26 mg l and 0 5 19 5

12 mg l fig 1e the influent ph was 6 8 0 2 7 0 0 2 and the effluent ph was 7 3 0 2 7 9 0 2 table 1 the ratios of δ no₂ n δ nh₄ n and δ no3 n δ nh₄ n were 1 14 1 36 and 0 18 0 23 respectively during the nlr elevation phase in r2 table 1 as compared to r1 the anammox start up lag phase was shortened by 45 days and the propagation phase was shortened by 14 days in r2 with gac addition it took 255 days for r1 and 173 days for r2 to reach a nrr of 0 76 kg n m3 day 3 2 quorum sensing during anammox development with and without gac evidence showed qs regulates the growth activities and phenotypes of anammox bacteria and ahl dependent qs systems promote anammox liu et al 2020 q zhang et al 2021 to investigate the impact of gac addition on the ahl dependent qs system ahl molecules in the water phases of r1 no gac and r2 with gac were analyzed fig 2 shows that both reactors contained high numbers of the qs molecule c8 hsl r1 effluent contained 3 62 ng l and r2 effluent contained 3 43 ng l the qs molecule c12 hsl was detected at 2 46 ng l in r2 with gac and 0 14 ng l in r1 no gac c10 hsl at 0 11 ng l was exclusively detected in r2 and 3o c10 hsl at 0 07 ng l was exclusively detected in r1 c6 hsl was not found in either reactor other qs molecules detected including c4 hsl c14 hsl 3o c6 hsl 3o c8 hsl 3o c12 hsl and 3o c14 hsl showed relatively comparable concentrations below 0 5 ng l in two reactors positive correlations of the qs molecules c8 hsl and c12 hsl with anammox activities or growth have been detected in other studies de clippeleir et al 2011 tang et al 2018b as the concentrations of signal molecules are cell density dependent shi et al 2022 the higher concentrations of c8 hsl and c12 hsl in r2 compared to the other qs molecules at the end of reactor operation might be a consequence of the presence of gac each type of signal molecule might control anammox differently the occurrence of c8 hsl in both reactors and the exclusively high c12 hsl excretion in the gac amended reactor probably indicate that c8 hsl and c12 hsl have different ecological niches zhao et al 2021 the molecular communication between cells in the quorum sensing system might contribute to the regulation of microbial cross feeding y feng et al 2019 guo et al 2021 overall the results indicated that gac impacted the qs dependent microbial communications during anammox and might have contributed to a faster anammox enrichment 3 3 microbial community development during anammox start up with and without gac 3 3 1 microbial development at the phylum level the microbial community structures at the phylum level in the suspended sludge from r1 no gac and r2 with gac and the gac biofilm from r2 are shown in fig 3 a bacteria from the phylum planctomycetes proteobacteria and chloroflexi were predominant in all anammox samples regardless of their different spatial locations planctomycetes accounted for 3 0 in the seed sludge 39 7 and 38 2 in r1 sludge 1 and 2 46 6 and 46 6 in r2 sludge 1 and 2 and 35 4 and 33 8 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 after 255 days of anammox enrichment proteobacteria accounted for 14 8 in the seed sludge 26 7 and 27 6 in r1 sludge 1 and 2 8 0 and 7 9 in r2 sludge 1 and 2 and 39 8 and 39 6 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 respectively chloroflexi was enriched from 1 7 in the seed sludge to 8 7 and 9 0 in r1 sludge 1 and 2 40 8 and 41 3 in r2 sludge 1 and 2 and 21 2 and 22 2 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 proteobacteria and chloroflexi include denitrification and heterotrophic bacteria and they have been commonly reported in anammox systems zhang et al 2018 with no organic carbon source in the influent heterotrophic bacteria in anammox systems can utilize organic substances from cell debris and soluble microbial products xing et al 2008 the reduction of nitrate to nitrite and the cross feeding among microbes can support anammox growth lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 microorganisms from gemmatimonadetes 5 0 and 4 7 in r1 sludge 1 and 2 were enriched in r1 and were reported related to denitrification han et al 2021 3 3 2 microbial development at the genus level to get a deeper understanding of the microbial development as anammox is getting underway with and without gac addition microbial community compositions at genus level were discussed and the top 35 abundant genera were shown in fig 3b r1 and r2 showed remarkable discrepancies in the microbial structure no microbial genera that take part in anammox were identified in the seed sludge community yet they were the most abundant genera in all samples collected at the end of reactor operation bacteria from order subdivision3 genera incertae sedis and genera mesotoga aminivibrio inmirania and vulgatibacteraceae dominated the microbial community in the seed sludge 3 3 2 1 microbial genera affiliated with anammox two microbial genera that take part in anammox candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were enriched in the current study in r1 no gac candidatus brocadia was the predominant microbe with relative abundances of 37 3 and 35 5 in sludge 1 and 2 respectively candidatus kuenenia accounted for only 1 8 and 2 in sludge 1 and 2 an adverse condition was observed in r2 with gac where candidatus kuenenia accounted for 44 1 and 44 2 in sludge 1 and 2 respectively and 31 7 and 30 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 respectively candidatus brocadia accounted for only 2 3 in r2 sludge samples and 3 4 and 3 8 in gac biofilm samples 1 and 2 respectively although candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia are commonly observed in anammox systems they have different physiological properties oshiki et al 2016b according to r k selection theory candidatus brocadia has a low substrate affinity that can develop quickly at high substrate concentrations kang et al 2019 liu et al 2017 oshiki et al 2016b candidatus kuenenia shows a high affinity for substrates that enables it to grow at low n concentrations kang et al 2019 liu et al 2017 oshiki et al 2016b providing high competitiveness with the syntrophic growth of denitrification bacteria the significantly different microbial communities in r1 and r2 might have been triggered by the addition of gac although the gac adsorption of organics induced less competition from heterotrophic bacteria in bulk solution enabling better anammox development the presence of gac induced the formation of biofilm that could favor candidatus kuenenia growth under the substrate limited condition at the beginning of reactor operation peng et al 2022 3 3 2 2 microbial genera affiliated with denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra in addition to anammox other microbial groups also showed considerable differences various types of denitrification bacteria were developed in r1 while relatively unitarily dominant groups were developed in r2 samples in r1 genera propionivibrio 8 6 and 8 4 in sludge 1 and 2 bellilinea 4 in sludge 1 and 2 ornatilinea 3 1 and 3 2 in sludge 1 and 2 and ignavibacterium 1 7 and 1 8 in sludge 1 and 2 were reported as heterotrophic denitrification or dnra bacteria he et al 2021 hou et al 2022 lianfu liang et al 2022 van den berg et al 2017a in addition in r1 the genera thermomonas 3 and 3 1 in sludge 1 and 2 sulfurisoma 3 1 and 3 in sludge 1 and 2 sulfuritalea 1 9 and 2 in sludge 1 and 2 and thiobacillus 1 8 and 2 in sludge 1 and 2 have been reported as autotrophic denitrifying bacteria that utilize sulfur or h2 as electron donors for no3 reduction carboni et al 2021 k li et al 2019 ucar et al 2020 xia et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 k zhang et al 2020 l zhang et al 2015 in r2 the genus ornatilinea was dominant at 38 7 and 39 6 in r2 sludge 1 and 2 and at 20 4 and 21 4 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 respectively during anammox enrichment with limited organic carbon source from the surrounding environment bacteria in the genus ornatilinea were likely to convert nitrate to nitrite and the produced nitrite would promote anammox xiao et al 2021 ornatilinea is also recognized as a filamentous bacterium which could contribute to biofilm structures sui et al 2020 sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob have been involved in sulfur driven denitrification deng et al 2019 bacteria in the genus sulfuritalea had abundances of 28 and 26 6 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 sulfuritalea has been identified as a core denitrifying bacterium in wastewater treatment plants performing sulfur based autotrophic denitrification de almeida fernandes et al 2018 mcilroy et al 2016 other enriched genera such as propionivibrio 4 3 and 4 2 in r2 sludge 1 and 2 1 1 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 bellilinea 1 5 and 1 3 in r2 sludge 1 and 2 0 6 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 limnobacter 0 4 and 0 5 in r2 sludge 1 and 2 1 1 and 1 3 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 and comamonas 0 2 in r2 sludge 1 and 2 1 1 and 1 2 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 might have also contributed to denitrification during anammox development van den berg et al 2017b wang et al 2018 yuan et al 2021 limnobacter like sulfuritalea could metabolize sulfur and nitrate in the anammox system xu et al 2020 3 3 2 3 electroactive genera with the presence of the conductive gac extracellular electron transfer eet could have participated in the development of microbial populations and the anammox reaction in r2 candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis and candidatus brocadia are electroactive and could transfer electrons to insoluble extracellular electron acceptors i e electrode and graphene oxide shaw et al 2020 sulfuritalea abundant in the biofilm of the reactor that contained gac has been reported to be enriched on the electrodes in electrochemical membrane bioreactors and microbial fuel cells mfc ma et al 2015 wan et al 2021 comamonas was abundant at 1 1 and 1 2 in gac biofilm microbial communities comamonas a genus of proteobacteria are denitrifying bacteria capable of generating electricity in mfc reactors xing et al 2010 bacteria from the genus rhodopseudomonas with relative abundances of 0 9 and 1 in the gac biofilm have been reported to be electroactive and capable of utilizing nitrate as an electron acceptor to fix co2 and to generate atp under dark conditions via eet liu et al 2021 3 3 3 impact of gac on microbial dynamics alpha diversity mean species diversity metrics chao1 shannon and simpson were evaluated to compare microbial richness and diversity among r1 and r2 anammox samples in fig 3c chao1 represents microbial community richness and shannon and simpson indexes represent microbial community diversity compared with seed sludge samples collected at the end of reactor operation showed lower microbial richness and diversity this could be due to the selection of ecological adaptive populations within the anammox feedstock r2 sludge and gac biofilm samples showed lower richness and diversity compared to r1 sludge samples and r2 sludge samples showed the least diversity among all samples 3 4 microbial functions in r1 and r2 to gain insights into the impact of gac addition on metagenomes of anammox sludge the metabolic functional genes related to nitrogen metabolism sulfur oxidation extracellular electron transfer quorum sensing co2 fixation and microbial cross feeding are discussed fig 4 3 4 1 nitrogen metabolism genes of core enzymes hydrazine synthase hzs and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh that catalyze anammox were not identified due to the lack of a kegg annotation guide it was observed that hao hydroxylamine dehydrogenase was enriched in r1 and r2 previous metagenome studies suggested that hao could play a critical role in anammox hao was proposed to participate in no2 reduction and the oxidation of hydrazine n2h4 to n2 z feng et al 2019 oshiki et al 2016a sun et al 2018 yang et al 2020 the highest relative abundances of hao genes were observed in r2 sludge samples which had the highest anammox activity previous isotope 15n labelling tests identified hydroxylamine as an intermediate in an electrode dependent anammox reaction shaw 2020 hydroxylamine could also be an intermediate in the current anammox systems nitrite reductase genes nirs and nirk were identified in both reactors yang et al 2020 the nirs and nirk gene abundances in gac biofilm samples were relatively higher than the nirs and nirk gene abundances in r2 sludge samples this might be related to denitrification in the gac biofilm nitrate reductase genes narghi and napab are responsible for nitrate reduction to nitrite in denitrification and dnra relatively higher relative abundances of narghi genes were observed in gac biofilm samples powder activated carbon has been reported to stimulate the growth of denitrifiers in denitrification anammox systems ge et al 2018 nitric oxide reductase norbc and nitrous oxide reductase nosz genes related to denitrification and the nh4 forming nitrite reductase nrfah gene related to dnra showed relatively low abundances 3 4 2 sulfur oxidation the sulfur oxidizing bacteria identified in r1 and r2 section 3 3 suggest the presence of sulfur based autotrophic denitrification where sulfide sulfur or thiosulfate can act as an electron donor for nitrogen removal zhang et al 2020 cysteine synthase cysk adenylylsulfate reductase aprab genes showed high relative abundances in r1 sludge and higher relative abundances in r2 sludge sulfate adenylyltransferase sat sulfur oxidizing genes sox heterodisulfide reductase hdr and sulfide quinone reductase sqr genes for sulfur oxidation had higher relative abundances in r1 sludge than in r2 sludge thus sulfur metabolism might have contributed to denitrification during anammox development pang and wang 2021 3 4 3 extracellular electron transfer eet in anammox systems was considered mediated by c type cytochrome shaw et al 2020 biochar addition has been shown to enhance anammox and to increase the redox active eps components that mediate eet in anammox xu et al 2022 in the current study genes encoding c type cytochrome showed relative abundances with the sequence of r2 gac biofilm r1 sludge r2 sludge from previous experiences and the current results it is speculated that gac induced eet dependent anammox happened in r2 with c type cytochrome as the electron mediator and it is also possible that gac as a conductive material directly served as an electron conductor 3 4 4 quorum sensing multiple types of qs molecules synthesis genes were analyzed including luxi and hdts for ahl cqsa for cholera autoinducer 1 cai 1 dgc for second messenger bis 3 5 cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate c di gmp luxs for autoinducer 2 ai 2 and rpff for diffusible signal factor dsf tang et al 2018a from the results hdts genes showed overall higher relative abundances and a sequence of r2 sludge r2 gac biofilm r1 sludge of the hdts genes relative abundances was observed previous studies found that hdts genes were mainly responsible for microbial communications in anammox systems they were positively correlated with nrr tang et al 2018a and they were harbored by ca kuenenia and ca brocadia t zhang et al 2020 a relatively higher abundance of luxi genes related to denitrification tang et al 2018a was observed in gac biofilm samples dgc genes had the second highest relative abundance in all samples c di gmp could have regulated eps for biofilm formation and sludge aggregation hengge 2009 the other qs genes cqsa rpff luxs showed limited relative abundances our results suggest that the ahl dependent qs system played an important role in anammox development and gac addition might have improved the synthesis of ahl signal molecules zhao et al 2021 3 4 5 co2 fixation and microbial cross feeding some secondary metabolites are essential to biological processes and microbial cross feeding of these metabolites could have benefited anammox development lawson et al 2017 molybdopterin cofactor moco and folate are essential cofactors in co2 fixation in bacteria exogenous moco and folate were supplied by proteobacteria and armatimonadetes affiliated bacteria to anammox zhao et al 2018 in the current work higher relative abundances of co2 fixation related genes formate dehydrogenases fdha formate tetrahydrofolate ligase fhs and anaerobic carbon monoxide dehydrogenase coos folate synthesis gene dihydrofolate synthase folc moco synthesis gene molybdopterin molybdotransferase moea were observed in r2 sludge consistent with the higher anammox relative abundances the co2 fixation gene methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase fold the folate synthesis gene dihydrofolate reductase fola and the moco synthesis gene molybdopterin adenylyltransferase moga showed the lowest relative gene abundances in the r2 sludge this finding is supported by previous studies in which an abundance of fold fola and moga required support from an exogenously microbial cross feeding of moco and folate zhou et al 2020 3 5 proposed mechanisms the current results demonstrate that gac addition shortened the time to develop anammox in a uasb reactor from anaerobic digestion sludge with no detectable anammox activity as seed sludge with the same operation duration the nrr in a uasb reactor with gac addition was higher than nrr in a uasb reactor without gac results from the current work supported the conclusions that gac could improve anammox performance under stressful conditions and promote full scale applications we propose the impacts of gac on anammox development included the following aspects fig 5 i gac provided distinct ecological niches in gac biofilm and bulk environment for anammox development which could broaden its applications in engineering systems ii gac enhanced metabolic networks between anammox and other microbes i e denitrification and heterotrophic bacteria which could benefit anammox enrichment in simultaneous partial nitrification anammox denitrification processes iii gac impacted microbial communications via quorum sensing mainly ahl and c di gmp dependent qs which regulated anammox growth and mechanical structures iv gac enabled eet dependent anammox providing multiple options for ammonium removal with electron acceptors other than nitrite the observed impacts derived by gac addition underlines the important role of gac in the wide engineering applications of anammox which can be integrated into future design of anammox driven nitrogen removal in both engineered and natural systems the shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing can be applied in future studies to construct the genomic view of gac induced metabolic pathways in the anammox incorporated nitrogen cycles 4 conclusion anammox was enhanced with the addition of gac in the treatment of synthetic wastewater anammox began at 113 days of reactor operation in the reactor containing gac and at 158 days in a control reactor without gac the nrr reached 0 83 kg n m3 day in the reactor with gac and 0 76 kg n m3 day in the reactor without gac after 255 days operation the ahl dependent qs molecule c8 hsl showed comparable concentrations in both reactors while the reactor containing gac contained a higher level of c12 hsl molecules 2 46 ng l candidatus brocadia were predominant in the non gac reactor and candidatus kuenenia were predominant in the reactor containing gac heterotrophic denitrification and sulfur based autotrophic denitrification developed simultaneously with anammox ahl dependent quorum sensing microbial cross feeding of substrates and the essential cofactors molybdopterin cofactor moco and folate in co2 fixation in bacteria possibly contributed to an enhanced anammox development in the reactor amended with gac anammox could have been augmented by the extracellular electron transfer that would be enabled with gac addition

14987,anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox offered an energy efficient option for nitrogen removal from wastewater granular activated carbon gac addition has been reported that improved biomass immobilization but the role of gac in anammox reactors has not been sufficiently revealed in this study it was observed that gac addition in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor led to the significantly shortened anammox enrichment time shortened by 45 days than the reactor without gac addition the nitrogen removal rate was 0 83 kg n m3 day versus 0 76 kg n m3 day in gac and non gac reactors respectively after 255 days operation acyl homoserine lactone ahl quorum sensing signal molecule c8 hsl had comparable concentrations in both anammox reactors whereas the signal molecule c12 hsl was more pervasive in the reactor containing gac than the reactor without gac microbial analysis revealed distinct anammox development in both reactors with candidatus brocadia predominant in the reactor that did not contain gac and candidatus kuenenia predominant in the reactor that contained gac denitrification bacteria likely supported anammox metabolism in both reactors the analyses of microbial functions suggested that ahl dependent quorum sensing was enhanced with the addition of gac and that gac possibly augmented the extracellular electron transfer eet dependent anammox reaction graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox extracellular electron transfer granular activated carbon microbial cross feeding quorum sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen removal from wastewater is critical to maintaining a healthy ecosystem kończak and huber 2022 compared to conventional energy intensive nitrification denitrification processes treatments with anammox require less oxygen and no organic carbon source cao et al 2019 however the low growth rate and high sensitivity to the environment of anammox bacteria pose challenges in engineering applications of the anammox process wang et al 2022 anammox start up requires a long duration especially when anammox seed is not provided the retention and adaptation of anammox bacteria to the ambient environment is critical for effective applications of anammox it has been reported that the addition of granular activated carbon gac can facilitate anammox reactor start up and enhance nitrogen removal performance because their high specific surface area and hydrophobicity favour anammox biofilm colonization adams et al 2020 s yang et al 2021 w zhang et al 2015 gu et al 2020 reported that the gac packed anammox moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr achieved a 0 4 kg n m3 day total nitrogen removal rate nrr in 60 days which outcompeted the performance of mbbrs packed with nonwoven fabrics plastic and polyurethane sponge carriers liang et al 2022 found that gac addition promoted re granulation of the disintegrated anammox hydroxyapatite sludge at low phosphate condition which ensured an effective nitrogen removal of 88 at a nrr of 8 5 kg n m3 day similarly zhang et al 2015 utilized gac as nucleus and achieved fast granulation of anammox sludge within only 38 days in an anammox expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor however the underlying mechanisms of gac in anammox development may have been overlooked for instance gac addition might induce distinct niche for the survival and enrichment of anammox bacteria y yang et al 2021 the microenvironment and the prolonged biomass retention of gac biofilm might enable complex nitrogen cycles microbial cross feeding in which one species lives off the metabolic products of another species in the anammox community has been shown to increase bacterial growth zhao et al 2018 in addition quorum sensing qs a system by which bacteria regulate cell population density in accordance with molecular communication between cells has been associated with anammox development microbial communication regulated by qs signal molecules such as acyl homoserine lactone ahl bis 3 5 cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate c di gmp and diffusible signal factor dsf have been reported in anammox bioreactors guo et al 2021 tang et al 2018a the ahl dependent quorum sensing was reported to promote the microbial aggregations biofilm formation and activities and excretion of redox substances e g c type cytochrome flavin liu et al 2022 the synthesis and degradation of qs molecules could be affected by exogenous additives e g the addition of nano zero valent iron nzvi improved the c di gmp synthesis facilitated the formation of sludge particles and improved the nitrogen removal efficiency in an anammox bioreactor wang et al 2021 recently extracellular electron transfer has been observed in anammox bacterial communities shaw et al 2020 xu et al 2022 demonstrated that biochar addition in an anammox system improved nitrogen removal and electron transfer capability that was mediated by redox extracellular polymeric substances eps until now the above mentioned mechanisms in gac amended anammox systems remain largely uninvestigated the present study was carried out with two uasb reactors with one reactor supplemented with gac and one without the objective of this work is to explore the fundamental mechanisms associated with gac addition during anammox reactor start up our research focus encompassed gac induced nitrogen metabolism quorum sensing microbial community dynamics and extracellular electron transfer in anammox development 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor operation two 5 l lab scale uasb reactors r1 and r2 were operated for the enrichment of anammox bacteria in this study granular sludge enables effective biomass retention which facilitates

using the dneasy powersoil pro kit qiagen hilden germany according to the manufacturer s protocol extracted dna was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction pcr with the universal primer pair 515f gtgccagcmgccgcgg and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat then subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing the sequencing was processed on the illumina miseq platform and the analysis was conducted in the qiime 2 dada2 pipeline hall and beiko 2018 the asvs were inferred with 99 similarity the taxonomy of asvs was assigned using ribosomal database project rdp classifier using the database of 16s rrna training set 18 with default setting cole et al 2009 phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust2 douglas et al 2020 was utilized to predict the functional genes from the asvs data and the reference database kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg kanehisa et al 2016 the metabolic functional dynamics of the microbial community in response to exogenous additives in anammox system have been performed using the predicted metagenomes from 16s rrna data and reference database in previous reported studies ge et al 2018 h li et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the raw sequence data was submitted to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi genbank bio project prjna823682 3 results and discussion 3 1 anammox start up in uasb reactors with and without gac the bioreactors operation lasted for 255 days in three phases a lag phase during which effluent nh4 n was higher than influent nh4 n a propagation phase nh4 n removal increased continuously and a nitrogen loading rate nlr elevation phase a rapid increase in the nlr with simultaneous nh4 n and no2 n removals influent and effluent nitrogen dynamics nitrogen removal efficiencies the total nlr the total nitrogen removal rate nrr and soluble cod concentrations in r1 and r2 effluents are shown in fig 1 phase durations ph values the δ no2 n δ nh4 n ratio and the δ no3 n δ nh4 n ratio are presented in table 1 3 1 1 nitrogen dynamics in the reactor without gac the lag phase lasted for 157 days in r1 without gac addition the relatively long time before anammox began could be due to the intensive cell lysis that occurred when microbes shifted from heterotrophic to autotrophic metabolism and the cod supported heterotrophic growth that competed with anammox adams et al 2020 chamchoi and nitisoravut 2007 chen et al 2012 nh4 n concentrations were higher in the effluent 52 9 2 0 mg l than in the influent 50 0 1 3 mg l in the lag phase fig 1a no2 n removal was observed in the lag phase which could be attributed to denitrification with the presence of available electron donors e g organic matters from cell lysis at the end of the lag phase days 154 157 effluent no2 n concentration were 0 9 3 0 mg l and no2 n removal efficiencies were 93 8 97 9 the propagation phase started on day 158 in r1 when nh4 n removal was observed and lasted for 37 days with sharp decreases in effluent nh4 n concentrations during this phase influent nh4 n concentrations were maintained at 50 mg l and no2 n increased from 50 mg l to 60 mg l effluent concentrations of nh4 n 3 5 mg l no2 n 0 9 mg l and 9 5 mg l no3 n were achieved at the end of the propagation phase on day 195 which correspondingly generated nh4 n no2 n and total n removal efficiencies of 93 1 98 4 and 87 2 throughout lag and propagation phases the total nlr was in the range of 0 18 0 24 kg n m3 day and the total nrr reached 0 19 kg n m3 day at the end of the propagation phase in r1 during the nlr elevation phase day 196 255 in r1 and the influent nh4 n and no2 n concentrations increased from 50 mg l to 198 mg l and from 60 mg l to 240 mg l respectively effluent nh4 n and no2 n concentrations were 0 15 5 mg l and 0 13 5 mg l respectively during this time no3 n concentrations increased with increasing n removal and reached 40 7 0 3 mg l when the influent nh4 n concentration reached 198 mg l at the end of r1 operation the total nlr reached 0 88 0 00 kg n m3 day the total nrr reached 0 76 0 01 kg n m3 day and nh4 n no2 n and total n removal efficiencies were 94 3 1 7 95 2 0 4 and 85 9 0 8 respectively fig 1c and 1f it was noticed that the nh4 n removal began when soluble cod concentrations in the effluent attributed to cell debris and cell metabolites decreased to 0 7 mg l fig 1e this might correspond to an anammox suitable environment with less competition from heterotrophs throughout the anammox start up process the ph of the effluent 7 3 0 2 7 7 0 3 was higher than the influent 6 9 0 2 table 1 due first to the denitrification and then to the anammox reactions the δ no₂ n δ nh₄ n ratio and the δ no3 n δ nh₄ n ratio was 1 16 1 36 and 0 19 0 24 respectively in the nlr elevation phase these ratios are comparable with reported values strous et al 1998 zhang et al 2010 3 1 2 nitrogen dynamics in the reactor with gac the lag phase lasted for 112 days in r2 with gac addition as shown in fig 1b and 1d only no2 n removal was observed and nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations in the r2 effluent showed trends similar to the trends observed in r1 during the lag phase nh4 n removal was first observed on day 113 nh4 n no2 n and total n removal efficiencies reached 92 98 6 and 87 9 with effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations of 4 mg l 0 9 mg l and 9 1 mg l respectively on day 136 at the end of the propagation phase nlrs were 0 2 0 23 kg n m3 day during the first two operational phases and the nrr reached 0 2 kg n m3 day at the end of the propagation phase from day 137 to day 255 influent nh4 n concentrations increased from 50 mg l to 220 mg l no2 n concentrations increased from 60 mg l to 268 mg l effluent nh4 n and no2 n concentrations were 0 26 mg l and 0 5 19 5 mg l respectively and effluent no3 n concentrations reached 42 0 0 5 mg l at the end of reactor operation at the end of reactor operation removal efficiencies of nh4 n no2 n and total n were 90 4 0 6 96 0 0 5 and 84 8 0 5 respectively the total nlr was 0 97 0 00 kg n m3 day and the total nrr was 0 83 0 00 kg n m3 day fig 1d and 1f when nh4 n removal began in r2 cod concentrations stabilized at 2 12 mg l fig 1e the influent ph was 6 8 0 2 7 0 0 2 and the effluent ph was 7 3 0 2 7 9 0 2 table 1 the ratios of δ no₂ n δ nh₄ n and δ no3 n δ nh₄ n were 1 14 1 36 and 0 18 0 23 respectively during the nlr elevation phase in r2 table 1 as compared to r1 the anammox start up lag phase was shortened by 45 days and the propagation phase was shortened by 14 days in r2 with gac addition it took 255 days for r1 and 173 days for r2 to reach a nrr of 0 76 kg n m3 day 3 2 quorum sensing during anammox development with and without gac evidence showed qs regulates the growth activities and phenotypes of anammox bacteria and ahl dependent qs systems promote anammox liu et al 2020 q zhang et al 2021 to investigate the impact of gac addition on the ahl dependent qs system ahl molecules in the water phases of r1 no gac and r2 with gac were analyzed fig 2 shows that both reactors contained high numbers of the qs molecule c8 hsl r1 effluent contained 3 62 ng l and r2 effluent contained 3 43 ng l the qs molecule c12 hsl was detected at 2 46 ng l in r2 with gac and 0 14 ng l in r1 no gac c10 hsl at 0 11 ng l was exclusively detected in r2 and 3o c10 hsl at 0 07 ng l was exclusively detected in r1 c6 hsl was not found in either reactor other qs molecules detected including c4 hsl c14 hsl 3o c6 hsl 3o c8 hsl 3o c12 hsl and 3o c14 hsl showed relatively comparable concentrations below 0 5 ng l in two reactors positive correlations of the qs molecules c8 hsl and c12 hsl with anammox activities or growth have been detected in other studies de clippeleir et al 2011 tang et al 2018b as the concentrations of signal molecules are cell density dependent shi et al 2022 the higher concentrations of c8 hsl and c12 hsl in r2 compared to the other qs molecules at the end of reactor operation might be a consequence of the presence of gac each type of signal molecule might control anammox differently the occurrence of c8 hsl in both reactors and the exclusively high c12 hsl excretion in the gac amended reactor probably indicate that c8 hsl and c12 hsl have different ecological niches zhao et al 2021 the molecular communication between cells in the quorum sensing system might contribute to the regulation of microbial cross feeding y feng et al 2019 guo et al 2021 overall the results indicated that gac impacted the qs dependent microbial communications during anammox and might have contributed to a faster anammox enrichment 3 3 microbial community development during anammox start up with and without gac 3 3 1 microbial development at the phylum level the microbial community structures at the phylum level in the suspended sludge from r1 no gac and r2 with gac and the gac biofilm from r2 are shown in fig 3 a bacteria from the phylum planctomycetes proteobacteria and chloroflexi were predominant in all anammox samples regardless of their different spatial locations planctomycetes accounted for 3 0 in the seed sludge 39 7 and 38 2 in r1 sludge 1 and 2 46 6 and 46 6 in r2 sludge 1 and 2 and 35 4 and 33 8 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 after 255 days of anammox enrichment proteobacteria accounted for 14 8 in the seed sludge 26 7 and 27 6 in r1 sludge 1 and 2 8 0 and 7 9 in r2 sludge 1 and 2 and 39 8 and 39 6 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 respectively chloroflexi was enriched from 1 7 in the seed sludge to 8 7 and 9 0 in r1 sludge 1 and 2 40 8 and 41 3 in r2 sludge 1 and 2 and 21 2 and 22 2 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 proteobacteria and chloroflexi include denitrification and heterotrophic bacteria and they have been commonly reported in anammox systems zhang et al 2018 with no organic carbon source in the influent heterotrophic bacteria in anammox systems can utilize organic substances from cell debris and soluble microbial products xing et al 2008 the reduction of nitrate to nitrite and the cross feeding among microbes can support anammox growth lawson et al 2017 speth et al 2016 microorganisms from gemmatimonadetes 5 0 and 4 7 in r1 sludge 1 and 2 were enriched in r1 and were reported related to denitrification han et al 2021 3 3 2 microbial development at the genus level to get a deeper understanding of the microbial development as anammox is getting underway with and without gac addition microbial community compositions at genus level were discussed and the top 35 abundant genera were shown in fig 3b r1 and r2 showed remarkable discrepancies in the microbial structure no microbial genera that take part in anammox were identified in the seed sludge community yet they were the most abundant genera in all samples collected at the end of reactor operation bacteria from order subdivision3 genera incertae sedis and genera mesotoga aminivibrio inmirania and vulgatibacteraceae dominated the microbial community in the seed sludge 3 3 2 1 microbial genera affiliated with anammox two microbial genera that take part in anammox candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were enriched in the current study in r1 no gac candidatus brocadia was the predominant microbe with relative abundances of 37 3 and 35 5 in sludge 1 and 2 respectively candidatus kuenenia accounted for only 1 8 and 2 in sludge 1 and 2 an adverse condition was observed in r2 with gac where candidatus kuenenia accounted for 44 1 and 44 2 in sludge 1 and 2 respectively and 31 7 and 30 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 respectively candidatus brocadia accounted for only 2 3 in r2 sludge samples and 3 4 and 3 8 in gac biofilm samples 1 and 2 respectively although candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia are commonly observed in anammox systems they have different physiological properties oshiki et al 2016b according to r k selection theory candidatus brocadia has a low substrate affinity that can develop quickly at high substrate concentrations kang et al 2019 liu et al 2017 oshiki et al 2016b candidatus kuenenia shows a high affinity for substrates that enables it to grow at low n concentrations kang et al 2019 liu et al 2017 oshiki et al 2016b providing high competitiveness with the syntrophic growth of denitrification bacteria the significantly different microbial communities in r1 and r2 might have been triggered by the addition of gac although the gac adsorption of organics induced less competition from heterotrophic bacteria in bulk solution enabling better anammox development the presence of gac induced the formation of biofilm that could favor candidatus kuenenia growth under the substrate limited condition at the beginning of reactor operation peng et al 2022 3 3 2 2 microbial genera affiliated with denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra in addition to anammox other microbial groups also showed considerable differences various types of denitrification bacteria were developed in r1 while relatively unitarily dominant groups were developed in r2 samples in r1 genera propionivibrio 8 6 and 8 4 in sludge 1 and 2 bellilinea 4 in sludge 1 and 2 ornatilinea 3 1 and 3 2 in sludge 1 and 2 and ignavibacterium 1 7 and 1 8 in sludge 1 and 2 were reported as heterotrophic denitrification or dnra bacteria he et al 2021 hou et al 2022 lianfu liang et al 2022 van den berg et al 2017a in addition in r1 the genera thermomonas 3 and 3 1 in sludge 1 and 2 sulfurisoma 3 1 and 3 in sludge 1 and 2 sulfuritalea 1 9 and 2 in sludge 1 and 2 and thiobacillus 1 8 and 2 in sludge 1 and 2 have been reported as autotrophic denitrifying bacteria that utilize sulfur or h2 as electron donors for no3 reduction carboni et al 2021 k li et al 2019 ucar et al 2020 xia et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 k zhang et al 2020 l zhang et al 2015 in r2 the genus ornatilinea was dominant at 38 7 and 39 6 in r2 sludge 1 and 2 and at 20 4 and 21 4 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 respectively during anammox enrichment with limited organic carbon source from the surrounding environment bacteria in the genus ornatilinea were likely to convert nitrate to nitrite and the produced nitrite would promote anammox xiao et al 2021 ornatilinea is also recognized as a filamentous bacterium which could contribute to biofilm structures sui et al 2020 sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob have been involved in sulfur driven denitrification deng et al 2019 bacteria in the genus sulfuritalea had abundances of 28 and 26 6 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 sulfuritalea has been identified as a core denitrifying bacterium in wastewater treatment plants performing sulfur based autotrophic denitrification de almeida fernandes et al 2018 mcilroy et al 2016 other enriched genera such as propionivibrio 4 3 and 4 2 in r2 sludge 1 and 2 1 1 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 bellilinea 1 5 and 1 3 in r2 sludge 1 and 2 0 6 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 limnobacter 0 4 and 0 5 in r2 sludge 1 and 2 1 1 and 1 3 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 and comamonas 0 2 in r2 sludge 1 and 2 1 1 and 1 2 in gac biofilm 1 and 2 might have also contributed to denitrification during anammox development van den berg et al 2017b wang et al 2018 yuan et al 2021 limnobacter like sulfuritalea could metabolize sulfur and nitrate in the anammox system xu et al 2020 3 3 2 3 electroactive genera with the presence of the conductive gac extracellular electron transfer eet could have participated in the development of microbial populations and the anammox reaction in r2 candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis and candidatus brocadia are electroactive and could transfer electrons to insoluble extracellular electron acceptors i e electrode and graphene oxide shaw et al 2020 sulfuritalea abundant in the biofilm of the reactor that contained gac has been reported to be enriched on the electrodes in electrochemical membrane bioreactors and microbial fuel cells mfc ma et al 2015 wan et al 2021 comamonas was abundant at 1 1 and 1 2 in gac biofilm microbial communities comamonas a genus of proteobacteria are denitrifying bacteria capable of generating electricity in mfc reactors xing et al 2010 bacteria from the genus rhodopseudomonas with relative abundances of 0 9 and 1 in the gac biofilm have been reported to be electroactive and capable of utilizing nitrate as an electron acceptor to fix co2 and to generate atp under dark conditions via eet liu et al 2021 3 3 3 impact of gac on microbial dynamics alpha diversity mean species diversity metrics chao1 shannon and simpson were evaluated to compare microbial richness and diversity among r1 and r2 anammox samples in fig 3c chao1 represents microbial community richness and shannon and simpson indexes represent microbial community diversity compared with seed sludge samples collected at the end of reactor operation showed lower microbial richness and diversity this could be due to the selection of ecological adaptive populations within the anammox feedstock r2 sludge and gac biofilm samples showed lower richness and diversity compared to r1 sludge samples and r2 sludge samples showed the least diversity among all samples 3 4 microbial functions in r1 and r2 to gain insights into the impact of gac addition on metagenomes of anammox sludge the metabolic functional genes related to nitrogen metabolism sulfur oxidation extracellular electron transfer quorum sensing co2 fixation and microbial cross feeding are discussed fig 4 3 4 1 nitrogen metabolism genes of core enzymes hydrazine synthase hzs and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh that catalyze anammox were not identified due to the lack of a kegg annotation guide it was observed that hao hydroxylamine dehydrogenase was enriched in r1 and r2 previous metagenome studies suggested that hao could play a critical role in anammox hao was proposed to participate in no2 reduction and the oxidation of hydrazine n2h4 to n2 z feng et al 2019 oshiki et al 2016a sun et al 2018 yang et al 2020 the highest relative abundances of hao genes were observed in r2 sludge samples which had the highest anammox activity previous isotope 15n labelling tests identified hydroxylamine as an intermediate in an electrode dependent anammox reaction shaw 2020 hydroxylamine could also be an intermediate in the current anammox systems nitrite reductase genes nirs and nirk were identified in both reactors yang et al 2020 the nirs and nirk gene abundances in gac biofilm samples were relatively higher than the nirs and nirk gene abundances in r2 sludge samples this might be related to denitrification in the gac biofilm nitrate reductase genes narghi and napab are responsible for nitrate reduction to nitrite in denitrification and dnra relatively higher relative abundances of narghi genes were observed in gac biofilm samples powder activated carbon has been reported to stimulate the growth of denitrifiers in denitrification anammox systems ge et al 2018 nitric oxide reductase norbc and nitrous oxide reductase nosz genes related to denitrification and the nh4 forming nitrite reductase nrfah gene related to dnra showed relatively low abundances 3 4 2 sulfur oxidation the sulfur oxidizing bacteria identified in r1 and r2 section 3 3 suggest the presence of sulfur based autotrophic denitrification where sulfide sulfur or thiosulfate can act as an electron donor for nitrogen removal zhang et al 2020 cysteine synthase cysk adenylylsulfate reductase aprab genes showed high relative abundances in r1 sludge and higher relative abundances in r2 sludge sulfate adenylyltransferase sat sulfur oxidizing genes sox heterodisulfide reductase hdr and sulfide quinone reductase sqr genes for sulfur oxidation had higher relative abundances in r1 sludge than in r2 sludge thus sulfur metabolism might have contributed to denitrification during anammox development pang and wang 2021 3 4 3 extracellular electron transfer eet in anammox systems was considered mediated by c type cytochrome shaw et al 2020 biochar addition has been shown to enhance anammox and to increase the redox active eps components that mediate eet in anammox xu et al 2022 in the current study genes encoding c type cytochrome showed relative abundances with the sequence of r2 gac biofilm r1 sludge r2 sludge from previous experiences and the current results it is speculated that gac induced eet dependent anammox happened in r2 with c type cytochrome as the electron mediator and it is also possible that gac as a conductive material directly served as an electron conductor 3 4 4 quorum sensing multiple types of qs molecules synthesis genes were analyzed including luxi and hdts for ahl cqsa for cholera autoinducer 1 cai 1 dgc for second messenger bis 3 5 cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate c di gmp luxs for autoinducer 2 ai 2 and rpff for diffusible signal factor dsf tang et al 2018a from the results hdts genes showed overall higher relative abundances and a sequence of r2 sludge r2 gac biofilm r1 sludge of the hdts genes relative abundances was observed previous studies found that hdts genes were mainly responsible for microbial communications in anammox systems they were positively correlated with nrr tang et al 2018a and they were harbored by ca kuenenia and ca brocadia t zhang et al 2020 a relatively higher abundance of luxi genes related to denitrification tang et al 2018a was observed in gac biofilm samples dgc genes had the second highest relative abundance in all samples c di gmp could have regulated eps for biofilm formation and sludge aggregation hengge 2009 the other qs genes cqsa rpff luxs showed limited relative abundances our results suggest that the ahl dependent qs system played an important role in anammox development and gac addition might have improved the synthesis of ahl signal molecules zhao et al 2021 3 4 5 co2 fixation and microbial cross feeding some secondary metabolites are essential to biological processes and microbial cross feeding of these metabolites could have benefited anammox development lawson et al 2017 molybdopterin cofactor moco and folate are essential cofactors in co2 fixation in bacteria exogenous moco and folate were supplied by proteobacteria and armatimonadetes affiliated bacteria to anammox zhao et al 2018 in the current work higher relative abundances of co2 fixation related genes formate dehydrogenases fdha formate tetrahydrofolate ligase fhs and anaerobic carbon monoxide dehydrogenase coos folate synthesis gene dihydrofolate synthase folc moco synthesis gene molybdopterin molybdotransferase moea were observed in r2 sludge consistent with the higher anammox relative abundances the co2 fixation gene methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase fold the folate synthesis gene dihydrofolate reductase fola and the moco synthesis gene molybdopterin adenylyltransferase moga showed the lowest relative gene abundances in the r2 sludge this finding is supported by previous studies in which an abundance of fold fola and moga required support from an exogenously microbial cross feeding of moco and folate zhou et al 2020 3 5 proposed mechanisms the current results demonstrate that gac addition shortened the time to develop anammox in a uasb reactor from anaerobic digestion sludge with no detectable anammox activity as seed sludge with the same operation duration the nrr in a uasb reactor with gac addition was higher than nrr in a uasb reactor without gac results from the current work supported the conclusions that gac could improve anammox performance under stressful conditions and promote full scale applications we propose the impacts of gac on anammox development included the following aspects fig 5 i gac provided distinct ecological niches in gac biofilm and bulk environment for anammox development which could broaden its applications in engineering systems ii gac enhanced metabolic networks between anammox and other microbes i e denitrification and heterotrophic bacteria which could benefit anammox enrichment in simultaneous partial nitrification anammox denitrification processes iii gac impacted microbial communications via quorum sensing mainly ahl and c di gmp dependent qs which regulated anammox growth and mechanical structures iv gac enabled eet dependent anammox providing multiple options for ammonium removal with electron acceptors other than nitrite the observed impacts derived by gac addition underlines the important role of gac in the wide engineering applications of anammox which can be integrated into future design of anammox driven nitrogen removal in both engineered and natural systems the shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing can be applied in future studies to construct the genomic view of gac induced metabolic pathways in the anammox incorporated nitrogen cycles 4 conclusion anammox was enhanced with the addition of gac in the treatment of synthetic wastewater anammox began at 113 days of reactor operation in the reactor containing gac and at 158 days in a control reactor without gac the nrr reached 0 83 kg n m3 day in the reactor with gac and 0 76 kg n m3 day in the reactor without gac after 255 days operation the ahl dependent qs molecule c8 hsl showed comparable concentrations in both reactors while the reactor containing gac contained a higher level of c12 hsl molecules 2 46 ng l candidatus brocadia were predominant in the non gac reactor and candidatus kuenenia were predominant in the reactor containing gac heterotrophic denitrification and sulfur based autotrophic denitrification developed simultaneously with anammox ahl dependent quorum sensing microbial cross feeding of substrates and the essential cofactors molybdopterin cofactor moco and folate in co2 fixation in bacteria possibly contributed to an enhanced anammox development in the reactor amended with gac anammox could have been augmented by the extracellular electron transfer that would be enabled with gac addition

generated from drinking water plants dwpts and wastewater plants wwpts in china the annual production of was has risen to 13 3 million tons dry sludge in 2020 ministry of housing and urban rural development china 2020 dws production is greatly affected by the quality of raw water it s approximately 1 5 2 4 million tons dry sludge kang et al 2022 was is produced by activated sludge process treating wastewater which is characterized with a large amount of hydrophilic organic matter the high water content difficult dewatering cao et al 2020 dws is a by product produced by adding coagulants or flocculants iron or aluminum salt in drinking water sources to remove turbidity color and natural organic matter salehin et al 2020 dws contains low organic matter and high inorganic content making it unsuitable for biodegradation and incineration the high concentration of metals makes it unfit for terrestrial applications xie et al 2021 dws also faces the problem of difficult dewatering due to the high content of bound water as the essential step for sludge treatments dewatering can minimize the sludge volume facilitate transportation and reduce costs wu et al 2020 resource utilization of dewatered sludge is an effective way to avoid secondary pollution and has become the focus of environmental pollution prevention chen et al 2020 was is a non homogeneous colloidal system extracellular polymeric substances eps with high water holding properties construct complex network spatial conformation and firmly capture plenty of water molecules it is difficult to complete solid liquid separation using mechanical pressure alone xu et al 2018 different intensified technologies physical chemical and biological conditioning have been developed advanced oxidation processes aops in chemical conditioning are widely recognized the main contributor may be the generation of free radicals to disintegrate sludge gel like structure for internal moisture transformation and drainage thereby ameliorating sludge dewaterability ge et al 2019 the typical aop processes with iron based catalyst activated oxidant hydrogen peroxide or persulfate shows good performance in enhanced sludge dewatering zhen et al 2018 but it prones a problem of catalyst dissolution and hydrogen peroxide oxidizer is a regulated hazardous chemical ozone o3 has the effect of efficient decomposition of sludge flocs without toxic by products and environmental friendly characteristics o3 molecules can selectively oxidize organic compounds abundant of special functional groups double bonds aromatic rings non protonated amines etc rapidly which is worthy of being applied and explored in enhanced sludge dewatering zhang et al 2016 however due to the insoluble property of o3 molecules a large number of heterogeneous catalysts have been developed to facilitate o3 decomposition to generate hydroxyl radicals oh with stronger oxidation and non selective wang and chen

effective in improving oh production in wastewater treatment nawaz et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 the mechanism of degradation of organic matter in wastewater treatment by catalytic oxidation mentioned above has been thoroughly investigated however was is rich in complex organic matter such as many proteins pn and polysaccharides ps and the concentration is much greater than that in wastewater these large molecules and strongly hydrophilic substances are the main bottleneck for the difficult dewatering of sludge therefore it is worthwhile to explore the application of the above catalysts in catalytic ozonation for was dewatering dws mainly contains inorganic components such as sio2 al2o3 with certain hardness and a small amount of organic components liu et al 2020 after dewatering it has a certain porosity and a large range of specific surface area reflecting excellent catalytic and adsorption properties du et al 2020 van truong and kim 2021 the modification and scientific reuse of dws in combination with its own characteristics is an important demand for sludge resource recovery currently dws is mainly used as an adsorbent for heavy metals phosphorus p and fluoride hou et al 2018 jing et al 2020 and as a coagulant in wastewater treatment and alternatives manufactured from ceramiste or building materials liu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 muruganandham et al 2007 compared the dws and several different metal zno tio2 al2o3 fe2o3 for the decomposition ability of o3 and confirm its effectiveness but the oxidation effect of pollutants was not revealled the application of dws for catalytic ozonation enhanced was dewatering performance deserves to be explored however adding dws directly to was might lead to the dissolution of organic matter in dws which is unconducive to dewatering based on the al2o3 rich characteristic of dws it has the potential advantage of catalyzing o3 after heated modification of dws hdws porous and skeletal structures are formed increasing the specific surface area to improve its stability and catalytic potential however there is still a lack of a comprehensive investigation concerning was handling with the combined hdws o3 process and the dewaterability of was and other physicochemical characteristics as well as the main chemical reaction mechanism in hdws o3 conditioning are still rarely understood the purpose of this study is to 1 prepare and characterize the hdws 2 investigate the effects of ph o3 dosage and hdws dosage on was dewaterability 3 further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the enhanced was dewaterability in terms of changes in physicochemical properties eps and correlation analysis 4 reveal the catalytic mechanism of hdws for o3 by pyridine infrared analysis and dft calculations finally the feasibility of engineering applications of realizing resource utilization of dws while enhancing the was dewaterability is discussed providing inspiration for the new strategy of the collaborative treatment of urban multi source sludge the flowchart of the study outline was provided in fig s1 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge characteristics the experimental sludge was obtained in the secondary settling tank of wastewater treatment system the sludge sample was left to settle for 6 h at 4 c to obtain the concentrated sludge rs with total solid ts of 21 82 0 12 g l volatile solids vs of 11 37 0 10 g l water content wc of 97 13 0 14 wt zeta potential of 18 37 0 21 mv and ph 6 98 0 04 the dws sample was produced in the drinking water treatment system the poly aluminum chloride with a basicity oh al of 1 03 was used as the coagulant it was obtained from the dewatering workshop with wc of 55 37 0 27 and ph 7 45 0 05 2 2 preparation of hdws the dws was dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h to remove moisture then ground and sieved through a 40 mesh screen for latter analysis and heated modification a portion of the dws was then calcined in a muffle furnace exposed to static air heated to 800 c with a ramp rate of 10 c min and held for 2 h the hdws was collected after cooling the product yield was determined to be 89 69 0 52 by three parallel tests the main compositions of dws and hdws were analyzed by x ray fluorescence xrf indicating that it contained a variety of metal and non metal oxides in different proportions as shown in table 1 the major portions of dws specimen had 11 45 0 15 organic matter 33 36 0 12 sio2 and 30 66 0 14 al2o3 followed by fe2o3 and cao hdws has the significantly higher contents of sio2 and al2o3 as 37 29 0 11 and 40 58 0 13 compared to dws which was content with the report by pham et al 2021 the point of zero charge phpzc of dws and hdws were 6 74 and 7 28 respectively 2 3 experimental procedure 500 ml rs was mixed with dws or hdws in the beakers and adjusted ph to the targeted values by 1 mol l hcl or 1 mol l naoh the mixture was then poured into a 2 0 l fully mixed closed reactor and o3 was injected at a flow rate of 1 l min through a porous silica diffuser at the bottom of the reactor for conditioning o3 was produced from oxygen by the laboratory ozone generator in order to fully mix rs dws or hdws and o3 the stirrer in the reactor was kept running during conditioning the whole conditioning time lasted for 30 min the o3 dosage controlled by adjusting o3 concentration the inlet and outflow o3 concentrations were constantly monitored by the digital o3 concentration detector o3 exhaust was absorbed by potassium iodide the schematic diagram of the ozonation and conditioning system was shown in fig s2 the specific experimental design of dws and hdws was shown in table 2 the effects of ph and dws or hdws dosage on the dewatering effect were explored firstly and the o3 dosage was optimized on this basis 2 4 analytical methods the characterizations of dws and hdws x ray fluorescence xrf x ray diffraction xrd fourier transformed infrared ftir scanning electron microscope sem brunauer emmett teller bet surface area and the pore characteristics were described in text s1 the dewatering performance capillary water time cst specific resistance filtration srf and moisture distribution physicochemical properties zeta potential particle size fractal dimension df and hydrophobicity of was were described in text s2 the layers of eps were classified into extra microcolony polymers emps and extra cellular polymers ecps which are defined as the exopolymers that mainly exist outside the microcolonies for floc formation and inside the microcolonies for microcolony aggregation respectively wang et al 2014 the extraction and the properties of epms and ecps component total organic carbon toc pn ps and humus hs content pn secondary structure and molecular weight mw were described in text s3 the detailed process of oh determination was shown in our previous report xiao et al 2021 all experiments were performed in triplicate with the standard deviations shown as error bars the pyridine infrared measurement was texted in text s4 the detailed description of the statistical analysis and the computational methods were given in text s5 and text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of dws and hdws 3 1 1 xrd and ftir analysis the crystalline properties of dws and hdws were examined by xrd analysis in fig 1 a the xrd pattern was analyzed and compared according to the standard data base library jcpds card in xrd patterns two distinctive characteristic peaks represent sio2 crystals in the range of 2θ from 20 to 30 the existence of sio2 in large amounts was confirmed by both xrf and xrd results which was consistent with the results reported in the literatures lin et al 2015 yang et al 2023 the crystalline substances were mainly sio2 al2o3 and fe2o3 and fe3al2 sio4 3 and naalsi3o8 were also found which was also confirmed by muruganandham et al 2007 it was found that combined with the results of pore structure and specific surface area in section 3 1 2 the presence of large amounts of inorganic particles such as sio2 can increased the size of dws or hdws and promote the formation of porous structure an increase in the peaks of al2o3 crystals could be found in the xrd pattern of hdws likewise tantawy 2015 proposed that the amount of al2o3 polymorphs increased when the temperature was increased to calcine dws above 700 c this was because during calcination the crystallization and dehydration processes increase the crystallinity of the amorphous aluminum salts and transform them into crystalline al2o3 which could improve the catalytic o3 effect the ftir spectra of dws and hdws were illustrated in fig 1b the spectral bonds and the corresponding functional groups in ftir spectrum were identified according to the relevant literature and detailed in table s1 soleha et al 2016 tantawy 2015 the strong and broad absorption band at wavenumber 3442 cm 1 was the stretching vibration of o h connected to al the peak at 1627 cm 1 corresponded to the structural characteristic peak of the aluminum hydroxy complex which was associated with the h o h bending vibration in the coordination water molecules these peaks decrease in intensity in hdws indicating alumina dehydroxide oxidation the peak at wavenumber at 1432 cm 1 was belonged to stretching vibrations of the c o groups in carbonaceous mineral or carbonate the band disappeared in hdws might be caused by the loss of inorganic carbon the absorption peak at 1025 1060 cm 1 and 789 cm 1 were attributed to the symmetrical stretching vibration of si o si and bending vibration of o si o in dws and hdws remained present in hdws confirming the stability of the sio2 phase as also shown with xrd the peak at 911 cm 1 was assigned to al o h bending vibration and disappeared in hdws with mineral dehydroxylation the peaks at 462 cm 1 and 526 cm 1 were caused by the asymmetric bending vibration of the si o si and si o al the absorption bands at 526 cm 1 diminished the intensity of the absorption peaks at 462 cm 1 increased after heated treatment in hdws indicating that si o si remained stable at 800 and its proportion in hdws increased due to the moisture loss ftir analysis showed that the functional groups in dws were mainly related to the silica crystals and coagulant aluminum salt it contained 3 1 2 sem bet and pore structure analysis the morphologies of dws and hdws were observed by sem at different magnification as shown in fig 2 fig 2a c depicted sem images of dws at 5 μm and 1 μm magnification revealed that a large number of inhomogeneous rough particles on dws surface ling et al 2017 sem image clearly demonstrated that hdws had a distinct porous structure fig 2b d which might contribute to the adsorption of o3 on surface the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of dws and hdws were the type iv isotherms fig 2e the pore size distributions of dws and hdws were shown in fig 2f the pore size is in the mesoporous range 2 50 nm which enhanced the proximity of o3 molecules to the active sites in their pore channels and improved the catalytic performance the sbet total pore volume vt and average pore diameter dp of hdws were higher than dws with detailed data of 30 6 and 82 18 m2 g 0 14 and 0 25 cm3 g 3 72 and 5 75 nm respectively table s2 after high temperature calcination of hdws the residual metal oxides were more fully distributed on the surface forming a porous structure increasing the specific surface area and pore volume the results indicated that hdws had larger surface area and well developed pore structure compared to dws suggesting an increase in surface active sites and the conduction potential to o3 molecules adsorbed on hdws surface xiao et al 2021 this was expected to lead to more improved catalytic effects 3 2 effects on was dewatering performance 3 2 1 dewatering performance cst and srf were adopted as the dependent variables to explore the influence of ph dws or hdws dosage and o3 dosage on dewatering performance of was and optimize the conditions of dws o3 and hdws o3 process figs s3 and 3 the effect of dws o3 on dewatering performance was described in text s7 as shown in fig 3a adding hwds alone without adjusting ph could slightly reduce the cst and srf values from 85 8 2 10 s and 7 85 0 15 1013 m kg of rs to 70 5 2 5 s and 5 48 0 14 1013 m kg the cst and srf values decreased to 56 9 1 9 s and 4 09 0 14 1013 m kg at ph 2 the dewatering performance would be deteriorated under the alkaline condition at ph 8 which was consistent with the results reported by he et al 2017 further adding o3 as 60 mg g vs it was found that the cst and srf minimum values were got as 20 9 2 4 s and 1 07 0 19 1013 m kg under ph 4 fig 3b the reduction rates reached 75 64 and 86 37 the effects of o3 and hdws dosage on cst and srf values were shown in fig 3c d and described in detail in text s8 the optimal conditions for hdws o3 to enhance the dewatering performance of was were ph 4 o3 dosage 60 mg g vs and hdws dosage 700 mg g vs for dws o3 process the optimal conditions were ph 2 o3 dosage 75 mg g vs and hdws dosage 900 mg g vs as depicted in fig 3e the cst and srf values were significantly increased to 167 8 2 40 s conditioned by o3 alone 60 mg g vs suggesting the deteriorated dewaterability of ozonized sludge which was due to the solubilization of negatively charged organic matters and decrease the particle size ge et al 2019 xiao et al 2021 interestingly with the coupled dws o3 and hdws o3 treatment sludge dewaterability was pronouncedly improved the wc of dewatered sludge cake reduced to 70 15 1 05 and 60 37 0 97 corresponding to a further reduction volume of 27 78 0 85 and 37 85 0 92 respectively fig 3f the speculative reason was that dws or hdws coupled with o3 under ph 2 or 4 formed a new pluralistic system in which the systemic oxidizability was reinforced alum ion could bind the sites on the decomposed biopolymers fragments weakening the affinity of eps for water molecules li et al 2012 moreover the effective reduction of srf indicated that the inorganic particles in dws or hdws provided friction and extrusion for crushed sludge and improved the porosity of sludge cake as a skeleton accelerator with the water content decreasing during the filtration process li et al 2016 apparently hdws o3 ph 4 could enhance the dewatering performance of rs more significantly compared with dws o3 ph 2 indicating that the acidity required for conditioning could be ameliorated while improving sludge dewatering performance 3 2 2 moisture distribution the moisture distribution of rs conditioned by o3 dws o3 and hdws o3 was tested in fig 4 and table s3 the transition of different moisture types was another important indicator to characterize sludge dewatering effect zhang et al 2019 according to the calculation of the thermal drying curve the free moisture fm interstitial moisture im surface moisture sm and bound moisture bm proportions of rs were 74 18 0 03 16 35 0 04 7 64 0 05 and 1 83 0 04 respectively fig 4a most of the water in was was fm or im at high water content above 90 but the bm was the main bottleneck problem in the process of further reducing the moisture content reduced to below 80 fm was desorbed easily in dewatering whereas the separation of bm needed more energy input in mechanical pressure filtration because it is tightly bound to eps or other sludge components by adhesive forces and or chemical bonds cai et al 2018 in fig 4b o3 conditioned the fm and im decreased by 0 36 and 0 30 while the content of sm and bm increased slightly by 3 25 and 0 66 symbolizing the deterioration of the dewatering performance ge et al 2020 o3 conditioning alone would allow the sludge to be oxidized to smaller fine particles providing some surface area which in turn would absorb a part of the moisture zhang et al 2016 dws o3 and hdws o3 conditioning under their optimal conditions increased the fm content to 77 13 0 02 and 81 26 0 02 and im sm and bm contents were reduced to different degrees fig 4c d obviously hdws o3 conditioning was more effective in improving dewatering performance and the bm content decreased to 0 99 0 02 correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between cst and bm content r 0 980 p 0 05 srf and im content r 0 954 p 0 05 table s4 the highest fm content and the lowest bm content implied that the sludge flocs were destroyed releasing internal moisture and realizing the moisture conversion into more fm the combination of cst and srf values were significantly reduced the feasibility and effectiveness of hdws o3 conditioning was could be clarified 3 3 effects on physicochemical properties the physicochemical properties of sludge were investigated after conditioned by o3 dws o3 and hdws o3 the sludge dewaterability was usually determined by these properties li et al 2020 was is abundant in negatively charged organic substances they are stabilized by electrostatic repulsion preventing water flow zeta potential can reflect the electrical charge content in sludge flocs as seen in fig 5 a the zeta potential of the o3 conditioned was significantly lower than that of rs decreasing from 18 37 0 21 mv to 25 69 0 35 mv this was attributable to the destruction of eps structure by ozonation which increased the exposure of anionic groups amino groups and carboxyl groups ge et al 2019 surprisingly the zeta potential up to 0 56 0 08 mv dramatically after hdws o3 ph 4 conditioning proving that the negative charge density and repulsion between sludge particles decreased probably because the hdws o3 could induce peroxone reaction to produce more radicals to degrade and mineralize the released extracellular negatively charged biopolymers dissolved positively charged metal ions were released into the liquid phase from the sludge system under acidic conditions for charge neutralization the multi charged cations could agglomerate sludge floc particles and inhibit their brownian motion reducing vicinal water content the previous study had also demonstrated that sludge flocs become denser and easier to compress with al3 addition li et al 2012 in table s4 the zeta potential was significantly and positively correlated with srf r 0 986 p 0 05 as depicted in fig 5b the particle size distribution observed after oxidation with o3 was significantly lower compared to rs this would increase the resistance during filtration while the released hydrophilic organic compounds tend to bind more water molecules therefore an effective combination of ozonation and conditioner was usually necessary ge et al 2019 yu et al 2018 the particle size d10 d50 d90 of the sludge samples conditioned by dws o3 and hdws o3 were increased all in particular d90 increased from 49 58 0 58 to 95 91 0 97 µm d50 increased from 19 36 1 37 to 35 64 1 33 µm by hdws o3 conditioning which could effectively flocculate the sludge flocs the effect of sludge particle size on dewatering is still controversial and some studies have shown that even a decrease in particle size does not lead to poor dewaterability ge et al 2022 zhang et al 2016 the increase or decrease of particle size depends on whether the oxidation reaction mineralizes more hydrophilic substrates and counteracts the negative effect the disruption of hydrophilic groups and water bonds may be responsible for the improved dewaterability and the composition and transformation of hydrophilic organic matters in eps layers were further analyzed and discussed in later sections the df value changed from 2 49 to 2 19 fig 5c the decrease in df values represented the sludge flocs structure became looser and more porous enhancing the mobility of internal molecules and water this was consistent with the conversion of bm and sm to fm correlation analysis table s4 showed that df was highly significantly and positively correlated with cst r 0 998 p 0 01 and bm r 0 967 p 0 05 the relative hydrophobicity was characterized by measuring the contact angle of the sludge surface to calculate the surface free energy δgadh jin et al 2004 a more negative value of δgadh meant that the sludge surface was more hydrophobic with o3 conditioning δgadh increased from 10 60 to 14 74 mj m2 fig 5d and table s6 indicating that the sludge had a more hydrophilic surface increasing the bm content of was and reducing dewaterability which was line with the results of zhang et al 2016 the δgadh value dropped rapidly and became more negative to 35 14 and 51 61 mj m2 when conditioned by dws o3 and hdws o3 which indicates that hydrophobic interaction was the main interaction force under this condition the higher hydrophobicity was mainly responsible for enhancing dewaterability the enhanced hydrophobicity of was is attributed to the dissolution and oxidation of hydrophilic organic matters which reduces the binding force between sludge flocs and water more correlation analysis showed that an extremely significant positive correlations of δgadh with both cst r 0 998 p 0 01 and srf r 0 993 p 0 01 which had been confirmed by chen et al 2022 moreover δgadh also showed a significant positive correlation with im r 0 983 p 0 05 table s4 which is consistent with the results of increased im content the measurement and analysis of the above physicochemical properties further verified the effectiveness of hdws o3 conditioning was to achieve enhanced dewaterability 3 4 effects on the distribution and composition of eps 3 4 1 toc pn ps and hs contents fig 6 explored the toc pn ps and hs content changed in emps and ecps compared with rs conditioned by o3 dws o3 and hdws o3 contained fewer organic compounds in ecps than those in emps specifically fig 6a showed that the toc content gradually increased in ecps and the emps exhibited an opposite trend hdws o3 had the most obvious conditioning effect and the toc content in the total eps increased to 24 94 mg g vs fig 6b d the pn content in emps and ecps layers was significantly higher than that of ps and hs and was the main component of eps it was generally accepted that the dewaterability of was is more influenced by the distribution and specific molecular structure of extracellular pn than ps and hs bai et al 2021 pn and ps content gradually decreased in ecps and increased in emps after o3 dws o3 and hdws o3 conditioning the pn and ps content in emps increased with the improvement of oxidative properties in the conditioning system it was obvious that the emps becoming the dominant fraction of oxidation sludge eps these results indicated that oxidative conditioning promoted the polymeric substances transformed from the inner layer ecps to the outer layer emps accompanied by the oxidative degradation of macromolecules to more small molecules matter and structural changes xiao et al 2021 the ratio of pn ps in ecps showed a decreasing trend which meant a contribution to the increase in hydrophobicity and positive charges wu et al 2020 consistent with the results of zeta potential and δgadh fig 5 correlation analysis revealed that toc and pn were significantly and positively correlated with both cst and srf in ecps layer r 0 965 p 0 05 table s4 and s5 toc pn and ps all showed highly significant positive correlations with im r 0 957 p 0 05 on the contrary toc pn had no significant correlation with cst and srf r 0 898 p 0 05 ps was negatively correlated with cst and srf r 0 705 p 0 05 toc pn and ps showed high negatively correlated with im r 0 965 p 0 05 the change of hs content was increased both in emps and ecps layer fig 6d and hs was reported to have no significant effect on sludge dewatering performance sheng et al 2010 3 4 2 pn secondary structure not only dosage pn content exert a significant influence on sludge dewaterability but also the spatial structure of pn more insight into the mechanism of enhanced sludge dewaterability through the analysis of pn secondary structure bai et al 2021 fig s4 and table 3 summarized the variations of four representative structure α helix β sheet β turn and random coil in emps and ecps as determined by cd spectral the proportions of α helix and β sheet were predominated in ecps of rs while the proportion of random coil was converse table 3 the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil was usually applied to assess pn structural tightness which was larger in ecps than in emps indicating that the pn structure in ecps was tighter the pn secondary structure was changed in both emps and ecps layers after the various conditioning obviously the relative content of α helix declined distinctly following the order hdws o3 dws o3 o3 rs the presence of α helix was thought to prevent the elimination of moisture from the sludge flocs because α helix was retained by the hydrogen bond between the amide hydrogen and the carbonyl oxygen of the peptide bond zhu et al 2020 simultaneously the decreased degree of β turn and α helix β sheet random coil were roughly in agreement with that of α helix both in emps and ecps β turn is a reverse rotational conformation connecting α helix and β sheet the reduction of the two spatial conformations suggested that the pn polypeptide was disrupted and the complex multilevel structure deconvoluted becoming looser meanwhile the increase of β sheet and random coil is not negligible the higher content of β sheet indicated that the hydrogen bond was destroyed after ozonation treatment so that the non polar residues hidden inside and more hydrophobic sites were continuously exposed the increase in the proportion of random coils meant that the pn molecular structure was unfolded and the disorder was enhanced simultaneously for enhanced sludge dewaterability li et al 2020 significant correlations were found between α helix and β turn with toc pn and ps contents r 0 954 p 0 05 in ecps and the opposite relationship in emps tables s4 and s5 in emps it showed that β sheet react a highly significant positive correlation with pn r 0 995 p 0 01 the most prominent effect of hdws o3 conditioning was the reduction of the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil from 0 24 and 0 26 to 0 10 and 0 06 in emps and ecps layers it had been reported that the key to reducing the hydrophilicity of microbial aggregates was the destruction of α helix and the aggregation and folding of stretched polypeptide chains wu et al 2017 3 4 3 mw distribution high molecular weight hmw eps endowed sludge flocs with more stable structure and water molecular adsorption sites xu et al 2017 in fig 7 the mw distribution of the components in ecps was concentrated in the range of 100 1000 kda liu et al 2016 pointed out that organic matter with molecular weights between 100 1000 kda contributed significantly to the sludge dewatering performance and the high content of this fraction leaded to poor dewaterability after conditioning by o3 dws o3 and hdws o3 the mw in emps was significantly reduced especially the components with mw 1000 kda were oxidized to lower mw lmw components the percentage of emps and ecps components with mw 1000 kda disappeared after hdws o3 conditioning while the content of components with mw of 0 100 kda and 100 500 kda increased to 40 32 and 43 57 respectively it been reported that oh generated by oxidative conditioning react with the soluble fraction of sludge to oxidize the hydrophilic hmw proteins to lmw proteins and the dewatering performance was positively and strongly correlated with the percentage of lmw proteins in eps inner layer zhu et al 2020 in ecps 500 1000 kda and 1000 kda were significantly positively correlated with pn α helix and β turn r 0 981 p 0 05 0 100 kda was highly positively correlated with β sheet both in emps and ecps r 0 960 p 0 05 pn structure and mw were the factors that directly affect the organic content in eps xiao et al 2022 to sum up combining all the above correlation analyses it was found that the components and pn structures and mw in ecps correlated positively and more strongly with the sludge dewatering performance indicating that the ecps layer had a higher effect on the enhanced sludge dewatering performance than emps layer 3 5 mechanisms of enhanced catalytic ozonation by hdws 3 5 1 oh generation the oh generated in the catalytic ozone oxidation system has been proved to be a possible major contributor to enhanced sludge dewaterability disrupting the eps structure to provide a channel for moisture flow ge et al 2022 the ability of dws and hdws to catalyze ozonation to produce oh was determined at different reaction times as seen in fig 8 dws and hdws rapidly generated oh within 1 5 min and then the oh production increased with the reaction time this phenomenon proved that o3 was continuously decomposed to produce more oh during the sludge conditioning process hdws exhibited higher ozonolysis efficiency than dws and produced higher oh concentration the oh yield reached to 0 76 0 01 mm and 0 57 0 01 mm at 30 min it was indicated that hdws could significantly contributed to catalytic o3 decomposition in the sludge system and further illustrated the better catalytic performance of hdws 3 5 2 pyridine ftir analysis lewis acid sites were easily formed on the surface of heterogeneous catalyst metal oxide al2o3 which could accelerate the ozonation decomposition rate bing et al 2015 after degassing at 200 c the acid sites of dws and hdws were determined by ftir of pyridine adsorption fig s5 both dws and hdws exhibited two strong ir bands at 1447 and 1608 cm 1 attributed to pyridine adsorbed on lewis acid sites the ir bands appeared at 1447 cm 1 was associated with the surface concentration of pyridine and attributed to strong lewis sites cortez elizalde et al 2022 the band at 1488 cm 1 was assigned to pyridine adsorbed on lewis acid sites the band at 1575 cm 1 corresponded to the weak lewis sites it could be seen that the intensity and area of the peaks in the pyridine infrared spectrum are higher for hdws compared to dws furthermore no peak was observed for the characteristic signal indicating the production of bronsted acid sites by any metal oxides in the pyridine ftir spectra which might be due to the presence of more species and different metal oxide coordination on the dws and hdws surfaces propagating the formation of lewis sites cortez elizalde et al 2022 the quantitative estimation of total and strong lewis acid sites of dws and hdws degassed at 200 c and 350 c was performed according to the method described by emeis et al 1993 table 4 summarized that the total lewis acid sites on the surface of dws and hdws were 41 18 and 106 74 μmol g and the medium strong acid sites were 30 15 and 94 59 μmol g respectively the relatively high content of al2o3 enriched in hdws increased the number of lewis sites romero toledo et al 2018 some studies indicates that this might be attributed to the substitution of hydrogen by al in the si oh group on the surface of sio2 bing et al 2015 the presence of lewis acid sites increased phpzc which was consistent with the result that the phpzc of hdws was 7 28 greater than that of dws at 6 74 3 5 3 dft calculation the action mechanism between o3 and the surface configuration of al2o3 the major metal oxides with catalytic properties enriched on the surface of hdws was further determined by dft calculations the dft calculation was achieved by electrostatic effects and electron density which had emerged as a method for exploring catalyst activity jiang et al 2021 firstly the possible configurations of o3 adsorption on al2o3 110 surface were comprehensively modeled with five configurations fig s6 the adsorption energy δeads ev was used to express the binding strength between the adsorbed o3 molecule and the catalyst surface a negative and higher absolute value represented a more stable adsorption structure the calculated results showed that the optimal adsorption configuration of o3 on the al2o3 110 surface corresponded to an adsorption energy of δeads 1 83 ev fig 9 a was the molecular stable structure of o3 the o o single bond length was 1 28 å the bond angle was 118 20 as shown in fig 9b and table 5 the single oxygen atoms at both ends of the o3 molecule and the al atom sites on the al2o3 110 surface form the covalent bond al o 1 95 å with a longer al o bond length 1 87 å than that in the al2o3 structure in addition the o o bond length of o3 extended from 1 28 å to 1 34 å on the surface of al2o3 110 the changes of al o and o o bond lengths represented that o3 was susceptible to dissociation at the al site in fig 9c the yellow area indicated the distribution of valence electron density on the al2o3 110 surface the electrons were mainly concentrated on o atoms the isosurfaces level was 0 10 e å3 the results of bader method calculation of differential charge density showed that the electrons were transferred mainly from o3 to al the isosurfaces level was 0 05 e å3 fig 9d o3 was an electrophilic oxidizer with a high electron density on one oxygen atom in the resonance structure which would have a strong affinity with the lewis acid center on the surface of the metal oxide ouyang et al 2021 the chemisorbed o3 would decompose into atomic oxygen species at the lewis acid site of al3 thus triggering a chain reaction to produce oh which was consistent with the results of cheng et al 2020 the adsorption and decomposition of o3 molecules on the catalyst surface was associated with the lewis acid center which echoed the results of the higher total lewis acid site on the hdws surface in the previous section 3 6 the application potential of hdws o3 to improve was dewaterability the application of dws as a conditioner for conditioning was to enhance its dewaterability is an effective technology for the collaborative treatment of urban multi source sludge achieving multiple environmental benefits in terms of cost savings pollution reduction and carbon emission reduction hdws coupled with ozonation plays both physical skeleton and chemical catalysis roles during conditioning process which has been sought as an efficient and environmentally friendly sludge dewatering process in the research field lin et al 2015 qi et al 2011 the significant advantage of o3 is more environmentally friendly and easy to produce in suit the annual yield of dws is about 5 8 of was kang et al 2022 li et al 2022 which can be fully used to prepare hdws for conditioning was dewatering and saving the annual disposal cost of dws with the establishment and improvement of the integrated system of urban water supply and drainage dws and was are suitable for collaborative disposal moreover hdws replaced traditional conditioner polyacrylamide iron aluminum salt eliminating the need for conditioner purchase costs the cost analyses of dws o3 and hdws o3 dewatering processes was conducted without the consider of the labor and infrastructure cost the corresponding results were summarized in table s7 the entire cost of hdws o3 dewatering processes was 72 81 y t which was cheaper 10 70 y t 14 70 than the cost of dws o3 dewatering processes based on wc 80 and the wc of dewatered sludge cake was further reduced 9 78 the cost of dws or hdws coupled o3 for sludge dewatering were dramatically cheaper than the reported cost of fenton reagent with 339 00 y t liang et al 2020 or cao2 o3 with 129 90 y t based on wc 80 ge et al 2022 in general the application of hdws o3 enhanced sludge dewatering technology is economically feasible and promising it is worth noting that dws properties are strongly influenced by raw water quality and coagulant dosage and the application of more types iron rich salts and more dws samples are worth being explored in addition an increasing number of studies have confirmed that some emerging contaminants antibiotics resistance genes environmental hormones etc have been detected in sludge and are considered as a strong point released into the environment cai et al 2022 huang et al 2015 hence it is also important to focus on the abatement effect of emerging contaminants during the hdws o3 enhanced sludge dewatering process 4 conclusion this study investigated the performance and mechanisms of hdws used as a conditioner coupled with ozonation to enhance was dewaterability the main findings are as follows 1 the ph o3 and hdws dosages were systematically optimized hdws o3 could effectively reduce the cst and srf values of rs in the optimal conditions with the reduction rates of 75 64 and 86 37 corresponding to a further reduction volume of 37 85 0 92 2 the systematic analysis of the physicochemical properties of was and catalytic mechanism indicated that hdws acted as a physical skeleton to enhance the filtration performance during the conditioning process likewise it played a certain role in electrical neutralization and flocculation at ph 4 which was reflected in the increase of zeta potential and particle size as well as the more hydrophobic surface 3 hdws surface rich al3 lewis acid sites catalyzed ozonation to produce more oh and eps structure was destroyed to provide channels for internal moisture flow solubilization of organic matter components occurred from the ecps layer to emps layer and the pn secondary structure was unfolded exposing more hydrophobic sites and significantly converting the hmw distribution to lmw 4 correlation analysis revealed that the organic matter distribution in ecps was more likely to determine the dewatering performance of was than emps this study expands the resource utilization pathway of dws and the process selection of conditioning was dewatering meanwhile could serve as a basis for further application of more effective collaborative disposal of dws and was declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

14988,drinking water sludge dws and waste activated sludge was are usually treated separately with the continuous deepening understanding of the characteristics of two types sludge the research and application of the collaborative disposal is worth considering the heated modification dws hdws rich in inorganic matter and aluminum al2o3 can be used as a conditioner to enhance was dewaterability using its properties with physical skeleton and chemically catalyzed ozone o3 the results showed that the minimum values of capillary water time cst and specific resistance filtration srf for was were 20 9 2 40 s and 1 07 0 19 1013 m kg at ph 4 o3 dosage 60 mg g vs and hdws dosage 700 mg g vs corresponding to the reduction of sludge cake water content wc to 60 37 0 97 the mechanism of hdws o3 enhanced was dewaterability was systematically elucidated through pyridine infrared analysis and density functional theory dft calculations the surface of al2o3 in hdws had more lewis acidic sites and the oxygen atoms of o3 combined with al atoms to form al o bonds and undergo electron transfer while o3 molecules dissociated to produce more hydroxyl radicals oh with the oxidation of oh the extra microcolony cellular polymers emps ecps structure were destroyed and became looser promoting the conversion of internal moisture to free moisture zeta potential tended to zero particle size increased and the surface was more hydrophobic correlation analysis revealed that the component content protein pn secondary structure and molecular weight mw in ecps were positively and more strongly correlated with the sludge dewaterability compared to emps the discovery of hdws o3 applied to effectively enhance was dewaterability provided an inspiring perspective on the emerging dws and was co

generated from drinking water plants dwpts and wastewater plants wwpts in china the annual production of was has risen to 13 3 million tons dry sludge in 2020 ministry of housing and urban rural development china 2020 dws production is greatly affected by the quality of raw water it s approximately 1 5 2 4 million tons dry sludge kang et al 2022 was is produced by activated sludge process treating wastewater which is characterized with a large amount of hydrophilic organic matter the high water content difficult dewatering cao et al 2020 dws is a by product produced by adding coagulants or flocculants iron or aluminum salt in drinking water sources to remove turbidity color and natural organic matter salehin et al 2020 dws contains low organic matter and high inorganic content making it unsuitable for biodegradation and incineration the high concentration of metals makes it unfit for terrestrial applications xie et al 2021 dws also faces the problem of difficult dewatering due to the high content of bound water as the essential step for sludge treatments dewatering can minimize the sludge volume facilitate transportation and reduce costs wu et al 2020 resource utilization of dewatered sludge is an effective way to avoid secondary pollution and has become the focus of environmental pollution prevention chen et al 2020 was is a non homogeneous colloidal system extracellular polymeric substances eps with high water holding properties construct complex network spatial conformation and firmly capture plenty of water molecules it is difficult to complete solid liquid separation using mechanical pressure alone xu et al 2018 different intensified technologies physical chemical and biological conditioning have been developed advanced oxidation processes aops in chemical conditioning are widely recognized the main contributor may be the generation of free radicals to disintegrate sludge gel like structure for internal moisture transformation and drainage thereby ameliorating sludge dewaterability ge et al 2019 the typical aop processes with iron based catalyst activated oxidant hydrogen peroxide or persulfate shows good performance in enhanced sludge dewatering zhen et al 2018 but it prones a problem of catalyst dissolution and hydrogen peroxide oxidizer is a regulated hazardous chemical ozone o3 has the effect of efficient decomposition of sludge flocs without toxic by products and environmental friendly characteristics o3 molecules can selectively oxidize organic compounds abundant of special functional groups double bonds aromatic rings non protonated amines etc rapidly which is worthy of being applied and explored in enhanced sludge dewatering zhang et al 2016 however due to the insoluble property of o3 molecules a large number of heterogeneous catalysts have been developed to facilitate o3 decomposition to generate hydroxyl radicals oh with stronger oxidation and non selective wang and chen 2020 metal oxide such as mno2 fe based materials fe2o3 fe3o4 feooh aluminum based materials alooh al2o3 and other metal oxides tio2 zno and bimetallic polymetallic oxides have been shown to be effective in improving oh production in wastewater treatment nawaz et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 the mechanism of degradation of organic matter in wastewater treatment by catalytic oxidation mentioned above has been thoroughly investigated however was is rich in complex organic matter such as many proteins pn and polysaccharides ps and the concentration is much greater than that in wastewater these large molecules and strongly hydrophilic substances are the main bottleneck for the difficult dewatering of sludge therefore it is worthwhile to explore the application of the above catalysts in catalytic ozonation for was dewatering dws mainly contains inorganic components such as sio2 al2o3 with certain hardness and a small amount of organic components liu et al 2020 after dewatering it has a certain porosity and a large range of specific surface area reflecting excellent catalytic and adsorption properties du et al 2020 van truong and kim 2021 the modification and scientific reuse of dws in combination with its own characteristics is an important demand for sludge resource recovery currently dws is mainly used as an adsorbent for heavy metals phosphorus p and fluoride hou et al 2018 jing et al 2020 and as a coagulant in wastewater treatment and alternatives manufactured from ceramiste or building materials liu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 muruganandham et al 2007 compared the dws and several different metal zno tio2 al2o3 fe2o3 for the decomposition ability of o3 and confirm its effectiveness but the oxidation effect of pollutants was not revealled the application of dws for catalytic ozonation enhanced was dewatering performance deserves to be explored however adding dws directly to was might lead to the dissolution of organic matter in dws which is unconducive to dewatering based on the al2o3 rich characteristic of dws it has the potential advantage of catalyzing o3 after heated modification of dws hdws porous and skeletal structures are formed increasing the specific surface area to improve its stability and catalytic potential however there is still a lack of a comprehensive investigation concerning was handling with the combined hdws o3 process and the dewaterability of was and other physicochemical characteristics as well as the main chemical reaction mechanism in hdws o3 conditioning are still rarely understood the purpose of this study is to 1 prepare and characterize the hdws 2 investigate the effects of ph o3 dosage and hdws dosage on was dewaterability 3 further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the enhanced was dewaterability in terms of changes in physicochemical properties eps and correlation analysis 4 reveal the catalytic mechanism of hdws for o3 by pyridine infrared analysis and dft calculations finally the feasibility of engineering applications of realizing resource utilization of dws while enhancing the was dewaterability is discussed providing inspiration for the new strategy of the collaborative treatment of urban multi source sludge the flowchart of the study outline was provided in fig s1 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge characteristics the experimental sludge was obtained in the secondary settling tank of wastewater treatment system the sludge sample was left to settle for 6 h at 4 c to obtain the concentrated sludge rs with total solid ts of 21 82 0 12 g l volatile solids vs of 11 37 0 10 g l water content wc of 97 13 0 14 wt zeta potential of 18 37 0 21 mv and ph 6 98 0 04 the dws sample was produced in the drinking water treatment system the poly aluminum chloride with a basicity oh al of 1 03 was used as the coagulant it was obtained from the dewatering workshop with wc of 55 37 0 27 and ph 7 45 0 05 2 2 preparation of hdws the dws was dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h to remove moisture then ground and sieved through a 40 mesh screen for latter analysis and heated modification a portion of the dws was then calcined in a muffle furnace exposed to static air heated to 800 c with a ramp rate of 10 c min and held for 2 h the hdws was collected after cooling the product yield was determined to be 89 69 0 52 by three parallel tests the main compositions of dws and hdws were analyzed by x ray fluorescence xrf indicating that it contained a variety of metal and non metal oxides in different proportions as shown in table 1 the major portions of dws specimen had 11 45 0 15 organic matter 33 36 0 12 sio2 and 30 66 0 14 al2o3 followed by fe2o3 and cao hdws has the significantly higher contents of sio2 and al2o3 as 37 29 0 11 and 40 58 0 13 compared to dws which was content with the report by pham et al 2021 the point of zero charge phpzc of dws and hdws were 6 74 and 7 28 respectively 2 3 experimental procedure 500 ml rs was mixed with dws or hdws in the beakers and adjusted ph to the targeted values by 1 mol l hcl or 1 mol l naoh the mixture was then poured into a 2 0 l fully mixed closed reactor and o3 was injected at a flow rate of 1 l min through a porous silica diffuser at the bottom of the reactor for conditioning o3 was produced from oxygen by the laboratory ozone generator in order to fully mix rs dws or hdws and o3 the stirrer in the reactor was kept running during conditioning the whole conditioning time lasted for 30 min the o3 dosage controlled by adjusting o3 concentration the inlet and outflow o3 concentrations were constantly monitored by the digital o3 concentration detector o3 exhaust was absorbed by potassium iodide the schematic diagram of the ozonation and conditioning system was shown in fig s2 the specific experimental design of dws and hdws was shown in table 2 the effects of ph and dws or hdws dosage on the dewatering effect were explored firstly and the o3 dosage was optimized on this basis 2 4 analytical methods the characterizations of dws and hdws x ray fluorescence xrf x ray diffraction xrd fourier transformed infrared ftir scanning electron microscope sem brunauer emmett teller bet surface area and the pore characteristics were described in text s1 the dewatering performance capillary water time cst specific resistance filtration srf and moisture distribution physicochemical properties zeta potential particle size fractal dimension df and hydrophobicity of was were described in text s2 the layers of eps were classified into extra microcolony polymers emps and extra cellular polymers ecps which are defined as the exopolymers that mainly exist outside the microcolonies for floc formation and inside the microcolonies for microcolony aggregation respectively wang et al 2014 the extraction and the properties of epms and ecps component total organic carbon toc pn ps and humus hs content pn secondary structure and molecular weight mw were described in text s3 the detailed process of oh determination was shown in our previous report xiao et al 2021 all experiments were performed in triplicate with the standard deviations shown as error bars the pyridine infrared measurement was texted in text s4 the detailed description of the statistical analysis and the computational methods were given in text s5 and text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of dws and hdws 3 1 1 xrd and ftir analysis the crystalline properties of dws and hdws were examined by xrd analysis in fig 1 a the xrd pattern was analyzed and compared according to the standard data base library jcpds card in xrd patterns two distinctive characteristic peaks represent sio2 crystals in the range of 2θ from 20 to 30 the existence of sio2 in large amounts was confirmed by both xrf and xrd results which was consistent with the results reported in the literatures lin et al 2015 yang et al 2023 the crystalline substances were mainly sio2 al2o3 and fe2o3 and fe3al2 sio4 3 and naalsi3o8 were also found which was also confirmed by muruganandham et al 2007 it was found that combined with the results of pore structure and specific surface area in section 3 1 2 the presence of large amounts of inorganic particles such as sio2 can increased the size of dws or hdws and promote the formation of porous structure an increase in the peaks of al2o3 crystals could be found in the xrd pattern of hdws likewise tantawy 2015 proposed that the amount of al2o3 polymorphs increased when the temperature was increased to calcine dws above 700 c this was because during calcination the crystallization and dehydration processes increase the crystallinity of the amorphous aluminum salts and transform them into crystalline al2o3 which could improve the catalytic o3 effect the ftir spectra of dws and hdws were illustrated in fig 1b the spectral bonds and the corresponding functional groups in ftir spectrum were identified according to the relevant literature and detailed in table s1 soleha et al 2016 tantawy 2015 the strong and broad absorption band at wavenumber 3442 cm 1 was the stretching vibration of o h connected to al the peak at 1627 cm 1 corresponded to the structural characteristic peak of the aluminum hydroxy complex which was associated with the h o h bending vibration in the coordination water molecules these peaks decrease in intensity in hdws indicating alumina dehydroxide oxidation the peak at wavenumber at 1432 cm 1 was belonged to stretching vibrations of the c o groups in carbonaceous mineral or carbonate the band disappeared in hdws might be caused by the loss of inorganic carbon the absorption peak at 1025 1060 cm 1 and 789 cm 1 were attributed to the symmetrical stretching vibration of si o si and bending vibration of o si o in dws and hdws remained present in hdws confirming the stability of the sio2 phase as also shown with xrd the peak at 911 cm 1 was assigned to al o h bending vibration and disappeared in hdws with mineral dehydroxylation the peaks at 462 cm 1 and 526 cm 1 were caused by the asymmetric bending vibration of the si o si and si o al the absorption bands at 526 cm 1 diminished the intensity of the absorption peaks at 462 cm 1 increased after heated treatment in hdws indicating that si o si remained stable at 800 and its proportion in hdws increased due to the moisture loss ftir analysis showed that the functional groups in dws were mainly related to the silica crystals and coagulant aluminum salt it contained 3 1 2 sem bet and pore structure analysis the morphologies of dws and hdws were observed by sem at different magnification as shown in fig 2 fig 2a c depicted sem images of dws at 5 μm and 1 μm magnification revealed that a large number of inhomogeneous rough particles on dws surface ling et al 2017 sem image clearly demonstrated that hdws had a distinct porous structure fig 2b d which might contribute to the adsorption of o3 on surface the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of dws and hdws were the type iv isotherms fig 2e the pore size distributions of dws and hdws were shown in fig 2f the pore size is in the mesoporous range 2 50 nm which enhanced the proximity of o3 molecules to the active sites in their pore channels and improved the catalytic performance the sbet total pore volume vt and average pore diameter dp of hdws were higher than dws with detailed data of 30 6 and 82 18 m2 g 0 14 and 0 25 cm3 g 3 72 and 5 75 nm respectively table s2 after high temperature calcination of hdws the residual metal oxides were more fully distributed on the surface forming a porous structure increasing the specific surface area and pore volume the results indicated that hdws had larger surface area and well developed pore structure compared to dws suggesting an increase in surface active sites and the conduction potential to o3 molecules adsorbed on hdws surface xiao et al 2021 this was expected to lead to more improved catalytic effects 3 2 effects on was dewatering performance 3 2 1 dewatering performance cst and srf were adopted as the dependent variables to explore the influence of ph dws or hdws dosage and o3 dosage on dewatering performance of was and optimize the conditions of dws o3 and hdws o3 process figs s3 and 3 the effect of dws o3 on dewatering performance was described in text s7 as shown in fig 3a adding hwds alone without adjusting ph could slightly reduce the cst and srf values from 85 8 2 10 s and 7 85 0 15 1013 m kg of rs to 70 5 2 5 s and 5 48 0 14 1013 m kg the cst and srf values decreased to 56 9 1 9 s and 4 09 0 14 1013 m kg at ph 2 the dewatering performance would be deteriorated under the alkaline condition at ph 8 which was consistent with the results reported by he et al 2017 further adding o3 as 60 mg g vs it was found that the cst and srf minimum values were got as 20 9 2 4 s and 1 07 0 19 1013 m kg under ph 4 fig 3b the reduction rates reached 75 64 and 86 37 the effects of o3 and hdws dosage on cst and srf values were shown in fig 3c d and described in detail in text s8 the optimal conditions for hdws o3 to enhance the dewatering performance of was were ph 4 o3 dosage 60 mg g vs and hdws dosage 700 mg g vs for dws o3 process the optimal conditions were ph 2 o3 dosage 75 mg g vs and hdws dosage 900 mg g vs as depicted in fig 3e the cst and srf values were significantly increased to 167 8 2 40 s conditioned by o3 alone 60 mg g vs suggesting the deteriorated dewaterability of ozonized sludge which was due to the solubilization of negatively charged organic matters and decrease the particle size ge et al 2019 xiao et al 2021 interestingly with the coupled dws o3 and hdws o3 treatment sludge dewaterability was pronouncedly improved the wc of dewatered sludge cake reduced to 70 15 1 05 and 60 37 0 97 corresponding to a further reduction volume of 27 78 0 85 and 37 85 0 92 respectively fig 3f the speculative reason was that dws or hdws coupled with o3 under ph 2 or 4 formed a new pluralistic system in which the systemic oxidizability was reinforced alum ion could bind the sites on the decomposed biopolymers fragments weakening the affinity of eps for water molecules li et al 2012 moreover the effective reduction of srf indicated that the inorganic particles in dws or hdws provided friction and extrusion for crushed sludge and improved the porosity of sludge cake as a skeleton accelerator with the water content decreasing during the filtration process li et al 2016 apparently hdws o3 ph 4 could enhance the dewatering performance of rs more significantly compared with dws o3 ph 2 indicating that the acidity required for conditioning could be ameliorated while improving sludge dewatering performance 3 2 2 moisture distribution the moisture distribution of rs conditioned by o3 dws o3 and hdws o3 was tested in fig 4 and table s3 the transition of different moisture types was another important indicator to characterize sludge dewatering effect zhang et al 2019 according to the calculation of the thermal drying curve the free moisture fm interstitial moisture im surface moisture sm and bound moisture bm proportions of rs were 74 18 0 03 16 35 0 04 7 64 0 05 and 1 83 0 04 respectively fig 4a most of the water in was was fm or im at high water content above 90 but the bm was the main bottleneck problem in the process of further reducing the moisture content reduced to below 80 fm was desorbed easily in dewatering whereas the separation of bm needed more energy input in mechanical pressure filtration because it is tightly bound to eps or other sludge components by adhesive forces and or chemical bonds cai et al 2018 in fig 4b o3 conditioned the fm and im decreased by 0 36 and 0 30 while the content of sm and bm increased slightly by 3 25 and 0 66 symbolizing the deterioration of the dewatering performance ge et al 2020 o3 conditioning alone would allow the sludge to be oxidized to smaller fine particles providing some surface area which in turn would absorb a part of the moisture zhang et al 2016 dws o3 and hdws o3 conditioning under their optimal conditions increased the fm content to 77 13 0 02 and 81 26 0 02 and im sm and bm contents were reduced to different degrees fig 4c d obviously hdws o3 conditioning was more effective in improving dewatering performance and the bm content decreased to 0 99 0 02 correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between cst and bm content r 0 980 p 0 05 srf and im content r 0 954 p 0 05 table s4 the highest fm content and the lowest bm content implied that the sludge flocs were destroyed releasing internal moisture and realizing the moisture conversion into more fm the combination of cst and srf values were significantly reduced the feasibility and effectiveness of hdws o3 conditioning was could be clarified 3 3 effects on physicochemical properties the physicochemical properties of sludge were investigated after conditioned by o3 dws o3 and hdws o3 the sludge dewaterability was usually determined by these properties li et al 2020 was is abundant in negatively charged organic substances they are stabilized by electrostatic repulsion preventing water flow zeta potential can reflect the electrical charge content in sludge flocs as seen in fig 5 a the zeta potential of the o3 conditioned was significantly lower than that of rs decreasing from 18 37 0 21 mv to 25 69 0 35 mv this was attributable to the destruction of eps structure by ozonation which increased the exposure of anionic groups amino groups and carboxyl groups ge et al 2019 surprisingly the zeta potential up to 0 56 0 08 mv dramatically after hdws o3 ph 4 conditioning proving that the negative charge density and repulsion between sludge particles decreased probably because the hdws o3 could induce peroxone reaction to produce more radicals to degrade and mineralize the released extracellular negatively charged biopolymers dissolved positively charged metal ions were released into the liquid phase from the sludge system under acidic conditions for charge neutralization the multi charged cations could agglomerate sludge floc particles and inhibit their brownian motion reducing vicinal water content the previous study had also demonstrated that sludge flocs become denser and easier to compress with al3 addition li et al 2012 in table s4 the zeta potential was significantly and positively correlated with srf r 0 986 p 0 05 as depicted in fig 5b the particle size distribution observed after oxidation with o3 was significantly lower compared to rs this would increase the resistance during filtration while the released hydrophilic organic compounds tend to bind more water molecules therefore an effective combination of ozonation and conditioner was usually necessary ge et al 2019 yu et al 2018 the particle size d10 d50 d90 of the sludge samples conditioned by dws o3 and hdws o3 were increased all in particular d90 increased from 49 58 0 58 to 95 91 0 97 µm d50 increased from 19 36 1 37 to 35 64 1 33 µm by hdws o3 conditioning which could effectively flocculate the sludge flocs the effect of sludge particle size on dewatering is still controversial and some studies have shown that even a decrease in particle size does not lead to poor dewaterability ge et al 2022 zhang et al 2016 the increase or decrease of particle size depends on whether the oxidation reaction mineralizes more hydrophilic substrates and counteracts the negative effect the disruption of hydrophilic groups and water bonds may be responsible for the improved dewaterability and the composition and transformation of hydrophilic organic matters in eps layers were further analyzed and discussed in later sections the df value changed from 2 49 to 2 19 fig 5c the decrease in df values represented the sludge flocs structure became looser and more porous enhancing the mobility of internal molecules and water this was consistent with the conversion of bm and sm to fm correlation analysis table s4 showed that df was highly significantly and positively correlated with cst r 0 998 p 0 01 and bm r 0 967 p 0 05 the relative hydrophobicity was characterized by measuring the contact angle of the sludge surface to calculate the surface free energy δgadh jin et al 2004 a more negative value of δgadh meant that the sludge surface was more hydrophobic with o3 conditioning δgadh increased from 10 60 to 14 74 mj m2 fig 5d and table s6 indicating that the sludge had a more hydrophilic surface increasing the bm content of was and reducing dewaterability which was line with the results of zhang et al 2016 the δgadh value dropped rapidly and became more negative to 35 14 and 51 61 mj m2 when conditioned by dws o3 and hdws o3 which indicates that hydrophobic interaction was the main interaction force under this condition the higher hydrophobicity was mainly responsible for enhancing dewaterability the enhanced hydrophobicity of was is attributed to the dissolution and oxidation of hydrophilic organic matters which reduces the binding force between sludge flocs and water more correlation analysis showed that an extremely significant positive correlations of δgadh with both cst r 0 998 p 0 01 and srf r 0 993 p 0 01 which had been confirmed by chen et al 2022 moreover δgadh also showed a significant positive correlation with im r 0 983 p 0 05 table s4 which is consistent with the results of increased im content the measurement and analysis of the above physicochemical properties further verified the effectiveness of hdws o3 conditioning was to achieve enhanced dewaterability 3 4 effects on the distribution and composition of eps 3 4 1 toc pn ps and hs contents fig 6 explored the toc pn ps and hs content changed in emps and ecps compared with rs conditioned by o3 dws o3 and hdws o3 contained fewer organic compounds in ecps than those in emps specifically fig 6a showed that the toc content gradually increased in ecps and the emps exhibited an opposite trend hdws o3 had the most obvious conditioning effect and the toc content in the total eps increased to 24 94 mg g vs fig 6b d the pn content in emps and ecps layers was significantly higher than that of ps and hs and was the main component of eps it was generally accepted that the dewaterability of was is more influenced by the distribution and specific molecular structure of extracellular pn than ps and hs bai et al 2021 pn and ps content gradually decreased in ecps and increased in emps after o3 dws o3 and hdws o3 conditioning the pn and ps content in emps increased with the improvement of oxidative properties in the conditioning system it was obvious that the emps becoming the dominant fraction of oxidation sludge eps these results indicated that oxidative conditioning promoted the polymeric substances transformed from the inner layer ecps to the outer layer emps accompanied by the oxidative degradation of macromolecules to more small molecules matter and structural changes xiao et al 2021 the ratio of pn ps in ecps showed a decreasing trend which meant a contribution to the increase in hydrophobicity and positive charges wu et al 2020 consistent with the results of zeta potential and δgadh fig 5 correlation analysis revealed that toc and pn were significantly and positively correlated with both cst and srf in ecps layer r 0 965 p 0 05 table s4 and s5 toc pn and ps all showed highly significant positive correlations with im r 0 957 p 0 05 on the contrary toc pn had no significant correlation with cst and srf r 0 898 p 0 05 ps was negatively correlated with cst and srf r 0 705 p 0 05 toc pn and ps showed high negatively correlated with im r 0 965 p 0 05 the change of hs content was increased both in emps and ecps layer fig 6d and hs was reported to have no significant effect on sludge dewatering performance sheng et al 2010 3 4 2 pn secondary structure not only dosage pn content exert a significant influence on sludge dewaterability but also the spatial structure of pn more insight into the mechanism of enhanced sludge dewaterability through the analysis of pn secondary structure bai et al 2021 fig s4 and table 3 summarized the variations of four representative structure α helix β sheet β turn and random coil in emps and ecps as determined by cd spectral the proportions of α helix and β sheet were predominated in ecps of rs while the proportion of random coil was converse table 3 the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil was usually applied to assess pn structural tightness which was larger in ecps than in emps indicating that the pn structure in ecps was tighter the pn secondary structure was changed in both emps and ecps layers after the various conditioning obviously the relative content of α helix declined distinctly following the order hdws o3 dws o3 o3 rs the presence of α helix was thought to prevent the elimination of moisture from the sludge flocs because α helix was retained by the hydrogen bond between the amide hydrogen and the carbonyl oxygen of the peptide bond zhu et al 2020 simultaneously the decreased degree of β turn and α helix β sheet random coil were roughly in agreement with that of α helix both in emps and ecps β turn is a reverse rotational conformation connecting α helix and β sheet the reduction of the two spatial conformations suggested that the pn polypeptide was disrupted and the complex multilevel structure deconvoluted becoming looser meanwhile the increase of β sheet and random coil is not negligible the higher content of β sheet indicated that the hydrogen bond was destroyed after ozonation treatment so that the non polar residues hidden inside and more hydrophobic sites were continuously exposed the increase in the proportion of random coils meant that the pn molecular structure was unfolded and the disorder was enhanced simultaneously for enhanced sludge dewaterability li et al 2020 significant correlations were found between α helix and β turn with toc pn and ps contents r 0 954 p 0 05 in ecps and the opposite relationship in emps tables s4 and s5 in emps it showed that β sheet react a highly significant positive correlation with pn r 0 995 p 0 01 the most prominent effect of hdws o3 conditioning was the reduction of the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil from 0 24 and 0 26 to 0 10 and 0 06 in emps and ecps layers it had been reported that the key to reducing the hydrophilicity of microbial aggregates was the destruction of α helix and the aggregation and folding of stretched polypeptide chains wu et al 2017 3 4 3 mw distribution high molecular weight hmw eps endowed sludge flocs with more stable structure and water molecular adsorption sites xu et al 2017 in fig 7 the mw distribution of the components in ecps was concentrated in the range of 100 1000 kda liu et al 2016 pointed out that organic matter with molecular weights between 100 1000 kda contributed significantly to the sludge dewatering performance and the high content of this fraction leaded to poor dewaterability after conditioning by o3 dws o3 and hdws o3 the mw in emps was significantly reduced especially the components with mw 1000 kda were oxidized to lower mw lmw components the percentage of emps and ecps components with mw 1000 kda disappeared after hdws o3 conditioning while the content of components with mw of 0 100 kda and 100 500 kda increased to 40 32 and 43 57 respectively it been reported that oh generated by oxidative conditioning react with the soluble fraction of sludge to oxidize the hydrophilic hmw proteins to lmw proteins and the dewatering performance was positively and strongly correlated with the percentage of lmw proteins in eps inner layer zhu et al 2020 in ecps 500 1000 kda and 1000 kda were significantly positively correlated with pn α helix and β turn r 0 981 p 0 05 0 100 kda was highly positively correlated with β sheet both in emps and ecps r 0 960 p 0 05 pn structure and mw were the factors that directly affect the organic content in eps xiao et al 2022 to sum up combining all the above correlation analyses it was found that the components and pn structures and mw in ecps correlated positively and more strongly with the sludge dewatering performance indicating that the ecps layer had a higher effect on the enhanced sludge dewatering performance than emps layer 3 5 mechanisms of enhanced catalytic ozonation by hdws 3 5 1 oh generation the oh generated in the catalytic ozone oxidation system has been proved to be a possible major contributor to enhanced sludge dewaterability disrupting the eps structure to provide a channel for moisture flow ge et al 2022 the ability of dws and hdws to catalyze ozonation to produce oh was determined at different reaction times as seen in fig 8 dws and hdws rapidly generated oh within 1 5 min and then the oh production increased with the reaction time this phenomenon proved that o3 was continuously decomposed to produce more oh during the sludge conditioning process hdws exhibited higher ozonolysis efficiency than dws and produced higher oh concentration the oh yield reached to 0 76 0 01 mm and 0 57 0 01 mm at 30 min it was indicated that hdws could significantly contributed to catalytic o3 decomposition in the sludge system and further illustrated the better catalytic performance of hdws 3 5 2 pyridine ftir analysis lewis acid sites were easily formed on the surface of heterogeneous catalyst metal oxide al2o3 which could accelerate the ozonation decomposition rate bing et al 2015 after degassing at 200 c the acid sites of dws and hdws were determined by ftir of pyridine adsorption fig s5 both dws and hdws exhibited two strong ir bands at 1447 and 1608 cm 1 attributed to pyridine adsorbed on lewis acid sites the ir bands appeared at 1447 cm 1 was associated with the surface concentration of pyridine and attributed to strong lewis sites cortez elizalde et al 2022 the band at 1488 cm 1 was assigned to pyridine adsorbed on lewis acid sites the band at 1575 cm 1 corresponded to the weak lewis sites it could be seen that the intensity and area of the peaks in the pyridine infrared spectrum are higher for hdws compared to dws furthermore no peak was observed for the characteristic signal indicating the production of bronsted acid sites by any metal oxides in the pyridine ftir spectra which might be due to the presence of more species and different metal oxide coordination on the dws and hdws surfaces propagating the formation of lewis sites cortez elizalde et al 2022 the quantitative estimation of total and strong lewis acid sites of dws and hdws degassed at 200 c and 350 c was performed according to the method described by emeis et al 1993 table 4 summarized that the total lewis acid sites on the surface of dws and hdws were 41 18 and 106 74 μmol g and the medium strong acid sites were 30 15 and 94 59 μmol g respectively the relatively high content of al2o3 enriched in hdws increased the number of lewis sites romero toledo et al 2018 some studies indicates that this might be attributed to the substitution of hydrogen by al in the si oh group on the surface of sio2 bing et al 2015 the presence of lewis acid sites increased phpzc which was consistent with the result that the phpzc of hdws was 7 28 greater than that of dws at 6 74 3 5 3 dft calculation the action mechanism between o3 and the surface configuration of al2o3 the major metal oxides with catalytic properties enriched on the surface of hdws was further determined by dft calculations the dft calculation was achieved by electrostatic effects and electron density which had emerged as a method for exploring catalyst activity jiang et al 2021 firstly the possible configurations of o3 adsorption on al2o3 110 surface were comprehensively modeled with five configurations fig s6 the adsorption energy δeads ev was used to express the binding strength between the adsorbed o3 molecule and the catalyst surface a negative and higher absolute value represented a more stable adsorption structure the calculated results showed that the optimal adsorption configuration of o3 on the al2o3 110 surface corresponded to an adsorption energy of δeads 1 83 ev fig 9 a was the molecular stable structure of o3 the o o single bond length was 1 28 å the bond angle was 118 20 as shown in fig 9b and table 5 the single oxygen atoms at both ends of the o3 molecule and the al atom sites on the al2o3 110 surface form the covalent bond al o 1 95 å with a longer al o bond length 1 87 å than that in the al2o3 structure in addition the o o bond length of o3 extended from 1 28 å to 1 34 å on the surface of al2o3 110 the changes of al o and o o bond lengths represented that o3 was susceptible to dissociation at the al site in fig 9c the yellow area indicated the distribution of valence electron density on the al2o3 110 surface the electrons were mainly concentrated on o atoms the isosurfaces level was 0 10 e å3 the results of bader method calculation of differential charge density showed that the electrons were transferred mainly from o3 to al the isosurfaces level was 0 05 e å3 fig 9d o3 was an electrophilic oxidizer with a high electron density on one oxygen atom in the resonance structure which would have a strong affinity with the lewis acid center on the surface of the metal oxide ouyang et al 2021 the chemisorbed o3 would decompose into atomic oxygen species at the lewis acid site of al3 thus triggering a chain reaction to produce oh which was consistent with the results of cheng et al 2020 the adsorption and decomposition of o3 molecules on the catalyst surface was associated with the lewis acid center which echoed the results of the higher total lewis acid site on the hdws surface in the previous section 3 6 the application potential of hdws o3 to improve was dewaterability the application of dws as a conditioner for conditioning was to enhance its dewaterability is an effective technology for the collaborative treatment of urban multi source sludge achieving multiple environmental benefits in terms of cost savings pollution reduction and carbon emission reduction hdws coupled with ozonation plays both physical skeleton and chemical catalysis roles during conditioning process which has been sought as an efficient and environmentally friendly sludge dewatering process in the research field lin et al 2015 qi et al 2011 the significant advantage of o3 is more environmentally friendly and easy to produce in suit the annual yield of dws is about 5 8 of was kang et al 2022 li et al 2022 which can be fully used to prepare hdws for conditioning was dewatering and saving the annual disposal cost of dws with the establishment and improvement of the integrated system of urban water supply and drainage dws and was are suitable for collaborative disposal moreover hdws replaced traditional conditioner polyacrylamide iron aluminum salt eliminating the need for conditioner purchase costs the cost analyses of dws o3 and hdws o3 dewatering processes was conducted without the consider of the labor and infrastructure cost the corresponding results were summarized in table s7 the entire cost of hdws o3 dewatering processes was 72 81 y t which was cheaper 10 70 y t 14 70 than the cost of dws o3 dewatering processes based on wc 80 and the wc of dewatered sludge cake was further reduced 9 78 the cost of dws or hdws coupled o3 for sludge dewatering were dramatically cheaper than the reported cost of fenton reagent with 339 00 y t liang et al 2020 or cao2 o3 with 129 90 y t based on wc 80 ge et al 2022 in general the application of hdws o3 enhanced sludge dewatering technology is economically feasible and promising it is worth noting that dws properties are strongly influenced by raw water quality and coagulant dosage and the application of more types iron rich salts and more dws samples are worth being explored in addition an increasing number of studies have confirmed that some emerging contaminants antibiotics resistance genes environmental hormones etc have been detected in sludge and are considered as a strong point released into the environment cai et al 2022 huang et al 2015 hence it is also important to focus on the abatement effect of emerging contaminants during the hdws o3 enhanced sludge dewatering process 4 conclusion this study investigated the performance and mechanisms of hdws used as a conditioner coupled with ozonation to enhance was dewaterability the main findings are as follows 1 the ph o3 and hdws dosages were systematically optimized hdws o3 could effectively reduce the cst and srf values of rs in the optimal conditions with the reduction rates of 75 64 and 86 37 corresponding to a further reduction volume of 37 85 0 92 2 the systematic analysis of the physicochemical properties of was and catalytic mechanism indicated that hdws acted as a physical skeleton to enhance the filtration performance during the conditioning process likewise it played a certain role in electrical neutralization and flocculation at ph 4 which was reflected in the increase of zeta potential and particle size as well as the more hydrophobic surface 3 hdws surface rich al3 lewis acid sites catalyzed ozonation to produce more oh and eps structure was destroyed to provide channels for internal moisture flow solubilization of organic matter components occurred from the ecps layer to emps layer and the pn secondary structure was unfolded exposing more hydrophobic sites and significantly converting the hmw distribution to lmw 4 correlation analysis revealed that the organic matter distribution in ecps was more likely to determine the dewatering performance of was than emps this study expands the resource utilization pathway of dws and the process selection of conditioning was dewatering meanwhile could serve as a basis for further application of more effective collaborative disposal of dws and was declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

14989,in the era of the current epidemic it is urgent to control pathogens in sewage eliminate the source of infection and optimize the technology for killing pathogens combining calcium peroxide cao2 with sunlight is considered a potentially efficient economical and eco friendly method for pathogen contaminated water remediation this paper evaluated the solar activating properties of cao2 for inactivating pathogenic indicators and explored the roles of reactive species contributing to pathogen inactivation moreover these reactive species average steady state concentrations and second order reaction rate were tentatively explored and mechanistic model for photoinactivation were establishment pathogen s inactivation was mainly attributed to direct photoinactivation 13 50 and exogenous indirect mechanisms with corresponding contributions of reactive species i e oh 14 23 1o2 12 28 oh 20 32 o2 12 16 and h2o2 6 11 furthermore cell membrane rupture and dna damage were observed by transmission electron microscopy tem and agarose gel electrophoresis age experiments among experiments on common aqueous constituents influencing photoinactivation copper and iron ions were found to promote a pathogen inactivating ability of the system while fulvic acids fa and humic acid ha had the opposite effect this study revealed the potential of cao2 sunlight to inactivate pathogens and laid a foundation for its application in inactivating pathogens in surface water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photoinactivation calcium peroxide reactive species surface water second order reaction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a lack of safe drinking water and proper sanitation is the world s most significant cause of water borne disease accounting for 2 million deaths annually pruss ustun et al 2019 identifying environmental pathogens that affect human health and taking corresponding preventive intervention measures is of utmost concern to protect the population s health as early as 1878 humans discovered that ultraviolet rays uv in sunlight have sterilization and disinfection effects uv can destroy the nucleic acid of bacteria and viruses causing them to decompose denature and lose their normal functions resulting in the death or mutation of bacteria and viruses photons in the uvb range 280 320 nm mainly cause endogenous direct damage while photons in the uvb and uva range 320 400 nm may involve endogenous indirect damage however in the full wavelength sunlight the photons in the uvb uva and visible light 400 700 nm light region mainly cause exogenous damage nelson et al 2018 when endogenous or exogenous chromophores absorb photons and sensitize photo produced reactive intermediates ppri these intermediates can damage pathogenic components resulting in indirect inactivation nelson et al 2018 wenk et al 2019 moreover in most natural waters uv wavelength is strongly attenuated by colored dissolved organic matter cdom with the increase of light attenuation the light inactivation of uvb is greatly attenuated and uva and visible light become relatively important nelson et al 2018 photoinactivation has always been the focus of researchers due to the advantages of sunlight eco friendly widespread existence and free access indirect exogenous inactivation played a leading role in open water process wetlands owws which was found to simultaneously induce a photolysis of torcs jasper et al 2013 and photoinactivation of pathogens wenk et al 2019 using sunlight however the sterilization efficiency of photoinactivation by sunlight alone is quite minimal and changes in sunlight intensity due to seasonality and weather conditions clouds rain haziness etc make photoinactivation potential variable a concomitant use of techniques such as oxidation and solidification may be effective method for enhancing the capacity of photoinactivation tang et al 2021 calcium peroxide cao2 is a solid oxidant which can transform to generate h2o2 o2 ca oh 2 and trace reactive oxygen radicals when in contact with water liu et al 2021 qiu et al 2022 xue et al 2020 it was recently found that cao2 acts as an eco friendly disinfectant killing 90 of e coli escherichia coli s aureus staphylococcus aureus and vcsm13 escherichia coli specific m13 bacteriophage virus within 120 minutes qiu et al 2022 however there are natural conditions such as the significant influence of sunlight were not taken into account meanwhile the use of cao2 alone may exist problems such as large consumption long time required for inactivation and possible changes in water quality e g excess usage of cao2 may increase water hardiness turbidity and ph or cause scaling cao2 has been reported to have a relatively high photochemical activity and can be photoexcited to promote the photolysis of pollutants kaewdee et al 2016 with co exposure of sunlight and cao2 capable of producing more active free radicals mattle et al 2015 nelson et al 2018 the combination of cao2 and sunlight may greatly reduce the amount of cao2 thereby avoiding its adverse effect on water quality moreover the mechanistic effect of cao2 inactivation of pathogens when co exposed to sunlight and overall photoinactivation efficiency has not been well characterized to better understand the photoinactivation of pathogens in cao2 sunlight conditions and its potential use as a new water treatment technology the objectives were to assess the 1 effect of cao2 under various exposure concentrations 2

3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of cao2 dose and sunlight on pathogen photoinactivation e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were effectively inactivated by cao2 sunlight fig 1 reveals the inactivation efficiency escalated with increasing irradiation time with cao2 dosage at 1 0 1 0 and 2 0 mm achieving 100 photoinactivation of e coli s aureus and vcsm13 respectively within 30 min fig 1 a b c the inactivation efficiency of pathogens under a concomitant exposure of cao2 and sunlight was greatly improved compared to cao2 alone as previously reported qiu et al 2022 with the synergistic effect of sunlight and cao2 the sterilization efficiency of e coli increased by 75 400 the sharp drop in number of pathogens under cao2 sunlight were most likely that more hrs has been generated relative to cao2 alone qiu et al 2022 zheng et al 2019 including ca oh 2 1o2 h2o2 oh oh and o2 reaction 16 21 notable photoinactivation is caused by a combination of both indirect and direct inactivation liu et al 2019 indirect inactivation is mainly the inactivation via free radicals generated in vivo and in vitro including sunlight mediated cao2 and dom in sw and sunlight mediated pathogens nelson et al 2018 furthermore the inactivation kinetics of e coli s aureus and vcsm13 followed first order decay kinetics r2 0 90 with the inactivation rate constants k increasing with increasing cao2 dosage while the increases seemed to be retarded after 1 0 mm cao2 dosage for e coli and s aureus and 2 0 mm for vcsm13 in addition to the required 100 photoinactivation of pathogens fig 1 a b c considering that excessive cao2 dosage may cause adverse effects on water environment such as possible increase in water hardness ph turbidity etc as well as the economy of cao2 consumption we chose the most suitable cao2 dosage at 1 0 mm 1 0 mm and 2 0 mm for inactivating bacteria and vcsm13 respectively 16 c a o 2 2 h 2 o c a o h 2 h 2 o 2 17 2 c a o 2 2 h 2 o 2 c a o h 2 o 2 18 h 2 o 2 h v 2 o h 19 o h h 2 o 2

structures such as cell wall thickness and the number of peptidoglycan layers all affect the photoinactivation process the simpler the microstructure of microorganisms the easier it is for oxides such as oh to reduce the possibility of their survival qiu et al 2022 3 2 inactivated pathogens mechanism under cao2 sunlight 3 2 1 effect of cao2 hydrolysates on pathogens photoinactivation the inactivation rate of all pathogens was reached at nearly 100 within 20 minutes under sunlight ca oh 2 fig 2 a b c among the hydrolyzed products ca oh 2 had the most outstanding contribution to the photoinactivation rate likely due to the existence of oh in addition to reactive species generated from sunlight irradiated sw the o2 in ca oh 2 surface adsorbed may capture photoexcited electrons to produce reactive species e g o2 oh etc zhang 2014 the significant increase in the k from sunlight h2o2 compared to the control group sunlight suggests that oh and h2o2 played important roles during cao2 sunlight inactivation as h2o2 alone was confirmed to contribute to photoinactivation with a much lower k value previous investigations reported the effect of ca2 was negligible qiu et al 2022 while a promotion of photoinactivation by cacl2 may be enhanced by the formation of cloh cl cl2 qiu et al 2022 fig 2 3 2 2 identification of the main reactive species in cao2 sunlight epr signals showed peaks with an intensity 1 2 2 1 of dmpo oh fig s11 b which demonstrates the presence of oh the peaks with an intensity 1 1 1 1 of dmpo o2 fig s11 c demonstrates the generation of o2 the trilinear signals at a 1 1 1 height ratio fig s11 d were recognized as an adduct of temp 1o2 which indicates the generation of 1o2 the function of alkalinization and oxidation were further quantified by scavenging each ros with a quencher those treated with pbs had a decreased inactivation efficiency by nearly 28 59 fig 3 a for ipa cat and ipa sod treated the inactivation efficiency decreased by nearly 50 83 h2o2 accounted for 15 30 o2 accounted for 30 53 respectively fig 3 b the function of oxidation was much higher than that of alkalinity which suggests the inactivation mechanism of pathogens may be strongly related to h2o2 oh o2 and 1o2 3 2 3 contribution of direct photoinactivation to pathogens inactivation the difference in the photoinactivation rate constants k of e coli in pure water k 0 00183 s 1 and sw k 0 00216 s 1 was very small indicating that direct photoinactivation of pathogens was less affected by the matrix in sw herein the equivalent steady state quantum yields of pathogens inactivation are calculated using eq 6 in pure water system and shown in fig 5g φ p ss 0 560 for e coli φ p ss 0 311 for s aureus and φ p ss 0 623 for vcsm13 total specific rate of sunlight absorption by target pathogen k s p under cao2 sunlight was calculated using eq 5 and 7 fig 4f thus the calculated k direct of pathogens eq 8 under cao2 sunlight were about 1 88 19 5 10 4 min 1 cao2 0 5 2 0 mm changes in absorbance α λ beam attenuation coefficient s λ molar extinction coefficient ε λ and k d i r e c t in cao2 sunlight are shown in fig s12 furthermore the contributions of sunlight to inactivation of e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were about 15 3 39 6 13 2 46 2 and 40 5 50 2 respectively cao2 0 5 2 0 mm the intensity of sunlight contribution decreased with the increase of cao2 input therefore the sunlight induced pseudo first order rate constants account for 13 50 cao2 0 5 2 0 mm of k in cao2 sunlight 3 2 4 determination of hrs concentration and its reaction rate

fig s9 and the corresponding average steady state hrs oh ss h2o2 ss o2 ss 1o2 ss and oh ss are shown in fig 4 and table s2 the range of oh ss was 2 87 81 4 10 8 m cao2 0 1 2 0 mm fig 4a 0 t o h dt showed a good linear fit within 3 h r2 0 99 fig s10a the range of h2o2 ss was 7 13 153 10 5 m cao2 0 1 2 0 mm fig 4b 0 t h 2 o 2 d t showed a good linear fit within 3 h r2 0 95 fig s10b the range of

fit with r2 0 95 fig 4e oh ss ranged from 2 91 15 9 10 15 m for 0 1 2 0 mm of cao2 which showed a good linear fit with r2 0 92 fig 4d the apparent k h r s c of pathogens is shown in fig 5f the k oh p of e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were about 5 51 2 11 109 3 52 3 16 109 and 9 95 6 05 109 m 1 s 1 respectively the apparent k oh p of pathogens was close to the diffusion limit with oh previously shown to react very rapidly with most biomolecules at 109 m 1 s 1 bianco et al 2017 oh is a highly reactive and non selective oxidant which in principle can react with all amino acid side chains and trunks lundeen et al 2014 initiating chain reactions to exacerbate pathogenic damage the k 1 o 2 p fitting result of e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were about 17 1 12 8 106 4 64 3 32 106 and 9 27 7 38 106 m 1 s 1 respectively 1o2 can oxidize protein side chains to destroy viral coats and bacterial membranes causing genome damage and protein damage at the same time moreover values of k h 2 o 2 p k o h p and k o h p were decreased in sequence fig 5g in addition oh h2o2 and o2 were reported to be involved in reactive oxygen species ros response which may spread to the cell membrane to cause indirect endogenous damage increasing the inactivation rate of pathogens seaver and imlay 2001 according to this model the calculated k for oh inactivate e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were about 18 7 14 5 10 4 6 05 4 65 10 4 and 9 03 4 87 10 4 s 1 respectively under cao2 0 1 2 0 mm sunlight process the calculated k for o2 inactivate e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were about 9 57 7 07 10 4 6 74 5 336 10 4 and 4 16 3 9 10 4 s 1 respectively the calculated k for 1o2 inactivate e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were about 15 8 13 3 10 4 10 0 8 63 10 4 and 7 34 4 84 10 4 s 1 respectively the calculated k for oh inactivate e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were about 8 73 7 17 10 4 5 24 4 62 10 4 and 5 16 2 76 10 4 s 1 respectively the calculated k for h2o2 inactivate e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were about 12 7 11 4 10 4 0 99 0 29 10 4 and 2 95 1 76 10 4 s 1 respectively the contribution of hrs to the inactivation of pathogens was including alkalinity oh 14 23 and oxidation 1o2 12 28 oh 20 32 o2 12 16 and h2o2 6 11 3 3 effect of environmental levels of ions and noms the effect of environmentally relevant levels of ions and noms ha and fa on photoinactivation is shown in fig 6 a 15 fluctuation standard of the k value of the control was used to determine whether ions and noms would have an impact on pathogen growth for e coli naco3 nahco3 fecl3 nh4so4 mgso4 and kcl enhanced the inactivation of pathogens fig 5a this is likely due to the oxidants including co3 and hco3 the positive ions fe3 nh4 mg2 and k can react with oxidizing factors such as o2 and h2o2 to generate more oh and enhance pathogen inactivation lu et al 2017 instead kno3 showed an inhibitory effect during the pathogen s inactivation moreover e coli was found to use no3 to produce energy and grow in the gut of patients with inflammatory bowel disease which also provides a possible explanation for the negative role of kno3 in cao2 sunlight similarly for s aureus fecl3 cuso4 nh4so4 mgso4 and kcl promoted an inactivation fig 5b and kno3 inhibited the inactivation the promotion by positive ions fe3 nh4 mg2 k and cu2 may be due to its catalytic reaction with cao2 sunlight to produce hrs lu et al 2017 and positive ion inactivation of s aureus armstrong et al 2016 for vcsm13 in addition to naco3 nahco3 other ions can promote the killing of viruses fig 5c naco3 and nahco3 have little effect on virus inactivation likely due to anions such as co3 hco3 which could quench oh reducing the inactivation efficacy ha and fa in sw inhibited the inactivation of three pathogens the k value of the fa group decreased by 65 e coli 67 s aureus and 34 vcsm13 respectively the k value of the ha group decreased by 69 e coli 76 s aureus and 60 vcsm13 respectively the decrease of pathogen k may be due to nom acting as a quencher which would deplete hrs jasper and sedlak 2013 3 4 morphological and physicochemical changes for inactivation of pathogen indicator organisms in cao2 sunlight transmission electron microscopy tem images of untreated e coli and s aureus appeared to have intact cell walls and a dense cytoplasm and untreated vcsm13 were typically tadpole shaped fig 6 a b c blank shang et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 e coli and s aureus exposed to cao2 and cao2 sunlight had a separation of the plasma membrane from the outer membrane which formed blebs fig 7 a b the bacterial wall was ruptured and more bacteria were in a hollow state in cao2 sunlight fig 6 a b vcsm13 exposed to cao2 showed the head and tail separated and nucleic acid genetic material efflux fig 6 c for cao2 sunlight treated the vcsm13 were completely damaged only broken protein capsid fragments can be observed as well as traces of nucleic acid efflux fig 6c because of the high reactivity and non specific characteristics of oh oh can destroy protein side chains leading to cell membrane damage qiao and wigginton 2016 pathogens damage can also be caused when h2o2 and ferrous iron produce oh fe iv through a fenton reaction making many biomolecules more susceptible to oxidation fridovich et al 1998 o2 can exacerbate fenton damage by releasing iron from enzymes and reducing ferric to ferrous iron fridovich et al 1998 in the photochemical system 1o2 can be continuously generated through the reaction of dissolved oxygen with the excited triplet photosensitizer to effectively kill pathogenic microorganisms nelson et al 2018 based on the above judgment the cao2 sunlight system exhibited an excellent ability to kill pathogens and it can achieve sterilization by directly destroying the structure of pathogens 3 5 bacterial dna damage following treatment pathogen death is mediated by an endonuclease a series of ordered phases of degradation of chromatin to produce oligonucleosome fragments which can be detected as a characteristic dna ladder by age the untreated bacteria didn t show continuous diffuse bands a band of chromosomal dna was not clearly seen when bacteria were treated with cao2 and cao2 sunlight lanes 3 4 indicating that the dna in the bacteria was broken after treatment and the image characteristics were similar to necrotic dna fig 7 soejima et al 2007 the bands of the cao2 sunlight treatment were more diffuse than the bands treated with cao2 alone hrs h2o2 oh oh 1o2 and o2 in cao2 sunlight react with electron rich sites on biological molecules to cause damage to pathogen s dna reduces the ability of bacteria to divide and the ability of viruses to bind to their hosts wigginton et al 2012 the cao2 sunlight was more destructive to the dna of bacteria could destroy bacteria more thoroughly and prevent the bacteria from resuscitated again 4 conclusion cao2 sunlight system is more efficient and can inactivate pathogens within 30 minutes with 100 efficiency with the synergistic effect of sunlight and cao2 the sterilization efficiency increased by nearly 75 400 epr and free radical quenching experiments confirmed the presence of hrs oh h2o2 oh o2 and 1o2 in cao2 sunlight system moreover hrs ss and k hrs p were calculated and the hrs induced mechanism model was established the photoinactivation of pathogens was mainly attributable to direct photoinactivation 13 50 and indirect photoinactivation including alkalinity oh 14 23 and oxidation 1o2 12 28 oh 20 32 o2 12 16 and h2o2 6 11 for pathogens positive ions fe3 nh4 mg2 k and cu2 substantially enhanced inactivation however ha kno3 and fa negatively affected pathogen presence with the exposure to cao2 sunlight results of tem showed that the pathogens experienced a disruption of the cell membrane and capsid in addition age showed dna was systematically damaged leading to complete pathogen death this research will play a key role in further understanding the cao2 sunlight disinfection mechanism offering the

14989,in the era of the current epidemic it is urgent to control pathogens in sewage eliminate the source of infection and optimize the technology for killing pathogens combining calcium peroxide cao2 with sunlight is considered a potentially efficient economical and eco friendly method for pathogen contaminated water remediation this paper evaluated the solar activating properties of cao2 for inactivating pathogenic indicators and explored the roles of reactive species contributing to pathogen inactivation moreover these reactive species average steady state concentrations and second order reaction rate were tentatively explored and mechanistic model for photoinactivation were establishment pathogen s inactivation was mainly attributed to direct photoinactivation 13 50 and exogenous indirect mechanisms with corresponding contributions of reactive species i e oh 14 23 1o2 12 28 oh 20 32 o2 12 16 and h2o2 6 11 furthermore cell membrane rupture and dna damage were observed by transmission electron microscopy tem and agarose gel electrophoresis age experiments among experiments on common aqueous constituents influencing photoinactivation copper and iron ions were found to promote a pathogen inactivating ability of the system while fulvic acids fa and humic acid ha had the opposite effect this study revealed the potential of cao2 sunlight to inactivate pathogens and laid a foundation for its application in inactivating pathogens in surface water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photoinactivation calcium peroxide reactive species surface water second order reaction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a lack of safe drinking water and proper sanitation is the world s most significant cause of water borne disease accounting for 2 million deaths annually pruss ustun et al 2019 identifying environmental pathogens that affect human health and taking corresponding preventive intervention measures is of utmost concern to protect the population s health as early as 1878 humans discovered that ultraviolet rays uv in sunlight have sterilization and disinfection effects uv can destroy the nucleic acid of bacteria and viruses causing them to decompose denature and lose their normal functions resulting in the death or mutation of bacteria and viruses photons in the uvb range 280 320 nm mainly cause endogenous direct damage while photons in the uvb and uva range 320 400 nm may involve endogenous indirect damage however in the full wavelength sunlight the photons in the uvb uva and visible light 400 700 nm light region mainly cause exogenous damage nelson et al 2018 when endogenous or exogenous chromophores absorb photons and sensitize photo produced reactive intermediates ppri these intermediates can damage pathogenic components resulting in indirect inactivation nelson et al 2018 wenk et al 2019 moreover in most natural waters uv wavelength is strongly attenuated by colored dissolved organic matter cdom with the increase of light attenuation the light inactivation of uvb is greatly attenuated and uva and visible light become relatively important nelson et al 2018 photoinactivation has always been the focus of researchers due to the advantages of sunlight eco friendly widespread existence and free access indirect exogenous inactivation played a leading role in open water process wetlands owws which was found to simultaneously induce a photolysis of torcs jasper et al 2013 and photoinactivation of pathogens wenk et al 2019 using sunlight however the sterilization efficiency of photoinactivation by sunlight alone is quite minimal and changes in sunlight intensity due to seasonality and weather conditions clouds rain haziness etc make photoinactivation potential variable a concomitant use of techniques such as oxidation and solidification may be effective method for enhancing the capacity of photoinactivation tang et al 2021 calcium peroxide cao2 is a solid oxidant which can transform to generate h2o2 o2 ca oh 2 and trace reactive oxygen radicals when in contact with water liu et al 2021 qiu et al 2022 xue et al 2020 it was recently found that cao2 acts as an eco friendly disinfectant killing 90 of e coli escherichia coli s aureus staphylococcus aureus and vcsm13 escherichia coli specific m13 bacteriophage virus within 120 minutes qiu et al 2022 however there are natural conditions such as the significant influence of sunlight were not taken into account meanwhile the use of cao2 alone may exist problems such as large consumption long time required for inactivation and possible changes in water quality e g excess usage of cao2 may increase water hardiness turbidity and ph or cause scaling cao2 has been reported to have a relatively high photochemical activity and can be photoexcited to promote the photolysis of pollutants kaewdee et al 2016 with co exposure of sunlight and cao2 capable of producing more active free radicals mattle et al 2015 nelson et al 2018 the combination of cao2 and sunlight may greatly reduce the amount of cao2 thereby avoiding its adverse effect on water quality moreover the mechanistic effect of cao2 inactivation of pathogens when co exposed to sunlight and overall photoinactivation efficiency has not been well characterized to better understand the photoinactivation of pathogens in cao2 sunlight conditions and its potential use as a new water treatment technology the objectives were to assess the 1 effect of cao2 under various exposure concentrations 2

3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of cao2 dose and sunlight on pathogen photoinactivation e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were effectively inactivated by cao2 sunlight fig 1 reveals the inactivation efficiency escalated with increasing irradiation time with cao2 dosage at 1 0 1 0 and 2 0 mm achieving 100 photoinactivation of e coli s aureus and vcsm13 respectively within 30 min fig 1 a b c the inactivation efficiency of pathogens under a concomitant exposure of cao2 and sunlight was greatly improved compared to cao2 alone as previously reported qiu et al 2022 with the synergistic effect of sunlight and cao2 the sterilization efficiency of e coli increased by 75 400 the sharp drop in number of pathogens under cao2 sunlight were most likely that more hrs has been generated relative to cao2 alone qiu et al 2022 zheng et al 2019 including ca oh 2 1o2 h2o2 oh oh and o2 reaction 16 21 notable photoinactivation is caused by a combination of both indirect and direct inactivation liu et al 2019 indirect inactivation is mainly the inactivation via free radicals generated in vivo and in vitro including sunlight mediated cao2 and dom in sw and sunlight mediated pathogens nelson et al 2018 furthermore the inactivation kinetics of e coli s aureus and vcsm13 followed first order decay kinetics r2 0 90 with the inactivation rate constants k increasing with increasing cao2 dosage while the increases seemed to be retarded after 1 0 mm cao2 dosage for e coli and s aureus and 2 0 mm for vcsm13 in addition to the required 100 photoinactivation of pathogens fig 1 a b c considering that excessive cao2 dosage may cause adverse effects on water environment such as possible increase in water hardness ph turbidity etc as well as the economy of cao2 consumption we chose the most suitable

structures such as cell wall thickness and the number of peptidoglycan layers all affect the photoinactivation process the simpler the microstructure of microorganisms the easier it is for oxides such as oh to reduce the possibility of their survival qiu et al 2022 3 2 inactivated pathogens mechanism under cao2 sunlight 3 2 1 effect of cao2 hydrolysates on pathogens photoinactivation the inactivation rate of all pathogens was reached at nearly 100 within 20 minutes under sunlight ca oh 2 fig 2 a b c among the hydrolyzed products ca oh 2 had the most outstanding contribution to the photoinactivation rate likely due to the existence of oh in addition to reactive species generated from sunlight irradiated sw the o2 in ca oh 2 surface adsorbed may capture photoexcited electrons to produce reactive species e g o2 oh etc zhang 2014 the significant increase in the k from sunlight h2o2 compared to the control group sunlight suggests that oh and h2o2 played important roles during cao2 sunlight inactivation as h2o2 alone was confirmed to contribute to photoinactivation with a much lower k value previous investigations reported the effect of ca2 was negligible qiu et al 2022 while a promotion of photoinactivation by cacl2 may be enhanced by the formation of cloh cl cl2 qiu et al 2022 fig 2 3 2 2 identification of the main reactive species in cao2 sunlight epr signals showed peaks with an intensity 1 2 2 1 of dmpo oh fig s11 b which demonstrates the presence of oh the peaks with an intensity 1 1 1 1 of dmpo o2 fig s11 c demonstrates the generation of o2 the trilinear signals at a 1 1 1 height ratio fig s11 d were recognized as an adduct of temp 1o2 which indicates the generation of 1o2 the function of alkalinization and oxidation were further quantified by scavenging each ros with a quencher those treated with pbs had a decreased inactivation efficiency by nearly 28 59 fig 3 a for ipa cat and ipa sod treated the inactivation efficiency decreased by nearly 50 83 h2o2 accounted for 15 30 o2 accounted for 30 53 respectively fig 3 b the function of oxidation was much higher than that of alkalinity which suggests the inactivation mechanism of pathogens may be strongly related to h2o2 oh o2 and 1o2 3 2 3 contribution of direct photoinactivation to pathogens inactivation the difference in the photoinactivation rate constants k of e coli in pure water k 0 00183 s 1 and sw k 0 00216 s 1 was very small indicating that direct photoinactivation of pathogens was less affected by the matrix in sw herein the equivalent steady state quantum yields of pathogens inactivation are calculated using eq 6 in pure water system and shown in fig 5g φ p ss 0 560 for e coli φ p ss 0 311 for s aureus and φ p ss 0 623 for vcsm13 total specific rate of sunlight absorption by target pathogen k s p under cao2 sunlight was calculated using eq 5 and 7 fig 4f thus the calculated k direct of pathogens eq 8 under cao2 sunlight were about 1 88 19 5 10 4 min 1 cao2 0 5 2 0 mm changes in absorbance α λ beam attenuation coefficient s λ molar extinction coefficient ε λ and k d i r e c t in cao2 sunlight are shown in fig s12 furthermore the contributions of sunlight to inactivation of e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were about 15 3 39 6 13 2 46 2 and 40 5 50 2 respectively cao2 0 5 2 0 mm the intensity of sunlight contribution decreased with the increase of cao2 input therefore the sunlight induced pseudo first order rate constants account for 13 50 cao2 0 5 2 0 mm of k in cao2 sunlight 3 2 4 determination of hrs concentration and its reaction rate constant with pathogens pathogens inactivation includes direct photoinactivation by sunlight and indirect photoinactivation by hrs oh h2o2 oh 1o2 3dom and o2 in cao2 sunlight system indirect photolysis i e pathogenic inactivation by hrs were determined by hrs concentration hrs and second order reaction rate constants k hrs p changes in oh h2o2 o2 1o2 and oh in cao2 sunlight is shown in fig s9 and the corresponding average steady state hrs oh ss h2o2 ss o2 ss 1o2 ss and oh ss are shown in fig 4 and table s2 the range of oh ss was 2 87 81 4 10 8 m cao2 0 1 2 0 mm fig 4a 0 t o h dt showed a good linear fit within 3 h r2 0 99 fig s10a the range of h2o2 ss was 7 13 153 10 5 m cao2 0 1 2 0 mm fig 4b 0 t h 2 o 2 d t showed a good linear fit within 3 h r2 0 95 fig s10b the range of o2 ss was 2 26 19 0 10 6 m cao2 0 1 2 0 mm fig 4c 0 t o 2 dt showed a good linear fit within 3 h r2 0 95 fig s10b 1o2 ss ranged from 7 54 15 5 10 14 m for 0 1 2 0 mm cao2 which followed a good linear fit with r2 0 95 fig 4e oh ss ranged from 2 91 15 9 10 15 m for 0 1 2 0 mm of cao2 which showed a good linear fit with r2 0 92 fig 4d the apparent k h r s c of pathogens is shown in fig 5f the k oh p of e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were about 5 51 2 11 109 3 52 3 16 109 and 9 95 6 05 109 m 1 s 1 respectively the apparent k oh p of pathogens was close to the diffusion limit with oh previously shown to react very rapidly with most biomolecules at 109 m 1 s 1 bianco et al 2017 oh is a highly reactive and non selective oxidant which in principle can react with all amino acid side chains and trunks lundeen et al 2014 initiating chain reactions to exacerbate pathogenic damage the k 1 o 2 p fitting result of e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were about 17 1 12 8 106 4 64 3 32 106 and 9 27 7 38 106 m 1 s 1 respectively 1o2 can oxidize protein side chains to destroy viral coats and bacterial membranes causing genome damage and protein damage at the same time moreover values of k h 2 o 2 p k o h p and k o h p were decreased in sequence fig 5g in addition oh h2o2 and o2 were reported to be involved in reactive oxygen species ros response which may spread to the cell membrane to cause indirect endogenous damage increasing the inactivation rate of pathogens seaver and imlay 2001 according to this model the calculated k for oh inactivate e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were about 18 7 14 5 10 4 6 05 4 65 10 4 and 9 03 4 87 10 4 s 1 respectively under cao2 0 1 2 0 mm sunlight process the calculated k for o2 inactivate e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were about 9 57 7 07 10 4 6 74 5 336 10 4 and 4 16 3 9 10 4 s 1 respectively the calculated k for 1o2 inactivate e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were about 15 8 13 3 10 4 10 0 8 63 10 4 and 7 34 4 84 10 4 s 1 respectively the calculated k for oh inactivate e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were about 8 73 7 17 10 4 5 24 4 62 10 4 and 5 16 2 76 10 4 s 1 respectively the calculated k for h2o2 inactivate e coli s aureus and vcsm13 were about 12 7 11 4 10 4 0 99 0 29 10 4 and 2 95 1 76 10 4 s 1 respectively the contribution of hrs to the inactivation of pathogens was including alkalinity oh 14 23 and oxidation 1o2 12 28 oh 20 32 o2 12 16 and h2o2 6 11 3 3 effect of environmental levels of ions and noms the effect of environmentally relevant levels of ions and noms ha and fa on photoinactivation is shown in fig 6 a 15 fluctuation standard of the k value of the control was used to determine whether ions and noms would have an impact on pathogen growth for e coli naco3 nahco3 fecl3 nh4so4 mgso4 and kcl enhanced the inactivation of pathogens fig 5a this is likely due to the oxidants including co3 and hco3 the positive ions fe3 nh4 mg2 and k can react with oxidizing factors such as o2 and h2o2 to generate more oh and enhance pathogen inactivation lu et al 2017 instead kno3 showed an inhibitory effect during the pathogen s inactivation moreover e coli was found to use no3 to produce energy and grow in the gut of patients with inflammatory bowel disease which also provides a possible explanation for the negative role of kno3 in cao2 sunlight similarly for s aureus fecl3 cuso4 nh4so4 mgso4 and kcl promoted an inactivation fig 5b and kno3 inhibited the inactivation the promotion by positive ions fe3 nh4 mg2 k and cu2 may be due to its catalytic reaction with cao2 sunlight to produce hrs lu et al 2017 and positive ion inactivation of s aureus armstrong et al 2016 for vcsm13 in addition to naco3 nahco3 other ions can promote the killing of viruses fig 5c naco3 and nahco3 have little effect on virus inactivation likely due to anions such as co3 hco3 which could quench oh reducing the inactivation efficacy ha and fa in sw inhibited the inactivation of three pathogens the k value of the fa group decreased by 65 e coli 67 s aureus and 34 vcsm13 respectively the k value of the ha group decreased by 69 e coli 76 s aureus and 60 vcsm13 respectively the decrease of pathogen k may be due to nom acting as a quencher which would deplete hrs jasper and sedlak 2013 3 4 morphological and physicochemical changes for inactivation of pathogen indicator organisms in cao2 sunlight transmission electron microscopy tem images of untreated e coli and s aureus appeared to have intact cell walls and a dense cytoplasm and untreated vcsm13 were typically tadpole shaped fig 6 a b c blank shang et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 e coli and s aureus exposed to cao2 and cao2 sunlight had a separation of the plasma membrane from the outer membrane which formed blebs fig 7 a b the bacterial wall was ruptured and more bacteria were in a hollow state in cao2 sunlight fig 6 a b vcsm13 exposed to cao2 showed the head and tail separated and nucleic acid genetic material efflux fig 6 c for cao2 sunlight treated the vcsm13 were completely damaged only broken protein capsid fragments can be observed as well as traces of nucleic acid efflux fig 6c because of the high reactivity and non specific characteristics of oh oh can destroy protein side chains leading to cell membrane damage qiao and wigginton 2016 pathogens damage can also be caused when h2o2 and ferrous iron produce oh fe iv through a fenton reaction making many biomolecules more susceptible to oxidation fridovich et al 1998 o2 can exacerbate fenton damage by releasing iron from enzymes and reducing ferric to ferrous iron fridovich et al 1998 in the photochemical system 1o2 can be continuously generated through the reaction of dissolved oxygen with the excited triplet photosensitizer to effectively kill pathogenic microorganisms nelson et al 2018 based on the above judgment the cao2 sunlight system exhibited an excellent ability to kill pathogens and it can achieve sterilization by directly destroying the structure of pathogens 3 5 bacterial dna damage following treatment pathogen death is mediated by an endonuclease a series of ordered phases of degradation of chromatin to produce oligonucleosome fragments which can be detected as a characteristic dna ladder by age the untreated bacteria didn t show continuous diffuse bands a band of chromosomal dna was not clearly seen when bacteria were treated with cao2 and cao2 sunlight lanes 3 4 indicating that the dna in the bacteria was broken after treatment and the image characteristics were similar to necrotic dna fig 7 soejima et al 2007 the bands of the cao2 sunlight treatment were more diffuse than the bands treated with cao2 alone hrs h2o2 oh oh 1o2 and o2 in cao2 sunlight react with electron rich sites on biological molecules to cause damage to pathogen s dna reduces the ability of bacteria to divide and the ability of viruses to bind to their hosts wigginton et al 2012 the cao2 sunlight was more destructive to the dna of bacteria could destroy bacteria more thoroughly and prevent the bacteria from resuscitated again 4 conclusion cao2 sunlight system is more efficient and can inactivate pathogens within 30 minutes with 100 efficiency with the synergistic effect of sunlight and cao2 the sterilization efficiency increased by nearly 75 400 epr and free radical quenching experiments confirmed the presence of hrs oh h2o2 oh o2 and 1o2 in cao2 sunlight system moreover hrs ss and k hrs p were calculated and the hrs induced mechanism model was established the photoinactivation of pathogens was mainly attributable to direct photoinactivation 13 50 and indirect photoinactivation including alkalinity oh 14 23 and oxidation 1o2 12 28 oh 20 32 o2 12 16 and h2o2 6 11 for pathogens positive ions fe3 nh4 mg2 k and cu2 substantially enhanced inactivation however ha kno3 and fa negatively affected pathogen presence with the exposure to cao2 sunlight results of tem showed that the pathogens experienced a disruption of the cell membrane and capsid in addition age showed dna was systematically damaged leading to complete pathogen death this research will play a key role in further understanding the cao2 sunlight disinfection mechanism offering the
