2230,accurate assessment of soil water erosion swe susceptibility is critical for reducing land degradation and soil loss and for mitigating the negative impacts of erosion on ecosystem services water quality flooding and infrastructure deep learning algorithms have been gaining attention in geoscience due to their high performance and flexibility however an understanding of the potential for these algorithms to provide fast cheap and accurate predictions of soil erosion susceptibility is lacking this study provides the first quantification of this potential spatial predictions of susceptibility are made using three deep learning algorithms convolutional neural network cnn recurrent neural network rnn and long short term memory lstm for an iranian catchment that has historically experienced severe water erosion through a comparison of their predictive performance and an analysis of the driving geo environmental factors the results reveal 1 elevation was the most effective variable on swe susceptibility 2 all three developed models had good prediction performance with rnn being marginally the most superior 3 maps of swe susceptibility revealed that almost 40 of the catchment was highly or very highly susceptible to swe and 20 moderately susceptible indicating the critical need for soil erosion control in this catchment through these algorithms the soil erosion susceptibility of catchments can potentially be predicted accurately and with ease using readily available data thus the results reveal that these models have great potential for use in data poor catchments such as the one studied here especially in developing nations where technical modeling skills and understanding of the erosion processes occurring in the catchment may be lacking keywords soil erosion deep learning land degradation cnn rnn lstm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil water erosion swe is a major cause of global land degradation and soil loss tang et al 2015 through its negative impact on the organic physical and chemical characteristics of soils aslam et al 2021 various parts of the world are under the hazard of swe and these areas are growing in extent as a result of climate and land use change with areas extending beyond those of arid and semi arid regions into humid regions boudjemline and semar 2018 wijitkosum 2021 soil is eroded by water through processes which vary in temporal and spatial scales these processes are splash interrill rill and gully erosion in which particles are detached by raindrop impact unconcentrated flow or concentrated flow and transported via rainsplash interrill flow or concentrated flow cooper et al 2012 these processes cause direct and indirect damage to ecosystems services through soil nutrient loss decreasing soil productivity and reducing food production thus swe is often the main driver for a number of global social and economic issues such as food insecurity higher food prices and loss of biodiversity phinzi et al 2021 furthermore swe can have considerable off site impacts including decreasing water quality through increasing water turbidity leading to irreparable damage to the aquatic system reducing dam reservoir capacity changing river morphology and increasing flood risk one country in which these negative impacts of swe are being felt severely is iran the focus for this paper iran is a semi arid country covering a land area of 165 million hectares the country experiences a mean annual soil erosion rate of 25 to 30 ton ha year over 20 times higher than the mean global rate and four times higher than any other country afshar et al 2010 khalili moghadam et al 2015 sadeghi 2017 on average 1 to 5 million tons of erosion takes places annually over the country s land mass mohammadi et al 2021 thus although 50 million hectates of land is available for agriculture only 1 3 million hectares is classed as being suitable for growing crops laylin 2018 swe is causing 400 million m3 of sedimentation each year in reservoirs resulting in an annual volume reduction of 0 5 in reservoir capacity emadodin et al 2012 sadeghi 2017 at an annual cost of us 0 6 billion world bank 2005 this sedimentation reduces power generation and land irrigation capacity further reducing the availability of arable lands as a consequence these combined impacts of swe are costing the country us 56 to us 112 billion every year higher than the revenue generated by oil production sadeghi 2017 enhanced rates of swe in iran are due to the combined effects of over exploitation by communities and industry and changes in climate patterns sadeghi 2017 this expliotation includes improper and unnecessary infrastructure development land use changes and unlawful exploitation of resources an intensification in agricultural activities over the past five decades has took place in tandeem with this unsustainable land use change from the 1950 s until 2008 around 5 million hectares of forest was converted to farmland pasture and urban areas emadodin and bork 2012 there are also a number of indirect causes for these high swe rates including an inattention to soil value a small number of hydrometry stations limited short term studies of erosion unreliable monitoring data a misunderstanding of the swe processes and apathy sadeghi 2017 all of these indirect causes have combined to mask the severity and intensity of the problem the consequence is that soil is lost due to erosion approximately 19 times faster than it forms emadodin et al 2012 nearly 75 million is thought to be needed annually in soil improvement projects to reduce swe akbari 2017 thus in iran like many other countries experiencing the impacts of swe there is a critical need to target soil erosion control to those areas most susceptible as well to identify areas most suitable for sustainable agricultural development modeling plays a key role in identifying these areas understanding the factors that lead to high erosion susceptibility and in testing the efficacy of soil erosion control strategies thus far three main types of approaches have been used empirical physically based and data driven machine learning models raza et al 2021 empirical models such as the universal soil loss equation wischmeier and smith 1965 and its associated family of derivative models e g revised usle rusle renard et al 1997 modified usle musle williams 1975 and the modified mediterranean desertification and land use medalus abuzaid et al 2021 estimate swe using a prefixed set of physical parameters representing the main factors thought to affect erosion conoscenti et al 2008 these models have a linear and simple structure and do not aim to simulate the physical processes of swe instead they are based on producing a mathematical algorithm that best describes the relationship between these parameters and measured erosion rates these empirical models can perform well for the conditions upon which they are calibrated but typically perform poorly for conditions outside those used in calibration e g cerdan et al 2010 kinnell 2010 rapp 1963 tan et al 2018 zhang et al 1996 furthermore they do not simulate soil deposition e g sedimentation and in most cases insufficient measured data exist to rigorously determine the single factors for all needed situations and scenarios auerswald et al 2006 wischmeier and smith 1978 1965 physically based models such as watershed erosion prediction project wepp nearing et al 1989 and kinematic runoff and erosion kineros woolhiser et al 1990 attempt to mathematically represent the physics behind the processes of detachment transportation and deposition these models usually require many variables and detailed spatial and temporal catchment data for the model build calibration and validation such information is rarely available in developing countries because the monitoring required especially for large catchments is costly and time consuming conoscenti et al 2008 for example in iran many of the hydrometric stations only measure sediment concentration for a few days during some severe storms and the temporal pattern of sediment yield is rarely provided darvishan et al 2010 furthermore physically based simulations are complex time consuming and require highly skilled end users that do not always reside in these countries this issue has limited their use and success in iran akhavan et al 2010 amiri 2010 moreover concerns have been raised about their tendency to overestimate small runoff events and underestimate large runoff amounts even when calibrated kinnell 2017 and the physical basis of many commonly used modes has been questioned wainwright et al 2008 recently development of machine learning ml approaches have opened up new and exciting ways to predict environmental behavior including soil erosion susceptibility modeling e g mosavi et al 2020 vu et al 2020 these approaches have a non linear structure and seek to find a robust relationship between input and output readily available parameters ml techniques do not seek to explain the physical processes and mathematical reasoning for changes in environmental behavior but to recognize patterns both expected and unexpected within data these patterns can highlight environmental relationships in space and time that may unveil critical details about behavior reveal previously unsuspected relationships or mitigate uncertainty in estimates furthermore ml models are insensitive to missing data thus these types of techniques are at their most beneficial in situations when physically based models cannot be applied e g lack of understanding of the underlying physics of the process or that suffer from inadequacies due to the limitation of data therefore the key advantage of ml approaches is that some parameters which are difficult or expensive to measure such as soil erosion could be easily predicted using other readily available factors such as rainfall and those gained from satellite data artificial neural network ann is the oldest and most widely used ml technique in geoscience due to its computational efficiency abrahart et al 2012 for example ebtehaj and bonakdari 2013 applied ann algorithms to predict sediment transport in sewers revealing that ann had a higher prediction power than existing empirical transport formulas similar results have also been found within other areas of hydrology such as river suspended load prediction and evaporation modeling kisi et al 2016 melesse et al 2011 however these algorithms have slow coverage speed during the training procedure high errors in the modeling phase and a low convergence and generalization power kisi et al 2012 thus ann algorithms have poor prediction power when the range of the testing dataset is outside of the range of the training data kisi et al 2016 melesse et al 2011 and they require a long term dataset to achieve a reasonable result thus to solve this weakness ann algorithms have been ensembled with fuzzy logic algorithms to create adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis models anfis models take the advantages from both ann and fuzzy logic methods to generally produce a better predictive capability ebtehaj and bonakdari 2014 but they are poor at finding the best weight parameters which heavily influence prediction accuracy tien bui et al 2016 furthermore anfis algorithm suffer from the need for a large number of model operators each of which need to be set accurately especially the weights of membership function also anfis algorithms lack a systematic approach in the design of fuzzy rules and in the choice of membership functions variables khosravi et al 2018 tien bui et al 2016 another powerful ml technique commonly used is support vector machine svm this algorithm has been used in a range of applications in hydrology such as rainfall runoff forecasting e g dibike et al 2001 and suspended sediment load prediction çimen 2008 the developed models have a high prediction power ganguli and reddy 2014 goyal et al 2014 but suffer from having a lot of hyper parameters making model implementation difficult ahmad et al 2018 group method of data handling gmdh is another powerful and flexible neuron based algorithm the gmdh algorithm relates to the deterministic self organizing method group where the principle of a black box connectionism and induction is used anastasakis and mort 2001 applications include land subsidence susceptibility mapping panahi et al 2022 and flood modeling dodangeh et al 2020 however the weakness of the gmdh algorithm lies in its fixed configuration using a deterministic approach to find the optimal partition of datasets and parameters robinson 1998 although these ml models have been applied to model behaviors in a wide range of environmental settings they all suffer from the need to determine accurate weights in the membership function and the optimal values for hyper parameters since trial and error is not possible to determine the exact weights bio inspired algorithms have been applied to optimize these ml techniques for example angileri et al 2016 applied the stochastic gradient tree boost sgt for swe modeling in italy revealing excellent reliability accuracy sajedi hosseini et al 2018 applied the fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory fuzzy dematel approach for swe modeling and mapping at noor rood catchment in iran and found this approach had a reasonable prediction power in the same catchment mosavi et al 2020 utilized several machine learning models weighted subspace random forest wsrf gaussian process with a radial basis function kernel gaussprradial and naive bayes nb for swe susceptibility mapping their results showed the wsrf model outperformed the other models followed by gaussprradial and nb yousefi et al 2021 applied three ml models of random forest rf classification and regression tree cart and svm to model land degradation in alborz mountains iran rf outperformed the cart and svm models although tree based models have higher performance than ann anfis and svm models trees are sensitive to noisy data tien bui et al 2012 making them less suitable to catchments that lack continuous erosion monitoring or where this monitoring is sparse in spatial extent since these studies were conducted a new type of ml model has been developed namely deep learning algorithms these algorithms have a greater flexibility than traditional ml models and thus a higher predictive performance ghorbanzadeh et al 2019 convolutional neural network cnn recurrent neural network rnn and long short term memory lstm are amongst the popular deep learning algorithms examples of application of the cnn algorithm include flood modeling khosravi et al 2020 and landslide susceptibility assessment thi ngo et al 2021 the rnn algorithm has been applied for landslide susceptibility assessment li et al 2021 and lstm for flood modeling fang et al 2021 a significant gap exists in understanding the potential of these deep learning algorithms and in the identification of the most flexible and accurate algorithm for swe susceptibility prediction the present paper therefore aims to fill this gap in understanding by achieving the following objectives using the heavily eroded noor rood catchment in iran as a case study 1 delineate swe susceptibility areas using three deep learning algorithms techniques namely cnn rnn and lstm 2 compare the predictive power of these data driven models and 3 perform an analysis of effectiveness of the geo environmental driving variables through information gain attribute evaluator igae feature selection the performance of these particular algorithms is tested for the following reasons 1 a cnn model automatically detects the important features without any human supervision 2 rnn can process inputs of any length and 3 lstm that enables a model to remember past information the research offers new insight into which deep learning algorithms offer the potential to provide relatively cheap and fast predictions of swe susceptibility in situations when understanding of the physical processes at play may not be well understood such as the catchment studied here 2 study area noor rood catchment is one of the main sub catchments of the haraz watershed located southwest of amol city mazandaran province northern iran fig 1 eastern longitudes 51 26 13 to 52 18 21 and northern latitudes 36 00 58 to 36 16 18 the catchment is fully mountainous elevation between 721 and 4333 m has an area of 1298 km2 and experiences a mean annual precipitation of 504 mm solaimani and hadian amr 2008 the study area is mostly covered by the central elborz and shemshak shale marl and sandstone and karaj tuff and shale formations historically the catchment has suffered intense swe area due to flooding and human induced processes e g land use change over grazing intensive agriculture and etc causing high turbidity in haraz river high sedimentation and a decrease in water capacity in the haraz dam located downstream of the catchment since the building of large dams in the haraz watershed are costly and of critical importance to irrigation and energy generation delineating swe prone areas in the study area is necessary for aiding the location of new dams and mitigating the impacts of swe on existing dam capacity 3 methodology the conceptual framework for modeling swe susceptibility is shown in fig 2 four main steps are used 1 data collection of swe historical data 2 extraction of swe geo environmental variables 3 generating swe susceptibility maps using deep learning cnn lstm and rnn algorithms 4 model evaluation and comparing the results across algorithms using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc 3 1 swe inventory map spatial modeling through the machine learning approach has a binary classification system i e swe occurrence non occurrence the first and vital step in this binary modeling was determining the spatial relationship between swe historical data and geo environmental factors in order to determine the effectiveness of each on swe susceptibility the historical data was derived from a survey of soil erosion in 2017 by sajedi hosseini et al 2018 in which recordings of sheet rill interrill gully erosion and mass movements were made at 116 locations fig 1 and equally occurrences of no erosion were recorded at 116 locations 3 2 construction of the training and testing datasets in the next step values of 0 and 1 were allocated to locations that have experienced no swe and swe respectively then all data was split into two parts chung and fabbri 2003 in a ratio of 70 30 for training and testing respectively based on the most commonly used ratio the first 70 was used for model development and the remaining 30 for model evaluation in the final step the training dataset was overlaid with all the swe geo environment conditioning factors to extract their attribute values for modeling 3 3 swe geo environmental factor based on a body of previous work on swe susceptibility modeling sajedi hosseini et al 2018 aslam et al 2021 conoscenti et al 2008 mosavi et al 2020 rosskopf et al 2020 the characteristics of the study area and data availability 14 swe geo environmental conditioning factors were considered fig 3 a n after initial selection of these input factors their effectiveness was investigated parameters with a low or null value can cause lower model performance to identify if this was the case within the training dataset an information gain attribute evaluator igae feature selection technique was applied to determine input variable importance the igae technique evaluates the worth of an attribute by measuring the information gain with respect to the class as follows 1 i g a e class a t t r i b u t e h class h class a t t r i b u t e where h is the information entropy more information about this technique can be found in novakovic 2009 and trabelsi et al 2017 through the use of this technique all 14 geo environmental factors were considered effective and all considered in the next step of model development these factors were elevation ground slope slope aspect plan curvature topographic wetness index twi stream power index spi distance from river slope length and steepness factor ls factor rainfall erosivity re hydrologic soil group hsg normalized difference vegetation index ndvi land use soil texture and geology ground slope elevation slope aspect ls plan curvature twi and spi were gained directly from aster global digital elevation model dem of the study area with a 30 m 30 m resolution https earthexplorer usgs gov the distance from river factor was determined in arcgis 10 2 using a digital river network the re factor was calculated from recorded rainfall in the study area using a rainfall gradient approach due to the lack of rainfall intensity data according to the following equation yu and rosewell 1996 2 re 0 0483 p 1 61 where p is the mean annual precipitation mm the mean annual precipitation was estimated based on data recorded from 1976 to 2016 by six rain gauges in the catchment further information about the rainfall records can be found in mosavi et al 2020 hsg table a in supplementary material and soil texture data was acquired in a shape file format from mazandaran regional water authority ndvi and land use factors were measured using landsat 8 oli tirs operational land imager thermal infrared sensor imagery from june 2016 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 the geology dataset was obtained from the national geology map of iran at a scale of 1 100 000 table b in supplementary material 3 4 model description 3 4 1 convolutional neural network cnn the cnn method has the structure of ordinary feed forward neural networks with each hidden layer made of neurons fully connected to all neurons in the previous and next layer neurons in a single layer operate completely independently and do not share any connections weight sharing and local connection are two special characteristics of the cnn model enhancing the network training efficiency and improving its capability to effectively decrease the network s free parameters du et al 2022 the generalized architecture of the cnn model consists of three main types of layers convolutional pooling and fully connected layers in the convolution layer a linear operator such as convolution or a nonlinear activation function such as rectified linear unit relu defined as f x max 0 x yamashita et al 2018 separates and identifies the various features of the dataset for analysis these functions are able to capture the spatial and temporal dependencies between data the primary aim of the pooling layer is to decrease the size of the convolved feature map to reduce the computational costs and to handle overfitting issues this step is performed by decreasing the connections between layers independently operating on each feature map max min and average pooling are the most common form of pooling layer used to reduce data size whilst still preserving the most important features within them pally and samadi 2022 for example max pooling a nonlinear downsampling operation computes the largest value in each patch of a feature map venkatappareddy et al 2021 thus the pooling layer generalizes the features extracted by the convolution layer and helps the networks to recognize the features independently the fully connected layer is the final part of cnn model which maps the extracted features into final output using a softmax activation function to convert the vector of numbers into the vector of probabilities the output of the function reveals the probability of each class li et al 2021 3 4 2 recurrent neural network rnn rnn is a class of ann model derived from feed forward networks ffn where connections between nodes form a directed or undirected graph along a temporal sequence rnn algorithms are powerful and robust because they use their internal state memory to process variable length sequences of inputs rnns are best applied to sequential or time series data but by extracting the contextual information from the data rnn models can be efficaciously applied to data classification the rnn structure is composed of several successive recurrent layers a ffn allocates a weight to the input parameters similar to other deep learning models but the key difference is that rnn algorithms using the internal memory assign this weight to both current and previous inputs rnn models benefit from having loops in hidden layers and these loops have a significant effect on the training capability of the model feedback loops from the output layer x 1 t x nj are evaluated using the networks input y t for each new input the output values are calculated and then sent back to the modeling process as an adjusted modified input this approach continues until a fixed and steady output is obtained the mathematical approaches are as follows 3 a i t φ ji y i t σ ji h i t 1 j 1 n h 4 h i t f a i t j 1 n h 5 b i t a ji h i t j 1 n j 6 x i t g b j t j 1 n j where φ ji σ ji and a ji are weights f is defined as the non linear transformation parameter and n h is the hidden number of neurons generally hidden layers through networks input i e y t calculate the adjusted network weights 3 4 3 long short term memory lstm lstm is another type of rnn capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems this algorithm extends theinternal memory and helps the model to recall events from a long period of time standard rnn models due to the issue of gradient vanishing are unable to prepare long memories in contrast lstm models are able to train and learn from important events with lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series lstm uses three ways to allocate the weights forget the information let in new information and hold the information that affects the output the model also has three main layers or gates input control the input information in a memory cell output maintain control over the outgoing information throughout the remainder of the networks and forget control the input from the previous memory and determine if it should be deleted based on the preceding cell condition this information is calculated through the following equations 7 f t σ w xf x t w hf h t 1 b f 8 i t σ w xi x t w hi h t 1 b i 9 c t σ w xc x t w hc h t 1 b c 10 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 11 o t σ w xo x t w ho h t 1 b o 12

bias vectors 3 5 swe susceptibility map generation after developing the three models using the training data they were used to calculate swe indices swei for all pixels in the study area these swei values were classified based on the quantile classification scheme to very low low moderate high and very high to produce a swe susceptibility map 3 6 model performance evaluation the prediction power of each of the developed models was evaluated quantitatively using the powerful and reliable receiver operating characteristic roc curve method using statistical package for the social sciences spss software model evaluation was assessed during both model development success rate roc curve using the training dataset and during model evaluation using the testing dataset prediction rate roc curve success rate roc curves only reveal the efficiency of the built model whereas prediction rate roc curves using data not used in model development reveals how good the model is at prediction and thus shows the model generalization power area under the roc curve auc measures the entire two dimensional area underneath the roc curve providing an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds auc varies between 0 the lowest model prediction power and 1 ideal model with the highest performance table 1 based on yesilnacar 2005 shows how ranges of auc values can be interpreted for classifying model quality 4 result and analysis 4 1 effectiveness of input variables on swe susceptibility the effectiveness of the 14 input variables on swe susceptibility assessed using the igae feature selection technique is presented in a radar chart fig 4 this chart shows that elevation was the parameter with the highest effectiveness on swe 0 30 followed by re 0 16 ndvi 0 143 twi 0 142 plan curvature 0 141 ground slope 0 12 geology 0 099 aspect 0 091 spi 0 073 distance from river 0 070 land use 0 067 soil texture 0 030 ls 0 020 and hsg 0 016 4 2 swe susceptibility maps the delineated swe susceptibility maps showed the middle and eastern part of the catchment had a high and very high susceptibility to swe while the rest of the study area which surrounded the susceptible areas had a lower susceptibility fig 5 a c according to the roc model evaluation technique all models in terms of success rate and prediction rate had a very good prediction power 0 8 auc 0 9 fig 6 all models had the same performance in the training phase auc 0 85 but rnn was marginally superior in the testing phase auc 0 83 thus the rnn model had the highest generalization power albeit only slightly differences in the three maps are subtle the maps produced by the lstm and rnn models were most alike producing similar predictions for the percentage of catchment occupied by very low high very high susceptibility the cnn model predicted a higher percentage of very high susceptibility areas than the other two models but a slightly lower proportion of very low susceptibility fig 7 the cnn model overestimated the very high susceptibility classes while underestimated the moderate classes the lstm model overestimated the very low susceptibility classes while underestimated low and moderate susceptibility classes figs 5 and 7 according to the predictions made by the rnn model 19 8 of the study area had a very high swe susceptibility 19 7 20 8 20 8 and 18 9 had a high moderate low and very low susceptibility fig 7 overall 39 5 of the catchment had a high and very high susceptibility to swe 5 discussion 5 1 effectiveness of geo environmental factors to examine the effectiveness of each of the geo environmental factors a frequency ratio fr approach was used fr is a bivariate statistical approach that calculates the probabilistic relationship between swe susceptibility and each of the factors the fr is the ratio of the area where swe occurs to the total study area for a given attribute for each range or type of factor fr was calculated as follows fr d i i 1 n d i a i i 1 n a i where di is the area of swe of the i th category very low low medium high very high ai is the area of the i th category for a certain factor and n is the category number of the factor a derived fr value of more than 1 indicates a strong and positive relationship between the concerned class of the selected factor data layer and high swe susceptibility on the other hand a frequency ratio value of 1 suggests a poor and negative correlation between swe susceptibility and the concerned class of the factor data layer and low susceptibility the fr values and the elevation map fig 3a show that areas with lower and mid elevations 727 2404 m had a strong correlation with the highest swe susceptibility particularly due to mass movement areas with higher elevations may usually be thought to more susceptible due to higher rainfall and steeper slope thinner soils and bedrock outcrops however precipitation falls as snow in these higher elevations since snow has less erosivity than rainfall and can acts as an armor to protect soil from erosion these higher elevation areas therefore experience less erosion than the lower and mid elevations thus re had a poor correlation with swe fig 3f furthermore livestock farming is denser in low elevations resulting in overgrazing a reduction in vegetation cover especially during early spring when immature is damaged soil compaction lower infiltration rates lower soil retention and higher runoff combining to make soil more susceptible to rainsplash sheet rill and gully erosion sternberg et al 2000 orgill et al 2018 narantsetseg et al 2018 donovan and monaghan 2021 areas with low ndvi representing soil with little or no vegetation were strongly positively correlated with swe corresponding with higher susceptibility fig 8 whereas areas with high nvdi were negatively correlated because vegetation cover reduced the volume and intensity of rainfall reaching the soil surface e g vaezi et al 2016 and the detachment of sediment in overland flow in the long term vegetation also increases soil organic matter and improves soil physical properties e g puigdefabregas et al 1999 further reducing soil erosivity high values of twi were correlated strongly with swe since areas with high twi can indicate areas where there is an accumulation of water possibly due to the routing of overland flow resulting in a higher likelihood of particle detachment through rilling and gullying flat slopes were also associated with areas with high swe susceptibility since with all things constant such as soil thickness and vegetation cover lower angle slopes are most often associated with lower infiltration capacities and thus higher rates of runoff e g chen and young 2006 two lithological units pldv rhyolitic to rhyodacitic volcanic rocks and k2l2 thick bedded to massive limestone maastrichtian were highly correlated with areas of high swe with all other units displaying a weak association fig 8 slopes with different aspect receive differing amounts of solar radiation southerly aspects correspond strongly with areas of high swe since these areas receive more solar radiation reducing soil wetness aggregate stability and vegetation cover and more crusting of the soil surface reducing infiltration capacities and increasing runoff e g marques and mora 1992 fang and guo 2015 all other factors had a poor correlation with swe susceptibility 5 2 comparison in model performance since inputs were the same for each of the models the difference in performance between algorithms is attributable to their different computational structures rnn and lstm models outperformed the cnn model because they both have an internal memory that allows them to remember important information about the input they receive enhancing their precision in predicting what s coming next although the generalization ability of cnn is enhanced due to the use of a pooling layer their fitting ability is reduced when the inputs are low dimensional vectors leading to information loss liu et al 2019 cnn and rnn algorithms operate similarly by introducing sparsity and reusing the same neurons and weights however in the cnn model latent patterns in data are detected using convolution operations whereas in the rnn model the specific sequences in input data are found by considering the relationship between the current and the previous state allowing rnns to feed results back into the network also in cnn models the input size and resulting output are fixed but in rnn models they vary further the rnn algorithm benefits from a parameter sharing technique allowing rnn models to share parameters across different time steps in addition the incorporation of convolutional layers can stretch its efficiency to nearby pixels the cnn and lstm algorithms are feed forward neural networks but a backpropagation training algorithm is used in the rnn model providing the ability to more effectively interpret temporal information and capture long term dependencies in data as well as obtain a minimum error function value ajitha et al 2022 when these differences are taken together this greater complexity in the rnn computational structure accounts for the enhanced predictive power of rnn models over cnn models mutlu et al 2019 a direct comparison between our findings with those of previous studies is not possible as deep learning algorithms have not yet to be applied for swe modeling and mapping several studies have applied different ml models for swe mapping however yousefi et al 2021 applied three models of rf cart and svm model for swe susceptibility mapping in a different catchment in iran and reported these models have accuracies of between 0 89 and 0 96 based on the roc auc method these values are higher than reported in this study despite the use of more powerful algorithms resulting from the greater complexity in the relationships between the geo environmental factors and erosion processes in the catchment studied in the present paper in particular snow in mountainous areas high livestock density and deforestation in lowland areas and little variation in soil grain size resulted in some factors such as re land use and soil texture that would normally be well correlated with swe to be not well correlated and there was an unexpected relation with slope elevation in the same catchment sajedi hosseini et al 2018 applied a fuzzy dematel approach to swe mapping with an accuracy of 0 83 although their method has higher performance the generated map had higher uncertainty because the weights were calculated based on the expert opinion in contrast mosavi et al 2020 applied wsrf gaussprradial and nb methods for swe in the same study area and found predictive accuracy was lower wsrf with kappa index of 0 81 had a higher performance than gaussprradial 0 76 and nb with kappa 0 71 also abolhasani et al 2022 implemented rf boosted regression tree brt svm and classification and regression tree cart algorithms with auc values of 0 81 0 76 0 71 and 0 63 for swe mapping at qazvin plain iran the three models developed in the current study performed more strongly 5 3 applying deep learning models to map swe susceptibility the choice of the best predictive model is most often a compromise between model prediction accuracy and model complexity with the later in deep learning models most closely related to the data input requirements the major advantages of the deep learning models developed in this paper are their simplicity and their ease and in expense to build and run unlike physically based models whilst providing little compromise on model performance in other words the deep learning models provided good prediction performance based on inputs that are readily available from satellite imagery and national rainfall monitoring without the need for catchment or hillslope scale monitoring thus the results reveal that these models have great potential for use in swe susceptibility assessment in data poor catchments especially in developing nations where technical modeling skills and understanding of the hydrologic and erosion processes occurring in the catchment may be lacking the major disadvantages of these types of models however are twofold first like all statistical methods the developed models only relate directly to the catchments being considered and thus their application to other catchments may prove inappropriate future studies should apply the developed models to catchments with differing rainfall soils land use land cover geology and morphology to discover whether this is the case second due to their black box structure they provide poor explanatory power and thus are unable to extract understanding of the processes that cause changes in swe susceptibility with these considerations in mind the use of deep learning models may not simply lie in predicting erosion but integrating these techniques into process based models to help identify and optimize model parameters and mitigate uncertainty in model estimates e g vojinovic et al 2013 help recognize patterns within satellite data to unveil critical details about behavior and possibly reveal new environmental relationships future studies should seek to explore this potential this study has considered geo environmental factors that affect erosion where data is available future studies should consider human related factors in deep learning models such as livestock density e g evans 1997 arable yields e g gliessman 2004 the location of road networks e g deng et al 2011 keshkamat et al 2013 and distance from water resources e g mirzabaev et al 2016 for example yousefi et al 2016 reported that the rate of soil degradation around water resources was higher than in other parts more distant from water supplies deng et al 2011 demonstrated that when areas are composed of relatively high quality grassland roads lead to soil erosion and degradation whereas when grassland resources are sparse access to a road results in soil restoration in addition due to a lack of rainfall intensity data the current study had to take a simplified approach to account for rainfall as a factor using mean annual rainfall data to generate the re factor this approach does not account for the role of individual storm events and their magnitude and duration on soil erosion nor does it consider how preceding events affect susceptibility in proceeding events thus a focus for future studies should be on applying deep learning models to more data rich catchments using observations of rainfall intensity to generate the re factor with higher accuracy capolongo et al 2008 panagos et al 2015 petroselli et al 2021 since deep learning models are data driven one can postulate that with hourly rainfall data incorporated with the kind of satellite data used in this current study it should be possible to build more powerful more accurate models of soil erosion susceptibility over large spatial extents providing an important tool for targeting soil erosion control to those areas most susceptible and for identifying areas most suitable for sustainable agricultural development 6 conclusion soil erosion by water is a major cause of global land degradation and soil loss accurate predictions of erosion susceptibility are critical for protecting soils and targeting efforts to mitigate the impacts of erosion on ecosystem services water quality flooding and infrastructure using satellite data rainfall soil and other several readily available data this paper has quantified for the first time the potential of deep learning models to provide accurate predictions of soil water erosion swe susceptibility three state of the art deep learning algorithms convolutional neural network cnn recurrent neural network rnn and long short term memory lstm were applied to assess susceptibility in an iranian catchment that has historically experienced severe erosion the main findings were as follows 1 elevation was the most effective geo environmental variable on swe susceptibility followed by rainfall erosivity normalized difference vegetation index topographic wetness index plan curvature ground slope geology aspect stream power index distance from river land use soil texture slope length and steepness factor and hydrologic soil groups 2 model evaluation revealed that all three developed models had good prediction performance with rnn being marginally the most superior 3 maps of swe susceptibility revealed that almost 40 of the catchment was considered to be highly or very highly susceptible to swe and 20 moderately susceptible indicating the critical need for soil erosion control in this catchment to reduce susceptibility 4 swe mainly occurs in areas with elevations lower than 2700 m bare soils high twi flat curvature a southerly aspect and rhyolitic to rhyodacitic volcanic rocks the strength of these algorithms lies in their ease to implement use of readily available satellite and rainfall data and being inexpensive to build and run in comparison to physically based models whilst providing little compromise on model performance together these findings reveal that deep learning models have great potential for use in swe susceptibility assessment especially in situations when understanding of the physical processes at play may not be well understood or field monitoring data is lacking thus understanding more about this potential for different catchments and input variables represents a

2230,accurate assessment of soil water erosion swe susceptibility is critical for reducing land degradation and soil loss and for mitigating the negative impacts of erosion on ecosystem services water quality flooding and infrastructure deep learning algorithms have been gaining attention in geoscience due to their high performance and flexibility however an understanding of the potential for these algorithms to provide fast cheap and accurate predictions of soil erosion susceptibility is lacking this study provides the first quantification of this potential spatial predictions of susceptibility are made using three deep learning algorithms convolutional neural network cnn recurrent neural network rnn and long short term memory lstm for an iranian catchment that has historically experienced severe water erosion through a comparison of their predictive performance and an analysis of the driving geo environmental factors the results reveal 1 elevation was the most effective variable on swe susceptibility 2 all three developed models had good prediction performance with rnn being marginally the most superior 3 maps of swe susceptibility revealed that almost 40 of the catchment was highly or very highly susceptible to swe and 20 moderately susceptible indicating the critical need for soil erosion control in this catchment through these algorithms the soil erosion susceptibility of catchments can potentially be predicted accurately and with ease using readily available data thus the results reveal that these models have great potential for use in data poor catchments such as the one studied here especially in developing nations where technical modeling skills and understanding of the erosion processes occurring in the catchment may be lacking keywords soil erosion deep learning land degradation cnn rnn lstm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil water erosion swe is a major cause of global land degradation and soil loss tang et al 2015 through its negative impact on the organic physical and chemical characteristics of soils aslam et al 2021 various parts of the world are under the hazard of swe and these areas are growing in extent as a result of climate and land use change with areas extending beyond those of arid and semi arid regions into humid regions boudjemline and semar 2018 wijitkosum 2021 soil is eroded by water through processes which vary in temporal and spatial scales these processes are splash interrill rill and gully erosion in which particles are detached by raindrop impact unconcentrated flow or concentrated flow and transported via rainsplash interrill flow or concentrated flow cooper et al 2012 these processes cause direct and indirect damage to ecosystems services through soil nutrient loss decreasing soil productivity and reducing food production thus swe is often the main driver for a number of global social and economic issues such as food insecurity higher food prices and loss of biodiversity phinzi et al 2021 furthermore swe can have considerable off site impacts including decreasing water quality through increasing water turbidity leading to irreparable damage to the aquatic system reducing dam reservoir capacity changing river morphology and increasing flood risk one country in which these negative impacts of swe are being felt severely is iran the focus for this paper iran is a semi arid country covering a land area of 165 million hectares the country experiences a mean annual soil erosion rate of 25 to 30 ton ha year over 20 times higher than the mean global rate and four times higher than any other country afshar et al 2010 khalili moghadam et al 2015 sadeghi 2017 on average 1 to 5 million tons of erosion takes places annually over the country s land mass mohammadi et al 2021 thus although 50 million hectates of land is available for agriculture only 1 3 million hectares is classed as being suitable for growing crops laylin 2018 swe is causing 400 million m3 of sedimentation each year in reservoirs resulting in an annual volume reduction of 0 5 in reservoir capacity emadodin et al 2012 sadeghi 2017 at an annual cost of us 0 6 billion world bank 2005 this sedimentation reduces power generation and land irrigation capacity further reducing the availability of arable lands as a consequence these combined impacts of swe are costing the country us 56 to us 112 billion every year higher than the revenue generated by oil production sadeghi 2017 enhanced rates of swe in iran are due to the combined effects of over exploitation by communities and industry and changes in climate patterns sadeghi 2017 this expliotation includes improper and unnecessary infrastructure development land use changes and unlawful exploitation of resources an intensification in agricultural activities over the past five decades has took place in tandeem with this unsustainable land use change from the 1950 s until 2008 around 5 million hectares of forest was converted to farmland pasture and urban areas emadodin and bork 2012 there are also a number of indirect causes for these high swe rates including an inattention to soil value a small number of hydrometry stations limited short term studies of erosion unreliable monitoring data a misunderstanding of the swe processes and apathy sadeghi 2017 all of these indirect causes have combined to mask the severity and intensity of the problem the consequence is that soil is lost due to erosion approximately 19 times faster than it forms emadodin et al 2012 nearly 75 million is thought to be needed annually in soil improvement projects to reduce swe akbari 2017 thus in iran like many other countries experiencing the impacts of swe there is a critical need to target soil erosion control to those areas most susceptible as well to identify areas most suitable for sustainable agricultural development modeling plays a key role in identifying these areas understanding the factors that lead to high erosion susceptibility and in testing the efficacy of soil erosion control strategies thus far three main types of approaches have been used empirical physically based and data driven machine learning models raza et al 2021 empirical models such as the universal soil loss equation wischmeier and smith 1965 and its associated family of derivative models e g revised usle rusle renard et al 1997 modified usle musle williams 1975 and the modified mediterranean desertification and land use medalus abuzaid et al 2021 estimate swe using a prefixed set of physical parameters representing the main factors thought to affect erosion conoscenti et al 2008 these models have a linear and simple structure and do not aim to simulate the physical processes of swe instead they are based on producing a mathematical algorithm that best describes the relationship between these parameters and measured erosion rates these empirical models can perform well for the conditions upon which they are calibrated but typically perform poorly for conditions outside those used in calibration e g cerdan et al 2010 kinnell 2010 rapp 1963 tan et al 2018 zhang et al 1996 furthermore they do not simulate soil deposition e g sedimentation and in most cases insufficient measured data exist to rigorously determine the single factors for all needed situations and scenarios auerswald et al 2006 wischmeier and smith 1978 1965 physically based models such as watershed erosion prediction project wepp nearing et al 1989 and kinematic runoff and erosion kineros woolhiser et al 1990 attempt to mathematically represent the physics behind the processes of detachment transportation and deposition these models usually require many variables and detailed spatial and temporal catchment data for the model build calibration and validation such information is rarely available in developing countries because the monitoring required especially for large catchments is costly and time consuming conoscenti et al 2008 for example in iran many of the hydrometric stations only measure sediment concentration for a few days during some severe storms and the temporal pattern of sediment yield is rarely provided darvishan et al 2010 furthermore physically based simulations are complex time consuming and require highly skilled end users that do not always reside in these countries this issue has limited their use and success in iran akhavan et al 2010 amiri 2010 moreover concerns have been raised about their tendency to overestimate small runoff events and underestimate large runoff amounts even when calibrated kinnell 2017 and the physical basis of many commonly used modes has been questioned wainwright et al 2008 recently development of machine learning ml approaches have opened up new and exciting ways to predict environmental behavior including soil erosion susceptibility modeling e g mosavi et al 2020 vu et al 2020 these approaches have a non linear structure and seek to find a robust relationship between input and output readily available parameters ml techniques do not seek to explain the physical processes and mathematical reasoning for changes in environmental behavior but to recognize patterns both expected and unexpected within data these patterns can highlight environmental relationships in space and time that may unveil critical details about behavior reveal previously unsuspected relationships or mitigate uncertainty in estimates furthermore ml models are insensitive to missing data thus these types of techniques are at their most beneficial in situations when physically based models cannot be applied e g lack of understanding of the underlying physics of the process or that suffer from inadequacies due to the limitation of data therefore the key advantage of ml approaches is that some parameters which are difficult or expensive to measure such as soil erosion could be easily predicted using other readily available factors such as rainfall and those gained from satellite data artificial neural network ann is the oldest and most widely used ml technique in geoscience due to its computational efficiency abrahart et al 2012 for example ebtehaj and bonakdari 2013 applied ann algorithms to predict sediment transport in sewers revealing that ann had a higher prediction power than existing empirical transport formulas similar results have also been found within other areas of hydrology such as river suspended load prediction and evaporation modeling kisi et al 2016 melesse et al 2011 however these algorithms have slow coverage speed during the training procedure high errors in the modeling phase and a low convergence and generalization power kisi et al 2012 thus ann algorithms have poor prediction power when the range of the testing dataset is outside of the range of the training data kisi et al 2016 melesse et al 2011 and they require a long term dataset to achieve a reasonable result thus to solve this weakness ann algorithms have been ensembled with fuzzy logic algorithms to create adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis models anfis models take the advantages from both ann and fuzzy logic methods to generally produce a better predictive capability ebtehaj and bonakdari 2014 but they are poor at finding the best weight parameters which heavily influence prediction accuracy tien bui et al 2016 furthermore anfis algorithm suffer from the need for a large number of model operators each of which need to be set accurately especially the weights of membership function also anfis algorithms lack a systematic approach in the design of fuzzy rules and in the choice of membership functions variables khosravi et al 2018 tien bui et al 2016 another powerful ml technique commonly used is support vector machine svm this algorithm has been used in a range of applications in hydrology such as rainfall runoff forecasting e g dibike et al 2001 and suspended sediment load prediction çimen 2008 the developed models have a high prediction power ganguli and reddy 2014 goyal et al 2014 but suffer from having a lot of hyper parameters making model implementation difficult ahmad et al 2018 group method of data handling gmdh is another powerful and flexible neuron based algorithm the gmdh algorithm relates to the deterministic self organizing method group where the principle of a black box connectionism and induction is used anastasakis and mort 2001 applications include land subsidence susceptibility mapping panahi et al 2022 and flood modeling dodangeh et al 2020 however the weakness of the gmdh algorithm lies in its fixed configuration using a deterministic approach to find the optimal partition of datasets and parameters robinson 1998 although these ml models have been applied to model behaviors in a wide range of environmental settings they all suffer from the need to determine accurate weights in the membership function and the optimal values for hyper parameters since trial and error is not possible to determine the exact weights bio inspired algorithms have been applied to optimize these ml techniques for example angileri et al 2016 applied the stochastic gradient tree boost sgt for swe modeling in italy revealing excellent reliability accuracy sajedi hosseini et al 2018 applied the fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory fuzzy dematel approach for swe modeling and mapping at noor rood catchment in iran and found this approach had a reasonable prediction power in the same catchment mosavi et al 2020 utilized several machine learning models weighted subspace random forest wsrf gaussian process with a radial basis function kernel gaussprradial and naive bayes nb for swe susceptibility mapping their results showed the wsrf model outperformed the other models followed by gaussprradial and nb yousefi et al 2021 applied three ml models of random forest rf classification and regression tree cart and svm to model land degradation in alborz mountains iran rf outperformed the cart and svm models although tree based models have higher performance than ann anfis and svm models trees are sensitive to noisy data tien bui et al 2012 making them less suitable to catchments that lack continuous erosion monitoring or where this monitoring is sparse in spatial extent since these studies were conducted a new type of ml model has been developed namely deep learning algorithms these algorithms have a greater flexibility than traditional ml models and thus a higher predictive performance ghorbanzadeh et al 2019 convolutional neural network cnn recurrent neural network rnn and long short term memory lstm are amongst the popular deep learning algorithms examples of application of the cnn algorithm include flood modeling khosravi et al 2020 and landslide susceptibility assessment thi ngo et al 2021 the rnn algorithm has been applied for landslide susceptibility assessment li et al 2021 and lstm for flood modeling fang et al 2021 a significant gap exists in understanding the potential of these deep learning algorithms and in the identification of the most flexible and accurate algorithm for swe susceptibility prediction the present paper therefore aims to fill this gap in understanding by achieving the following objectives using the heavily eroded noor rood catchment in iran as a case study 1 delineate swe susceptibility areas using three deep learning algorithms techniques namely cnn rnn and lstm 2 compare the predictive power of these data driven models and 3 perform an analysis of effectiveness of the geo environmental driving variables through information gain attribute evaluator igae feature selection the performance of these particular algorithms is tested for the following reasons 1 a cnn model automatically detects the important features without any human supervision 2 rnn can process inputs of any length and 3 lstm that enables a model to remember past information the research offers new insight into which deep learning algorithms offer the potential to provide relatively cheap and fast predictions of swe susceptibility in situations when understanding of the physical processes at play may not be well understood such as the catchment studied here 2 study area noor rood catchment is one of the main sub catchments of the haraz watershed located southwest of amol city mazandaran province northern iran fig 1 eastern longitudes 51 26 13 to 52 18 21 and northern latitudes 36 00 58 to 36 16 18 the catchment is fully mountainous elevation between 721 and 4333 m has an area of 1298 km2 and experiences a mean annual precipitation of 504 mm solaimani and hadian amr 2008 the study area is mostly covered by the central elborz and shemshak shale marl and sandstone and karaj tuff and shale formations historically the catchment has suffered intense swe area due to flooding and human induced processes e g land use change over grazing intensive agriculture and etc causing high turbidity in haraz river high sedimentation and a decrease in water capacity in the haraz dam located downstream of the catchment since the building of large dams in the haraz watershed are costly and of critical importance to irrigation and energy generation delineating swe prone areas in the study area is necessary for aiding the location of new dams and mitigating the impacts of swe on existing dam capacity 3 methodology the conceptual framework for modeling swe susceptibility is shown in fig 2 four main steps are used 1 data collection of swe historical data 2 extraction of swe geo environmental variables 3 generating swe susceptibility maps using deep learning cnn lstm and rnn algorithms 4 model evaluation and comparing the results across algorithms using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc 3 1 swe inventory map spatial modeling through the machine learning approach has a binary classification system i e swe occurrence non occurrence the first and vital step in this binary modeling was determining the spatial relationship between swe historical data and geo environmental factors in order to determine the effectiveness of each on swe susceptibility the historical data was derived from a survey of soil erosion in 2017 by sajedi hosseini et al 2018 in which recordings of sheet rill interrill gully erosion and mass movements were made at 116 locations fig 1 and equally occurrences of no erosion were recorded at 116 locations 3 2 construction of the training and testing datasets in the next step values of 0 and 1 were allocated to locations that have experienced no swe and swe respectively then all data was split into two parts chung and fabbri 2003 in a ratio of 70 30 for training and testing respectively based on the most commonly used ratio the first 70 was used for model development and the remaining 30 for model evaluation in the final step the training dataset was overlaid with all the swe geo environment conditioning factors to extract their attribute values for modeling 3 3 swe geo environmental factor based on a body of previous work on swe susceptibility modeling sajedi hosseini et al 2018 aslam et al 2021 conoscenti et al 2008 mosavi et al 2020 rosskopf et al 2020 the characteristics of the study area and data availability 14 swe geo environmental conditioning factors were considered fig 3 a n after initial selection of these input factors their effectiveness was investigated parameters with a low or null value can cause lower model performance to identify if this was the case within the training dataset an information gain attribute evaluator igae feature selection technique was applied to determine input variable importance the igae technique evaluates the worth of an attribute by measuring the information gain with respect to the class as follows 1 i g a e class a t t r i b u t e h class h class a t t r i b u t e where h is the information entropy more information about this technique can be found in novakovic 2009 and trabelsi et al 2017 through the use of this technique all 14 geo environmental factors were considered effective and all considered in the next step of model development these factors were elevation ground slope slope aspect plan curvature topographic wetness index twi stream power index spi distance from river slope length and steepness factor ls factor rainfall erosivity re hydrologic soil group hsg normalized difference vegetation index ndvi land use soil texture and geology ground slope elevation slope aspect ls plan curvature twi and spi were gained directly from aster global digital elevation model dem of the study area with a 30 m 30 m resolution https earthexplorer usgs gov the distance from river factor was determined in arcgis 10 2 using a digital river network the re factor was calculated from recorded rainfall in the study area using a rainfall gradient approach due to the lack of rainfall intensity data according to the following equation yu and rosewell 1996 2 re 0 0483 p 1 61 where p is the mean annual precipitation mm the mean annual precipitation was estimated based on data recorded from 1976 to 2016 by six rain gauges in the catchment further information about the rainfall records can be found in mosavi et al 2020 hsg table a in supplementary material and soil texture data was acquired in a shape file format from mazandaran regional water authority ndvi and land use factors were measured using landsat 8 oli tirs operational land imager thermal infrared sensor imagery from june 2016 sajedi hosseini et al 2018 the geology dataset was obtained from the national geology map of iran at a scale of 1 100 000 table b in supplementary material 3 4 model description 3 4 1 convolutional neural network cnn the cnn method has the structure of ordinary feed forward neural networks with each hidden layer made of neurons fully connected to all neurons in the previous and next layer neurons in a single layer operate completely independently and do not share any connections weight sharing and local connection are two special characteristics of the cnn model enhancing the network training efficiency and improving its capability to effectively decrease the network s free parameters du et al 2022 the generalized architecture of the cnn model consists of three main types of layers convolutional pooling and fully connected layers in the convolution layer a linear operator such as convolution or a nonlinear activation function such as rectified linear unit relu defined as f x max 0 x yamashita et al 2018 separates and identifies the various features of the dataset for analysis these functions are able to capture the spatial and temporal dependencies between data the primary aim of the pooling layer is to decrease the size of the convolved feature map to reduce the computational costs and to handle overfitting issues this step is performed by decreasing the connections between layers independently operating on each feature map max min and average pooling are the most common form of pooling layer used to reduce data size whilst still preserving the most important features within them pally and samadi 2022 for example max pooling a nonlinear downsampling operation computes the largest value in each patch of a feature map venkatappareddy et al 2021 thus the pooling layer generalizes the features extracted by the convolution layer and helps the networks to recognize the features independently the fully connected layer is the final part of cnn model which maps the extracted features into final output using a softmax activation function to convert the vector of numbers into the vector of probabilities the output of the function reveals the probability of each class li et al 2021 3 4 2 recurrent neural network rnn rnn is a class of ann model derived from feed forward networks ffn where connections between nodes form a directed or undirected graph along a temporal sequence rnn algorithms are powerful and robust because they use their internal state memory to process variable length sequences of inputs rnns are best applied to sequential or time series data but by extracting the contextual information from the data rnn models can be efficaciously applied to data classification the rnn structure is composed of several successive recurrent layers a ffn allocates a weight to the input parameters similar to other deep learning models but the key difference is that rnn algorithms using the internal memory assign this weight to both current and previous inputs rnn models benefit from having loops in hidden layers and these loops have a significant effect on the training capability of the model feedback loops from the output layer x 1 t x nj are evaluated using the networks input y t for each new input the output values are calculated and then sent back to the modeling process as an adjusted modified input this approach continues until a fixed and steady output is obtained the mathematical approaches are as follows 3 a i t φ ji y i t σ ji h i t 1 j 1 n h 4 h i t f a i t j 1 n h 5 b i t a ji h i t j 1 n j 6 x i t g b j t j 1 n j where φ ji σ ji and a ji are weights f is defined as the non linear transformation parameter and n h is the hidden number of neurons generally hidden layers through networks input i e y t calculate the adjusted network weights 3 4 3 long short term memory lstm lstm is another type of rnn capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems this algorithm extends theinternal memory and helps the model to recall events from a long period of time standard rnn models due to the issue of gradient vanishing are unable to prepare long memories in contrast lstm models are able to train and learn from important events with lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series lstm uses three ways to allocate the weights forget the information let in new information and hold the information that affects the output the model also has three main layers or gates input control the input information in a memory cell output maintain control over the outgoing information throughout the remainder of the networks and forget control the input from the previous memory and determine if it should be deleted based on the preceding cell condition this information is calculated through the following equations 7 f t σ w xf x t w hf h t 1 b f 8 i t σ w xi x t w hi h t 1 b i 9 c t σ w xc x t w hc h t 1 b c 10 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 11 o t σ w xo x t w ho h t 1 b o 12

bias vectors 3 5 swe susceptibility map generation after developing the three models using the training data they were used to calculate swe indices swei for all pixels in the study area these swei values were classified based on the quantile classification scheme to very low low moderate high and very high to produce a swe susceptibility map 3 6 model performance evaluation the prediction power of each of the developed models was evaluated quantitatively using the powerful and reliable receiver operating characteristic roc curve method using statistical package for the social sciences spss software model evaluation was assessed during both model development success rate roc curve using the training dataset and during model evaluation using the testing dataset prediction rate roc curve success rate roc curves only reveal the efficiency of the built model whereas prediction rate roc curves using data not used in model development reveals how good the model is at prediction and thus shows the model generalization power area under the roc curve auc measures the entire two dimensional area underneath the roc curve providing an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds auc varies between 0 the lowest model prediction power and 1 ideal model with the highest performance table 1 based on yesilnacar 2005 shows how ranges of auc values can be interpreted for classifying model quality 4 result and analysis 4 1 effectiveness of input variables on swe susceptibility the effectiveness of the 14 input variables on swe susceptibility assessed using the igae feature selection technique is presented in a radar chart fig 4 this chart shows that elevation was the parameter with the highest effectiveness on swe 0 30 followed by re 0 16 ndvi 0 143 twi 0 142 plan curvature 0 141 ground slope 0 12 geology 0 099 aspect 0 091 spi 0 073 distance from river 0 070 land use 0 067 soil texture 0 030 ls 0 020 and hsg 0 016 4 2 swe susceptibility maps the delineated swe susceptibility maps showed the middle and eastern part of the catchment had a high and very high susceptibility to swe while the rest of the study area which surrounded the susceptible areas had a lower susceptibility fig 5 a c according to the roc model evaluation technique all models in terms of success rate and prediction rate had a very good prediction power 0 8 auc 0 9 fig 6 all models had the same performance in the training phase auc 0 85 but rnn was marginally superior in the testing phase auc 0 83 thus the rnn model had the highest generalization power albeit only slightly differences in the three maps are subtle the maps produced by the lstm and rnn models were most alike producing similar predictions for the percentage of catchment occupied by very low high very high susceptibility the cnn model predicted a higher percentage of very high susceptibility areas than the other two models but a slightly lower proportion of very low susceptibility fig 7 the cnn model overestimated the very high susceptibility classes while underestimated the moderate classes the lstm model overestimated the very low susceptibility classes while underestimated low and moderate susceptibility classes figs 5 and 7 according to the predictions made by the rnn model 19 8 of the study area had a very high swe susceptibility 19 7 20 8 20 8 and 18 9 had a high moderate low and very low susceptibility fig 7 overall 39 5 of the catchment had a high and very high susceptibility to swe 5 discussion 5 1 effectiveness of geo environmental factors to examine the effectiveness of each of the geo environmental factors a frequency ratio fr approach was used fr is a bivariate statistical approach that calculates the probabilistic relationship between swe susceptibility and each of the factors the fr is the ratio of the area where swe occurs to the total study area for a given attribute for each range or type of factor fr was calculated as follows fr d i i 1 n d i a i i 1 n a i where di is the area of swe of the i th category very low low medium high very high ai is the area of the i th category for a certain factor and n is the category number of the factor a derived fr value of more than 1 indicates a strong and positive relationship between the concerned class of the selected factor data layer and high swe susceptibility on the other hand a frequency ratio value of 1 suggests a poor and negative correlation between swe susceptibility and the concerned class of the factor data layer and low susceptibility the fr values and the elevation map fig 3a show that areas with lower and mid elevations 727 2404 m had a strong correlation with the highest swe susceptibility particularly due to mass movement areas with higher elevations may usually be thought to more susceptible due to higher rainfall and steeper slope thinner soils and bedrock outcrops however precipitation falls as snow in these higher elevations since snow has less erosivity than rainfall and can acts as an armor to protect soil from erosion these higher elevation areas therefore experience less erosion than the lower and mid elevations thus re had a poor correlation with swe fig 3f furthermore livestock farming is denser in low elevations resulting in overgrazing a reduction in vegetation cover especially during early spring when immature is damaged soil compaction lower infiltration rates lower soil retention and higher runoff combining to make soil more susceptible to rainsplash sheet rill and gully erosion sternberg et al 2000 orgill et al 2018 narantsetseg et al 2018 donovan and monaghan 2021 areas with low ndvi representing soil with little or no vegetation were strongly positively correlated with swe corresponding with higher susceptibility fig 8 whereas areas with high nvdi were negatively correlated because vegetation cover reduced the volume and intensity of rainfall reaching the soil surface e g vaezi et al 2016 and the detachment of sediment in overland flow in the long term vegetation also increases soil organic matter and improves soil physical properties e g puigdefabregas et al 1999 further reducing soil erosivity high values of twi were correlated strongly with swe since areas with high twi can indicate areas where there is an accumulation of water possibly due to the routing of overland flow resulting in a higher likelihood of particle detachment through rilling and gullying flat slopes were also associated with areas with high swe susceptibility since with all things constant such as soil thickness and vegetation cover lower angle slopes are most often associated with lower infiltration capacities and thus higher rates of runoff e g chen and young 2006 two lithological units pldv rhyolitic to rhyodacitic volcanic rocks and k2l2 thick bedded to massive limestone maastrichtian were highly correlated with areas of high swe with all other units displaying a weak association fig 8 slopes with different aspect receive differing amounts of solar radiation southerly aspects correspond strongly with areas of high swe since these areas receive more solar radiation reducing soil wetness aggregate stability and vegetation cover and more crusting of the soil surface reducing infiltration capacities and increasing runoff e g marques and mora 1992 fang and guo 2015 all other factors had a poor correlation with swe susceptibility 5 2 comparison in model performance since inputs were the same for each of the models the difference in performance between algorithms is attributable to their different computational structures rnn and lstm models outperformed the cnn model because they both have an internal memory that allows them to remember important information about the input they receive enhancing their precision in predicting what s coming next although the generalization ability of cnn is enhanced due to the use of a pooling layer their fitting ability is reduced when the inputs are low dimensional vectors leading to information loss liu et al 2019 cnn and rnn algorithms operate similarly by introducing sparsity and reusing the same neurons and weights however in the cnn model latent patterns in data are detected using convolution operations whereas in the rnn model the specific sequences in input data are found by considering the relationship between the current and the previous state allowing rnns to feed results back into the network also in cnn models the input size and resulting output are fixed but in rnn models they vary further the rnn algorithm benefits from a parameter sharing technique allowing rnn models to share parameters across different time steps in addition the incorporation of convolutional layers can stretch its efficiency to nearby pixels the cnn and lstm algorithms are feed forward neural networks but a backpropagation training algorithm is used in the rnn model providing the ability to more effectively interpret temporal information and capture long term dependencies in data as well as obtain a minimum error function value ajitha et al 2022 when these differences are taken together this greater complexity in the rnn computational structure accounts for the enhanced predictive power of rnn models over cnn models mutlu et al 2019 a direct comparison between our findings with those of previous studies is not possible as deep learning algorithms have not yet to be applied for swe modeling and mapping several studies have applied different ml models for swe mapping however yousefi et al 2021 applied three models of rf cart and svm model for swe susceptibility mapping in a different catchment in iran and reported these models have accuracies of between 0 89 and 0 96 based on the roc auc method these values are higher than reported in this study despite the use of more powerful algorithms resulting from the greater complexity in the relationships between the geo environmental factors and erosion processes in the catchment studied in the present paper in particular snow in mountainous areas high livestock density and deforestation in lowland areas and little variation in soil grain size resulted in some factors such as re land use and soil texture that would normally be well correlated with swe to be not well correlated and there was an unexpected relation with slope elevation in the same catchment sajedi hosseini et al 2018 applied a fuzzy dematel approach to swe mapping with an accuracy of 0 83 although their method has higher performance the generated map had higher uncertainty because the weights were calculated based on the expert opinion in contrast mosavi et al 2020 applied wsrf gaussprradial and nb methods for swe in the same study area and found predictive accuracy was lower wsrf with kappa index of 0 81 had a higher performance than gaussprradial 0 76 and nb with kappa 0 71 also abolhasani et al 2022 implemented rf boosted regression tree brt svm and classification and regression tree cart algorithms with auc values of 0 81 0 76 0 71 and 0 63 for swe mapping at qazvin plain iran the three models developed in the current study performed more strongly 5 3 applying deep learning models to map swe susceptibility the choice of the best predictive model is most often a compromise between model prediction accuracy and model complexity with the later in deep learning models most closely related to the data input requirements the major advantages of the deep learning models developed in this paper are their simplicity and their ease and in expense to build and run unlike physically based models whilst providing little compromise on model performance in other words the deep learning models provided good prediction performance based on inputs that are readily available from satellite imagery and national rainfall monitoring without the need for catchment or hillslope scale monitoring thus the results reveal that these models have great potential for use in swe susceptibility assessment in data poor catchments especially in developing nations where technical modeling skills and understanding of the hydrologic and erosion processes occurring in the catchment may be lacking the major disadvantages of these types of models however are twofold first like all statistical methods the developed models only relate directly to the catchments being considered and thus their application to other catchments may prove inappropriate future studies should apply the developed models to catchments with differing rainfall soils land use land cover geology and morphology to discover whether this is the case second due to their black box structure they provide poor explanatory power and thus are unable to extract understanding of the processes that cause changes in swe susceptibility with these considerations in mind the use of deep learning models may not simply lie in predicting erosion but integrating these techniques into process based models to help identify and optimize model parameters and mitigate uncertainty in model estimates e g vojinovic et al 2013 help recognize patterns within satellite data to unveil critical details about behavior and possibly reveal new environmental relationships future studies should seek to explore this potential this study has considered geo environmental factors that affect erosion where data is available future studies should consider human related factors in deep learning models such as livestock density e g evans 1997 arable yields e g gliessman 2004 the location of road networks e g deng et al 2011 keshkamat et al 2013 and distance from water resources e g mirzabaev et al 2016 for example yousefi et al 2016 reported that the rate of soil degradation around water resources was higher than in other parts more distant from water supplies deng et al 2011 demonstrated that when areas are composed of relatively high quality grassland roads lead to soil erosion and degradation whereas when grassland resources are sparse access to a road results in soil restoration in addition due to a lack of rainfall intensity data the current study had to take a simplified approach to account for rainfall as a factor using mean annual rainfall data to generate the re factor this approach does not account for the role of individual storm events and their magnitude and duration on soil erosion nor does it consider how preceding events affect susceptibility in proceeding events thus a focus for future studies should be on applying deep learning models to more data rich catchments using observations of rainfall intensity to generate the re factor with higher accuracy capolongo et al 2008 panagos et al 2015 petroselli et al 2021 since deep learning models are data driven one can postulate that with hourly rainfall data incorporated with the kind of satellite data used in this current study it should be possible to build more powerful more accurate models of soil erosion susceptibility over large spatial extents providing an important tool for targeting soil erosion control to those areas most susceptible and for identifying areas most suitable for sustainable agricultural development 6 conclusion soil erosion by water is a major cause of global land degradation and soil loss accurate predictions of erosion susceptibility are critical for protecting soils and targeting efforts to mitigate the impacts of erosion on ecosystem services water quality flooding and infrastructure using satellite data rainfall soil and other several readily available data this paper has quantified for the first time the potential of deep learning models to provide accurate predictions of soil water erosion swe susceptibility three state of the art deep learning algorithms convolutional neural network cnn recurrent neural network rnn and long short term memory lstm were applied to assess susceptibility in an iranian catchment that has historically experienced severe erosion the main findings were as follows 1 elevation was the most effective geo environmental variable on swe susceptibility followed by rainfall erosivity normalized difference vegetation index topographic wetness index plan curvature ground slope geology aspect stream power index distance from river land use soil texture slope length and steepness factor and hydrologic soil groups 2 model evaluation revealed that all three developed models had good prediction performance with rnn being marginally the most superior 3 maps of swe susceptibility revealed that almost 40 of the catchment was considered to be highly or very highly susceptible to swe and 20 moderately susceptible indicating the critical need for soil erosion control in this catchment to reduce susceptibility 4 swe mainly occurs in areas with elevations lower than 2700 m bare soils high twi flat curvature a southerly aspect and rhyolitic to rhyodacitic volcanic rocks the strength of these algorithms lies in their ease to implement use of readily available satellite and rainfall data and being inexpensive to build and run in comparison to physically based models whilst providing little compromise on model performance together these findings reveal that deep learning models have great potential for use in swe susceptibility assessment especially in situations when understanding of the physical processes at play may not be well understood or field monitoring data is lacking thus understanding more about this potential for different catchments and input variables represents a

2231,as an important part of global semi arid grassland adequately understanding how eco hydrological processes in the temperate semi arid grassland of china tsgc respond to environmental change over a century long time scale is of critical importance to environmental change adaptation and mitigation policy in the semi arid region we investigated the dynamics and driving forces of key eco hydrological variables leaf area index lai gross primary production gpp evapotranspiration et water yield wy and water use efficiency wue of 8 typical locations within the tsgc during the period 1901 2016 using a well tested mechanistic eco hydrological model seamlessly integrating land surface energy balance hydrological and carbon cycle vegetation dynamics and soil biogeochemistry results show that dominated by the elevated co2 the annual lai gpp and wue increased significantly during 1901 2016 indicating that the environmental conditions were conducive to vegetation growth warming conditions were a promoter of vegetation growth in sandy grassland but a suppressant in typical steppe due to water stress increase for the same reason et of sandy grassland exhibited a significant increasing trend in response to warming while that of typical steppe had an insignificant decreasing trend controlled by the precipitation decline warming and the vegetation growth acceleration due to the elevated co2 negatively influenced wy which showed a decreasing trend especially in the sandy grassland suggesting the reduction of available water resources overall our results revealed that this region especially sandy grassland exhibited an enhanced vegetation but decreased water yield trend under environmental changes occurred in the past century keywords semi arid grassland environmental change eco hydrological processes eco hydrological model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction semi arid regions constitute around 15 of the global land area and are estimated to feed about approximately 15 of the global population corvalan et al 2005 here the ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to environmental conditions zhang et al 2020 which have changed significantly since the industrial revolution for instance air temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 which are the key environmental factors affecting vegetation growth have increased by nearly 1 c and nearly 50 respectively since their preindustrial levels stocker et al 2013 consequently a growing number of pieces of evidence indicate that hydrological processes and ecosystem functions over these regions have shown substantial changes for example dominated water balance components were shown to decrease in the semi arid regions over the past several decades such as runoff and soil moisture decreased hansford et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 lakes shrank xu et al 2022 while vegetation functions were found to enhance such as the growing season integrated leaf area index lai and annual peak growth of global vegetation both increased terrestrial carbon uptake and water use efficiency increased cheng et al 2017 pan et al 2021 zhu et al 2016 the temperate semi arid grassland of china tsgc is an important part of the eurasian semi arid steppe ecosystem and a semi arid grassland research hotspot desertification and water shortage issues have been important concerns for human well being in this region kang et al 2007 tang et al 2019 therefore adequately understanding how the eco hydrological processes in the tsgc respond to environmental change especially co2 and temperature increases is of critical importance for sustainable environment preservation water resource planning and climate adaptation and mitigation policy in the semi arid region quantification of the responses of the water and carbon cycles which are tightly coupled since transpiration and photosynthetic carbon uptake both diffuse through leaf stomata to warming and rising co2 is complex especially in the semi arid regions with limited water availability cheng et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 climate warming is beneficial to vegetation greening by extending the growing seasons and also affects plant growth by increasing soil nitrogen mineralization and availability rustad et al 2001 zhang and ren 2017 however the promoting impact of warming on vegetation growth was diminished under water stress zhang and ren 2017 there is evidence that the responses of semi arid ecosystems to temperature change were regulated by precipitation with less positive responses in the dry years higher warming could trigger summer water deficiency due to evapotranspiration et losses thus increasing plant water stress and desiccation affecting the carbon uptake rates by photosynthesis and suppressing plant growth in the mid of the growing season huang et al 2018 zhang and ren 2017 high temperature also can close the stomata of plant leaf which would hinder carbon and water fluxes xie et al 2020 hence the net effect of warming on the vegetation and hydrological cycle in semi arid areas remains uncertain concurrently atmospheric co2 increase on the one hand it may reduce transpiration via partially closing the stomata of plant leaf on the other hand it can increase leaf co2 assimilation rates thus promoting plant growth and increasing leaf area fertilization effect which may increase et fatichi et al 2016 fatichi et al 2021 direct effects of elevated atmospheric co2 on stomatal conductance may be compensated by indirect effects of higher evaporation through larger leaf area thus constraining changes in et especially in arid and semi arid regions fatichi et al 2016 fatichi et al 2021 manzoni et al 2022 but it is not clear if these two effects balance out more complexly in water limited areas soil water is an important limiting factor for et so the increase in leaf area could reduce the benefits of elevated co2 concentration through soil water depletion and the ability of plants to respond to elevated co2 may also be controlled by nutrient limitation which is common in the drylands shi et al 2011 consequently in such water limited and nutrient limited regions there is still no consensus on how et and other hydrological cycle elements changes when co2 concentrations change in concert with increasing soil aridity here we applied a fully coupled eco hydrological model to investigate the dynamics of this semi arid region s eco hydrological processes and their responses to environmental change over a century long time scale the primary objectives of this article are to 1 driven by the environmental changes occurred from 1901 to 2016 at 8 typical sites across the tsgc assess the inter annual variability of the key eco hydrological variables i e lai gross primary production gpp et water yield wy defined as precipitation minus et is considered to be the primary indicator of water availability xia et al 2014 and water use efficiency wue and 2 provide quantitative evidence on how changes in environmental changes the elevated atmospheric co2 and temperature in particular have affected the centennial trends of these eco hydrological variables in this water limited semi arid grassland 2 study area tsgc fig 1 is a semiarid grassland with a temperate continental monsoon climate it covers roughly 448 500 km2 and crosses the inland river basin the yellow river basin and the liao river basin pang et al 2021 about 80 3 of this region are typical steppe ecosystems of which the dominant vegetation type is xerophytic bunch grasses and the dominant soil type is chestnut soil li et al 2020b shiyomi et al 2011 the other 19 7 are sandy grassland ecosystems of which the dominant vegetation type is the semiarid shrubs of artemisia and the dominate soil type is sand li et al 2020a this sandy grassland region is distributed mainly over the horqin desert the otindag desert the kubuqi desert and the mu us desert 3 sites and data 3 1 eddy covariance flux sites observation data for setting up and confirming model simulations were collected from 3 eddy covariance flux sites i e yulin site tongliao site and xilin gol site characterized by these two different grassland ecosystems within the tsgc table 1 the first two sites are located in the mu us desert and the horqin desert and have similar environmental conditions including vegetation and soil there are widely distributed fixed sand dunes and semi fixed sand dunes around the sites and the dominant soil type is sand the vegetation coverage of these sites is less than 30 xilin gol site is located in the xilingol grasslands which consist of natural pastures that are among the highest in quality in northern china the vegetation coverage is more than 80 and the soil is dark chestnut soil detailed soil content data of these sites could be obtained from soil sample experiments gong et al 2017 wang et al 2017 the observation items included half hourly meteorological

cm latent heat flux le sensible heat flux h net radiation rn and net ecosystem exchange nee nee fluxes were partitioned into gross primary production gpp and ecosystem respiration reco fluxes nee reco gpp using the reddyproc wutzler et al 2018 by the nighttime partitioning method reichstein et al 2005 the observation for the locations of yulin site and tongliao site spans a 1 year period july 2011 june 2012 and a 5 year period 2013 2017 respectively the observation for the locations of xilin gol site spans a 7 year period 2004 2010 except nee data which were available only in 2004 besides lai was sampled at tongliao site and xinlin gol site in the growing seasons by clipping representative leaf quadrants and measuring area using a canopy analyzer fan et al 2009 the atmospheric co2 data for these sites were extracted from the global monitoring division of noaa earth system research laboratory gml https www esrl noaa gov gmd ccgg the original co2 data was resampled into daily by a linear interpolation algorithm from monthly and then we assumed that co2 variability within a day can be neglected the yearly mean atmospheric nitrogen deposition depn data was provided by a comprehensive and synthetic dataset reconstructing the history of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs to the terrestrial biosphere hani at a 5 arcmin resolution and annual scale from 1860 to 2019 tian et al 2022 we assumed that depn is constant during a given year given the small amount of measured lai data we also made use of remote sensing estimates of lai at a 4 day temporal and a 500 m spatial resolution from the modis satellite data mcd15a3h myneni et al 2015 as auxiliary data for comparison with simulation results lai data was smoothed by savitzky golay filter cai et al 2017 and then interpolated to daily scale by spline interpolation method 3 2 typical simulation locations in order to avoid excessive computational costs for century long simulations we selected 8 typical simulation locations to conduct eco hydrological simulations fig 1 table 2 for ease of the spatial and temporal downscaling of climate data details of downscaling methods can be found below in this section we selected the weather stations with local measurements as simulation locations with the representativeness of the simulation case studies in mind first the nearest weather stations to the 3 eddy covariance flux sites used for setting up and confirming model simulations were included ie uxin banner horqin left back banner and xilin hot among them the first two weather stations are in the mu us desert and the horqin desert hence we added the dalad banner station in the kubuqi desert as a simulation location since there is no weather station in the otindag desert we did not set up a simulation location here in the typical steppe besides the xilin hot station we also selected 4 weather stations as simulation locations dashetai west uzhumuchin naran bulag and abaga banner which are scattered in the contiguous grassland region the 30 year 1988 2017 daily observation data of these weather stations for the latter spatial and temporal downscaling including prec temp rh ws pa and sunshine hours was obtained from the china meteorological administration cma https data cma cn the srad data was calculated from the sunshine hours using the food and agriculture organization fao method https www fao org 3 x0490e x0490e07 htm radiation cma also provided the hourly prec observation data during 2010 2017 for each station the long term meteorological reanalysis data for these weather stations were extracted from the climatic research unit national centers for environmental prediction cru ncep reanalysis products including prec temp ws rh srad and pa this dataset has a spatial resolution of 0 5 and a temporal resolution of 6 hour covering the period of 1901 2016 viovy 2018 several studies have verified the quality of this dataset barman et al 2014 guo et al 2018 sidike et al 2016 these data were used to drive the ecosystem model following a series of data management all the cru ncep data were processed into daily values to match the time scale of observations from weather stations a quantile delta mapping method was used for downscaling from the coarse spatial scale of the reanalysis dataset to the finer site scale with a daily step based on the 30 years of weather stations measured daily data from cma the long term reanalysis data for a site is detrended firstly and is bias corrected by the traditional quantile mapping method with the transfer function constructed in the baseline period when observational data of the reference weather station are available then the projected relative changes in quantiles are multiplied to the bias corrected outputs to obtain the final results for temperature which is an interval variable reimposition would be performed additively rather than multiplicatively this method preserves the relative changes of the reanalysis data in variables while at the same time correcting systematic biases in quantiles of the reanalysis series with respect to observed values a more detailed description of this algorithm can be found in cannon et al 2015 then all the cru ncep forcing variables were downscaled to a half hourly time step to run the simulations of this study for prec a model based on the relationship between rainfall intensity and duration was applied cao et al 2015 the site dependent parameters in the disaggregation model were calibrated for each site based on the hourly prec observation data during 2010 2017 obtained from cma for temp we first built the linear relationship between mean daily temp and daily maximum minimum temp based on observation data from the reference weather stations on this basis we estimated the daily maximum minimum temp during 1901 2016 by the spatial downscaled data then the hourly temp variation in a day was reconstructed using a sine curve which forces a sine curve through the daily maximum and minimum temperatures sammis and brown 2022 for ws and pa we assumed constant value throughout the day for rh first the daily dew point temperature was calculated using the daily rh and temp lawrence 2005 then we assumed that the dew point temperature remains constant during the day glassy and running 1994 so the hourly rh could be estimated by the hourly dew point temperature and temp for srad a simple model that can explicitly account for the processes of radiative transfer in the atmosphere was applied to calculate hourly data yang and koike 2005 its inputs are sunshine duration temp and rh so before performing this operation we calculated the sunshine duration from daily srad by the fao method as mentioned above the gml atmospheric co2 data mentioned in section 3 1 for the period of 1960 2016 did not cover the whole simulation period 1901 2016 therefore we added the mstmip environmental driver datasets https thredds daac ornl gov thredds catalog ornldaac 1220 catalog html for 1901 2010 on a monthly scale since the gml data is based on the direct atmospheric co2 measurements we corrected the mstmip co2 dataset for 1901 1959 using linear regression model based on the gml data in the coincidence period then produced a monthly co2 dataset covering 1901 2016 the monthly co2 data was resampled into daily by a linear interpolation algorithm we assumed that co2 variability within a day can be neglected same as the flux sites the depn data for these simulation locations was provided by the hani dataset we assumed that depn keep constant during the year in addition the site specific soil content of sand clay and organic matter of simulation locations were obtained from the soil database of china for land surface modeling with a spatial resolution of about 1 km shangguan et al 2013 4 methods 4 1 t c bg model 4 1 1 model description numerical simulations of energy water vegetation dynamics in each site were carried using the mechanistic terrestrial biosphere model t c bg see fatichi et al 2019 and reference therein for a detailed model description t c bg combines an eco hydrological model t c fatichi et al 2012 fatichi et al 2014 fugger et al 2022 mastrotheodoros et al 2020 paschalis et al 2022 which has been shown to have significant predictive capability across grassland ecosystem with a module simulating soil biogeochemistry and plant nutrient dynamics botter et al 2021 fatichi et al 2019 this module accounts for feedback between nutrient availability soil mineralization processes and plant growth the t c bg model simulates all essential components of hydrological energy and carbon cycles for instance swc rn h le and gpp are all prognostically computed at hourly time steps the vegetation module describes physiological vegetation processes including vegetation phenology photosynthesis respiration and carbon and nutrient budgets lai is also a prognostic variable that varies in response to phenology and environmental conditions 4 1 2 model configuration the t c bg model could simulate energy water vegetation dynamics of different vegetation types and only grassland is included in this study because the typical steppe and sandy grassland differ in their main vegetation and soil characteristics we set up t c bg models in these two grassland regions separately in the 3 eddy covariance flux sites we forced the model with the local observed meteorological data co2 data and depn data for running the model and evaluating the model performance the total depth of the soil column was set as 2 m and was discretized using 14 vertical layers with increasing depth from near the land surface to the bedrock model parameters describing the soil texture were adjusted based on soil sample experiments as mentioned in section 3 1 the selection of vegetation parameters was mainly based on previous experience with european and chinese grasslands botter et al 2021 yu et al 2020 some parameters describing phenology photosynthetic capacity and biophysical variables were manually adjusted to match observed dynamics as is common in modeling studies other parameters were obtained on the basis of physical knowledge plant physiological literature and expert knowledge the parameters selected for the final model configuration are detailed in table s1 in the supplementary material in the long term simulation at the 8 typical locations for the same grassland type we adopt the same vegetation parametrization for all sites in the simulations in other words we set up t c bg model in typical steppe based on the forcing data of xilin gol site and then all 5 typical steppe simulation locations shared the same vegetation parameter settings for sandy grassland we set up the model based on the forcing data at yulin and tongliao sites and then applied the vegetation parametrization at all the 3 sandy grassland locations the site specific parameters describing the soil content were adjusted based on the soil dataset as mentioned in section 3 2 the initial conditions of soil carbon and nutrient pools at the beginning of the last century were established by spinning up the soil biogeochemistry module first the average climatic conditions were obtained from the preliminary model simulations with the soil biogeochemistry module inactive i e t c model then we spun up soil carbon and nutrient pools by running only the soil biogeochemistry module for 1000 years under these average climatic conditions these results were used as the initial conditions of the soil biogeochemistry module for the fully coupled simulations over the period with hourly forcing data this operation is repeated several times to achieve a dynamic equilibrium with the current climate botter et al 2021 4 1 3 model confirmation to comprehensively evaluate the t c bg model performance we compared an ensemble of diverse variables at the three locations of xilin gol tongliao and yulin which were equipped with eddy covariance towers first to assess the model performance in reproducing the land surface energy and carbon fluxes we compared simulated and observed rn h le and gpp using flux tower data on a daily scale second we assessed the model performance in reproducing the hydrological variables by comparing the swc from the simulation results and from the in situ measurements third we evaluated the model performance in reproducing vegetation dynamics by comparing the lai time series from the model with that from local measurements and remote sensing dataset the slope of the linear fitting lines the root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 were calculated to assess the model performance we presented a confirmation of model performance in typical steppe based on observation data from xilin gol site and that in sandy grassland based on observation data from yulin site and tongliao site the model simulation for the locations of xilin gol site spans a 7 year period and that for yulin site and tongliao site spans a combined total of 6 year period 4 2 attribution of annual eco hydrologic trends to separate the contributions of the main drivers to annual trends of eco hydrologic variables in the period of 1901 2016 a series of controlled numerical experiments are conducted where forcing variables are modified one factor at a time given that climate change can impact terrestrial eco hydrological processes in relation to changes in atmospheric evaporative demand water supply and surface available energy xie et al 2020 we selected prec temp rh srad and ws as the main climatic factors to test the rising co2 concentration was also included in the assessment of causality besides depn is also currently recognized as the main factor affecting the structure and function of ecosystems since nitrogen is a key factor affecting plant photosynthetic capacity increased nitrogen addition can enhance the vegetation growth peak which may be related to the plant photosynthetic capacity stimulated by leaf nitrogen concentrations ali et al 2015 hence depn was also included in the attribution a series of experimental simulations included a transient run in which all factors are transient and single factor simulations in which for each forcing variable prec temp rh srad ws co2 and depn its long term annual trend is removed separately while all other variables are transient the differences between the simulation results of transient run and single factor control experiments represent the net impacts of that single variable on eco hydrologic processes in other words differences in the trend could be considered as the contribution of that single variable to the annual change in lai gpp et wy and wue liu et al 2018 on account of the high nonlinearity of the model leading to interactive effects among forcing variables and potential intra annual trends not removed by annual detrending the sum of the contribution of each factor may not exactly equal the simulated result of the transient run stein and alpert 1993 furthermore the attribution analysis did not include the influence of atmospheric air pressure as one of the input data we grouped these unexplained factors together in others 4 3 trend analysis a linear model y t k t y 0 was used to analyze the linear trends of the variables y t where k t and y 0 are respectively the slope time and intercept of the linear regression line chen et al 2017 meanwhile the significance of the trend was tested by the f test and was classified into statistically significant p 0 05 and insignificant p 0 05 5 results 5 1 model evaluation here we show the comparison between the simulated and the observed swc at various depths to evaluate the hydrological dynamics t c bg captures the swc dynamics and reproduces the decay of soil moisture pulses quite well at different sites at xilin gol site fig 2 a b the r2 of 0 10 cm and 20 50 cm equal 0 67 and 0 42 and the rmse is 3 49 and 5 84 at yulin tongliao sites fig 3 a c the r2 of 0 10 cm 20 50 cm and 80 200 cm equal 0 48 0 49 and 0 40 and the rmse is in the range of 2 17 2 77 across the three depths which is comparable with soil moisture measurement accuracy better performances are obtained near the surface than in deeper soil layers another difference is that the model simulation results for swc at deep soil layers are close to 0 in winter while the observed data are not considering the presence of frozen soil throughout the winter season we think that the model simulations are more realistic while the measurements have observation errors in winter the model performance in reproducing energy flux dynamics is illustrated in fig 2c e and fig 3d f the observed and simulated rn series are very close with slopes of 0 84 and 1 00 r2 of 0 86 and 0 89 and rmse of 24 9 w m2 and 18 7 w m2 in typical steppe site and sandy grassland sites respectively model performance of h dynamics is relatively lower at all sites where the r2 for daily h are 0 45 and 0 63 and the simulated value overestimates observations daily le dynamics are captured well as far as the magnitudes and the intra annual cycle are concerned with r2 of 0 59 and 0 63 and rmse of 20 9 w m2 and 11 7 w m2 in terms of slope 0 74 and 0 85 le value is slightly underestimated overall the model explains most of the variability in the daily energy fluxes during these years where observations are available in all sites the simulated gpp series is similar to the observation data the slopes of the linear fitting line at all sites are close to 1 r2 at the daily scale equals 0 79 and 0 74 for the xilin gol site fig 2f and the yulin tongliao sites fig 3g showing that more than 70 of the variability in daily gpp is captured by the model the simulated gpp compares favorably with the observations with rmse of 0 80 gc m2 day and 0 32 gc m2 day a comparison of simulations and observations in terms of lai is carried out using local sampling data and remote sensing data from modis at xilin gol site fig 2g the lai peak value given by remote sensing products was higher than the ground observations and t c bg simulations are much closer to the former the r2 of the simulation compared to the ground inferred and remotely inferred lai equal 0 38 and 0 76 and the rmse are 0 31 m2 m2 and 0 19 m2 m2 at tongliao site fig 3h the r2 of the simulation compared to the sampling data and modis data equal 0 87 and 0 79 and the rmse are 0 09 m2 m2 and 0 28 m2 m2 the results show a good match in temporal dynamics which confirmed that the site phenology and inter annual variability were appropriately simulated there is however a little seasonal delay in the annual peaks in the simulated time series at tongliao site as compared to both ground observations and remote sensing estimates overall the model performance in representing the key variables measured from the flux towers given the uncertainty of measurement themselves could be regarded as satisfactory across all the sites 5 2 changes in environmental factors the annual prec averaged across all sites over the period 1901 2016 was 306 76 mm yr and that of the sandy grassland was relatively higher than that of the typical steppe table 3 annual prec of both grassland regions exhibited decreasing but insignificant trends p 0 05 over the entire period while the decreasing rate of the typical steppe was higher than that of the sandy grassland fig 4 a table 3 annual rh with an average of 53 5 4 3 also exhibited insignificant decreasing trend over the entire period fig 4b the annual temp averaged across all sites over the study period had a multi year average of 4 19 2 9 c and showed a significant upward trend at an average rate of 0 016 0 0021 c yr over the entire period fig 4c among them the multi year average of the sandy grassland was about 4 5 c higher than that of the typical steppe while the typical steppe increasing at a higher rate annual srad and ws exhibited significant decreases at average rates of 0 025 0 0013 w m2 yr and 0 0011 0 0003 m s yr during 1901 2016 respectively fig 4d e as expected the inter annual variability of co2 is consistent across sites and all showed a significant increasing trend throughout the century fig 4f similarly depn increased significantly over the entire study period especially after the 1960s when the upward trend was more prominent fig 4g 5 3 changes in simulated eco hydrological variables the annual lai across all sites had a multi year average of 0 36 0 16 m2 m2 table 4 and showed a significant increasing trend at a rate of 7 5 3 4 10 4 m2 m2 yr during 1901 2016 fig 5 a separately lai at the sandy grassland sites was obviously lower than that at the typical steppe sites table 4 fig 5b but the increasing trend of the sandy grassland was more outstanding which was approximately 1 5 times larger than the increasing rate of the typical steppe the annual gpp averaged over the period 1901 2016 was 177 83 0 gc m2 yr across all sites and gpp at the sandy grassland sites was less than half of that at the typical steppe sites table 4 the average gpp across all sites showed an outstanding increasing trend at a rate of 0 51 0 13 gc m2 yr2 during 1901 2016 fig 5c there were significant upward trends in gpp in both grassland types for the study period at comparable rates average annual et across all sites in the region had no significant trend for the entire study period with a multi year average of 248 54 7 mm yr fig 5e which accounted for 81 0 20 3 of the precipitation the annual mean et of the sandy grassland sites 209 19 8 mm yr 57 8 1 7 of the precipitation was lower than that at the typical steppe sites 271 51 5 mm yr 99 5 0 41 of the precipitation different from the whole region and the typical steppe et of the sandy grassland sites exhibited a significant increasing trend at a rate of 0 10 0 09 mm yr2 over the entire period the average wy across all sites within the tsgc had an insignificant decreasing trend during the study period at the annual scale fig 5g the multi year average wy of the sandy grassland was 152 51 0 mm yr while that of the typical steppe fluctuated around zero with an average of 0 88 26 2 mm yr although neither was significant the rate of annual wy decline of sandy grassland 0 14 0 12 mm yr2 was much higher than that of the typical steppe 0 006 0 0054 mm yr2 the annual wue across all sites had a multi year average of 0 75 0 19 gc kg h2o table 4 and showed a particularly strong increasing trend at a rate of 2 23 0 58 10 3 gc kg h2o yr during 1901 2016 fig 5i separately the annual wue of the sandy grassland sites was relatively lower than that of the typical steppe sites but the increasing trend of the former was higher than that of the latter table 4 fig 5j in summary the eco hydrological processes of our study region especially the sandy grassland have experienced significant changes over the last century which is mainly manifested by the improvement of vegetation conditions and the decline of water yield 5 4 drivers of the trends in eco hydrologic variables for the period of 1901 2016 based on a series of factor controlled numerical experiments we quantified the contributions of main climatic forcing prec temp rh srad and ws co2 concentration and depn to the annual trend of simulated eco hydrologic variables fig 6 the most important factor in regulating lai increasing trend was the elevated co2 which generated a change in lai corresponding to 42 7 and 153 6 of the lai increasing trend of sandy grassland and typical steppe respectively temp also was an important factor in regulating the annual lai trend while it had different impacts in sandy grassland and typical steppe for sandy grassland increasing temp was the second major factor in shaping the increase of lai with a relative contribution of 24 7 conversely for typical steppe the influence of rising temp on the lai trend was negative accounting for 18 2 of the lai trend as for prec the negative effects of it on sandy grassland lai trend were statistically insignificant while that on typical steppe was much greater accounting for 25 9 of the lai trend in general the different contributions of temp and prec were mostly responsible for the greater upward trend of lai in sandy grassland than in typical steppe besides the depn increase also contributed positively to the lai trend in these two grasslands and the decreasing srad and rh had a negative influence on the lai trend in this region even though of small magnitude the attribution results of the annual gpp trend for the period 1901 2016 fig 6b were in general agreement with those of lai co2 played a dominant role in promoting gpp it accounted for 54 6 and 112 9 of the gpp increasing trend of sandy grassland and typical steppe respectively for sandy grassland increasing temp was the second major factor in regulating the increase of gpp with a relative contribution of 18 6 but for typical steppe the second important factor in regulating gpp trend was the declining prec which contributed a decreasing trend to lai 16 6 and rising temp had a negative influence on gpp trend different from the sandy grassland for the increasing trend of sandy grassland et during 1901 2016 warming was the dominant factor with a relative contribution of 72 9 fig 6c secondly co2 and depn also had a significant positive effect on the et trend in this region accounting for 37 1 and 22 4 of the et trend the decreasing srad had a negative influence on the et trend with a relative contribution of 18 2 different from the sandy grassland the positive contribution of temp increase to the typical steppe et trend was relatively lower and the rising co2 and depn also did not have a significant effect on the typical steppe et trend as the ecosystem was completely water limited here decreasing prec considerably dominated et decreasing trend 110 0 mirroring controls on et temp rise was the most important contributor to the decreasing trend of sandy grassland wy during 1901 2016 with a relative contribution of 56 3 fig 6d the increasing co2 and depn also had a negative influence on the wy trend accounting for 28 6 and 17 3 of the wy decreasing trend in the sandy grassland the decrease prec has also led to a declining trend of wy 13 0 conversely the srad decrease contributed a positive trend to wy for the typical steppe there was no significant trend in wy and no significant contribution of each factor to wy trend for the study period as almost all precipitation is converted into et the co2 increase had an overwhelmingly dominant effect on the increasing trend of wue fig 6e for the sandy grassland and the typical steppe the relative contributions of co2 were 61 and 105 7 temp was the second most important factor in regulating the trend of annual wue similar to lai and gpp temp had a positive contribution 9 0 to the wue trend of sandy grassland but a negative contribution 21 1 to that of the typical steppe in addition elevated depn also had a significant positive effect on the sandy grassland wue trend with a relative contribution of 6 3 while the declining prec contributed a decreasing trend 5 9 to the wue annual trend of the typical steppe 6 discussion 6 1 model performance it is a challenge for a single integrated model to concurrently reproduce land surface energy and carbon fluxes hydrological and vegetation dynamics botter et al 2021 while the t c bg model responds well to it across three grassland sites characterized by two different grassland types energy and carbon fluxes hydrology and vegetation dynamics are well simulated with several exceptions discussed below we argue that the simulation results of t c bg model are encouraging and they enabled us to explore the complex functions of the grassland ecosystem and to support the virtual numerical experiments that have been run there are still some uncertainties in the model simulations that are worth highlighting it is widely known that energy non closure is an unavoidable problem of the eddy covariance system leuning et al 2012 liu et al 2011 compared with the observed values the model overestimates h thus indicating that the missing energy may be attributed to h which is supported by other studies botter et al 2021 the model does not perform as well at deeper soil layers in reproducing soil water content as it does near the surface this is likely because the soil hydraulic parameters for the different layers were set to be consistent with the surface soil due to the lack of experimental data this uncertainty could be resolved if additional observations allow to estimate soil parameters at different layers besides uncertainty in the forcing data is significant in these model simulations the meteorological dataset used in this article was cru ncep with over a century long time scale and a resolution of 0 5 latitude longitude grid though we spatially and temporally downscaled the long term reanalysis data based on the observations from the reference weather stations other sources of error may still occur in the spatio temporal downscaled forcing for example we constructed a relationship between rainfall intensity and duration based on hourly precipitation data for 8 years and applied it to throughout a century without considering whether this relationship has changed 6 2 responses of eco hydrological variables to environmental changes our studies revealed that co2 had a leading function in promoting the lai gpp and wue of the tsgc over the study period which agreed with many previous studies huang et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 zhang and ren 2017 co2 is the substrate of photosynthesis and concentrations above current environmental levels would stimulate the plant carbon assimilation this fertilization effect of co2 affects vegetation productivity and in principle should lead to the increase of biomass and green vegetation cover greening knauer et al 2017 ukkola et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 these plant fundamental physiological responses to rising co2 through increased net carbon assimilation and reduced stomatal conductance also lead to increased intrinsic wue while the increase rate of co2 was comparable in the two regions table 3 the positive effect of co2 on vegetation growth in the typical steppe was larger than that in the sandy grassland fig 6 this is because the lower vegetation coverage of sandy grassland 30 compared with that of typical steppe 80 may weaken the influence of co2 at the unit scale in this study further reasons can be connected to the water limitations typical steppe is already using almost all the available water et prec and it is more often stressed than the sandy grassland therefore co2 induced temporary savings of soil moisture are stimulating productivity more than in the sandy grassland temp also played an important role in regulating the variation of annual lai gpp and wue our studies found that temp had different impacts in sandy grassland and typical steppe for sandy grassland our results revealed that vegetation growth was enhanced due to the warming trend because as introduced in section 1 warmer conditions are typically associated with overall better conditions for plant growth and prolonged growing season however due to the more significant warming trend in typical steppe and mostly because the typical steppe is already using almost all available water the increasing temperature amplified the periods when water limitation caused by evapotranspiration losses both seasonally and annually thus increasing the plant water stress and partially affecting the carbon uptake rates by photosynthesis and mostly the lai the meta analysis of 466 experiments across 719 plant species conducted by huang et al 2018 suggested similar results with warming promoting shrub growth but inhibiting typical grassland growth xie et al 2020 and zhou et al 2015 also found that the continued warming trend might suppress vegetation growth in some regions within the tsgc or periods besides as expected prec decrease had a negative effect on the vegetation growth especially in typical steppe this greater negative effect was not only because the downward trend in prec in this grassland region was more pronounced but also because this ecosystem was completely water limited several studies have yielded similar conclusions that the sensitivity of vegetation productivity to prec variation would increase as regional mean prec decreases fatichi and ivanov 2014 huxman et al 2004 knapp et al 2017 maurer et al 2020 taking all environmental effects together the difference in the co2 effect between the two ecosystems was compensated by the different effects of temp and prec this is why the upward trend of gpp is at a comparable level in the two grassland ecosystems but these effects are amplified for lai as reflected by larger differences in lai increasing trends between the two regions because the vegetation in a water stressed steppe is more difficult to convert gpp into aboveground biomass fatichi 2010 krinner et al 2005 this result is similar to that of zhang et al 2019 who revealed that vegetation greening does not bring a proportional increase in vegetation productivity warming dominated the increasing trend of sandy grassland et while the effect of warming on typical steppe et was relatively lower elevated temperature can directly influence et by increasing potential evapotranspiration and indirectly by affecting vegetation growth but as discussed above in the typical steppe these controls are not important as et was roughly equivalent to prec here and thus controlled solely by the amount of available water and given the greater downward trend of prec in the typical steppe prec decline replaced warming as the dominant factor in et decreasing trend here overall for et temp and prec are the two most important dominant factors over the entire tsgc which is consistent with many previous studies based on different et estimation models and attribution analysis methods li et al 2018 pan et al 2020 sun et al 2020 xia et al 2014 besides we found that co2 also had a significant positive effect on the et trend in this region for the past century which means that the co2 fertilization effect on increasing lai and thus et overcame the negative effect of stomatal closure xie et al 2020 conducted an attribution analysis of et over this region from 1982 to 2017 using the multiple linear regression method and reached a similar conclusion ukkola et al 2016 also confirmed a significant positive sensitivity of et to co2 in semi arid regions also due to the limitation of available water co2 promoted et much less in typical steppes than in sandy grasslands ukkola et al 2016 finally the results revealed that warming was the most important factor contributing to the decline in wy during 1901 2016 especially in the sandy grassland region despite the lack of studies on such long time scales studies focusing on recent decades have yielded similar conclusions for example based on the in situ soil moisture measurements of the last 30 years zhang et al 2017 indicated that higher temperature was the main cause of soil moisture reduction and soil drought over our study region the results of dai et al 2004 suggest that the increase in near surface air temperature which increased the water holding capacity of the air and thus its demand for moisture has been the main reason for the widespread soil moisture drying during the last several decades besides in sandy grassland the vegetation growth acceleration due to the elevated co2 and depn increased et and thus also became important factors in wy decline by comparison wy is relatively insensitive to changes in the typical steppe where et matched precipitation and wy was nearly zero in other words driven by environmental changes in sandy grassland et could increase at the expense of wy as et was considerably lower than precipitation here but because the typical steppe has already used almost all available water neither warming nor rising co2 could prompt these ecosystems to use more water 6 3 implications our study revealed that environmental changes promoted vegetation growth and reduced water resources over the tsgc during 1901 2016 first we presented numerical evidence that the entire tsgc region experienced a significant increase in vegetation productivity vegetation cover and water use efficiency in the period of 1901 2016 this is a positive sign that desertification was mitigated by co2 fertilization over a century long time scale but it is noteworthy that the available water resources amount has been on a downward trend this has been reflected in the real world as introduced in section 1 coupled with the pressure from population growth and economic development in recent years the conflict between the demand and supply of water resources is increasingly outstanding in addition these changes are particularly dramatic in sandy grassland areas where the lai gpp and wue exhibited more pronounced increasing trends and the wy declined at a greater rate this also alerts us on paying more attention to desert areas with an already fragile environment our results highlight the large role increased vegetation activity played in the decreasing trend of wy during 1901 2016 over the tsgc the increase in vegetation activity due to co2 and depn alone accounted for at least 47 of the declining trend of the average available water resources amount for all sites however it should be noted that this study only focused on the environmental change effects the effects of direct human activities change effect are not analyzed in reality since 1998 china has implemented a number of ecological restoration projects to improve the ecological environment of this region one of the world s largest revegetation programs the grain for green project is launched in 1999 returning cultivated land into forest and grass to increase the vegetation cover of the loess plateau which contains most areas in our study area belonging to the yellow river basin shao et al 2019 a large number of ecological restoration measures have also been taken to alleviate the desertification of grasslands such as the artificial grassland establishment bryan et al 2018 these large scale vegetation recoveries and ecological engineering construction have greatly improved the vegetation coverage of these areas liu et al 2020 necessarily at the expense of even more water consumption than computed with our simulations the findings of this study have an important implication for vegetation restoration given the decline in water resources that has occurred in this region because of the environmental changes there should be careful consideration about the implementation of further ecosystem restoration projects especially in sandy grassland it is necessary to use eco hydrological approaches to compute the water losses caused by vegetation growth and assess the carrying capacity before promoting a policy of reforestation 7 conclusion we first validated a fully coupled terrestrial biosphere model using collected observations from 3 eddy covariance flux towers then we applied the model to investigate the changes in eco hydrological variables using lai gpp et wy and wue as indicators driven by the environmental changes occurred from 1901 to 2016 at 8 simulation locations within the tsgc region based on the modeling results we then assessed the contributions of climatic factors atmospheric co2 and depn to the trends in these key eco hydrologic variables by a series of controlled numerical experiments on average from all sites in the tsgc the environmental conditions during the study period 1901 2016 were conducive to vegetation growth all sites averaged lai gpp and wue showed significant increases stimulated by the elevated atmospheric co2 annual et showed an insignificant increasing trend over a century long time scale the increasing temperature and co2 had a significant positive effect on the trend of annual et but these effects were partly offset by the precipitation decline the average wy across all sites had a slightly decreasing trend during 1901 2016 which was dominated by warming suggesting a potential reduction of available water resources under different water stress there were obvious differences in the responses of eco hydrological processes to environmental changes between the two grassland regions warming was a promoter of vegetation growth in sandy grassland where et could increase at the expense of wy as et was considerably lower than precipitation but a suppressant of vegetation growth in typical steppe where et matches precipitation and warming would increase the plant water stress for the same reason prec decline elicited a much stronger response in vegetation and et of typical steppe compared with the sandy grassland overall the total centennial environmental changes were inclined to promote vegetation growth and increase et at the expense of wy while these effects would be reduced and even reversed under water stresses in general the eco hydrological processes of our study region especially the sandy grassland have experienced significant changes over the last century which is mainly manifested by the improvement of vegetation conditions and the decline of water yield our results contributed to a more quantitative understanding of the effect of environmental change on the eco hydrological processes of tsgc region and bring

2231,as an important part of global semi arid grassland adequately understanding how eco hydrological processes in the temperate semi arid grassland of china tsgc respond to environmental change over a century long time scale is of critical importance to environmental change adaptation and mitigation policy in the semi arid region we investigated the dynamics and driving forces of key eco hydrological variables leaf area index lai gross primary production gpp evapotranspiration et water yield wy and water use efficiency wue of 8 typical locations within the tsgc during the period 1901 2016 using a well tested mechanistic eco hydrological model seamlessly integrating land surface energy balance hydrological and carbon cycle vegetation dynamics and soil biogeochemistry results show that dominated by the elevated co2 the annual lai gpp and wue increased significantly during 1901 2016 indicating that the environmental conditions were conducive to vegetation growth warming conditions were a promoter of vegetation growth in sandy grassland but a suppressant in typical steppe due to water stress increase for the same reason et of sandy grassland exhibited a significant increasing trend in response to warming while that of typical steppe had an insignificant decreasing trend controlled by the precipitation decline warming and the vegetation growth acceleration due to the elevated co2 negatively influenced wy which showed a decreasing trend especially in the sandy grassland suggesting the reduction of available water resources overall our results revealed that this region especially sandy grassland exhibited an enhanced vegetation but decreased water yield trend under environmental changes occurred in the past century keywords semi arid grassland environmental change eco hydrological processes eco hydrological model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction semi arid regions constitute around 15 of the global land area and are estimated to feed about approximately 15 of the global population corvalan et al 2005 here the ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to environmental conditions zhang et al 2020 which have changed significantly since the industrial revolution for instance air temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 which are the key environmental factors affecting vegetation growth have increased by nearly 1 c and nearly 50 respectively since their preindustrial levels stocker et al 2013 consequently a growing number of pieces of evidence indicate that hydrological processes and ecosystem functions over these regions have shown substantial changes for example dominated water balance components were shown to decrease in the semi arid regions over the past several decades such as runoff and soil moisture decreased hansford et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 lakes shrank xu et al 2022 while vegetation functions were found to enhance such as the growing season integrated leaf area index lai and annual peak growth of global vegetation both increased terrestrial carbon uptake and water use efficiency increased cheng et al 2017 pan et al 2021 zhu et al 2016 the temperate semi arid grassland of china tsgc is an important part of the eurasian semi arid steppe ecosystem and a semi arid grassland research hotspot desertification and water shortage issues have been important concerns for human well being in this region kang et al 2007 tang et al 2019 therefore adequately understanding how the eco hydrological processes in the tsgc respond to environmental change especially co2 and temperature increases is of critical importance for sustainable environment preservation water resource planning and climate adaptation and mitigation policy in the semi arid region quantification of the responses of the water and carbon cycles which are tightly coupled since transpiration and photosynthetic carbon uptake both diffuse through leaf stomata to warming and rising co2 is complex especially in the semi arid regions with limited water availability cheng et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 climate warming is beneficial to vegetation greening by extending the growing seasons and also affects plant growth by increasing soil nitrogen mineralization and availability rustad et al 2001 zhang and ren 2017 however the promoting impact of warming on vegetation growth was diminished under water stress zhang and ren 2017 there is evidence that the responses of semi arid ecosystems to temperature change were regulated by precipitation with less positive responses in the dry years higher warming could trigger summer water deficiency due to evapotranspiration et losses thus increasing plant water stress and desiccation affecting the carbon uptake rates by photosynthesis and suppressing plant growth in the mid of the growing season huang et al 2018 zhang and ren 2017 high temperature also can close the stomata of plant leaf which would hinder carbon and water fluxes xie et al 2020 hence the net effect of warming on the vegetation and hydrological cycle in semi arid areas remains uncertain concurrently atmospheric co2 increase on the one hand it may reduce transpiration via partially closing the stomata of plant leaf on the other hand it can increase leaf co2 assimilation rates thus promoting plant growth and increasing leaf area fertilization effect which may increase et fatichi et al 2016 fatichi et al 2021 direct effects of elevated atmospheric co2 on stomatal conductance may be compensated by indirect effects of higher evaporation through larger leaf area thus constraining changes in et especially in arid and semi arid regions fatichi et al 2016 fatichi et al 2021 manzoni et al 2022 but it is not clear if these two effects balance out more complexly in water limited areas soil water is an important limiting factor for et so the increase in leaf area could reduce the benefits of elevated co2 concentration through soil water depletion and the ability of plants to respond to elevated co2 may also be controlled by nutrient limitation which is common in the drylands shi et al 2011 consequently in such water limited and nutrient limited regions there is still no consensus on how et and other hydrological cycle elements changes when co2 concentrations change in concert with increasing soil aridity here we applied a fully coupled eco hydrological model to investigate the dynamics of this semi arid region s eco hydrological processes and their responses to environmental change over a century long time scale the primary objectives of this article are to 1 driven by the environmental changes occurred from 1901 to 2016 at 8 typical sites across the tsgc assess the inter annual variability of the key eco hydrological variables i e lai gross primary production gpp et water yield wy defined as precipitation minus et is considered to be the primary indicator of water availability xia et al 2014 and water use efficiency wue and 2 provide quantitative evidence on how changes in environmental changes the elevated atmospheric co2 and temperature in particular have affected the centennial trends of these eco hydrological variables in this water limited semi arid grassland 2 study area tsgc fig 1 is a semiarid grassland with a temperate continental monsoon climate it covers roughly 448 500 km2 and crosses the inland river basin the yellow river basin and the liao river basin pang et al 2021 about 80 3 of this region are typical steppe ecosystems of which the dominant vegetation type is xerophytic bunch grasses and the dominant soil type is chestnut soil li et al 2020b shiyomi et al 2011 the other 19 7 are sandy grassland ecosystems of which the dominant vegetation type is the semiarid shrubs of artemisia and the

covariance flux sites observation data for setting up and confirming model simulations were collected from 3 eddy covariance flux sites i e yulin site tongliao site and xilin gol site characterized by

these sites were extracted from the global monitoring division of noaa earth system research laboratory gml https www esrl noaa gov gmd ccgg the original co2 data was resampled into daily by a linear interpolation algorithm from monthly and then we assumed that co2 variability within a day can be neglected the yearly mean atmospheric nitrogen deposition depn data was provided by a comprehensive

assumed that depn is constant during a given year given the small amount of measured lai data we also made use of remote sensing estimates of lai at a 4 day temporal and a 500 m spatial resolution from the modis satellite data mcd15a3h myneni et al 2015 as auxiliary data for comparison with simulation results lai data was smoothed by savitzky golay filter cai et al 2017 and then interpolated to

conduct eco hydrological simulations fig 1 table 2 for ease of the spatial and temporal downscaling of climate data details of downscaling methods can be found below in this section we selected the weather stations with local measurements as simulation locations with the representativeness of the simulation case studies in mind first the nearest weather stations to the 3 eddy covariance flux sites used for setting up and confirming model simulations were included ie uxin banner horqin left back banner and xilin hot among them the first two weather stations are in the mu us desert and the horqin desert hence we added the dalad banner station in the kubuqi desert as a simulation location since there is no weather station in the otindag desert we did not set up a simulation location here in the typical steppe besides the xilin hot station we also selected 4 weather stations as simulation locations dashetai west uzhumuchin naran bulag and abaga banner which are scattered in the

were used to drive the ecosystem model following a series of data management all the cru ncep data were processed into daily values to match the time scale of observations from weather stations a quantile delta mapping method was used for downscaling from the coarse spatial scale of the reanalysis dataset to the finer site scale with a daily step based on the 30 years of weather stations measured daily data from cma the long term reanalysis data for a site is detrended firstly and is bias corrected by the traditional quantile mapping method with the transfer function constructed in the baseline period when observational data of the reference weather station are available then the projected relative changes in quantiles are multiplied to the bias corrected outputs to obtain the final results for temperature which is an interval variable reimposition would be performed additively rather than multiplicatively this method preserves the relative changes of the reanalysis data in variables while at the same time correcting systematic biases in quantiles of the reanalysis series with respect to observed values a more detailed description of this algorithm can be found in cannon et al 2015 then all the cru ncep forcing variables were downscaled to a half hourly time step to run the simulations of this study for prec a model based on the relationship between rainfall intensity and duration was applied cao et al 2015 the site dependent parameters in the disaggregation model were calibrated for each site based on the hourly prec observation data during 2010 2017 obtained from cma for temp we first built the linear relationship between mean daily temp and daily maximum minimum temp based on observation data from the reference weather stations on this basis we estimated the daily maximum minimum temp during 1901 2016 by the spatial downscaled data then the hourly temp variation in a day was reconstructed using a sine curve which forces a sine curve through the daily maximum and minimum temperatures sammis and brown 2022 for ws and pa we assumed constant value throughout the day for rh first the daily dew point temperature was calculated using the daily rh and temp lawrence 2005 then we assumed that the dew point temperature remains constant during the day glassy and running 1994 so the hourly rh could be estimated by the hourly dew point temperature and temp for srad a simple model that can explicitly account for the processes of radiative transfer in the atmosphere was applied to calculate hourly data yang and koike 2005 its inputs are sunshine duration temp and rh so before performing this operation we calculated the sunshine duration from daily srad by the fao method as mentioned above the gml atmospheric co2 data mentioned in section 3 1 for the period of 1960 2016 did not cover the whole simulation period 1901 2016 therefore we added the mstmip environmental driver datasets https thredds daac ornl gov thredds catalog ornldaac 1220 catalog html for 1901 2010 on a monthly scale since the gml data is based on the direct atmospheric co2 measurements we corrected the mstmip co2 dataset for 1901 1959 using linear regression model based on the gml data in the coincidence period then produced a monthly co2 dataset covering 1901 2016 the monthly co2 data was resampled into daily by a linear interpolation algorithm we assumed that co2 variability within a day can be neglected same as the flux sites the depn data for these simulation locations was provided by the hani dataset we assumed that depn keep constant during the year in addition the site specific soil content of sand clay and organic matter of simulation locations were obtained from the soil database of china for land surface modeling with a spatial resolution of about 1 km shangguan et al 2013 4 methods 4 1 t c bg model 4 1 1 model description numerical simulations of energy water vegetation dynamics in each site were carried using the mechanistic terrestrial biosphere model t c bg see fatichi et al 2019 and reference therein for a detailed model description t c bg combines an eco hydrological model t c fatichi et al 2012 fatichi et al 2014 fugger et al 2022 mastrotheodoros et al 2020 paschalis et al 2022 which has been shown to have significant predictive capability across grassland ecosystem with a module simulating soil biogeochemistry and plant nutrient dynamics botter et al 2021 fatichi et al 2019 this module accounts for feedback between nutrient availability soil mineralization processes and plant growth the t c bg model simulates all essential components of hydrological energy and carbon cycles for instance swc rn h le and gpp are all prognostically computed at hourly time steps the vegetation module describes physiological vegetation processes including vegetation phenology photosynthesis respiration and carbon and nutrient budgets lai is also a prognostic variable that varies in response to phenology and environmental conditions 4 1 2 model configuration the t c bg model could simulate energy water vegetation dynamics of different vegetation types and only grassland is included in this study because the typical steppe and sandy grassland differ in their main vegetation and soil characteristics we set up t c bg models in these two grassland regions separately in the 3 eddy covariance flux sites we forced the model with the local observed meteorological data co2 data and depn data for running the model and evaluating the model performance the total depth of the soil column was set as 2 m and was discretized using 14 vertical layers with increasing depth from near the land surface to the bedrock model parameters describing the soil texture were adjusted based on soil sample experiments as mentioned in section 3 1 the selection of vegetation parameters was mainly based on previous experience with european and chinese grasslands botter et al 2021 yu et al 2020 some parameters describing phenology photosynthetic capacity and biophysical variables were manually adjusted to match observed dynamics as is common in modeling studies other parameters were obtained on the basis of physical knowledge plant physiological literature and expert knowledge the parameters selected for the final model configuration are detailed in table s1 in the supplementary material in the long term simulation at the 8 typical locations for the same grassland type we adopt the same vegetation parametrization for all sites in the simulations in other words we set up t c bg model in typical steppe based on the forcing data of xilin gol site and then all 5 typical steppe simulation locations shared the same vegetation parameter settings for sandy grassland we set up the model based on the forcing data at yulin and tongliao sites and then applied the vegetation parametrization at all the 3 sandy grassland locations the site specific parameters describing the soil content were adjusted based on the soil dataset as mentioned in section 3 2 the initial conditions of soil carbon and nutrient pools at the beginning of the last century were established by spinning up the soil biogeochemistry module first the average climatic conditions were obtained from the preliminary model simulations with the soil biogeochemistry module inactive i e t c model then we spun up soil carbon and nutrient pools by running only the soil biogeochemistry module for 1000 years under these average climatic conditions these results were used as the initial conditions of the soil biogeochemistry module for the fully coupled simulations over the period with hourly forcing data this operation is repeated several times to achieve a dynamic equilibrium with the current climate botter et al 2021 4 1 3 model confirmation to comprehensively evaluate the t c bg model performance we compared an ensemble of diverse variables at the three locations of xilin gol tongliao and yulin which were equipped with eddy covariance towers first to assess the model performance in reproducing the land surface energy and carbon fluxes we compared simulated and observed rn h le and gpp using flux tower data on a daily scale second we assessed the model performance in reproducing the hydrological variables by comparing the swc from the simulation results and from the in situ measurements third we evaluated the model performance in reproducing vegetation dynamics by comparing the lai time series from the model with that from local measurements and remote sensing dataset the slope of the linear fitting lines the root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 were calculated to assess the model performance we presented a confirmation of model performance in typical steppe based on observation data from xilin gol site and that in sandy grassland based on observation data from yulin site and tongliao site the model simulation for the locations of xilin gol site spans a 7 year period and that for yulin site and tongliao site spans a combined total of 6 year period 4 2 attribution of annual eco hydrologic trends to separate the contributions of the main drivers to annual trends of eco hydrologic variables in the period of 1901 2016 a series of controlled numerical experiments are conducted where forcing variables are modified one factor at a time given that climate change can impact terrestrial eco hydrological processes in relation to changes in atmospheric evaporative demand water supply and surface available energy xie et al 2020 we selected prec temp rh srad and ws as the main climatic factors to test the rising co2 concentration was also included in the assessment of causality besides depn is also currently recognized as the main factor affecting the structure and function of ecosystems since nitrogen is a key factor affecting plant photosynthetic capacity increased nitrogen addition can enhance the vegetation growth peak which may be related to the plant photosynthetic capacity stimulated by leaf nitrogen concentrations ali et al 2015 hence depn was also included in the attribution a series of experimental simulations included a transient run in which all factors are transient and single factor simulations in which for each forcing variable prec temp rh srad ws co2 and depn its long term annual trend is removed separately while all other variables are transient the differences between the simulation results of transient run and single factor control experiments represent the net impacts of that single variable on eco hydrologic processes in other words differences in the trend could be considered as the contribution of that single variable to the annual change in lai gpp et wy and wue liu et al 2018 on account of the high nonlinearity of the model leading to interactive effects among forcing variables and potential intra annual trends not removed by annual detrending the sum of the contribution of each factor may not exactly equal the simulated result of the transient run stein and alpert 1993 furthermore the attribution analysis did not include the influence of atmospheric air pressure as one of the input data we grouped these unexplained factors together in others 4 3 trend analysis a linear model y t k t y 0 was used to analyze the linear trends of the variables y t where k t and y 0 are respectively the slope time and intercept of the linear regression line chen et al 2017 meanwhile the significance of the trend was tested by the f test and was classified into statistically significant p 0 05 and insignificant p 0 05 5 results 5 1 model evaluation here we show the comparison between the simulated and the observed swc at various depths to evaluate the hydrological dynamics t c bg captures the swc dynamics and reproduces the decay of soil moisture pulses quite well at different sites at xilin gol site fig 2 a b the r2 of 0 10 cm and 20 50 cm equal 0 67 and 0 42 and the rmse is 3 49 and 5 84 at yulin tongliao sites fig 3 a c the r2 of 0 10 cm 20 50 cm and 80 200 cm equal 0 48 0 49 and 0 40 and the rmse is in the range of 2 17 2 77 across the three depths which is comparable with soil moisture measurement accuracy better performances are obtained near the surface than in deeper soil layers another difference is that the model simulation results for swc at deep soil layers are close to 0 in winter while the observed data are not considering the presence of frozen soil throughout the winter season we think that the model simulations are more realistic while the measurements have observation errors in winter the model performance in reproducing energy flux dynamics is illustrated in fig 2c e and fig 3d f the observed and simulated rn series are very close with slopes of 0 84 and 1 00 r2 of 0 86 and 0 89 and rmse of 24 9 w m2 and 18 7 w m2 in typical steppe site and sandy grassland sites respectively model performance of h dynamics is relatively lower at all sites where the r2 for daily h are 0 45 and 0 63 and the simulated value overestimates observations daily le dynamics are captured well as far as the magnitudes and the intra annual cycle are concerned with r2 of 0 59 and 0 63 and rmse of 20 9 w m2 and 11 7 w m2 in terms of slope 0 74 and 0 85 le value is slightly underestimated overall the model explains most of the variability in the daily energy fluxes during these years where observations are available in all sites the simulated gpp series is similar to the observation data the slopes of the linear fitting line at all sites are close to 1 r2 at the daily scale equals 0 79 and 0 74 for the xilin gol site fig 2f and the yulin tongliao sites fig 3g showing that more than 70 of the variability in daily gpp is captured by the model the simulated gpp compares favorably with the observations with rmse of 0 80 gc m2 day and 0 32 gc m2 day a comparison of simulations and observations in terms of lai is carried out using local sampling data and remote sensing data from modis at xilin gol site fig 2g the lai peak value given by remote sensing products was higher than the ground observations and t c bg simulations are much closer to the former the r2 of the simulation compared to the ground inferred and remotely inferred lai equal 0 38 and 0 76 and the rmse are 0 31 m2 m2 and 0 19 m2 m2 at tongliao site fig 3h the r2 of the simulation compared to the sampling data and modis data equal 0 87 and 0 79 and the rmse are 0 09 m2 m2 and 0 28 m2 m2 the results show a good match in temporal dynamics which confirmed that the site phenology and inter annual variability were appropriately simulated there is however a little seasonal delay in the annual peaks in the simulated time series at tongliao site as compared to both ground observations and remote sensing estimates overall the model performance in representing the key variables measured from the flux towers given the uncertainty of measurement themselves could be regarded as satisfactory across all the sites 5 2 changes in environmental factors the annual prec averaged across all sites over the period 1901 2016 was 306 76 mm yr and that of the sandy grassland was relatively higher than that of the typical steppe table 3 annual prec of both grassland regions exhibited decreasing but insignificant trends p 0 05 over the entire period while the decreasing rate of the typical steppe was higher than that of the sandy grassland fig 4 a table 3 annual rh with an average of 53 5 4 3 also exhibited insignificant decreasing trend over the entire period fig 4b the annual temp averaged across all sites over the study period had a multi year average of 4 19 2 9 c and showed a significant upward trend at an average rate of 0 016 0 0021 c yr over the entire period fig 4c among them the multi year average of the sandy grassland was about 4 5 c higher than that of the typical steppe while the typical steppe increasing at a higher rate annual srad and ws exhibited significant decreases at average rates of 0 025 0 0013 w m2 yr and 0 0011 0 0003 m s yr during 1901 2016 respectively fig 4d e as expected the inter annual variability of co2 is consistent across sites and all showed a significant increasing trend throughout the century fig 4f similarly depn increased significantly over the entire study period especially after the 1960s when the upward trend was more prominent fig 4g 5 3 changes in simulated eco hydrological variables the annual lai across all sites had a multi year average of 0 36 0 16 m2 m2 table 4 and showed a significant increasing trend at a rate of 7 5 3 4 10 4 m2 m2 yr during 1901 2016 fig 5 a separately lai at the sandy grassland sites was obviously lower than that at the typical steppe sites table 4 fig 5b but the increasing trend of the sandy grassland was more outstanding which was approximately 1 5 times larger than the increasing rate of the typical steppe the annual gpp averaged over the period 1901 2016 was 177 83 0 gc m2 yr across all sites and gpp at the sandy grassland sites was less than half of that at the typical steppe sites table 4 the average gpp across all sites showed an outstanding increasing trend at a rate of 0 51 0 13 gc m2 yr2 during 1901 2016 fig 5c there were significant upward trends in gpp in both grassland types for the study period at comparable rates average annual et across all sites in the region had no significant trend for the entire study period with a multi year average of 248 54 7 mm yr fig 5e which accounted for 81 0 20 3 of the precipitation the annual mean et of the sandy grassland sites 209 19 8 mm yr 57 8 1 7 of the precipitation was lower than that at the typical steppe sites 271 51 5 mm yr 99 5 0 41 of the precipitation different from the whole region and the typical steppe et of the sandy grassland sites exhibited a significant increasing trend at a rate of 0 10 0 09 mm yr2 over the entire period the average wy across all sites within the tsgc had an insignificant decreasing trend during the study period at the annual scale fig 5g the multi year average wy of the sandy grassland was 152 51 0 mm yr while that of the typical steppe fluctuated around zero with an average of 0 88 26 2 mm yr although neither was significant the rate of annual wy decline of sandy grassland 0 14 0 12 mm yr2 was much higher than that of the typical steppe 0 006 0 0054 mm yr2 the annual wue across all sites had a multi year average of 0 75 0 19 gc kg h2o table 4 and showed a particularly strong increasing trend at a rate of 2 23 0 58 10 3 gc kg h2o yr during 1901 2016 fig 5i separately the annual wue of the sandy grassland sites was relatively lower than that of the typical steppe sites but the increasing trend of the former was higher than that of the latter table 4 fig 5j in summary the eco hydrological processes of our study region especially the sandy grassland have experienced significant changes over the last century which is mainly manifested by the improvement of vegetation conditions and the decline of water yield 5 4 drivers of the trends in eco hydrologic variables for the period of 1901 2016 based on a series of factor controlled numerical experiments we quantified the contributions of main climatic forcing prec temp rh srad and ws co2 concentration and depn to the annual trend of simulated eco hydrologic variables fig 6 the most important factor in regulating lai increasing trend was the elevated co2 which generated a change in lai corresponding to 42 7 and 153 6 of the lai increasing trend of sandy grassland and typical steppe respectively temp also was an important factor in regulating the annual lai trend while it had different impacts in sandy grassland and typical steppe for sandy grassland increasing temp was the second major factor in shaping the increase of lai with a relative contribution of 24 7 conversely for typical steppe the influence of rising temp on the lai trend was negative accounting for 18 2 of the lai trend as for prec the negative effects of it on sandy grassland lai trend were statistically insignificant while that on typical steppe was much greater accounting for 25 9 of the lai trend in general the different contributions of temp and prec were mostly responsible for the greater upward trend of lai in sandy grassland than in typical steppe besides the depn increase also contributed positively to the lai trend in these two grasslands and the decreasing srad and rh had a negative influence on the lai trend in this region even though of small magnitude the attribution results of the annual gpp trend for the period 1901 2016 fig 6b were in general agreement with those of lai co2 played a dominant role in promoting gpp it accounted for 54 6 and 112 9 of the gpp increasing trend of sandy grassland and typical steppe respectively for sandy grassland increasing temp was the second major factor in regulating the increase of gpp with a relative contribution of 18 6 but for typical steppe the second important factor in regulating gpp trend was the declining prec which contributed a decreasing trend to lai 16 6 and rising temp had a negative influence on gpp trend different from the sandy grassland for the increasing trend of sandy grassland et during 1901 2016 warming was the dominant factor with a relative contribution of 72 9 fig 6c secondly co2 and depn also had a significant positive effect on the et trend in this region accounting for 37 1 and 22 4 of the et trend the decreasing srad had a negative influence on the et trend with a relative contribution of 18 2 different from the sandy grassland the positive contribution of temp increase to the typical steppe et trend was relatively lower and the rising co2 and depn also did not have a significant effect on the typical steppe et trend as the ecosystem was completely water limited here decreasing prec considerably dominated et decreasing trend 110 0 mirroring controls on et temp rise was the most important contributor to the decreasing trend of sandy grassland wy during 1901 2016 with a relative contribution of 56 3 fig 6d the increasing co2 and depn also had a negative influence on the wy trend accounting for 28 6 and 17 3 of the wy decreasing trend in the sandy grassland the decrease prec has also led to a declining trend of wy 13 0 conversely the srad decrease contributed a positive trend to wy for the typical steppe there was no significant trend in wy and no significant contribution of each factor to wy trend for the study period as almost all precipitation is converted into et the co2 increase had an overwhelmingly dominant effect on the increasing trend of wue fig 6e for the sandy grassland and the typical steppe the relative contributions of co2 were 61 and 105 7 temp was the second most important factor in regulating the trend of annual wue similar to lai and gpp temp had a positive contribution 9 0 to the wue trend of sandy grassland but a negative contribution 21 1 to that of the typical steppe in addition elevated depn also had a significant positive effect on the sandy grassland wue trend with a relative contribution of 6 3 while the declining prec contributed a decreasing trend 5 9 to the wue annual trend of the typical steppe 6 discussion 6 1 model performance it is a challenge for a single integrated model to concurrently reproduce land surface energy and carbon fluxes hydrological and vegetation dynamics botter et al 2021 while the t c bg model responds well to it across three grassland sites characterized by two different grassland types energy and carbon fluxes hydrology and vegetation dynamics are well simulated with several exceptions discussed below we argue that the simulation results of t c bg model are encouraging and they enabled us to explore the complex functions of the grassland ecosystem and to support the virtual numerical experiments that have been run there are still some uncertainties in the model simulations that are worth highlighting it is widely known that energy non closure is an unavoidable problem of the eddy covariance system leuning et al 2012 liu et al 2011 compared with the observed values the model overestimates h thus indicating that the missing energy may be attributed to h which is supported by other studies botter et al 2021 the model does not perform as well at deeper soil layers in reproducing soil water content as it does near the surface this is likely because the soil hydraulic parameters for the different layers were set to be consistent with the surface soil due to the lack of experimental data this uncertainty could be resolved if additional observations allow to estimate soil parameters at different layers besides uncertainty in the forcing data is significant in these model simulations the meteorological dataset used in this article was cru ncep with over a century long time scale and a resolution of 0 5 latitude longitude grid though we spatially and temporally downscaled the long term reanalysis data based on the observations from the reference weather stations other sources of error may still occur in the spatio temporal downscaled forcing for example we constructed a relationship between rainfall intensity and duration based on hourly precipitation data for 8 years and applied it to throughout a century without considering whether this relationship has changed 6 2 responses of eco hydrological variables to environmental changes our studies revealed that co2 had a leading function in promoting the lai gpp and wue of the tsgc over the study period which agreed with many previous studies huang et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 zhang and ren 2017 co2 is the substrate of photosynthesis and concentrations above current environmental levels would stimulate the plant carbon assimilation this fertilization effect of co2 affects vegetation productivity and in principle should lead to the increase of biomass and green vegetation cover greening knauer et al 2017 ukkola et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 these plant fundamental physiological responses to rising co2 through increased net carbon assimilation and reduced stomatal conductance also lead to increased intrinsic wue while the increase rate of co2 was comparable in the two regions table 3 the positive effect of co2 on vegetation growth in the typical steppe was larger than that in the sandy grassland fig 6 this is because the lower vegetation coverage of sandy grassland 30 compared with that of typical steppe 80 may weaken the influence of co2 at the unit scale in this study further reasons can be connected to the water limitations typical steppe is already using almost all the available water et prec and it is more often stressed than the sandy grassland therefore co2 induced temporary savings of soil moisture are stimulating productivity more than in the sandy grassland temp also played an important role in regulating the variation of annual lai gpp and wue our studies found that temp had different impacts in sandy grassland and typical steppe for sandy grassland our results revealed that vegetation growth was enhanced due to the warming trend because as introduced in section 1 warmer conditions are typically associated with overall better conditions for plant growth and prolonged growing season however due to the more significant warming trend in typical steppe and mostly because the typical steppe is already using almost all available water the increasing temperature amplified the periods when water limitation caused by evapotranspiration losses both seasonally and annually thus increasing the plant water stress and partially affecting the carbon uptake rates by photosynthesis and mostly the lai the meta analysis of 466 experiments across 719 plant species conducted by huang et al 2018 suggested similar results with warming promoting shrub growth but inhibiting typical grassland growth xie et al 2020 and zhou et al 2015 also found that the continued warming trend might suppress vegetation growth in some regions within the tsgc or periods besides as expected prec decrease had a negative effect on the vegetation growth especially in typical steppe this greater negative effect was not only because the downward trend in prec in this grassland region was more pronounced but also because this ecosystem was completely water limited several studies have yielded similar conclusions that the sensitivity of vegetation productivity to prec variation would increase as regional mean prec decreases fatichi and ivanov 2014 huxman et al 2004 knapp et al 2017 maurer et al 2020 taking all environmental effects together the difference in the co2 effect between the two ecosystems was compensated by the different effects of temp and prec this is why the upward trend of gpp is at a comparable level in the two grassland ecosystems but these effects are amplified for lai as reflected by larger differences in lai increasing trends between the two regions because the vegetation in a water stressed steppe is more difficult to convert gpp into aboveground biomass fatichi 2010 krinner et al 2005 this result is similar to that of zhang et al 2019 who revealed that vegetation greening does not bring a proportional increase in vegetation productivity warming dominated the increasing trend of sandy grassland et while the effect of warming on typical steppe et was relatively lower elevated temperature can directly influence et by increasing potential evapotranspiration and indirectly by affecting vegetation growth but as discussed above in the typical steppe these controls are not important as et was roughly equivalent to prec here and thus controlled solely by the amount of available water and given the greater downward trend of prec in the typical steppe prec decline replaced warming as the dominant factor in et decreasing trend here overall for et temp and prec are the two most important dominant factors over the entire tsgc which is consistent with many previous studies based on different et estimation models and attribution analysis methods li et al 2018 pan et al 2020 sun et al 2020 xia et al 2014 besides we found that co2 also had a significant positive effect on the et trend in this region for the past century which means that the co2 fertilization effect on increasing lai and thus et overcame the negative effect of stomatal closure xie et al 2020 conducted an attribution analysis of et over this region from 1982 to 2017 using the multiple linear regression method and reached a similar conclusion ukkola et al 2016 also confirmed a significant positive sensitivity of et to co2 in semi arid regions also due to the limitation of available water co2 promoted et much less in typical steppes than in sandy grasslands ukkola et al 2016 finally the results revealed that warming was the most important factor contributing to the decline in wy during 1901 2016 especially in the sandy grassland region despite the lack of studies on such long time scales studies focusing on recent decades have yielded similar conclusions for example based on the in situ soil moisture measurements of the last 30 years zhang et al 2017 indicated that higher temperature was the main cause of soil moisture reduction and soil drought over our study region the results of dai et al 2004 suggest that the increase in near surface air temperature which increased the water holding capacity of the air and thus its demand for moisture has been the main reason for the widespread soil moisture drying during the last several decades besides in sandy grassland the vegetation growth acceleration due to the elevated co2 and depn increased et and thus also became important factors in wy decline by comparison wy is relatively insensitive to changes in the typical steppe where et matched precipitation and wy was nearly zero in other words driven by environmental changes in sandy grassland et could increase at the expense of wy as et was considerably lower than precipitation here but because the typical steppe has already used almost all available water neither warming nor rising co2 could prompt these ecosystems to use more water 6 3 implications our study revealed that environmental changes promoted vegetation growth and reduced water resources over the tsgc during 1901 2016 first we presented numerical evidence that the entire tsgc region experienced a significant increase in vegetation productivity vegetation cover and water use efficiency in the period of 1901 2016 this is a positive sign that desertification was mitigated by co2 fertilization over a century long time scale but it is noteworthy that the available water resources amount has been on a downward trend this has been reflected in the real world as introduced in section 1 coupled with the pressure from population growth and economic development in recent years the conflict between the demand and supply of water resources is increasingly outstanding in addition these changes are particularly dramatic in sandy grassland areas where the lai gpp and wue exhibited more pronounced increasing trends and the wy declined at a greater rate this also alerts us on paying more attention to desert areas with an already fragile environment our results highlight the large role increased vegetation activity played in the decreasing trend of wy during 1901 2016 over the tsgc the increase in vegetation activity due to co2 and depn alone accounted for at least 47 of the declining trend of the average available water resources amount for all sites however it should be noted that this study only focused on the environmental change effects the effects of direct human activities change effect are not analyzed in reality since 1998 china has implemented a number of ecological restoration projects to improve the ecological environment of this region one of the world s largest revegetation programs the grain for green project is launched in 1999 returning cultivated land into forest and grass to increase the vegetation cover of the loess plateau which contains most areas in our study area belonging to the yellow river basin shao et al 2019 a large number of ecological restoration measures have also been taken to alleviate the desertification of grasslands such as the artificial grassland establishment bryan et al 2018 these large scale vegetation recoveries and ecological engineering construction have greatly improved the vegetation coverage of these areas liu et al 2020 necessarily at the expense of even more water consumption than computed with our simulations the findings of this study have an important implication for vegetation restoration given the decline in water resources that has occurred in this region because of the environmental changes there should be careful consideration about the implementation of further ecosystem restoration projects especially in sandy grassland it is necessary to use eco hydrological approaches to compute the water losses caused by vegetation growth and assess the carrying capacity before promoting a policy of reforestation 7 conclusion we first validated a fully coupled terrestrial biosphere model using collected observations from 3 eddy covariance flux towers then we applied the model to investigate the changes in eco hydrological variables using lai gpp et wy and wue as indicators driven by the environmental changes occurred from 1901 to 2016 at 8 simulation locations within the tsgc region based on the modeling results we then assessed the contributions of climatic factors atmospheric co2 and depn to the trends in these key eco hydrologic variables by a series of controlled numerical experiments on average from all sites in the tsgc the environmental conditions during the study period 1901 2016 were conducive to vegetation growth all sites averaged lai gpp and wue showed significant increases stimulated by the elevated atmospheric co2 annual et showed an insignificant increasing trend over a century long time scale the increasing temperature and co2 had a significant positive effect on the trend of annual et but these effects were partly offset by the precipitation decline the average wy across all sites had a slightly decreasing trend during 1901 2016 which was dominated by warming suggesting a potential reduction of available water resources under different water stress there were obvious differences in the responses of eco hydrological processes to environmental changes between the two grassland regions warming was a promoter of vegetation growth in sandy grassland where et could increase at the expense of wy as et was considerably lower than precipitation but a suppressant of vegetation growth in typical steppe where et matches precipitation and warming would increase the plant water stress for the same reason prec decline elicited a much stronger response in vegetation and et of typical steppe compared with the sandy grassland overall the total centennial environmental changes were inclined to promote vegetation growth and increase et at the expense of wy while these effects would be reduced and even reversed under water stresses in general the eco hydrological processes of our study region especially the sandy grassland have experienced significant changes over the last century which is mainly manifested by the improvement of vegetation conditions and the decline of water yield our results contributed to a more quantitative understanding of the effect of environmental change on the eco hydrological processes of tsgc region and bring additional insights to any future adaptation or mitigation strategy aimed at improving the responses of semi arid ecosystems to environmental change declaration of competing interest the authors

2232,many water saving projects have been initiated in the typical alpine irrigation district in tibet which resulted in dramatic changes to the hydrothermal conversion process there is an urgent need to fully understand the hydrothermal transport process and to clarify the mechanism under which agricultural hydrology evolves in the alpine irrigation district of tibet this study selected highland barley field oat field wasteland natural herbage field without irrigation in pengbo irrigation district of tibet as study objects to study soil water and heat dynamics and soil water balance observed water and temperature data were used to calibrate and validate simulations of the hydrus 1d model for 2019 and 2020 respectively simulations of soil water and temperature were in good agreement with the measured values with determination coefficient of 0 69 0 91 this study proposes a set of hydrothermal parameters to fill the gap in the hydrothermal research of tibet the results showed that the variation of soil temperature was approximately sinusoidal with a lag effect the temperatures of the 0 20 cm and 30 50 cm soil layers lagged by about 1 2 h and 3 5 h respectively the highest rate of soil temperature increase occurred from the initial growth period to the rapid growth period during which the soil temperature of each layer increased by an average of 2 c however the soil temperature in this period was not the most suitable for crop growth soil evaporation of highland barley field oat field and wasteland during the growth period accounted for 20 29 20 29 10 18 of the rainfall and irrigation whereas transpiration accounted for 33 43 42 50 and 36 57 and percolation accounted for 42 35 39 and 16 45 respectively implementation of water saving projects resulted in reductions in irrigation volume and percolation rate this study can provide a reference for clarifying the hydrothermal transport process and allocating agricultural water resources in the alpine irrigation district of tibet keywords alpine irrigation district of tibet different types of vegetation and fields hydrus 1d model water and heat transport water balance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrothermal transportation is a continuous process occurring in the soil plant atmosphere system and is closely related to plant physiological processes hydrological processes and climatic characteristics ding et al 2010 therefore the hydrothermal condition is an important factor to consider when analyzing hydrological processes and is a popular field of research within the biospheric aspects of hydrological cycle bahc the core project of the international geosphere and biosphere program igbp mcmurtrie and wang 1993 agren and mcmurtrie 1991 the study of water transport process and the law of hydrothermal balance is the basis of understanding the formation and evolution of vegetation patterns hydrological process and other material cycles wang and liu 2002 the qinghai tibet plateau is a typical ecologically fragile area in china and is extremely sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic activities the interaction between earth and atmosphere and anthropogenic activities can have extremely important influences on regional and global climate mollasina and benedict 2004 known as the water tower of asia tibet is rich in water resources and changes in water consumption will directly affect the distribution of water resources in asia the irrigation district in tibet is the greatest consumer of water therefore there is a need to understand the hydrological process of the irrigation district to facilitate reasonable allocation of water resources liu et al 2020 yin et al 2010 recent large scale construction of dams reservoirs channels and other water conservancy facilities in tibet s irrigation district has resulted in changes to the natural hydrological process and the spatial and temporal distribution of runoff in the irrigation district agricultural measures have changed the underlying surface conditions in the water circulation pathway dai and cai 2008 thus affecting the distribution of surface water soil water and groundwater different kinds of vegetation are planted in the irrigation district and their growth characteristics water consumption and demand laws and irrigation systems are quite different therefore in order to clarify the hydrological process in the irrigation district there is an urgent need to further characterize evapotranspiration among different vegetation types soil evaporation soil percolation groundwater recharge and groundwater seepage tibet has high radiation intensity annual radiation of 8000 mj m2 about one to two times of that in the mainland annual sunshine duration of over 3000 h and a large diurnal temperature difference tang et al 2017 low temperature snowmelt water used for irrigation in spring results in dramatic diurnal changes to the soil hydrothermal environment liu et al 2020 there are differences in the hydrothermal environment and water consumption process among different types of vegetation and fields due to differences in physiological characteristics since climate change in the region has resulted in reduced biodiversity and serious soil desertification many scientists pay more attention to biodiversity zong and shi 2020 the spatial evolution of vegetation zones zuo et al 2021 carbon storage lu et al 2022 the soil freeze thaw process gao et al 2020 ming and zhao 2022 soil degradation dai et al 2020 and desertification study zou et al 2011 in tibet people living in the study area survive mainly by agriculture and animal husbandry resulting in a large demand for high quality herbage the influences of climate and anthropogenic activities have resulted in deficits in herbage resources in tibet therefore past studies have focused on crop breeding xu et al 2018 variety screening wang and wu 2017 crop growth li et al 2019 crop yield ying et al 2014 and irrigation systems luo et al 2013 xu et al 2015 however few studies have focused on differences in water consumption among different vegetation types and the evolution of the hydrothermal environment in the irrigated district currently there remains insufficient knowledge of the water consumption process of field system with different vegetation types which has hindered the regulation of agricultural water resources in irrigation district fully understanding the variations in hydrothermal transport processes among different vegetation types and fields in the alpine irrigation district of tibet can play an important role in clarifying the evolution of agricultural hydrology and allocation of water resources in irrigation district many methods for studying vegetation water consumption and soil water and heat transport currently exist jeewantinie kapilaratne et al 2017 improved a general temperature correction method for dielectric sensors which can be commonly used regardless of the differences in climatic conditions sensor type and soil type which can ensure the accuracy of soil water content measurements zhang et al 2018 used a micro evaporator and liquid flow meter to measure interplant evaporation and plant transpiration of maize under drip irrigation shorcomings of the probe type of the wrapped liquid flowmeter limit measurements of corn transpiration to the middle and late stages there is a need to adopt the crop coefficient method of fao56 and the basic crop coefficient during the middle growth period should be corrected by crop transpiration measured by a liquid flow meter following which crop transpiration over the entire growth period can be calculated zhang et al 2013 determined that net radiation saturated water pressure temperature and wind speed were the main meteorological factors affecting crop evapotranspiration the simdual kc model was calibrated and validated based on eddy current covariance measurements and applied to winter wheat and summer maize field experiments in the irrigation area in the upper reaches of the yellow river although the simulations of soil moisture were in good agreement with observations the effects of meteorological factors on evapotranspiration were different among northeast china northwest china and xinjiang which have obvious regional characteristics pereira et al 2015 kang et al 2005 applied the simultaneous heat and water shaw model to simulate the energy and water balance of the soil residual vegetation canopy system in the mountainous vegetation zone of the heihe river basin li 2005 used the shaw model to study the characteristics of surface energy and soil temperature transport of the active layer in the permafrost region of the qinghai tibet plateau by distinguishing between daytime and evening radiation yin et al 2009 verified the parameters of shaw model using soil freeze thaw data in its application to the haibei alpine meadow lhasa farmland gongga mountain forest daqaidan desert and wudaoliang grassland their study simulated the characteristics of water transport and the water balance in alpine meadow grassland farmland forest and desert ecosystems and the contributions of soil freezing and melting processes to vegetation water use were quantitatively analyzed however further research on the hydrothermal reciprocal feed back between atmosphere vegetation soil groundwater is needed there is a need for further research on changes in vegetation water consumption and in the soil water and thermal environment resulting from intense radiation and irrigation in the non freeze thaw growth period due to limitations to the shaw model wang et al 2010 constructed a model of soil hydrothermal transport under drip irrigation based on the hydrus 2d model their results showed that the constructed model could accurately predict the soil hydrothermal distribution which provided a theoretical basis for accurately regulating the soil hydrothermal environment required by crops under drip irrigation feng et al 2021 used the hydrus 2d model to study the effect of degradation film mulching on the soil hydrothermal environment in the west liaohe plain their results indicated the optimal period to implement degradation film mulching ren et al 2016 used the hydrus dualkc model to simulate and evaluate the water use efficiencies of maize sunflower and watermelon in irrigated farmland and described the water consumption processes of different crops pan et al 2017 conducted a thermal tracing experiment within saturated layered quartz sand under a stable flow field and inverted the water thermal transport parameters using the inverse problem algorithm of the hydrus model the hydrus model shows advantages over other models for simulating hydrothermal changes the objectives of the present study were to a calibrate and verify the hydrus model and then study the model simulations of soil hydrothermal processes of typical crops in the alpine irrigation district of tibet b evaluate the water balances of different crops c characterize heat conversion processes among different crops and different growth stages the present study provides a theoretical basis for clarifying the process of hydrothermal transport and the evolution of agricultural hydrological processes in the alpine irrigation district of tibet 2 study area material and methods 2 1 overview of study area the qinghai tibet plateau is in southwest china and encompasses an area of over 120 km2 between 26 51 36 52 n

140 d the period of rapid oat growth is mid to late june with a maximum duration of 45 d highland barley is planted and harvested in april 28 and september 22 respectively with a growth period of 148 d the middle of the growth period occurs in early july with a maximum duration of 50 d table 3 2 3 5 soil temperature fig 4 shows the changes in hourly soil temperature changes in soil temperature were examined over three days and five periods 1 14 16 may 2 14 16 june 3 14 16 july 4 14 16 august and 5 14 16 september temperature showed a sinusoidal trend with periodic changes the highest

layers there was a gradual delay in the timing of the maximum and minimum temperatures with increasing soil depth the lag time of the 10 cm and 20 cm soil layers due to the influences of different months was 1 2 h whereas that of the 30 50 cm soil layer was 3 5 h 2 3 6 soil moisture content this study was conducted in the same study area with the same soil type meteorological conditions and soil moisture and temperature monitoring equipment this study only pays attention to the comprehensive effects of various factors soil type precipitation atmospheric temperature irrigation and so on on soil moisture and temperature we eliminated the abnormal values of soil moisture and temperature by manually adjusting method fig 5 shows hourly changes in soil moisture content changes in soil moisture content were examined over the same periods as that for soil temperature the fluctuating moisture content in the 0 30 cm soil layer could be attributed to the influences of irrigation and rainfall while a linear decreasing trend was evident in the soil water content in the 40 60 cm soil layer two soil water stages could be defined in the 0 30 cm soil layer 1 soil water consumption

model was developed by the national salt reform center in the united states to provide a one dimensional vertical model of water heat and solute transport and root water uptake in porous media with saturated and unsaturated zones šimunek et al 2009 after years of improvement hydrus 1d has been widely used to simulate the variations in soil profile moisture temperature and solutes resulting from field irrigation and fertilization 2 4 1 soil water transport model the hydrus 1d model adopts a modified form of richards equation with a source sink term to solve the soil water transport process 1

50 cm 50 60 cm respectively 2 4 2 soil heat transport model soil moisture in non frozen soil consists of liquid water and gaseous water by ignoring gaseous water diffusion and only considering the influence of liquid water movement on soil heat transport soil heat flow movement can be expressed as 5 c θ t t r λ ij θ t z c w q i t r where λij θ is the apparent thermal conductivity of soil w cm c

transpiration potential evapotranspiration etp can be calculated as 6 e t p k c e t 0 where k c is the crop coefficient k c values of highland barley and oats were set to 0 56 0 97 and 0 62 and 0 3 1 15 and 0 79 in the early middle and late stages respectively as according to fao56 the hydrus 1d model uses the penman monteith equation to calculate et 0 which is then divided into potential evaporation ep and potential transpiration tp according to the crop leaf area index the potential transpiration rate tp 7 t p e t p 1 e klai where lai is the leaf area index k is the extinction coefficient of the crop canopy and k values of oats and highland barley were wet to 0 39 respectively hao et al 2015 potential evaporation is the difference between etp and tp 2 5 model establishment calibration and verification 2 5 1 simulation profile depths as shown in fig 6 the simulated profile depths of the highland barley field oat field and wasteland were 400 cm respectively the simulated profiles of the highland barley field oat field and wasteland were set as three layers according to their measured soil textures and study profile was divided as shown in table 1 the soil profile was divided in the vertical one dimensional direction into 401 nodes with a spacing of 1 cm observation points were arranged in the soil layers at 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm 60 cm and 400 cm the simulation periods for the highland barley field oat field and wasteland were set to april 28 to september 30 may 15 to september 30 and april 28 to september 30 respectively with simulation durations of 148 d 138 d and 156 d respectively the initial time steps of the highland barley field oat field and wasteland were set as 0 1 d the minimum time steps were set as 0 001 d and the maximum time steps were set as 5 d respectively 2 5 2 initial conditions and boundary conditions the present study constructed the boundary conditions for the highland barley field oat field and wasteland the interface between the atmosphere and soil surface was set as the upper boundary condition for whereas the variable pressure head condition was selected as the bottom boundary condition data required to represent the upper boundary conditions included daily rainfall daily evaporation and daily transpiration whereas that for the bottom boundary condition included daily groundwater depth as determined by the variable pressure head value the upper and lower boundary conditions of heat transport were set as the temperature boundary the upper boundary of the highland barley field oat field and wasteland were set as the atmospheric temperature respectively and the bottom boundary was set as the groundwater temperature 2 5 3 soil parameters the initial soil hydraulic parameters θs θr α n l were predicted by the retc software based on soil bulk density and the contents of sand silt and clay table 1 where bulk density θs ks and the contents of sand silt and clay were specified based on the measured values the thermal transport parameters b 1 b 2 b 3 λ were determined based on model inversion and prior studies feng et al 2021 gao 2019 the initial values of root water uptake parameters h1 h2 h3h h3l h4 hϕ and hϕ50 were determined by software default values and prior studies 2 5 4 model calibration and validation the model parameters were calibrated against data for soil water content and temperature in 2019 whereas that for 2020 were used to validate the model the root mean square error rmse regression coefficient b coefficient of determination r 2 and mean relative error mre were used to assess the model performance for both the calibration and validation processes these goodness of fit statistics are defined below ren et al 2016 xu et al 2013 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 9 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 0 5 i 1 n p i p 2 0 5 2 10 b i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 2 11 mre 1 n i 1 n h p i o i o i 100 where n is the number of observed values oi is the ith measured value pi is the ith simulated value o is the average of the observations and p is the average of simulations mre and rmse values close to zero and b values close to 1 indicate good model performance it is generally believed that an mre within 10 a ratio of rmse to the average measured value of within 20 and r 2 0 5 indicate that the variation in observations is well captured by the model 3 results 3 1 model calibration the model was calibrated against observations of soil water content and temperature in 2019 the simulations of soil water content were in good agreement with observations indicating that the model could represent the dynamic processes regulating soil water content as shown in table 4 the mre rmse r 2 and b of soil water content in the highland barley field oat field and wasteland varied from 7 94 to 0 06 0 02 to 0 03 cm3 cm 3 0 75 to 0 9 and 0 88 0 97 respectively whereas those of soil temperature were 3 17 to 0 35 0 54 to 1 26 c 0 69 to 0 88 and 0 97 to 0 99 respectively the evaluation of model goodness of fit statistics indicated that the model achieved an acceptable simulation accuracy for soil temperature tables 5 and 6 show the calibrated hydraulic and thermodynamic parameters whereas table 7 shows the root water uptake parameters the model achieved a lower simulation accuracy for soil temperature compared to that for soil water content which could be attributed to the effect of soil water content on soil temperature there is a large diurnal change in soil temperature in tibet particularly in the 0 20 cm soil layer and the strong radiation of the region has a significant impact on the thermal alternation of surface soil soil in tibet is often mixed with fine gravel which affects the thermal conductivity of soil 3 2 model validation the model was validated against measured soil water content and temperature data for 2020 model simulations were generated for the simulation period under the calibrated parameters fig 7 shows the results of the validation table 4 shows the results of the goodness of fit statistics for the validation of soil water content mre 6 80 1 43 rmse 0 016 0 02 c r 2 0 79 0 80 b 0 98 0 99 and soil temperature mre 1 67 0 33 rmse 0 55 1 06 c r 2 0 75 0 91 b 0 97 0 99 the goodness of fit indicator values for the validation period were similar to those of the calibration period thereby meeting model requirements for accuracy 3 3 soil hydrothermal dynamics the simulations for 2019 were used to analyze the dynamic processes regulating soil water content and soil temperature of the highland barley field oat field and wasteland with the results shown in figs 8 10 3 3 1 soil hydrothermal dynamics in highland barley field fig 8a shows the dynamics of soil water content of highland barley the relatively thin soil layer in tibet 20 30 cm and relatively large soil sediment content results in a relatively small soil water content the saturated water content of the 0 20 cm soil layer was only 0 3 cm3 cm3 whereas the soil water content of the 30 60 cm soil layer was only 0 23 0 25 cm3 cm3 fig 8a soil showed relatively poor water retention and low storage capacity irrigation volume of the study area was recorded highland barley was irrigated for five times in 2019 namely on may 2 may 12 june 6 june 21 and july 3 fig 8a and table 2 since precipitation during the growth period of 2019 was 358 mm precipitation from may to early july accounted for only 18 of the total growth period rainfall fig 3 during each irrigation event soil water content decreased from saturation to its maximum water holding capacity soil water content decreased by 47 57 in the 0 20 cm soil layer between each irrigation period the moisture of the 30 60 cm soil layer was higher than that of the surface layer during two irrigation events intervals the reduction in soil water content was lower than that of the surface layer about 36 44 and the reduction in soil water content in the surface layer exceeded that in the deep layer by 12 fig 8b shows the dynamics in soil temperature of highland barley the temperature of irrigation water was relatively low in may 13 c resulting in an obvious change in temperature in the 0 30 cm soil layer soil temperature showed a downward trend whereas there was a small change in the temperature of the 50 60 cm soil layer the temperature of irrigation water in july was about 19 c and temperature of the 0 60 cm soil layer showed a clear upward trend the study area experiences a large diurnal temperature difference strong radiation and frequent raining in the evening the low temperature of rain around 14 c results in strong fluctuations in the temperature of the 0 30 cm soil layer the average daily minimum temperatures over the growth period at soil depths of 10 cm 20 cm and 30 cm appeared on may 14 and the average daily maximum temperature occurred on july 3 with rates of temperature increase of 58 46 and 38 respectively the increases in temperature during this period for the 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil were 31 27 and 23 respectively the highest temperatures in the 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers were on august 20 the increases in soil temperature occurred at rates of 38 35 and 38 in comparison with the lowest temperature 13 c on may 14 similar to the temperature of the 30 cm soil layer on july 3 soil temperature transport showed a lag effect 3 3 2 soil hydrothermal dynamics in oats fields fig 9a demonstrates the dynamic process affecting soil water content in the oats field the observations of local irrigation indicated that the oats field was irrigated on june 9 and june 23 2019 table 2 precipitation was concentrated between in mid july to late september in 2019 accounting for 82 of total rainfall in the growing period fig 3 these results indicating significant fluctuation in the moisture of each soil layer the mean soil water contents at 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layer were 0 18 0 21 0 21 0 22 and 0 22 respectively irrigation resulted in increases in soil water content at the 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers increased by 86 67 88 61 71 47 61 35 56 and 35 47 respectively fig 9b shows the dynamic process of soil temperature in an oats field irrigation water temperatures on june 9 and june 23 were 15 c and 19 c respectively the temperature of the 10 cm soil layer decreased slightly after irrigation on june 9 whereas temperature of the 10 60 cm soil layer increased after two irrigations the area of exposed oats was larger the influence of the atmosphere on soil water content and temperature was greater and the soil water content and temperature of each soil layer showed an increasing trend during the initial growth period and rapid growth period may 15 to june 30 the rates of increase in soil temperature at the 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers were 36 31 31 23 28 and 20 respectively oats grew faster and vegetation coverage gradually increased from the mid growth period to the late growth period july 1 to september 15 therefore atmospheric radiation had little effect on soil temperature the temperature of the 0 30 cm soil layer decreased by 3 4 c from july 1st to july 25th whereas that of the 40 60 cm soil layer decreased by 1 2 c the temperature of each soil layer was relatively stable from july 25 to august 31 the mean soil temperatures of the 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers were 14 5 c 16 c 16 2 c 15 5 c 15 5 c and 15 5 c respectively the soil temperatures at the 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers decreased by 41 41 28 23 18 and 18 from september 15 to september 30 respectively 3 3 3 soil hydrothermal dynamics in wasteland fig 10 shows the dynamics process of soil water content of wasteland precipitation only accounting for 18 of total rainfall in the growing period from april 28 to july 1 and the cumulative daily rainfall was less than 5 mm therefore soil water content in the 0 20 cm soil layer fluctuated slightly from the initial growth period to july 1 whereas the soil water content at the 30 60 cm soil layer was not affected by rainfall since rainfall was concentrated from july 4 to august 23 fig 3 daily rainfall could reach 39 mm soil water content at the 0 20 cm soil layer changed greatly during this period and the soil water content at the 30 60 cm soil layer continued to increase through infiltration increased soil water consumption could be attributed to poor soil water retention strong radiation and absence of water recharge soil water contents from june 27 to july 8 at the 10 cm 20 cm and 30 cm soil layers decreased by 70 76 and 63 respectively soil water content during the rainy season at the 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers increased by 72 80 79 61 64 and 64 respectively the soil water content at 0 30 cm soil layer did not increase significantly during the entire growth period whereas that at the 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers increased by 60 64 and 67 respectively fig 10b shows the dynamic process of soil temperature of wasteland there was an increase in the temperature during the entire growth period at the 0 30 cm soil layer however temperatures at the 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers increased by 13 13 and 23 respectively wasteland was not irrigated and only affected by rainfall and radiation variation in atmospheric temperature fig 3 indicated that soil temperature of wasteland could be divided into two stages 1 the warming stage from april 28 to september 10 and 2 the cooling stage from september 11 to september 30 the soil temperature at the studied soil layer increased by 4 5 7 c during the warming stage and the soil temperatures at the 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers increased by 70 42 48 43 45 and 41 respectively the soil temperature decreases by 2 4 c during the cooling stage the average temperature of wasteland 0 60 cm varied from 13 to 14 c during the entire growth period 3 4 water balance analysis the simulations of soil water of the highland barley field oat field and wasteland in 2019 and 2020 were used to analyze the water balance of the 0 60 cm soil profile over different growth stages based on the water balance theory table 8 shows a summary of the calculated results 3 4 1 soil water balance in the highland barley field in 2019 irrigation of highland barley land occurred mainly in the initial growth period and in the rapid growth period during which percolation values at the 0 60 cm soil layer were 13 16 cm and 15 74 cm respectively whereas total percolation was 28 90 cm percolation of highland barley land in 2020 was around 37 cm and was mainly concentrated during the rapid growth period and mid growth period when percolation values were 13 62 cm and 17 70 cm respectively accounting for 85 of total percolation precipitation values during these two periods were 27 26 cm and 22 14 cm respectively accounting for 79 of total rainfall and resulted in highland barley land being irrigated twice the largest evaporation of highland barley occurred during the rapid growth period and mid growth period with values of 9 35 14 82 cm and 10 32 18 70 cm respectively accounting for 80 90 of total evapotranspiration soil evaporation and transpiration accounted for 20 29 and 33 43 of the introduced water rainfall and irrigation respectively the actual water consumption of highland barley amounted to 63 of the total introduced water rainfall and irrigation excluding the variation of water storage of 0 60 cm soil profile 3 4 2 soil water balance in oats field the largest percolation of the oats field occurred in the initial growth period and the rapid growth period during which it varied from 8 95 cm to 13 16 cm and from 15 74 cm to 19 42 cm respectively and accounted for 77 94 of total percolation during the whole growth period the rainfall and irrigation amount in the initial growth period and the rapid growth period accounted for 80 90 of the total rainfall and irrigation in the entire growth period maximum evapotranspiration of oats of 11 89 cm 19 05 cm occurred during the rapid growth period soil evaporation and transpiration accounted for 20 29 and 42 50 of the introduced water rainfall and irrigation respectively the percolation of 17 54 36 05 cm accounted for 35 39 of the total introduced water rainfall and irrigation and the oat field consumed 61 79 of the total introduced water rainfall and irrigation excluding the variation in water storage of the 0 60 cm soil profile 3 4 3 soil water balance in wasteland the percolation of wasteland was only 7 26 cm and 28 cm in 2019 and 2020 respectively this could be attributed to rainfall in the growth period of 2020 being twice that in 2019 percolation in wasteland accounted for 16 45 of precipitation with the rate of percolation varying greatly according to year specific rainfall soil evaporation and transpiration were 6 42 6 74 cm and 20 60 22 78 cm in 2019 and 2020 accounting for 10 18 and 36 57 of rainfall respectively the maximum evapotranspiration occurred in the mid growth period ranging from 15 53 cm to 16 35 cm 3 5 heat transport of different soil layers and different growth periods the present study analyzed changes in heat in the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers over different growth periods based on simulations of soil temperature for the highland barley field oats field and wasteland in 2019 and 2020 table 9 shows a summary of the results 3 5 1 characterization of soil heat transformation of the highland barley field for different growth periods the maximum soil temperature in 2019 and 2020 was observed in the mid growth period with average daily temperatures of the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 16 5 c 17 1 c and 16 5 c respectively soil temperature changes dramatically between the initial growth period and rapid growth period with increases in temperature at the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 2 36 2 60 c 2 30 2 42 c and 2 10 2 50 c respectively less dramatic changes in soil temperature occurred between the rapid growth period to the mid growth period with the least changes between the mid growth period and late growth period there were increases in temperature across the entire growth period at the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 3 00 3 36 c 2 84 3 20 c and 3 19 3 90 c respectively with an amplitude of temperature increase of 2 50 4 0 c 3 5 2 characterization of the soil heat transformation of the oats field for different growth periods the maximum temperatures in 2019 and 2020 occurred in the mid growth period and the rapid growth period respectively the average daily temperatures of 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers were 14 66 c 16 57 c and 15 87 c in 2019 and 14 81 c 16 90 c and 16 20 c in 2020 respectively there were increases in soil temperature from the initial grow period to the rapid grow period at the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 1 14 2 32 c 1 45 2 56 c and 1 59 2 93 c respectively during which temperature fluctuations were the most obvious there were slight decreases in soil temperature from the middle to late growth period at the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 0 67 0 96 c 0 68 0 87 c and 0 17 0 9 c respectively there were increases in soil temperature over the entire growth period at the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 1 43 1 75 c 1 18 1 92 c and 0 18 2 5 c respectively 3 5 3 characterization of soil heat transformation of wasteland for different growth periods the maximum soil temperature in 2019 and 2020 occurred in the mid growth stage with average daily temperatures of the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 15 07 15 26 c 15 31 15 63 c and 14 34 14 77 c respectively there were large changes in soil temperature between the initial growth period and rapid growth period with increases in the average daily temperatures of the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 1 55 c 1 84 c and 1 77 c respectively less changes in soil temperature occurred between the rapid growth period and mid growth period however there were slight decreases in soil temperature between the middle and late growth periods at the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 1 34 1 53 c 0 85 1 24 c and 0 44 c respectively there were increases in soil temperature over the entire growth period at the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 0 92 0 99 c 1 33 1 40 c and 2 33 2 39 c respectively 4 discussion 4 1 water balance in the highland barley field oat field and wasteland in a typical alpine irrigation district of tibet the results of the present study identified water consumptions of highland barley of 176 196 mm and 138 207 mm during the rapid growth period and mid growth period respectively liu et al 2019 identified the water consumption of highland barley to be 136 22 141 72 mm and 117 66 133 62 mm during the rapid growth period and mid growth period respectively the less water consumption of highland barley identified in the prior study can be attributed to damage to highland barley due to irrigation with cold water which delayed the emergence and tiller of the crop and reduced the effective panicles at the jointing stage root development of highland barley was affected by cumulative cold damage during the early stage which in turn affected the subsequent stages the results of the present study indicated a water consumption of highland barley over the entire growth period of 457 549 mm exceeding that identified by liu et al of 473 7 499 mm this difference could be attributed to irrigation water at a normal temperature being applied in the current study whereas that ion the liu et al study was at a lower temperature of 3 5 and 7 c xu et al 2015 conduced field experiments in lhasa to characterize forage irrigation in high altitude areas of tibet in which the water requirements and water consumption of oats were studied based on simulations of the cropwat model their results showed that the water requirement of oats in lhasa over the entire growth period was 570 mm and water consumption was 464 570 mm under different water conditions the critical oats irrigation period was the early stage of tiller and jointing and they used the cropwat model to determine an optimal irrigation schedule of 2 4 applications the results of the present study based on the simulations of the hydrus model showed that water consumption of oat fields over the entire growth period ranged from 404 mm to 571 mm similar to prior studies the different rainfall patterns contributed to the wide range of water consumption of oat fields and the results of the present and previous studies indicated that an oats field has a range of water consumption of 106 mm to 167 mm the present study irrigated the oats field 2 4 times in accordance with the local irrigation schedule with more detailed information shown in table 2 the present study used to results of a previous study xu et al 2015 to identify the irrigation duration and quantity of the oats field the results indicated that rapid growth stage tillering and joining of oats is a key growth period of oats during which the maximum evapotranspiration water demand occurs ranging from 11 89 cm to 19 05 cm yin et al 2010 analyzed the main characteristics of water transport in a plateau wheat farmland ecosystem based on model simulations in which the farmland in the lower lhasa valley of the qinghai tibet plateau was adopted as a study area their results showed that the maximum water consumption of wheat occurred over the joint filling stage and water was mainly transferred between soil and plant the results of the present study showed that the maximum evapotranspiration of highland barley and oat occurred over the rapid growth stage jointing stage was 9 35 14 82 cm and 11 89 19 05 cm respectively the maximum evapotranspiration of highland barley and wasteland occurred over the mid growth stage was the 10 32 18 70 cm and 15 53 16 35 cm respectively water exchange was more frequent in these two periods water uptake of wheat roots in the lhasa valley tibet was mainly concentrated in the 10 40 cm soil layer total percolation of the wheat field over the entire growth period was 33 1 cm accounting for approximately 50 of the total irrigation quantity total percolation amounts for highland barley oats and wasteland were 30 88 36 61 cm 17 54 36 05 cm and 7 26 28 cm accounting for 42 35 39 and 16 45 of total introduced water respectively highland barley oat and winter wheat showed similar percolation whereas that of wasteland was less since it was not irrigated the percolation rates of highland barley and oats were significantly lower than that of wheat several years of water saving initiatives implemented in the tibet irrigation district resulted in a significant reduction in the percolation rate and the current irrigation quantities of highland barley and oats are half of that of wheat 665 mm yin et al 2009 si et al 2005 determined that the total evapotranspiration of wasteland tamarix ramosissima was approximately 248 mm with an evapotranspiration rate of 1 6 mm d 1 si et al 2005 wang et al 2020 showed that the evapotranspiration et of wasteland ranged from 203 68 to 283 92 mm over the entire growth period wang et al 2020 the results of the present study determined a et of wasteland over the entire growth period of 270 295 mm slightly exceeding those identified by si et al and wang et al tibet is characterized by strong radiation annual solar radiation of 6000 8000 mj m2 and long sunshine hours 3000 h tang et al 2018 and the absolute ultraviolet ray flux in lhasa is 2 3 times of that in low altitude areas at the same latitude in china tang 2021 the water consumption values of highland barley oats and wasteland were 63 61 to 79 and 47 to 75 of total water introduced rainfall irrigation highland barley and oats showed similar ratios of water consumption to total introduced water which could be attributed to their similar growth characteristics and growth period and since both belong to the gramineae family wasteland which is only affected by rainfall consumed less water than highland barley and oats with the proportion of water consumption dependent on fear specific rainfall 4 2 variations in soil temperature in the highland barley field oats field and wasteland in a typical alpine irrigation district of tibet soil temperature is a comprehensive indicator of the soil thermal condition mahmood et al 2012 soil temperature affects the soil environment inselsbacher and nasholm 2012 which in turn affects the growth and development of crops gouranga and ashwani 2007 liu et al 2020 conducted a study on the growth of highland barley and the change in soil temperature under three irrigation water temperatures of 3 c 5 c and 7 c lower than the normal water temperature 7 15 c their results showed that irrigation with cold water reduced the temperatures of the 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm soil layers by 1 41 c and 0 67 c respectively the application of cold irrigation water of 3 c 5 c and 7 c lower than the normal delayed the emergence tiller and maturity of highland barley resulting in deceases in yield of 19 62 38 59 and 42 52 respectively the application of cold irrigation water can reduce the soil temperature in the root zone of highland barley which in turn indirectly affects water uptake and root growth guan et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 showed that the germination potential germination percentage and germination index of highland barley increased with increasing temperature of irrigation water in the range of 10 25 c whereas temperatures exceeding this range would lead to a decline in the seed germination index the results of the present study showed that the average daily temperatures of highland barley in the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers during the early growth stage seedling stage were 13 3 c 14 2 c and 13 3 c whereas those of oats were 12 3 c 14 0 c and 13 2 c and those of wasteland were 12 75 c 12 06 c and 12 c respectively these temperatures were conducive to the germination and emergence of highland barley oats and natural herbage the largest variation in soil temperature of the highland barley field oat field and wasteland occurred during the rapid growth period during this period there were increases in soil temperature for highland barley at the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 cm 60 cm soil layers of 2 48 c 2 36 c and 2 3 c whereas those for oats were 1 73 c 2 01 c and 2 26 c and those for wasteland were 1 55 c 1 84 c and 1 77 c respectively an optimal growth temperature is critical at this period although soil temperature could meet the requirements for crop growth in the seedling period it was not optimal and an appropriate increase in soil temperature would benefit crop growth between the initial growth period and rapid growth period since highland barley is planted 15 d earlier than oats the increased temperature of highland barley field is higher than that of oat field natural herbage does not experience year round harvesting and is only eaten by livestock therefore there constant presence of herbage vegetation on the soil surface affects the transmission of solar radiation to soil heat resulting in a lower soil warming of wasteland compared to that of oats and highland barley the results of the present study showed that the temperatures of the 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers showed lag effects the time lag of the 10 cm and 20 cm soil layers was 1 2 h whereas that of the 30 50 cm soil layer was 3 5 h cai et al 2013 identified a time lag of the daily maximum soil temperature at a 5 cm depth of 2 h longer than that identified in previous studies shi 2015 found a gradual decrease in the diurnal variation in soil temperature with increasing of soil depth with virtually no variation at a depth 25 cm the results of the present study showed changes in the temperature peak of each soil layer among the different months with no variation at a soil depth 40 cm linzhou county is a grain production base due to its relatively fertile thick and compact soil shi 2015 identified decreases in soil temperature at the 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm 20 cm 25 cm soil layers of 6 c 7 c 7 c 8 c and 7 c from the heading stage to maturity stage the results of the present study showed that temperature of each soil layer of a highland barley field did not change much during the middle to the later growth period whereas that of the oat field showed slight decreases in the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 cm 60 cm soil layers of 0 67 0 96 c 0 68 0 87 c and 0 17 0 90 c and that of wasteland decreased by 1 34 1 53 c 0 85 1 24 c and 0 44 c respectively the altitude of xigaze prefecture in tibet is 4 200 m 600 mm higher than that of linzhou county lhasa shigaze is more affected by radiation during the day compared to linzhou county its climate is extremely dry the night temperature is low linzhou county has more vegetation and a relatively mild climate comparted to xigaze prefecture and summer humidity is relatively high therefore the changes in soil temperature of linzhou county are smaller than those of xigaze the decrease in soil temperature in wasteland exceeded that in the oat field from the middle to late growth period since a more regular field planting scheme is applied to oats it has a larger planting density and soil coverage compared to wasteland and soil is relatively less affected by radiation resulting in smaller changes to soil temperature 5 conclusions this study applied the hydrus 1d model to study the water heat transport process of the highland barley field oat field and wasteland in the alpine irrigated district of tibet a set of parameters suitable for the water and heat transport were proposed which will contribute to the development of ecological hydrology the maximum increase in soil temperature occurred between the initial growth period and rapid growth period with an average increase at the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layer of 2 48 c 2 36 c and 2 3 c for highland barley 1 73 c 2 0 c and 2 26 c for oats and 1 55 c 1 84 c and 1 77 c for wasteland respectively although crop growth during this period was vigorous soil temperature was not optimal the water consumption of highland barley field oat field and wasteland over the entire growth period were 457 549 mm 404 571 mm and 270 295 mm respectively for highland barley field oat field and wasteland soil evaporation accounted for 20 29 20 29 and 10 18 of the introduced water rainfall and irrigation whereas transpiration accounted for 33 43 42 50 and 36 57 and percolation was 30 88 36 61 cm 17 54 36 05 cm and 7 26 28 cm respectively which was good to the management of agricultural water resources and improvement of

2232,many water saving projects have been initiated in the typical alpine irrigation district in tibet which resulted in dramatic changes to the hydrothermal conversion process there is an urgent need to fully understand the hydrothermal transport process and to clarify the mechanism under which agricultural hydrology evolves in the alpine irrigation district of tibet this study selected highland barley field oat field wasteland natural herbage field without irrigation in pengbo irrigation district of tibet as study objects to study soil water and heat dynamics and soil water balance observed water and temperature data were used to calibrate and validate simulations of the hydrus 1d model for 2019 and 2020 respectively simulations of soil water and temperature were in good agreement with the measured values with determination coefficient of 0 69 0 91 this study proposes a set of hydrothermal parameters to fill the gap in the hydrothermal research of tibet the results showed that the variation of soil temperature was approximately sinusoidal with a lag effect the temperatures of the 0 20 cm and 30 50 cm soil layers lagged by about 1 2 h and 3 5 h respectively the highest rate of soil temperature increase occurred from the initial growth period to the rapid growth period during which the soil temperature of each layer increased by an average of 2 c however the soil temperature in this period was not the most suitable for crop growth soil evaporation of highland barley field oat field and wasteland during the growth period accounted for 20 29 20 29 10 18 of the rainfall and irrigation whereas transpiration accounted for 33 43 42 50 and 36 57 and percolation accounted for 42 35 39 and 16 45 respectively implementation of water saving projects resulted in reductions in irrigation volume and percolation rate this study can provide a reference for clarifying the hydrothermal transport process and allocating agricultural water resources in the alpine irrigation district of tibet keywords alpine irrigation district of tibet different types of vegetation and fields hydrus 1d model water and heat transport water balance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrothermal transportation is a continuous process occurring in the soil plant atmosphere system and is closely related to plant physiological processes hydrological processes and climatic characteristics ding et al 2010 therefore the hydrothermal condition is an important factor to consider when analyzing hydrological processes and is a popular field of research within the biospheric aspects of hydrological cycle bahc the core project of the international geosphere and biosphere program igbp mcmurtrie and wang 1993 agren and mcmurtrie 1991 the study of water transport process and the law of hydrothermal balance is the basis of understanding the formation and evolution of vegetation patterns hydrological process and other material cycles wang and liu 2002 the qinghai tibet plateau is a typical ecologically fragile area in china and is extremely sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic activities the interaction between earth and atmosphere and anthropogenic activities can have extremely important influences on regional and global climate mollasina and benedict 2004 known as the water tower of asia tibet is rich in water resources and changes in water consumption will directly affect the distribution of water resources in asia the irrigation district in tibet is the greatest consumer of water therefore there is a need to understand the hydrological process of the irrigation district to facilitate reasonable allocation of water resources liu et al 2020 yin et al 2010 recent large scale construction of dams reservoirs channels and other water conservancy facilities in tibet s irrigation district has resulted in changes to the natural hydrological process and the spatial and temporal distribution of runoff in the irrigation district agricultural measures have changed the underlying surface conditions in the water circulation pathway dai and cai 2008 thus affecting the distribution of surface water soil water and groundwater different kinds of vegetation are planted in the irrigation district and their growth characteristics water consumption and demand laws and irrigation systems are quite different therefore in order to clarify the hydrological process in the irrigation district there is an urgent need to further characterize evapotranspiration among different vegetation types soil evaporation soil percolation groundwater recharge and groundwater seepage tibet has high radiation intensity annual radiation of 8000 mj m2 about one to two times of that in the mainland annual sunshine duration of over 3000 h and a large diurnal temperature difference tang et al 2017 low temperature snowmelt water used for irrigation in spring results in dramatic diurnal changes to the soil hydrothermal environment liu et al 2020 there are differences in the hydrothermal environment and water consumption process among different types of vegetation and fields due to differences in physiological characteristics since climate change in the region has resulted in reduced biodiversity and serious soil desertification many scientists pay more attention to biodiversity zong and shi 2020 the spatial evolution of vegetation zones zuo et al 2021 carbon storage lu et al 2022 the soil freeze thaw process gao et al 2020 ming and zhao 2022 soil degradation dai et al 2020 and desertification study zou et al 2011 in tibet people living in the study area survive mainly by agriculture and animal husbandry resulting in a large demand for high quality herbage the influences of climate and anthropogenic activities have resulted in deficits in herbage resources in tibet therefore past studies have focused on crop breeding xu et al 2018 variety screening wang and wu 2017 crop growth li et al 2019 crop yield ying et al 2014 and irrigation systems luo et al 2013 xu et al 2015 however few studies have focused on differences in water consumption among different vegetation types and the evolution of the hydrothermal environment in the irrigated district currently there remains insufficient knowledge of the water consumption process of field system with different vegetation types which has hindered the regulation of agricultural water resources in irrigation district fully understanding the variations in hydrothermal transport processes among different vegetation types and fields in the alpine irrigation district of tibet can play an important role in clarifying the evolution of agricultural hydrology and allocation of water resources in irrigation district many methods for studying vegetation water consumption and soil water and heat transport currently exist jeewantinie kapilaratne et al 2017 improved a general temperature correction method for dielectric sensors which can be commonly used regardless of the differences in climatic conditions sensor type and soil type which can ensure the accuracy of soil water content measurements zhang et al 2018 used a micro evaporator and liquid flow meter to measure interplant evaporation and plant transpiration of maize under drip irrigation shorcomings of the probe type of the wrapped liquid flowmeter limit measurements of corn transpiration to the middle and late stages there is a need to adopt the crop coefficient method of fao56 and the basic crop coefficient during the middle growth period should be corrected by crop transpiration measured by a liquid flow meter following which crop transpiration over the entire growth period can be calculated zhang et al 2013 determined that net radiation saturated water pressure temperature and wind speed were the main meteorological factors affecting crop evapotranspiration the simdual kc model was calibrated and validated based on eddy current covariance measurements and applied to winter wheat and summer maize field experiments in the irrigation area in the upper reaches of the yellow river although the simulations of soil moisture were in good agreement with observations the effects of meteorological factors on evapotranspiration were different among northeast china northwest china and xinjiang which have obvious regional characteristics pereira et al 2015 kang et al 2005 applied the simultaneous heat and water shaw model to simulate the energy and water balance of the soil residual vegetation canopy system in the mountainous vegetation zone of the heihe river basin li 2005 used the shaw model to study the characteristics of surface energy and soil temperature transport of the active layer in the permafrost region of the qinghai tibet plateau by distinguishing between daytime and evening radiation yin et al 2009 verified the parameters of shaw model using soil freeze thaw data in its application to the haibei alpine meadow lhasa farmland gongga mountain forest daqaidan desert and wudaoliang grassland their study simulated the characteristics of water transport and the water balance in alpine meadow grassland farmland forest and desert ecosystems and the contributions of soil freezing and melting processes to vegetation water use were quantitatively analyzed however further research on the hydrothermal reciprocal feed back between atmosphere vegetation soil groundwater is needed there is a need for further research on changes in vegetation water consumption and in the soil water and thermal environment resulting from intense radiation and irrigation in the non freeze thaw growth period due to limitations to the shaw model wang et al 2010 constructed a model of soil hydrothermal transport under drip irrigation based on the hydrus 2d model their results showed that the constructed model could accurately predict the soil hydrothermal distribution which provided a theoretical basis for accurately regulating the soil hydrothermal environment required by crops under drip irrigation feng et al 2021 used the hydrus 2d model to study the effect of degradation film mulching on the soil hydrothermal environment in the west liaohe plain their results indicated the optimal period to implement degradation film mulching ren et al 2016 used the hydrus dualkc model to simulate and evaluate the water use efficiencies of maize sunflower and watermelon in irrigated farmland and described the water consumption processes of different crops pan et al 2017 conducted a thermal tracing experiment within saturated layered quartz sand under a stable flow field and inverted the water thermal transport parameters using the inverse problem algorithm of the hydrus model the hydrus model shows advantages over other models for simulating hydrothermal changes the objectives of the present study were to a calibrate and verify the hydrus model and then study the model simulations of soil hydrothermal processes of typical crops in the alpine irrigation district of tibet b evaluate the water balances of different crops c characterize heat conversion processes among different crops and different growth stages the present study provides a theoretical basis for clarifying the process of hydrothermal transport and the evolution of agricultural hydrological processes in the alpine

d the middle of the growth period occurs in early july with a maximum duration of 50 d table 3 2 3 5 soil temperature fig 4 shows the changes in hourly soil temperature changes in soil temperature were examined over three days and five periods 1 14 16 may 2 14 16 june 3 14 16 july 4 14 16 august and 5 14 16 september temperature showed a sinusoidal trend with periodic changes the highest

soil moisture and temperature monitoring equipment this study only pays attention to the comprehensive effects of various factors soil type precipitation atmospheric temperature irrigation and so on on soil moisture and temperature we eliminated the abnormal values of soil moisture and temperature by manually adjusting method fig 5 shows hourly changes in soil moisture content changes in soil moisture content were examined over the same periods as that for soil temperature the fluctuating moisture content in the 0 30 cm soil layer could be attributed to the influences of irrigation and rainfall while a linear decreasing trend was evident in the soil water content in the 40 60 cm soil layer two soil water stages could be defined in the 0 30 cm soil layer 1 soil water consumption

model was developed by the national salt reform center in the united states to provide a one dimensional vertical model of water heat and solute transport and root water uptake in porous media with saturated and unsaturated zones šimunek et al 2009 after years of improvement hydrus 1d has been widely used to simulate the variations in soil profile moisture temperature and solutes resulting from field irrigation and fertilization 2 4 1 soil water transport model the hydrus 1d model adopts a modified form of richards equation with a source sink term to solve the soil water transport process 1

was assumed that the root depth reached 50 of the maximum root depth in the preceding t half of the growth period ren et al 2017 the root depth of highland barley oat natural herbage was 40 50 cm 40 50 cm 50 60 cm respectively 2 4 2 soil heat transport model soil moisture in non frozen soil consists of liquid water and gaseous water by ignoring gaseous water diffusion and only considering the influence of liquid water movement on soil heat transport soil heat flow movement can be expressed as 5 c θ t t r λ ij θ t z c w q i t r where λij θ is the apparent thermal conductivity of soil w cm c c θ is the total volumetric heat capacity of soil j cm3 c cw is the volumetric heat capacity of water j cm3 c t is soil temperature c and qi is water circulation cm day 2 4 3 evaporation and transpiration potential evapotranspiration etp can be calculated as 6 e t p k c e t 0 where k c is the crop coefficient k c values of highland barley and oats were set to 0 56 0 97 and 0 62 and 0 3 1 15 and 0 79 in the early middle and late stages respectively as according to fao56 the hydrus 1d model uses the penman monteith equation to calculate et 0 which is then divided into potential evaporation ep and potential transpiration tp according to the crop leaf area index the potential transpiration rate tp 7 t p e t p 1 e klai where lai is the leaf area index k is the extinction coefficient of the crop canopy and k values of oats and highland barley were wet to 0 39 respectively hao et al 2015 potential evaporation is the difference between etp and tp 2 5 model establishment calibration and verification 2 5 1 simulation profile depths as shown in fig 6 the simulated profile depths of the highland barley field oat field and wasteland were 400 cm respectively the simulated profiles of the highland barley field oat field and wasteland were set as three layers according to their measured soil textures and study profile was divided as shown in table 1 the soil profile was divided in the vertical one dimensional direction into 401 nodes with a spacing of 1 cm observation points were arranged in the soil layers at 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm 60 cm and 400 cm the simulation periods for the highland barley field oat field and wasteland were set to april 28 to september 30 may 15 to september 30 and april 28 to september 30 respectively with simulation durations of 148 d 138 d and 156 d respectively the initial time steps of the highland barley field oat field and wasteland were set as 0 1 d the minimum time steps were set as 0 001 d and the maximum time steps were set as 5 d respectively 2 5 2 initial conditions and boundary conditions the present study constructed the boundary conditions for the highland barley field oat field and wasteland the interface between the atmosphere and soil surface was set as the upper boundary condition for whereas the variable pressure head condition was selected as the bottom boundary condition data required to represent the upper boundary conditions included daily rainfall daily evaporation and daily transpiration whereas that for the bottom boundary condition included daily groundwater depth as determined by the variable pressure head value the upper and lower boundary conditions of heat transport were set as the temperature boundary the upper boundary of the highland barley field oat field and wasteland were set as the atmospheric temperature respectively and the bottom boundary was set as the groundwater temperature 2 5 3 soil parameters the initial soil hydraulic parameters θs θr α n l were predicted by the retc software based on soil bulk density and the contents of sand silt and clay table 1 where bulk density θs ks and the contents of sand silt and clay were specified based on the measured values the thermal transport parameters b 1 b 2 b 3 λ were determined based on model inversion and prior studies feng et al 2021 gao 2019 the initial values of root water uptake parameters h1 h2 h3h h3l h4 hϕ and hϕ50 were determined by software default values and prior studies 2 5 4 model calibration and validation the model parameters were calibrated against data for soil water content and temperature in 2019 whereas that for 2020 were used to validate the model the root mean square error rmse regression coefficient b coefficient of determination r 2 and mean relative error mre were used to assess the model performance for both the calibration and validation processes these goodness of fit statistics are defined below ren et al 2016 xu et al 2013 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 9 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 0 5 i 1 n p i p 2 0 5 2 10 b i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 2 11 mre 1 n i 1 n h p i o i o i 100 where n is the number of observed values oi is the ith measured value pi is the ith simulated value o is the average of the observations and p is the average of simulations mre and rmse values close to zero and b values close to 1 indicate good model performance it is generally believed that an mre within 10 a ratio of rmse to the average measured value of within 20 and r 2 0 5 indicate that the variation in observations is well captured by the model 3 results 3 1 model calibration the model was calibrated against observations of soil water content and temperature in 2019 the simulations of soil water content were in good agreement with observations indicating that the model could represent the dynamic processes regulating soil water content as shown in table 4 the mre rmse r 2 and b of soil water content in the highland barley field oat field and wasteland varied from 7 94 to 0 06 0 02 to 0 03 cm3 cm 3 0 75 to 0 9 and 0 88 0 97 respectively whereas those of soil temperature were 3 17 to 0 35 0 54 to 1 26 c 0 69 to 0 88 and 0 97 to 0 99 respectively the evaluation of model goodness of fit statistics indicated that the model achieved an acceptable simulation accuracy for soil temperature tables 5 and 6 show the calibrated hydraulic and thermodynamic parameters whereas table 7 shows the root water uptake parameters the model achieved a lower simulation accuracy for soil temperature compared to that for soil water content which could be attributed to the effect of soil water content on soil temperature there is a large diurnal change in soil temperature in tibet particularly in the 0 20 cm soil layer and the strong radiation of the region has a significant impact on the thermal alternation of surface soil soil in tibet is often mixed with fine gravel which affects the thermal conductivity of soil 3 2 model validation the model was validated against measured soil water content and temperature data for 2020 model simulations were generated for the simulation period under the calibrated parameters fig 7 shows the results of the validation table 4 shows the results of the goodness of fit statistics for the validation of soil water content mre 6 80 1 43 rmse 0 016 0 02 c r 2 0 79 0 80 b 0 98 0 99 and soil temperature mre 1 67 0 33 rmse 0 55 1 06 c r 2 0 75 0 91 b 0 97 0 99 the goodness of fit indicator values for the validation period were similar to those of the calibration period thereby meeting model requirements for accuracy 3 3 soil hydrothermal dynamics the simulations for 2019 were used to analyze the dynamic processes regulating soil water content and soil temperature of the highland barley field oat field and wasteland with the results shown in figs 8 10 3 3 1 soil hydrothermal dynamics in highland barley field fig 8a shows the dynamics of soil water content of highland barley the relatively thin soil layer in tibet 20 30 cm and relatively large soil sediment content results in a relatively small soil water content the saturated water content of the 0 20 cm soil layer was only 0 3 cm3 cm3 whereas the soil water content of the 30 60 cm soil layer was only 0 23 0 25 cm3 cm3 fig 8a soil showed relatively poor water retention and low storage capacity irrigation volume of the study area was recorded highland barley was irrigated for five times in 2019 namely on may 2 may 12 june 6 june 21 and july 3 fig 8a and table 2 since precipitation during the growth period of 2019 was 358 mm precipitation from may to early july accounted for only 18 of the total growth period rainfall fig 3 during each irrigation event soil water content decreased from saturation to its maximum water holding capacity soil water content decreased by 47 57 in the 0 20 cm soil layer between each irrigation period the moisture of the 30 60 cm soil layer was higher than that of the surface layer during two irrigation events intervals the reduction in soil water content was lower than that of the surface layer about 36 44 and the reduction in soil water content in the surface layer exceeded that in the deep layer by 12 fig 8b shows the dynamics in soil temperature of highland barley the temperature of irrigation water was relatively low in may 13 c resulting in an obvious change in temperature in the 0 30 cm soil layer soil temperature showed a downward trend whereas there was a small change in the temperature of the 50 60 cm soil layer the temperature of irrigation water in july was about 19 c and temperature of the 0 60 cm soil layer showed a clear upward trend the study area experiences a large diurnal temperature difference strong radiation and frequent raining in the evening the low temperature of rain around 14 c results in strong fluctuations in the temperature of the 0 30 cm soil layer the average daily minimum temperatures over the growth period at soil depths of 10 cm 20 cm and 30 cm appeared on may 14 and the average daily maximum temperature occurred on july 3 with rates of temperature increase of 58 46 and 38 respectively the increases in temperature during this period for the 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil were 31 27 and 23 respectively the highest temperatures in the 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers were on august 20 the increases in soil temperature occurred at rates of 38 35 and 38 in comparison with the lowest temperature 13 c on may 14 similar to the temperature of the 30 cm soil layer on july 3 soil temperature transport showed a lag effect 3 3 2 soil hydrothermal dynamics in oats fields fig 9a demonstrates the dynamic process affecting soil water content in the oats field the observations of local irrigation indicated that the oats field was irrigated on june 9 and june 23 2019 table 2 precipitation was concentrated between in mid july to late september in 2019 accounting for 82 of total rainfall in the growing period fig 3 these results indicating significant fluctuation in the moisture of each soil layer the mean soil water contents at 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layer were 0 18 0 21 0 21 0 22 and 0 22 respectively irrigation resulted in increases in soil water content at the 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers increased by 86 67 88 61 71 47 61 35 56 and 35 47 respectively fig 9b shows the dynamic process of soil temperature in an oats field irrigation water temperatures on june 9 and june 23 were 15 c and 19 c respectively the temperature of the 10 cm soil layer decreased slightly after irrigation on june 9 whereas temperature of the 10 60 cm soil layer increased after two irrigations the area of exposed oats was larger the influence of the atmosphere on soil water content and temperature was greater and the soil water content and temperature of each soil layer showed an increasing trend during the initial growth period and rapid growth period may 15 to june 30 the rates of increase in soil temperature at the 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers were 36 31 31 23 28 and 20 respectively oats grew faster and vegetation coverage gradually increased from the mid growth period to the late growth period july 1 to september 15 therefore atmospheric radiation had little effect on soil temperature the temperature of the 0 30 cm soil layer decreased by 3 4 c from july 1st to july 25th whereas that of the 40 60 cm soil layer decreased by 1 2 c the temperature of each soil layer was relatively stable from july 25 to august 31 the mean soil temperatures of the 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers were 14 5 c 16 c 16 2 c 15 5 c 15 5 c and 15 5 c respectively the soil temperatures at the 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers decreased by 41 41 28 23 18 and 18 from september 15 to september 30 respectively 3 3 3 soil hydrothermal dynamics in wasteland fig 10 shows the dynamics process of soil water content of wasteland precipitation only accounting for 18 of total rainfall in the growing period from april 28 to july 1 and the cumulative daily rainfall was less than 5 mm therefore soil water content in the 0 20 cm soil layer fluctuated slightly from the initial growth period to july 1 whereas the soil water content at the 30 60 cm soil layer was not affected by rainfall since rainfall was concentrated from july 4 to august 23 fig 3 daily rainfall could reach 39 mm soil water content at the 0 20 cm soil layer changed greatly during this period and the soil water content at the 30 60 cm soil layer continued to increase through infiltration increased soil water consumption could be attributed to poor soil water retention strong radiation and absence of water recharge soil water contents from june 27 to july 8 at the 10 cm 20 cm and 30 cm soil layers decreased by 70 76 and 63 respectively soil water content during the rainy season at the 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers increased by 72 80 79 61 64 and 64 respectively the soil water content at 0 30 cm soil layer did not increase significantly during the entire growth period whereas that at the 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers increased by 60 64 and 67 respectively fig 10b shows the dynamic process of soil temperature of wasteland there was an increase in the temperature during the entire growth period at the 0 30 cm soil layer however temperatures at the 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers increased by 13 13 and 23 respectively wasteland was not irrigated and only affected by rainfall and radiation variation in atmospheric temperature fig 3 indicated that soil temperature of wasteland could be divided into two stages 1 the warming stage from april 28 to september 10 and 2 the cooling stage from september 11 to september 30 the soil temperature at the studied soil layer increased by 4 5 7 c during the warming stage and the soil temperatures at the 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers increased by 70 42 48 43 45 and 41 respectively the soil temperature decreases by 2 4 c during the cooling stage the average temperature of wasteland 0 60 cm varied from 13 to 14 c during the entire growth period 3 4 water balance analysis the simulations of soil water of the highland barley field oat field and wasteland in 2019 and 2020 were used to analyze the water balance of the 0 60 cm soil profile over different growth stages based on the water balance theory table 8 shows a summary of the calculated results 3 4 1 soil water balance in the highland barley field in 2019 irrigation of highland barley land occurred mainly in the initial growth period and in the rapid growth period during which percolation values at the 0 60 cm soil layer were 13 16 cm and 15 74 cm respectively whereas total percolation was 28 90 cm percolation of highland barley land in 2020 was around 37 cm and was mainly concentrated during the rapid growth period and mid growth period when percolation values were 13 62 cm and 17 70 cm respectively accounting for 85 of total percolation precipitation values during these two periods were 27 26 cm and 22 14 cm respectively accounting for 79 of total rainfall and resulted in highland barley land being irrigated twice the largest evaporation of highland barley occurred during the rapid growth period and mid growth period with values of 9 35 14 82 cm and 10 32 18 70 cm respectively accounting for 80 90 of total evapotranspiration soil evaporation and transpiration accounted for 20 29 and 33 43 of the introduced water rainfall and irrigation respectively the actual water consumption of highland barley amounted to 63 of the total introduced water rainfall and irrigation excluding the variation of water storage of 0 60 cm soil profile 3 4 2 soil water balance in oats field the largest percolation of the oats field occurred in the initial growth period and the rapid growth period during which it varied from 8 95 cm to 13 16 cm and from 15 74 cm to 19 42 cm respectively and accounted for 77 94 of total percolation during the whole growth period the rainfall and irrigation amount in the initial growth period and the rapid growth period accounted for 80 90 of the total rainfall and irrigation in the entire growth period maximum evapotranspiration of oats of 11 89 cm 19 05 cm occurred during the rapid growth period soil evaporation and transpiration accounted for 20 29 and 42 50 of the introduced water rainfall and irrigation respectively the percolation of 17 54 36 05 cm accounted for 35 39 of the total introduced water rainfall and irrigation and the oat field consumed 61 79 of the total introduced water rainfall and irrigation excluding the variation in water storage of the 0 60 cm soil profile 3 4 3 soil water balance in wasteland the percolation of wasteland was only 7 26 cm and 28 cm in 2019 and 2020 respectively this could be attributed to rainfall in the growth period of 2020 being twice that in 2019 percolation in wasteland accounted for 16 45 of precipitation with the rate of percolation varying greatly according to year specific rainfall soil evaporation and transpiration were 6 42 6 74 cm and 20 60 22 78 cm in 2019 and 2020 accounting for 10 18 and 36 57 of rainfall respectively the maximum evapotranspiration occurred in the mid growth period ranging from 15 53 cm to 16 35 cm 3 5 heat transport of different soil layers and different growth periods the present study analyzed changes in heat in the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers over different growth periods based on simulations of soil temperature for the highland barley field oats field and wasteland in 2019 and 2020 table 9 shows a summary of the results 3 5 1 characterization of soil heat transformation of the highland barley field for different growth periods the maximum soil temperature in 2019 and 2020 was observed in the mid growth period with average daily temperatures of the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 16 5 c 17 1 c and 16 5 c respectively soil temperature changes dramatically between the initial growth period and rapid growth period with increases in temperature at the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 2 36 2 60 c 2 30 2 42 c and 2 10 2 50 c respectively less dramatic changes in soil temperature occurred between the rapid growth period to the mid growth period with the least changes between the mid growth period and late growth period there were increases in temperature across the entire growth period at the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 3 00 3 36 c 2 84 3 20 c and 3 19 3 90 c respectively with an amplitude of temperature increase of 2 50 4 0 c 3 5 2 characterization of the soil heat transformation of the oats field for different growth periods the maximum temperatures in 2019 and 2020 occurred in the mid growth period and the rapid growth period respectively the average daily temperatures of 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers were 14 66 c 16 57 c and 15 87 c in 2019 and 14 81 c 16 90 c and 16 20 c in 2020 respectively there were increases in soil temperature from the initial grow period to the rapid grow period at the 0 10 cm 10

the middle to late growth period at the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 0 67 0 96 c 0 68 0 87 c and 0 17 0 9 c respectively there were increases in soil temperature over the entire growth period at the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 1 43 1 75 c 1 18 1 92 c and 0 18 2 5 c respectively 3 5 3 characterization of soil heat transformation of wasteland for different growth periods the maximum soil temperature in 2019 and 2020 occurred in the mid growth stage with average daily temperatures of the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 15 07 15 26 c 15 31 15 63 c and 14 34 14 77 c respectively there were large changes in soil temperature between the initial growth period and rapid growth period with increases in the average daily temperatures of the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 1 55 c 1 84 c and 1 77 c respectively less changes in soil temperature occurred between the rapid growth period and mid growth period however there were slight decreases in soil temperature between the middle and late growth periods at the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 1 34 1 53 c 0 85 1 24 c and 0 44 c respectively there were increases in soil temperature over the entire growth period at the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers of 0 92 0 99 c 1 33 1 40 c and 2 33 2 39 c respectively 4 discussion 4 1 water balance in the highland barley field oat field and wasteland in a typical alpine irrigation district of tibet the results of the present study identified water consumptions of highland barley of 176 196 mm and 138 207 mm during the rapid growth period and mid growth period respectively liu et al 2019 identified the water consumption of highland barley to be 136 22 141 72 mm and 117 66 133 62 mm during the rapid growth period and mid growth period respectively the less water consumption of highland barley identified in the prior study can be attributed to damage to highland barley due to irrigation with cold water which delayed the emergence and tiller of the crop and reduced the effective panicles at the jointing stage root development of highland barley was affected by cumulative cold damage during the early stage which in turn affected the subsequent stages the results of the present study indicated a water consumption of highland barley over the entire growth period of 457 549 mm exceeding that identified by liu et al of 473 7 499 mm this difference could be attributed to irrigation water at a normal temperature being applied in the current study whereas that ion the liu et al study was at a lower temperature of 3 5 and 7 c xu et al 2015 conduced field experiments in lhasa to characterize forage irrigation in high altitude areas of tibet in which the water requirements and water consumption of oats were studied based on simulations of the cropwat model their results showed that the water requirement of oats in lhasa over the entire growth period was 570 mm and water consumption was 464 570 mm under different water conditions the critical oats irrigation period was the early stage of tiller and jointing and they used the cropwat model to determine an optimal irrigation schedule of 2 4 applications the results of the present study based on the simulations of the hydrus model showed that water consumption of oat fields over the entire growth period ranged from 404 mm to 571 mm similar to prior studies the different rainfall patterns contributed to the wide range of water consumption of oat fields and the results of the present and previous studies indicated that an oats field has a range of water consumption of 106 mm to 167 mm the present study irrigated the oats field 2 4 times in accordance with the local irrigation schedule with more detailed information shown in table 2 the present study used to results of a previous study xu et al 2015 to identify the irrigation duration and quantity of the oats field the results indicated that rapid growth stage tillering and joining of oats is a key growth period of oats during which the maximum evapotranspiration water demand occurs ranging from 11 89 cm to 19 05 cm yin et al 2010 analyzed the main characteristics of water transport in a plateau wheat farmland ecosystem based on model simulations in which the farmland in the lower lhasa valley of the qinghai tibet plateau was adopted as a study area their results showed that the maximum water consumption of wheat occurred over the joint filling stage and water was mainly transferred between soil and plant the results of the present study showed that the maximum evapotranspiration of highland barley and oat occurred over the rapid growth stage jointing stage was 9 35 14 82 cm and 11 89 19 05 cm respectively the maximum evapotranspiration of highland barley and wasteland occurred over the mid growth stage was the 10 32 18 70 cm and 15 53 16 35 cm respectively water exchange was more frequent in these two periods water uptake of wheat roots in the lhasa valley tibet was mainly concentrated in the 10 40 cm soil layer total percolation of the wheat field over the entire growth period was 33 1 cm accounting for approximately 50 of the total irrigation quantity total percolation amounts for highland barley oats and wasteland were 30 88 36 61 cm 17 54 36 05 cm and 7 26 28 cm accounting for 42 35 39 and 16 45 of total introduced water respectively highland barley oat and winter wheat showed similar percolation whereas that of wasteland was less since it was not irrigated the percolation rates of highland barley and oats were significantly lower than that of wheat several years of water saving initiatives implemented in the tibet irrigation district resulted in a significant reduction in the percolation rate and the current irrigation quantities of highland barley and oats are half of that of wheat 665 mm yin et al 2009 si et al 2005 determined that the total evapotranspiration of wasteland tamarix ramosissima was approximately 248 mm with an evapotranspiration rate of 1 6 mm d 1 si et al 2005 wang et al 2020 showed that the evapotranspiration et of wasteland ranged from 203 68 to 283 92 mm over the entire growth period wang et al 2020 the results of the present study determined a et of wasteland over the entire growth period of 270 295 mm slightly exceeding those identified by si et al and wang et al tibet is characterized by strong radiation annual solar radiation of 6000 8000 mj m2 and long sunshine hours 3000 h tang et al 2018 and the absolute ultraviolet ray flux in lhasa is 2 3 times of that in low altitude areas at the same latitude in china tang 2021 the water consumption values of highland barley oats and wasteland were 63 61 to 79 and 47 to 75 of total water introduced rainfall irrigation highland barley and oats showed similar ratios of water consumption to total introduced water which could be attributed to their similar growth characteristics and growth period and since both belong to the gramineae family wasteland which is only affected by rainfall consumed less water than highland barley and oats with the proportion of water consumption dependent on fear specific rainfall 4 2 variations in soil temperature in the highland barley field oats field and wasteland in a typical alpine irrigation district of tibet soil temperature is a comprehensive indicator of the soil thermal condition mahmood et al 2012 soil temperature affects the soil environment inselsbacher and nasholm 2012 which in turn affects the growth and development of crops gouranga and ashwani 2007 liu et al 2020 conducted a study on the growth of highland barley and the change in soil temperature under three irrigation water temperatures of 3 c 5 c and 7 c lower than the normal water temperature 7 15 c their results showed that irrigation with cold water reduced the temperatures of the 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm soil layers by 1 41 c and 0 67 c respectively the application of cold irrigation water of 3 c 5 c and 7 c lower than the normal delayed the emergence tiller and maturity of highland barley resulting in deceases in yield of 19 62 38 59 and 42 52 respectively the application of cold irrigation water can reduce the soil temperature in the root zone of highland barley which in turn indirectly affects water uptake and root growth guan et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 showed that the germination potential germination percentage and germination index of highland barley increased with increasing temperature of irrigation water in the range of 10 25 c whereas temperatures exceeding this range would lead to a decline in the seed germination index the results of the present study showed that the average daily temperatures of highland barley in the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layers during the early growth stage seedling stage were 13 3 c 14 2 c and 13 3 c whereas those of oats were 12 3 c 14 0 c and 13 2 c and those of wasteland were 12 75 c 12 06 c and 12 c respectively these temperatures were conducive to the germination and emergence of highland barley oats and natural herbage the largest variation in soil temperature of the highland barley field oat field and wasteland occurred during the rapid growth period during this period there were increases in soil temperature for highland barley at the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 cm 60 cm soil layers of 2 48 c 2 36 c and 2 3 c whereas those for oats were 1 73 c 2 01 c and 2 26 c and those for wasteland were 1 55 c 1 84 c and 1 77 c respectively an optimal growth temperature is critical at this period although soil temperature could meet the requirements for crop growth in the seedling period it was not optimal and an appropriate increase in soil temperature would benefit crop growth between the initial growth period and rapid growth period since highland barley is planted 15 d earlier than oats the increased temperature of highland barley field is higher than that of oat field natural herbage does not experience year round harvesting and is only eaten by livestock therefore there constant presence of herbage vegetation on the soil surface affects the transmission of solar radiation to soil heat resulting in a lower soil warming of wasteland compared to that of oats and highland barley the results of the present study showed that the temperatures of the 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm and 60 cm soil layers showed lag effects the time lag of the 10 cm and 20 cm soil layers was 1 2 h whereas that of the 30 50 cm soil layer was 3 5 h cai et al 2013 identified a time lag of the daily maximum soil temperature at a 5 cm depth of 2 h longer than that identified in previous studies shi 2015 found a gradual decrease in the diurnal variation in soil temperature with increasing of soil depth with virtually no variation at a depth 25 cm the results of the present study showed changes in the temperature peak of each soil layer among the different months with no variation at a soil depth 40 cm linzhou county is a grain production base due to its relatively fertile thick and compact soil shi 2015 identified decreases in soil temperature at the 5 cm 10 cm 15 cm 20 cm 25 cm soil layers of 6 c 7 c 7 c 8 c and 7 c from the heading stage to maturity stage the results of the present study showed that temperature of each soil layer of a highland barley field did not change much during the middle to the later growth period whereas that of the oat field showed slight decreases in the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 cm 60 cm soil layers of 0 67 0 96 c 0 68 0 87 c and 0 17 0 90 c and that of wasteland decreased by 1 34 1 53 c 0 85 1 24 c and 0 44 c respectively the altitude of xigaze prefecture in tibet is 4 200 m 600 mm higher than that of linzhou county lhasa shigaze is more affected by radiation during the day compared to linzhou county its climate is extremely dry the night temperature is low linzhou county has more vegetation and a relatively mild climate comparted to xigaze prefecture and summer humidity is relatively high therefore the changes in soil temperature of linzhou county are smaller than those of xigaze the decrease in soil temperature in wasteland exceeded that in the oat field from the middle to late growth period since a more regular field planting scheme is applied to oats it has a larger planting density and soil coverage compared to wasteland and soil is relatively less affected by radiation resulting in smaller changes to soil temperature 5 conclusions this study applied the hydrus 1d model to study the water heat transport process of the highland barley field oat field and wasteland in the alpine irrigated district of tibet a set of parameters suitable for the water and heat transport were proposed which will contribute to the development of ecological hydrology the maximum increase in soil temperature occurred between the initial growth period and rapid growth period with an average increase at the 0 10 cm 10 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil layer of 2 48 c 2 36 c and 2 3 c for highland barley 1 73 c 2 0 c and 2 26 c for oats and 1 55 c 1 84 c and 1 77 c for wasteland respectively although crop growth during this period was vigorous soil temperature was not optimal the water consumption of highland barley field oat field and wasteland over the entire growth period were 457 549 mm 404 571 mm and 270 295 mm respectively for highland barley field oat field and wasteland soil evaporation accounted for 20 29 20 29 and 10 18 of the introduced water rainfall and irrigation whereas transpiration accounted for 33 43 42 50 and 36 57 and percolation was 30 88 36 61 cm 17 54 36 05 cm and 7 26 28 cm respectively which was good to the management of agricultural water resources and improvement of

2233,the pore structure characteristics and hydraulic properties including saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention curve swrc for granite residual soil under different particle gradation were carried out by high resolution x ray computed tomography ct and pressure plate the relationship between three dimensional pore structure characteristics and hydraulic properties were quantitatively analyzed the results show that the decrease of the average pore throat radius and the ct connected porosity with the particle diameter decreases but the fractal dimension value increases indicating that the soil pore structure became complex the effect on hydraulic properties is the comprehensive effect of soil properties and soil structure adding big particles improved the saturated hydraulic conductivity by increasing the soil pore connectivity and decreasing the fractal dimension in addition the micropore spatial variation and complex pore structure help to increase the water retention capacity keywords soil water retention curve porosity particle gradation pore structure data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction granite residual soil widely distributed throughout guangdong province accounts for 40 of the total surface area of shenzhen city zhao et al 2022 its particle diameter composition pore distribution and mineral composition are subject to different degrees of weathering water infiltration causes granite residual soil to easily collapse and soften and pore structural changes and a reduction in matric suction result in a loss of shear strength which is the main reason for slope instability ground subsidence foundation settlement and environmental disruption liu et al 2022 the rainfall landslide accident in guangming district shenzhen caused heavy losses to people s lives and property zhan et al 2018 however due to the very complex pore particle geometry for granite residual soil a clear expression of the relationship between soil texture and hydraulic properties remains a challenge the effects of the void ratio initial water content initial dry density stress history etc on swrc have long been recognized vanapalli et al 1999 li et al 2019 wen et al 2019 2020 the swrc is essentially a pore size distribution curve della vecchia et al 2011 scanning electron microscopy sem and mercury intrusion porosimetry mip have been widely applied to investigate the pore structure and distribution characteristics of soil but they are limited to 2d analysis x ray computed tomography is a noninvasive scanner imaging technique that provides detailed information about the pore structure wildenschild and sheppard 2013 singh et al 2021 gao et al 2019 studied the water wet microporosity by using x ray microtomography and found that it provides additional connectivity to the water phases ct can quantitatively analyze the porosity and connectivity of soil and the spatial distribution of pores which is essential for understanding the influence of pore characteristics on soil water movement périard et al 2016 however the effect of pore structure on the hydraulic properties has not been studied in depth and less attention has been given to the analysis of three dimensional images the purpose of this study was to explore the effect of particle gradations on pore structure and hydraulic properties of packed granite residual soil and clarify the relationship between three dimensional pore structure characteristics and hydraulic properties 2 2 materials and tests 2 1 soil specimens the packed granite residual soil used in this study was taken from a deep excavation in shenzhen city china the chemical composition of granite residual soil is mainly sio2 al2o3 and fe2o3 accounting for 85 of the total 2 2 experimental design firstly an appropriate amount of tested soil was placed in the oven baked for 24 h and fully crushed all soil particles are sieved by vibrating screen machine and three different particle gradations of specimens s1 maximum particle diameter 1 25 mm s2 maximum particle diameter 0 75 mm and s3 maximum particle diameter 0 075 mm were screened the property parameters and grain diameter distribution of the tested soils is given in table 1 and fig 1 the coefficient of nonuniformity cu and coefficient of curvature cc can be used to quantitatively index the particle size distribution 1 c u d 60 d 10 2 c c d 30 d 30 d 10 d 60 secondly the soil was taken according to dry density 1 45 g cm3 the dry soil was humidified with distilled water to obtain a water content of 11 5 and they were well mixed by blender then the compaction tests were carried out on the granite residual soil according to astm d1557 2009 and the packed soil specimens with a diameter of 20 mm and a height of 30 mm finally the specimens were saturated with distilled water after vacuum seeding for approximately 2 h and submerged for approximately 24 h the following experiments were conducted fig 2 in addition comparative tests were conducted each swrc test has three specimens due to the complexity of testing the swrc and the need to ensure the integrity of the specimen all testes including saturated hydraulic conductivity test and the ct scanning test must be completed under one same specimen a total of 9 complete specimens were measured 2 3 saturated hydraulic conductivity tests the hydraulic conductivity of the residual soil was measured by conducting the falling head test wen et al 2022 the value of k can be measured 3 k al a δ t ln δ h 1 δ h 2 where a m2 and a m2 are the cross sectional area of the water pipe and the specimen l m is the height of specimen and δ h 1 m and δ h 2 m are the height of the head change in different time periods δ t s 2 4 swrc tests the specimen was put in the pressure plate instrument and subjected to a drying test by increasing the matric suction step by step 1 10 20 50 100 200 400 kpa according to astm d6836 16 then the swrc is obtained and expressed as van genuchten 1980 4 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n 1 1 n 5 ψ air e n t r y 1 α where θ s and θ r is the saturated and residual volumetric water content respectively ψ kpa is the matric suction α n are curve parameters 2 5 ct scanning tests after each scan 1104 grayscale ct images 1024 1024 with a spatial resolution of 20 μm were obtained the median filter and grey intensity were used to separate the pore space and solid images singh et al 2021 wu et al 2019 in which the threshold value of each pixel in the image was calculated based on the mean and standard deviation of gray values of neighboring pixels by matlab the pixels with gray values lower than the threshold value were identified as pores the pore distribution analysis and image processing as shown in fig 3 the 3d connectivity algorithm was applied in the image processing to obtain the connected pore space haralick et al 1987 gerke et al 2018 after subtracting the connected pore space from all pore spaces the isolated pore space could be obtained wen et al 2022 in addition the ct images were used to extract an equivalent network with topological pores and throats using maximal ball method dong and blunt 2009 gerke et al 2020 the adjacent solid was defined as a void ball and the pores and throats were defined based on their diameters and ranks during the clustering process and the saturated hydraulic conductivity of pore network can be expressed and calculated using darcy s law zhang et al 2020 2 6 chemical and microstructural tests the scanning electron microscopy sem test is conducted on the upper surface of the specimens s1 s2 and s3 to see the spatial distribution of particles and pores after that the specimen was ground into powder and the x ray diffraction xrd test is conducted to analyze its chemical composition 2 7 statistical analysis the general linear model and the pearson s coefficient r was used to determine the correlation between soil pore structure parameters and soil hydraulic properties the standard deviation s is also calculated in descriptive statistics 6 r i 1 n x x y y i 1 n x x 2 i 1 n y y 2 7 s 1 n i 1 n x x 2 where n is the specimen number x i y i and x y are the observed values and mean values of the two variables respectively 3 results 3 1 3d pore characteristics as the particle diameter decreases the connected pore space gradually decreases while the isolated pore space increases as shown in fig 4 this shows that the smaller the particle size the smaller the pore size the pore size becomes smaller with the particle size decreases the number of large pores decreases and the number of small pores increases in fig 4 fig 5 shows the porosity of three pore types for the same density specimens the proportion of isolated pores of s1 in the ct image is less than that in the s3 image numerically speaking the pore porosities of the s1 s2 and s3 images are 15 8 11 and 8 2 respectively it can be seen that the larger the particle diameter gradation is the more pores are observed under the same ct scanning accuracy and the same dry density similarly the isolated porosity decreases with increasing particle gradation which is 3 13 2 66 and 0 56 for s1 s2 and s3 respectively the connectivity of the soil pores mainly depends on the proportion of small particles and more small particles effectively block the pore connectivity the isolated pore space represents the water holding characteristics of the soil the coefficient of nonuniformity and coefficient of curvature affected the shape and distribution of tested soil pores the larger the slope of the grain diameter distribution curve the smaller the coefficient of curvature the more concentrated the particle size distribution and the more uniform the pore size the average pore throat radius and connected porosity were smaller with the coefficient of curvature reduces table 2 but there is a very significant negative correlation between particle fractal dimension and particle diameter 3 2 pore network properties the sphere represents the pores in fig 6 and the connecting channel between the two pores is the pore throat the distribution of connected pores is clearly observed fig 7 demonstrates variations in the throat pore radius distribution within the pore network from fig 6 s1 s2 and s3 have similar trend of throat radius distribution frequency diagram and their throat radius is mainly concentrated in the range of 70 μm it is obvious that the throat radius 90 μm accounts of s1 is much more than that of s2 and s3 s3 has almost no large throat which is directly related to the pore radius fig 7b representsthat the peak pore radius distribution of s3 at 175 μm and the pore radius mainly concentrates in 125 225 μm furthermore the frequency of larger pore radius distribution increases with the increase of the maximum particle diameter the peak pore radius distribution of s1 and s2 shift to the right in turn the peak pore radius distribution of s1 at 275 μm and the frequency of larger pore radius 325 μm distribution is also very large 3 3 hydraulic properties 3 3 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity the k s value had a significant increasing trend with increasing connected porosity in fig 8 and the predicted data based on pore network model is very close to the measured ones it can be proved that the selected subvolume of ct images is representative the larger the particle composition the greater the hydraulic conductivity it is mainly due to the pore connectivity and the pores throats radius become smaller with decreasing particle diameter as shown in figs 6 and 7 3 3 2 measured swrc the measured and fitted swrc for s1 s2 and s3 are shown in fig 9 and table 3 respectively the s3 had higher volumetric water content and θ s values table 3 what s more as the particle diameter increased the volumetric water content significantly decreased the θ s value which had an decreasing trend θ s value of s3 was higher than that of s1 and s2 table 3 the larger the particle diameter are the more obvious the change in the swrc it is consistent with the the frequency of throats pores distribution in fig 7 in addition the average throat radius of s1 s2 and s3 are 50 951 μm 46 6 μm and 35 86 μm table 2 respectively corresponding to the change in the swrc slope from large to small for s1 s2 and s3 it is consistent with the the frequency of throats distribution in fig 7a the air entry value can be clearly seen in table 3 the results show that the air entry value of s1 is the smallest and that of s2 is the second smallest in contrast s3 lacked connectivity in pores and exhibited significantly lower soil porosity with a smaller particle diameter and it had better water retention characteristics it is consistent with the the frequency of pores distribution in fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 pore structure characteristics with different particle diameter s1 s2 and s3 are the tested soil specimens obtained by screening different particles from a same granite residual soil and their chemical compositions are different as shown in fig 10 the chemical compositions of s1 and s2 are similar including quart kaolinite muscovite and nacrite but the proportion of quart is relatively high the chemical composition of s3 is quite different it is mainly composed of quart and kaolinite and the proportion of kaolinite is high furthermore some small clay particles are attached to the surface of large particles in fig 11 a and fill the pores between large particles but most of the pores is generated around the large particles the structural morphology of s2 in fig 11b is similar to that of s1 but the contact between particles is more compact and it has many small pores the sand particles are small and difficult to distinguish in fig 11c the clay particles completely wrap the sand particles and then contact each other resulting in a small pore radius and the highest compactness it can be concluded that the chemical composition could be affect their pore structure and skeleton structure including the position and contact state between soil particles wen et al 2022 it also can be seen from ct slices of s1 that some small particles are randomly distributed between large particles in fig 12 the macropores are mainly formed around large particles and some small pores are also formed between small particles moreover the fd value was larger in the small particle soil indicating that the small pores increased and the soil pore structure became complex which was consistent with the research reported in wang et al 2019 the particle size distribution parameters cu and cc had significant positive correlations with soil pore structure parameters such as apr conn and ctp table 4 which indicated that it is feasible to analyze soil pore structure by the particle size distribution parameters the excessive small particle caused the decrease of the average pore radius and the ct connected porosity this may be because small particle filled pores that were larger than itself and the large amount of small particle would block soil pores blanco and humberto 2017 wen et al 2021 therefore the volume of small pores increased and the sizes of macropores decreased with the particle diameter decreases kumar et al 2019 the soil pore space became complex 4 2 underlying mechanism of pore structure on hydraulic properties according to table 4 and fig 8 the positive correlation between the ctp value and the ks value indicated that adding big particles cc and apr value increases improved the ks by increasing the soil pore connectivity sandin et al 2017 the saturated hydraulic conductivity is positively correlated with cu and cc and negatively correlated with fd it show that the difference in their chemical composition see fig 10 and the location and contact state between soil particles see figs 11 and 12 will greatly affect their pore structure which is mainly reflected in the distribution of throat pore radius resulting in great changes in pore connectivity mady and shein 2020 it indicated that the effect on ks is the comprehensive effect of soil properties and soil structure chen et al 2019 sun et al 2021 fan et al 2021 also found that the pore volume distribution tend to increase with particle diameter and it is the key factor affecting the permeability of calcareous sand with different particle diameter the larger specific surface area high clay content and low sand contributed to the improvement in θ s and water content it has a positive effect on water retention mollinedo et al 2015 the θ s value increased with increasing fd value which means that the strong pore spatial variation and complex pore structure help to conserve water according to tables 2 and 4 the α value increased with increasing apr atr acn conn value but decreased with increasing fd this is consistent with the results observed by manahiloh and meehan 2017 they found that the amount of air that entered the soil was determined by the largest pore the positive correlation between the n value and cc apr ctp value indicates that the greater the pore connectivity is the faster the pore water will be discharged the average coordination number represents the connectivity of the pore network which is an effective way to seepage davudov and moghanloo 2018 5 conclusion three dimensional pore structure characteristics of granite residual soil and their relationship with hydraulic properties under different particle gradation were studied based on x ray computed tomography the pore structure parameters and hydraulic properties were quantitatively analyzed the following conclusions were derived 1 the volume of small pores increased and the sizes of macropores decreased with the particle diameter decreases it caused the decrease of the average pore throat radius and the ct connected porosity but the fractal dimension value increases indicating that the soil pore structure became complex 2 adding big particles cu and cc value increases improved the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks by increasing the soil pore connectivity and decreasing the fractal dimension it indicated that the effect on ks is the comprehensive effect of soil properties and soil structure 3 the θ s value increased with increasing fd value as the micropores increased the α n value is positively correlated with cc apr ctp value but negatively correlated with fd the micropore spatial variation and complex pore structure help to increase the water retention

properties of packed granite residual soil and clarify the relationship between three dimensional pore structure characteristics and hydraulic properties 2 2 materials and tests 2 1 soil specimens the packed granite residual soil used in this study was taken from a deep excavation in shenzhen city china the chemical composition of granite residual soil is mainly sio2 al2o3 and fe2o3 accounting for 85 of the total 2 2 experimental design firstly an appropriate amount of tested soil was placed in the oven baked for 24 h and fully crushed all soil particles are sieved by vibrating screen machine and three different particle gradations of specimens s1 maximum particle diameter 1 25 mm s2 maximum particle diameter 0 75 mm and s3 maximum particle diameter 0 075 mm were screened the property parameters and grain diameter distribution of the tested soils is given in table 1 and fig 1 the coefficient of nonuniformity cu and coefficient of curvature cc can be used to quantitatively index the particle size distribution 1 c u d 60 d 10 2 c c d 30 d 30 d 10 d 60 secondly the soil was taken according to dry density 1 45 g cm3 the dry soil was humidified with distilled water to obtain a water content of 11 5 and they were well mixed by blender then the compaction tests were carried out on the granite residual soil according to astm d1557 2009 and the packed soil specimens with a diameter of 20 mm and a height of 30 mm finally the specimens were saturated with distilled water after vacuum seeding for approximately 2 h and submerged for approximately 24 h the following experiments were conducted fig 2 in addition comparative tests were conducted each swrc test has three specimens due to the complexity of testing the swrc and the need to ensure the integrity of the specimen all testes including saturated hydraulic conductivity test and the ct scanning test must be completed under one same specimen a total of 9 complete specimens were measured 2 3 saturated hydraulic conductivity tests the hydraulic conductivity of the residual soil was measured by conducting the falling head test wen et al 2022 the value of k can be measured 3 k al a δ t ln δ h 1 δ h 2 where a m2 and a m2 are the cross sectional area of the water pipe and the specimen l m is the height of specimen and δ h 1 m and δ h 2 m are the height of the head change in different time periods δ t s 2 4 swrc tests the specimen was put in the pressure plate instrument and subjected to a drying test by increasing the matric suction step by step 1 10 20 50 100 200 400 kpa according to astm d6836 16 then the swrc is obtained and expressed as van genuchten 1980 4 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n 1 1 n 5 ψ air e n t r y 1 α where θ s and θ r is the saturated and residual volumetric water content respectively ψ kpa is the matric suction α n are curve parameters 2 5 ct scanning tests after each scan 1104 grayscale ct images 1024 1024 with a spatial resolution of 20 μm were obtained the median filter and grey intensity were used to separate the pore space and solid images singh et al 2021 wu et al 2019 in which the threshold value of each pixel in the image was calculated based on the mean and standard deviation of gray values of neighboring pixels by matlab the pixels with gray values lower than the threshold value were identified as pores the pore distribution analysis and image processing as shown in fig 3 the 3d connectivity algorithm was applied in the image processing to obtain the connected pore space haralick et al 1987 gerke et al 2018 after subtracting the connected pore space from all pore spaces the isolated pore space could be obtained wen et al 2022 in addition the ct images were used to extract an equivalent network with topological pores and throats using maximal ball method dong and blunt 2009 gerke et al 2020 the adjacent solid was defined as a void ball and the pores and throats were defined based on their diameters and ranks during the clustering process and the saturated hydraulic conductivity of pore network can be expressed and calculated using darcy s law zhang et al 2020 2 6 chemical and microstructural tests the scanning electron microscopy sem test is conducted on the upper surface of the specimens s1 s2 and s3 to see the spatial distribution of particles and pores after that the specimen was ground into powder and the x ray diffraction xrd test is conducted to analyze its chemical composition 2 7 statistical analysis the general linear model and the pearson s coefficient r was used to determine the correlation between soil pore structure parameters and soil hydraulic properties the standard deviation s is also calculated in descriptive statistics 6 r i 1 n x x y y i 1 n x x 2 i 1 n y y 2 7 s 1 n i 1 n x x 2 where n is the specimen number x i y i and x y are the observed values and mean values of the two variables respectively 3 results 3 1 3d pore characteristics as the particle diameter decreases the connected pore space gradually decreases while the isolated pore space increases as shown in fig 4 this shows that the smaller the particle size the smaller the pore size the pore size becomes smaller with the particle size decreases the number of large pores decreases and the number of small pores increases in fig 4 fig 5 shows the porosity of three pore types for the same density specimens the proportion of isolated pores of s1 in the ct image is less than that in the s3 image numerically speaking the pore porosities of the s1 s2 and s3 images are 15 8 11 and 8 2 respectively it can be seen that the larger the particle diameter gradation is the more pores are observed under the same ct scanning accuracy and the same dry density similarly the isolated porosity decreases with increasing particle gradation which is 3 13 2 66 and 0 56 for s1 s2 and s3 respectively the connectivity of the soil pores mainly depends on the proportion of small particles and more small particles effectively block the pore connectivity the isolated pore space represents the water holding characteristics of the soil the coefficient of nonuniformity and coefficient of curvature affected the shape and distribution of tested soil pores the larger the slope of the grain diameter distribution curve the smaller the coefficient of curvature the more concentrated the particle size distribution and the more uniform the pore size the average pore throat radius and connected porosity were smaller with the coefficient of curvature reduces table 2 but there is a very significant negative correlation between particle fractal dimension and particle diameter 3 2 pore network properties the sphere represents the pores in fig 6 and the connecting channel between the two pores is the pore throat the distribution of connected pores is clearly observed fig 7 demonstrates variations in the throat pore radius distribution within the pore network from fig 6 s1 s2 and s3 have similar trend of throat radius distribution frequency diagram and their throat radius is mainly concentrated in the range of 70 μm it is obvious that the throat radius 90 μm accounts of s1 is much more than that of s2 and s3 s3 has almost no large throat which is directly related to the pore radius fig 7b representsthat the peak pore radius distribution of s3 at 175 μm and the pore radius mainly concentrates in 125 225 μm furthermore the frequency of larger pore radius distribution increases with the increase of the maximum particle diameter the peak pore radius distribution of s1 and s2 shift to the right in turn the peak pore radius distribution of s1 at 275 μm and the frequency of larger pore radius 325 μm distribution is also very large 3 3 hydraulic properties 3 3 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity the k s value had a significant increasing trend with increasing connected porosity in fig 8 and the predicted data based on pore network model is very close to the measured ones it can be proved that the selected subvolume of ct images is representative the larger the particle composition the greater the hydraulic conductivity it is mainly due to the pore connectivity and the pores throats radius become smaller with decreasing particle diameter as shown in figs 6 and 7 3 3 2 measured swrc the measured and fitted swrc for s1 s2 and s3 are shown in fig 9 and table 3 respectively the s3 had higher volumetric water content and θ s values table 3 what s more as the particle diameter increased the volumetric water content significantly decreased the θ s value which had an decreasing trend θ s value of s3 was higher than that of s1 and s2 table 3 the larger the particle diameter are the more obvious the change in the swrc it is consistent with the the frequency of throats pores distribution in fig 7 in addition the average throat radius of s1 s2 and s3 are 50 951 μm 46 6 μm and 35 86 μm table 2 respectively corresponding to the change in the swrc slope from large to small for s1 s2 and s3 it is consistent with the the frequency of throats distribution in fig 7a the air entry value can be clearly seen in table 3 the results show that the air entry value of s1 is the smallest and that of s2 is the second smallest in contrast s3 lacked connectivity in pores and exhibited significantly lower soil porosity with a smaller particle diameter and it had better water retention characteristics it is consistent with the the frequency of pores distribution in fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 pore structure characteristics with different particle diameter s1 s2 and s3 are the tested soil specimens obtained by screening different particles from a same granite residual soil and their chemical compositions are different as shown in fig 10 the chemical compositions of s1 and s2 are similar including quart kaolinite muscovite and nacrite but the proportion of quart is relatively high the chemical composition of s3 is quite different it is mainly composed of quart and kaolinite and the proportion of kaolinite is high furthermore some small clay particles are attached to the surface of large particles in fig 11 a and fill the pores between large particles but most of the pores is generated around the large particles the structural morphology of s2 in fig 11b is similar to that of s1 but the contact between particles is more compact and it has many small pores the sand particles are small and difficult to distinguish in fig 11c the clay particles completely wrap the sand particles and then contact each other resulting in a small pore radius and the highest compactness it can be concluded that the chemical composition could be affect their pore structure and skeleton structure including the position and contact state between soil particles wen et al 2022 it also can be seen from ct slices of s1 that some small particles are randomly distributed between large particles in fig 12 the macropores are mainly formed around large particles and some small pores are also formed between small particles moreover the fd value was larger in the small particle soil indicating that the small pores increased and the soil pore structure became complex which was consistent with the research reported in wang et al 2019 the particle size distribution parameters cu and cc had significant positive correlations with soil pore structure parameters such as apr conn and ctp table 4 which indicated that it is feasible to analyze soil pore structure by the particle size distribution parameters the excessive small particle caused the decrease of the average pore radius and the ct connected porosity this may be because small particle filled pores that were larger than itself and the large amount of small particle would block soil pores blanco and humberto 2017 wen et al 2021 therefore the volume of small pores increased and the sizes of macropores decreased with the particle diameter decreases kumar et al 2019 the soil pore space became complex 4 2 underlying mechanism of pore structure on hydraulic properties according to table 4 and fig 8 the positive correlation between the ctp value and the ks value indicated that adding big particles cc and apr value increases improved the ks by increasing the soil pore connectivity sandin et al 2017 the saturated hydraulic conductivity is positively correlated with cu and cc and negatively correlated with fd it show that the difference in their chemical composition see fig 10 and the location and contact state between soil particles see figs 11 and 12 will greatly affect their pore structure which is mainly reflected in the distribution of throat pore radius resulting in great changes in pore connectivity mady and shein 2020 it indicated that the effect on ks is the comprehensive effect of soil properties and soil structure chen et al 2019 sun et al 2021 fan et al 2021 also found that the pore volume distribution tend to increase with particle diameter and it is the key factor affecting the permeability of calcareous sand with different particle diameter the larger specific surface area high clay content and low sand contributed to the improvement in θ s and water content it has a positive effect on water retention mollinedo et al 2015 the θ s value increased with increasing fd value which means that the strong pore spatial variation and complex pore structure help to conserve water according to tables 2 and 4 the α value increased with increasing apr atr acn conn value but decreased with increasing fd this is consistent with the results observed by manahiloh and meehan 2017 they found that the amount of air that entered the soil was determined by the largest pore the positive correlation between the n value and cc apr ctp value indicates that the greater the pore connectivity is the faster the pore water will be discharged the average coordination number represents the connectivity of the pore network which is an effective way to seepage davudov and moghanloo 2018 5 conclusion three dimensional pore structure characteristics of granite residual soil and their relationship with hydraulic properties under different particle gradation were studied based on x ray computed tomography the pore structure parameters and hydraulic properties were quantitatively analyzed the following conclusions were derived 1 the volume of small pores increased and the sizes of macropores decreased with the particle diameter decreases it caused the decrease of the average pore throat radius and the ct connected porosity but the fractal dimension value increases indicating that the soil pore structure became complex 2 adding big particles cu and cc value increases improved the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks by increasing the soil pore connectivity and decreasing the fractal dimension it indicated that the effect on ks is the comprehensive effect of soil properties and soil structure 3 the θ s value increased with increasing fd value as the micropores increased the α n value is positively correlated with cc apr ctp value but negatively correlated with fd the micropore spatial variation and complex pore structure help to increase the water retention

2234,the arkansas river and its tributaries provide critical water resources for agricultural irrigation hydropower generation and public water supply in the arkansas river basin arb however climate change and other environmental factors have imposed significant impacts on regional hydrological processes resulting in widespread ecological and economic consequences in this study we projected future river flow patterns in the 21st century across the entire arb under two climate and socio economic change scenarios i e ssp2 rcp45 and ssp5 rcp85 using the process based dynamic land ecosystem model dlem we designed baseline simulations all driving factors were kept constant at the level circa 2000 and environmental change simulations at least one driving factor changed over time during 2001 2099 to simulate the inter annual variations of river flow and quantify the contributions of four driving factors i e climate change co2 concentration atmospheric nitrogen deposition and land use change results showed that the arkansas river flow in 2080 2099 would decrease by 12 1 in the ssp2 rcp45 and 27 9 in the ssp5 rcp85 compared to that during 2000 2019 river flow decline would occur from the beginning to the middle of this century in the ssp2 rcp45 and happen throughout the entire century in the ssp5 rcp85 all major rivers in the arb would experience river flow decline with the largest percentage reduction in the western and southwestern arb warming and drying climates would account for 77 95 of the reduction the rising co2 concentration would exacerbate the decline through increasing foliage area and ecosystem evapotranspiration this study provides insight into the spatial patterns of future changes in water availability in the arb and the underlying mechanisms controlling these changes this information is critical for designing watershed specific management strategies to maintain regional water resource sustainability and mitigate the adverse impacts of climate changes on water availability keywords climate change hydrological modeling droughts surface runoff great plains evapotranspiration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the arkansas river is one of the major tributaries of the mississippi river originating in the rocky mountains in new mexico and colorado flowing through the plains and highlands in kansas and oklahoma and finally joining the mississippi river in arkansas the arkansas river basin arb is the largest river basin in the southern great plains spanning a large diversity of climate terrain and vegetation river flow in the arkansas river and its tributaries provide critical water resources for agricultural irrigation hydropower generation and public water supply and provide habitats for several endangered aquatic species however as a prevalent land disturbance in the arb basara et al 2013 droughts disrupt the normal hydrological processes reduce water availability in rivers and lakes and cause widespread ecological consequences and agricultural and economic losses seager et al 2013 many rivers in the arb flow across the boundary of multiple states which requires interstate stream compacts to apportion the waters and resolve conflicts between states schlager and heikkila 2009 in the arb the surface water in rivers and lakes is an essential source for agriculture irrigation and public water supply diversion facilities were constructed in colorado between avondale and la junta to remove water from the arkansas river for irrigation use and substantially decreased streamflow gates et al 2016 ortiz et al 1998 in oklahoma daily surface water withdrawals reached 989 million gallons in 2005 32 of which was used for cropland irrigation tortorelli 2009 additionally a number of important u s cities reside along the arkansas river and its tributaries including oklahoma city and tulsa in oklahoma little rock in arkansas wichita in kansas and pueblo in colorado with the increasing urban population surface water has become the primary public water supply source in the eastern arb in kansas surface water represented 52 61 of the total annual withdrawals for public supply during 1990 2012 kenny 2014 in oklahoma 41 of the surface water withdrawals have been used as public water supply additionally the arkansas river and its tributaries provide critical habitats for multiple endangered aquatic species for example the arkansas river shinner is endemic to the arkansas river system but its abundance and living extent started to shrink in the 1970s pigg 1999 the southern great plains and the arb are prone to various types of droughts multiyear droughts seasonal droughts and flash droughts with severe consequences to regional water availability crop production and livestock health livneh and hoerling 2016 the southern great plains has experienced a number of multiyear droughts such as the droughts in the 1930s and the 1950s when sea surface temperatures in the tropics were lower than normal schubert et al 2004 seasonal droughts were prevalent in the arb in the 20th century and the early 21st century and will likely become more frequent and severe after the 2050s along with climate warming and drying liu et al 2013a over recent years flash droughts at the sub seasonal timescale have been intensively investigated in the u s e g basara et al 2019 chen et al 2019 christian et al 2019 the arb and the central great plains have been identified as hot spots with the most intense flash droughts such as the great plain drought in 2011 christian et al 2019 these drought events decreased river flow and surface water storage for example the water level in lake thunderbird in central oklahoma was 7 feet about 2 1 m below the recommended conservation pool during the 2011 2012 drought threatening the drinking water supply in the three metropolitan areas of midwest city del city and norman another drastic example is lake meredith on the canadian river which historically was a major source of drinking water for cities in the texas panhandle by 2012 however the lake level has dropped to the point that no water was delivered to these cities cepeda 2016 additionally some reaches of the arkansas river such as that between dodge city and garden city in kansas were once perennial but completely dry over recent decades due to the limited water resources over a large portion of the arb disputes regarding river water apportionment have long been common between neighboring states clemons 2003 for example water conflicts between kansas and colorado over the apportionment of arkansas river flows happened multiple times since the early 20th century from 1950 to 1985 colorado intercepted 328 000 acre feet of arkansas river water that was supposed to flow to kansas naeser and bennett 1998 kansas sued colorado in the u s supreme court that colorado deprived kansas of its accustomed flow of the arkansas river to manage and apportion the waters in the arkansas river and its major tributaries many interstate stream compacts have been approved by the united states congress and enacted in federal statutes and the statutes of each agreeing state schlager and heikkila 2009 to design better strategies for surface water allocation information regarding future river flow is urgently needed by the states in the arb climate change has affected and will continue altering river hydrological regimes and endanger water resource sustainability at the regional and global scales seager et al 2013 van vliet et al 2013 quantitative information about future river flow under climate change and water use scenarios is of particular importance for water risk assessment nohara et al 2006 and designing proactive intervention water management strategies palmer et al 2008 future climate change will likely worsen water shortages in the arb by enhancing water demand while reducing water supply changed precipitation regimes will affect soil moisture conditions and runoff generation seager et al 2013 climate warming will likely increase ecosystem evapotranspiration and in turn drive up irrigation water requirements and public water use yang et al 2019a additionally ecosystem evapotranspiration and river flow can be affected by many other environmental factors for example tao et al 2014 reported that under the high emission scenarios human induced rising co2 concentration and land use change would play a more important role than climate change in shaping the river discharge of the mississippi river in contrast piao et al 2007 found that climate change and cropland expansion had a larger impact than the rising co2 concentrations in determining river flow trend one critical pattern of land cover change in the arb is woody plant encroachment in the grasslands which has been found to affect runoff generation and groundwater recharge acharya et al 2018 qiao et al 2017 it can be concluded that an accurate simulation of future river flow needs to consider the impacts of climate change as well as other human caused environmental changes although future river flow has been projected in many basins in the u s and across the world under climate change scenarios e g lauri et al 2012 seager et al 2013 tao et al 2014 we lack an in depth understanding of future river flow patterns in the arb and the southern great plains which is limiting our ability to design water use and management strategies to sustain regional water resource availability in this study we aimed at answering the following two questions 1 how much would river flow change over different parts of the arb in the middle and at the end of the 21st century 2 what are the major environmental factors controlling future river flow changes to answer these two questions we compiled and analyzed future projections of climate conditions and other environmental factors from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 and phase 6 cmip5 and cmip6 and used these compiled future environmental factors to drive the process based dynamic land ecosystem model dlem tian et al 2011 we designed baseline simulations all driving factors were kept constant at the level circa 2000 and environmental change simulations at least one driving factor changed over time during 2001 2099 to simulate the inter annual variations of river flow in the arb and quantify the contributions of four driving factors i e climate change co2 concentration atmospheric nitrogen deposition and land use change contrasting to previous river flow modeling studies that report river flow at one or multiple river outlets our work presented the spatial pattern of future river flow of all major river channels in the arb which is critical for designing water management strategies at the local state and basin levels 2 data and methods 2 1 study domain our study domain is the arkansas river basin fig 1 which has a total land area of 0 41 million km2 and covers parts of 7 states colorado new mexico kansas oklahoma texas missouri and arkansas and 16 epa level iii ecoregions fig s1 we delineated the arb boundary based on the hydro1k digital elevation model dem data using hydrological analysis tools in arcgis 10 8 we identified the major river channels fig 1 from the hydro1k dem by calculating flow accumulation area and then selecting grids with flow accumulation area 16 000 km2 topography presents significant spatial variations in the east west direction fig s2 the ecoregion of the mississippi alluvial plain in arkansas see its location in fig s1 has the lowest elevation mean 61 m while the ecoregion of the southern rockies in colorado and new mexico has the highest elevation mean 2636 m according to the gridmet climate data abatzoglou 2013 arb had an average annual temperature of 8 4 c during 1991 2020 with the highest temperature of 12 2 c in the ecoregion of the mississippi alluvial plain and the lowest temperature of 1 2 c in the ecoregion of the southern rockies fig s3 july was the warmest month 20 7 2 8 c mean 1 std dev same hereafter and january was the coldest month 3 6 2 1 c fig s4 during the last 30 years regional average precipitation was 732 mm year with a distinct declining pattern from east to west may was the month with the highest precipitation 94 7 56 3 mm month and january was the month with the lowest precipitation 28 4 27 9 mm month fig s4 the average potential evapotranspiration was 1490 mm year for the arb potential evapotranspiration was the highest in the southwestern arb 1700 mm year as an indicator of aridity conditions the aridity index ai the ratio of long term precipitation to long term potential evapotranspiration middleton and thomas 1998 was 0 49 in the arb with a large spatial variation from less than 0 3 in the arid west to 1 0 in the humid east the dryland area ai less than 0 65 accounted for 69 7 of the arb and the humid area ai 0 65 accounted for the remaining 31 3 as shown by the national land cover database 2019 fig 1 homer et al 2020 grassland and pasture are the dominant land use and land cover types accounting for 42 5 of the entire arb land area forest and shrub are the second and third largest natural vegetation types representing 14 7 and 13 2 of the arb land area respectively deciduous forests are primarily distributed in the eastern ecoregions such as the cross timbers the boston mountains the arkansas valley and the ozark highlands see their locations in fig s1 evergreen forests are prevalent in the ecoregion of the southern rockies in the west croplands account for 22 5 of the arb land area mostly occurring in the ecoregions of the high plains the central great plains and the mississippi alluvial plain 2 2 model description and experimental design in this study we first evaluated the performance of dynamic land ecosystem model dlem in simulating evapotranspiration and river flow in the arb against usgs measurement and satellite based evapotranspiration products after model evaluation and validation we ran the validated dlem to simulate the annual river flow from 2001 to 2099 in six model simulation scenarios model driving forces included climate change co2 concentration atmospheric nitrogen deposition and land use change fig 2 2 2 1 dynamic land ecosystem model dlem is a process based ecosystem model for simulating ecosystem water carbon and nitrogen processes at the site regional and global scales liu et al 2013b tian et al 2011 yao et al 2020 the terrestrial processes include five major components including biophysical biogeochemical hydrological vegetation dynamics and land use processes tian et al 2010 in the arb dlem includes seven major plant functional types pfts to represent the distribution of natural vegetation which are temperate broadleaf deciduous forest temperate needleleaf evergreen forest evergreen shrub deciduous shrub c3 grass c4 grass and wetland in each grid dlem uses a cohort structure to represent land cover types with a maximum of four natural vegetation pfts and one crop type liu et al 2013b natural and anthropogenic land disturbances such as wildfires forest harvesting and herbivore grazing have been explicitly represented enabling dlem to simulate the impacts of anthropogenic and natural disturbances on ecosystem carbon and water dynamics chen et al 2013 dangal et al 2017 yang et al 2015a dlem also has the capability to evaluate land use change and land management practices such as fertilizer application and timber harvest on the terrestrial and aquatic processes lu et al 2020 pan et al 2021 ren et al 2016 tian et al 2020 yang et al 2015b the aquatic module in dlem simulates sub grid level hydrological processes as well as water nutrient and sediment transport between grids through river networks down to the ocean it is unique in the incorporation of various environmental drivers simultaneous simulations of terrestrial water carbon nitrogen dynamics land to atmosphere gas and water exchanges and land to aquatic mass flows tian et al 2020 yao et al 2020 text s1 provides a brief description of dlem algorithms to estimate et runoff baseflow and water movement along the river network the detailed description can be found in our previous publications liu et al 2013b pan et al 2015 yang et al 2015b yao et al 2020 2 2 2 model input datasets in this study we prepared model input datasets at a spatial resolution of 4 km which is the highest resolution for the downscaled cmip5 future climate data in the arb the static model input variables included soil properties topography and river network we obtained soil property data from the gridded harmonized world soil database hwsd v1 2 wieder 2014 including soil texture ph value and bulk density next we used the arc hydro tools in arcgis djokic et al 2011 to fill sinks in the hydro1k dem data calculate flow direction and accumulation area determine river channels and delineate basin boundary time varying model inputs include daily climate conditions co2 concentration atmospheric nitrogen deposition and annual cropland distribution climate data daily average maximum minimum air temperature precipitation and solar radiation were from two data sources i e the 4 km gridmet climate data from 1979 to 2021 abatzoglou 2013 and downscaled general circulation model gcm outputs in the cmip5 project over the historical period 1980 2005 and future period 2006 2099 in two representative concentration pathways with medium and high greenhouse gas concentrations i e rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios taylor et al 2012 we used cmip5 climate data from seven gcms which are bcc csm1 ccsm4 gfdl esm2g hadgem2 es365 ipsl cm5a lr miroc5 and noresm1 m these data have been downscaled to a spatial resolution of 4 km and bias has been corrected according to the gridmet historical climate data using the multivariate adaptive constructed analogs maca abatzoglou and brown 2012 it is noteworthy that we used the downscaled climate data from the cmip5 rather than the cmip6 although downscaled cmip6 climate data are available such as the nex gddp cmip6 thrasher and nemani 2021 this is because the spatial resolution of current cmip6 downscaled climate data such as 0 25 latitude longitude for the nex gddp cmip6 is not high enough to meet our requirement for hydrological simulations in the arb annual co2 concentration data between 1979 and 2020 were from the noaa global monitoring laboratory and future co2 concentration data in the rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios were obtained from the rcp database version 2 0 the atmospheric nitrogen deposition data nhx and noy 0 5 latitude longitude in the historical and future periods were from the ncar chemistry climate model initiative ccmi which has been used in the global n2o model intercomparison project nmip tian et al 2018 these nitrogen deposition data were simulated by atmospheric chemistry models in scenarios combining shared socioeconomic pathways ssp and rcp i e ssp2 rcp45 and ssp5 rcp85 in this study we further downscaled these data to a spatial resolution of 4 km using the bilinear interpolation method to drive dlem to construct the future distribution of cropland and natural vegetation we first developed a 30 m natural vegetation land cover map by replacing cropland pixels in the nlcd 2019 with their nearest natural vegetation land cover pixels next we downloaded the 1 km historical fractional cropland data 1979 2016 developed by yu and lu 2018 and extracted future fractional cropland data 2015 2099 in the ssp2 rcp45 and ssp5 rcp85 scenarios from the land use harmonization data luh2 hurtt et al 2020 we modified cropland fractions in the luh2 based on cropland fractions in the yu and lu 2018 dataset to make cropland fractions in the two datasets connect seamlessly finally we overlayed the annual cropland fraction datasets on the 30 m natural vegetation land cover map and computed the fractions of vegetation types in each 4 km grid for model simulations during 1979 2099 the major crop types in the arb include winter wheat soybean corn sorghum and hay 2 2 3 model validation and result comparison in this study dlem simulations consisted of two stages which were the equilibrium run and the transient run in the equilibrium run stage the model was driven by the 20 year average climate condition between 1979 and 1998 from gridmet the other driving factors cropland distribution atmospheric nitrogen deposition and co2 concentration were kept constant at the level in 1979 vegetation seeds started to grow from the bare ground with no soil carbon nitrogen and water storage until the system reached an equilibrium state defined as the changes in grid level ecosystem carbon nitrogen and water storage between two consecutive 20 year periods less than 0 5 g c m2 0 5 g n m2 and 0 5 g h2o m2 respectively for most simulation grids in the arb it took 1 000 10 000 years for the model to reach an equilibrium state next we implemented model validation and result comparison by designing the transient run from 1979 to 2021 driven by gridmet climate data and other time varying driving forces the transient run used the simulated carbon water and nitrogen status in the equilibrium run as the starting point dlem parameters controlling ecosystem evapotranspiration and water yield processes such as leaf stomatal conductance and soil surface reflectance were from pan et al 2015 which have been validated against et measurements at 21 ameriflux sites in the u s we obtained other model parameters not directly related to ecosystem water processes from our recent simulations in theinter sectoral impact model intercomparison project phase 2a pan et al 2020 shi et al 2021 then these parameters were used to drive dlem in the equilibrium run and the transient runs we compared dlem simulated monthly et against the data based latent heat product of model tree ensembles mte jung et al 2011 et estimates from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam martens et al 2017 and modis et product of mod16a3 mu et al 2011 mte et was available from 1982 to 2011 gleam et were available from 2003 to 2020 and modis et was available from 2001 to 2021 in this study we compared dlem et with these three et datasets from 2003 to 2011 during which all these datasets are available also we compared model simulations of river flow against usgs measurements at five gauge stations along the arkansas river and its major tributaries including the site at chouteau ok id 07191500 neosho river the site at muskogee ok id 07194500 arkansas river the site at murray dam ar id 07263450 arkansas river the site at white field ok id 07245000 canadian river and the site at fort smith ar id 07249455 arkansas river the locations of the five sites and their associated watersheds are illustrated in fig s5 we used two goodness of fit metrics i e the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 to evaluate dlem s performance in simulating monthly river flow nse is a normalized statistic metric that quantifies the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the variance of river flow measurements ranging from to 1 0 with nse 1 being the perfect simulation and nse 0 as acceptable levels of performance moriasi et al 2007 pbias measures the tendency of dlem simulated river flow to be larger or smaller than the measurements with pbias 0 being the perfect simulation and a lower absolute value of pbias indicating a more accurate simulation moriasi et al 2007 positive pbias values indicate model underestimates river flow while negative values indicate overestimation 2 2 4 design of model simulations besides the transient run in 1979 2021 for model validation and result comparison section 2 2 3 we designed another 49 model simulations in the period of 1979 2099 table 1 all the 49 simulations used the simulated carbon water and nitrogen status in the equilibrium run as starting points through these model simulations we projected future variations of river flow in the arkansas river and its major tributary of the canadian river and attributed river flow variations to four environmental factors including climate change cropland change cc rising co2 concentration and atmospheric nitrogen deposition ndep while all the 49 simulations started in 1979 our analyses focused on the period of 2000 2099 these simulations can be grouped into five broad categories i e baseline simulations s0 climate only simulations s1 cc only simulations s2 co2 only simulations s3 ndep only simulations s4 and all combined simulations s5 table 1 for the reference simulations s0 all driving factors were kept constant throughout the simulation period of 2001 2099 climate conditions were kept at the level of the 20 year average over the period of 1981 2000 while cropland area co2 concentration and nitrogen deposition were kept at the level in 2000 the fifteen s0 reference simulations were to provide a baseline for s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 simulations to make comparisons in the fourteen s1 climate only simulations climate conditions were the only time varying driving force in the simulation period of 2001 2099 contributions of future climate change to river flow were quantified by calculating the difference between s1 simulations and the corresponding s0 simulations likewise cropland area co2 concentration and nitrogen deposition were the only time varying driving factors in s2 s3 and s4 respectively while climate conditions in s2 s3 and s4 were kept constant in the simulation period of 2001 2099 using the 20 year average of gridmet climate data in 1981 2000 contributions of cropland change rising co2 concentration and nitrogen deposition to river flow were quantified by comparing model results in s2 s3 and s4 with those in the s0 gridmet respectively s5 simulations were the all combined simulations in which all driving factors changed over time simulation results in s5 represent dlem s best estimate of future river flow it is worth noting that future climate data used in this study come from gcms in the cmip5 and were not based on the shared socioeconomic pathways in the cmip6 although we used the same scenario names i e ssp2 rcp45 and ssp5 rcp85 as that in the cmip6 2 3 future river flow analyses we analyzed dlem simulated future annual river flow at two levels for the level 1 analysis we examined river flow at three watershed outlets which were 1 the usgs site id 07245000 canadian river near white field ok 2 the usgs site id 07194500 muskogee ok and 3 the outlet of the entire arkansas river basin associated watersheds for the two usgs sites can be found in fig s5 representing river hydrological conditions in the arb s north and south parts respectively for the level 2 analysis we examined river flow in the grids with major river channels see major river channels in fig 1 to illustrate the spatial pattern of river flow changes across the arb next we calculated the contributions of four environmental factors climate change cropland change rising co2 concentration and atmospheric nitrogen deposition to river flow changes at the arb outlet according to the methods described in section 2 2 4 note that our simulations in this study represent river flow conditions without much human water use and regulation therefore river water diversion and the effects of dams were not considered we detected the temporal trend of annual river flow in the arb over the period of 2000 2099 using the mann kendall m k trend test and the non parametric sen s slope estimator e g ali et al 2019 tosunoglu and kisi 2017 yue and wang 2004 next we analyzed the changed annual river flow in the middle 2040 2059 and at the end 2080 2099 of the 21st century relative to the period from 2000 to 2019 3 results 3 1 comparison and validation over the nine years between 2003 and 2011 dlem simulated et was 594 2 48 mm year which had a similar magnitude as gleam et 570 4 51 3 mm year fig 3 mte and modis had a relatively lower et rate 531 31 3 mm year and 427 9 54 2 mm year respectively according to velpuri et al 2013 modis underestimated et in cropland grassland and shrubland by 8 14 compared to ameriflux measurements which partially explained the lower modis et than the other three datasets in the central and western arb all four datasets simulated a declining et spatial pattern from east to west interannual et variation in the four datasets was similar to each other fig s6 during 2003 2011 the four datasets showed that 2011 was the year with the lowest et which were 19 1 27 5 19 9 and 13 3 lower than the 9 year average et for dlem modis gleam and mte respectively meanwhile the four datasets showed that 2007 was the year with the highest et which were 8 2 15 8 9 8 and 6 1 higher than the 9 year average for dlem modis gleam and mte respectively additionally all four datasets showed annual et in the arb had a significant declining trend over the nine years with declining rates of 8 5 mm year 6 2 mm year 5 9 mm year and 4 0 mm year for dlem modis gleam and mte respectively the dlem simulated monthly river flow was validated against measurements at usgs gauge stations fig 4 nse of dlem simulations reached 0 66 0 65 0 68 0 54 and 0 59 at the five stations of site 07 191 500 chouteau ok site 07 194 500 muskogee ok site 07 263 450 murray dam ar site 07 245 000 canadian river near white field ok and site 07 249 455 fort smith ar nse results indicated that dlem captured the temporal variation of river flow in the arb however pbias was negative at four sites 12 6 at site 07194500 8 3 at site 07263450 23 3 at site 07245000 and 8 8 at site 07249455 and positive at one site 15 4 at site 07191500 pbias results indicated the magnitude of dlem simulated river flow was generally consistent with usgs measurements but with a tendency to overestimate the arb river flow this was likely caused by the diversion of arkansas river water for cropland irrigation and public supply which was not considered in our simulations 3 2 future changes in environmental conditions according to the bias corrected climate data simulated by seven gcms in cmip5 temperature in the arb will increase significantly in both the rcp45 and the rcp85 scenarios throughout the 21st century fig 5 temperature will increase by 1 6 0 29 c and 2 2 0 44 c from the period of 2000 2019 to the period of 2040 2059 in the rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios respectively table 2 and s1 between the first and last 20 year periods in the 21st century temperature will increase by 2 1 0 48 c and 4 7 0 67 c in the rcp45 and the rcp85 scenarios respectively the increasing trend in future temperature is relatively consistent between all the seven gcms fig s7 precipitation will have a different pattern of change to temperature the model ensemble mean results showed that average precipitation in 2040 2059 and 2080 2099 would be lower than that in 2000 2019 table 2 compared to the period of 2000 2019 precipitation in 2040 2059 will decrease by 28 32 9 mm year 3 8 and 28 3 48 8 mm year 3 8 in the rcp45 and the rcp85 respectively compared to the period of 2000 2019 precipitation in 2080 2099 will decrease by 13 1 31 7 mm year 1 8 and 32 7 39 3 mm year 4 4 in the rcp45 and the rcp85 respectively table s1 it is worth noting that the changes in regional precipitation are associated with considerable variations between gcms fig s7 for example in the rcp85 the range of precipitation change between the period of 2080 2099 and the period of 2000 2019 is from 107 7 mm year ipsl cm5a lr to 37 mm year ccsm4 indicating the necessity to include multiple gcms and report the uncertainty range when projecting future river flow regarding the spatial pattern precipitation reduction will occur over most of the arb fig s8 compared to the period of 2000 2019 the reduced precipitation in 2040 2059 will take place in 99 9 of the arb in the rcp45 and 98 1 of the arb in the rcp85 the reduced precipitation in 2080 2099 will take place in 90 6 of the arb in the rcp45 and 91 9 of the arb in the rcp85 precipitation will show a more significnat reduction in the southern arb than the northern arb under both scenarios and the increased precipitation will be primarily in eastern kansas the temporal variations of cropland area in the arb will differ between the ssp2 rcp45 and the ssp5 rcp85 in the ssp2 rcp45 the cropland area will increase from 86 631 km2 in 2000 2019 to 104 765 km2 in 2040 2059 table 2 cropland expansion in this period will primarily happen in the grassland areas fig s9 the cropland area will further increase to 123 356 km2 in 2080 2099 however cropland expansion in this period will be primarily in eastern oklahoma and kansas forest areas in the ssp5 rcp85 the cropland area will be at a relatively stable level of 82 156 km2 over the entire study period co2 concentration will increase continuously at different increasing rates in the rcp45 and the rcp85 fig 4 the average co2 concentration was 388 ppm from 2000 to 2019 in the rcp45 the average co2 concentration will increase to 486 ppm in 2040 2059 and 535 ppm in 2080 2099 compared to the rcp45 co2 concentration in the rcp85 will increase at a faster rate and reach 535 ppm in 2040 2059 and 837 ppm in 2080 2099 atmospheric nitrogen deposition rates in the future will be lower compared to the contemporary period in both the ssp2 rcp45 and the ssp5 rcp85 fig 4 nitrogen deposition in the period of 2000 2019 was 0 88 g n m2 year in the rcp45 the average nitrogen deposition rates will decrease to 0 61 g n m2 year in 2040 2059 and 0 46 g n m2 year in 2080 2099 in the rcp85 the average nitrogen deposition rates will decrease to 0 7 g n m2 year in the 2030 s and be a relatively stable level thereafter the decline in future nitrogen deposition is consistent with the trend over recent two decades as a result of the clean air act and other ruls constraining industrial nitrogen gas emissions gilliam et al 2019 3 3 future evapotranspiration for the arb as a whole the changing trend in regional et will be insignificant during 2000 2099 p value 0 05 m k trend test in both the ssp2 rcp45 and the ssp5 rcp85 fig s10 in the ssp2 rcp45 scenario et in the arb was 608 7 9 3 mm year in 2000 2019 and will be 601 8 16 3 mm year in 2040 2059 and 611 13 2 mm year in 2080 2099 table 3 in the ssp5 rcp85 scenario et in the arb was 605 9 14 mm year in 2000 2019 and will be 601 8 31 5 mm year in 2040 2059 and 609 6 16 1 mm year in 2080 2099 it is apparent that the eastern and western arb with the 98th meridian as the dividing line i e the dotted red line in fig 6 have contrasting patterns of et change table 3 in the eastern arb et in the ssp2 rcp45 scenario will increase by 5 9 mm year during 2040 2059 and 13 3 mm year during 2080 2099 compared to the period of 2000 2019 et in the ssp5 rcp85 scenario will increase by 9 1 mm year during 2040 2059 and 25 9 mm year during 2080 2099 compared to the period of 2000 2019 on the contrary in the western arb et in the ssp2 rcp45 scenario will decrease by 14 7 mm year during 2040 2059 and 4 5 mm year during 2080 2099 compared to the period of 2000 2019 et in the ssp5 rcp85 scenario will decrease by 12 3 mm year during 2040 2059 and 10 2 mm year during 2080 2099 compared to the period of 2000 2019 the eastern arb is a relatively humid region with an aridity index of 0 8 while the western arb is a relatively dry region with an aridity index of 0 32 fig s3 we developed a spatial map of pearson s correlation coefficient between the interannual variations in the dlem simulated et and annual precipitation fig s11 this map shows an increasing trend in the precipitation et correlation from east to west indicating a stronger precipitation impact on et in the western arb than that in the eastern arb according to the budyko curve that describes the geographic difference in annual evapotranspiration in relation to the abundance of annual precipitation and radiation budyko 1951 et is limited by water supply in the dry area and by radiation in the humid zone despite the reduced future precipitation over most of the arb the eastern arb will have an increased et because of the higher evaporative water demand in the atmosphere caused by climate warming in the western arb et will decrease along with the reduced precipitation and limited water supply the different patterns of et change between the eastern arb and the western arb will negate each other resulting in an insignificant et change in the 21st century when considering the entire arb 3 4 future river flow m k trend test showed that annual river flow from 2000 to 2099 will have significant decreasing trends p value less than 0 05 in both the ssp2 rcp45 and the ssp5 rcp85 at the three locations of 1 the usgs site id 07245000 canadian river near white field ok 2 the usgs site id 07194500 muskogee ok and 3 the outlet of the entire arb fig 7 we used the usgs site on the canadian river white field and the usgs site on the arkansas river muskogee to represent river hydrological conditions in the south and north of the arb fig s5 respectively for the canadian river white field changing rates of annual river flow i e sen s slope will be 1 6 107 m3 year in the ssp2 rcp45 and 3 6 107 m3 year in the ssp5 rcp85 for the arkansas river muskogee changing rates of annual river flow will be 4 8 107 m3 year in the ssp2 rcp45 and 1 1 108 m3 year in the ssp5 rcp85 at the outlet of the entire arb changing rates of annual river flow will be 8 5 107 m3 year in the ssp2 rcp45 and 1 9 108 m3 year in the ssp5 rcp85 the declining rate of annual river flow in the ssp5 rcp85 scenario will be 2 2 2 3 times the declining rate in the ssp2 rcp45 scenario at the three locations from the first 20 years to the last 20 years of the 21st century river flow in the ssp2 rcp45 will decrease by 13 4 11 4 and 12 1 at the three locations of the canadian river white field the the arkansas river muskogee and the arb outlet respectively while river flow in the ssp5 rcp85 will decrease by 33 7 27 3 and 27 9 at the three locations respectively table 4 river flow in the canadian river watershed will have a larger percentage reduction than that in the northern arb notably the reduced river flow in the ssp2 rcp45 scenario will take place from the beginning to the middle of the 21st century while the reduced river flow in the ssp5 rcp85 scenario will happen throughout the entire 21st century the shaded area and box plots in fig 7 indicate the general consistency in the decreasing trend of the simulated river flow driven by climate data from 7 gcms for example at the arb outlet in the ssp2 rcp45 simulations driven by 6 climate datasets show declined river flow in the middle of the 21st century and simulations driven by 5 climate datasets show declined river flow by the end of the 21st century additionally in the ssp5 rcp85 simulations driven by 6 climate datasets show declined river flow in the middle of the 21st century and simulations driven by all 7 climate datasets show declined river flow by the end of the 21st century this result consolidates the general declining trend in the arb river flow despite the variations in future climate conditions projected by different gcms the percentage reduction of river flow will show considerable variations over different areas in the arb fig 8 in the ssp2 rcp45 during 2040 2059 the greatest percentage reduction over 20 will happen in the southwestern arb i e the north canadian river the canadian river and the cimarron river to the west of the 99th meridian other areas of the arb will have a reduction in river flow between 10 and 20 fig 8a in the ssp2 rcp45 during 2080 2099 the southwestern arb i e the north canadian river the canadian river and the cimarron river to the west of the 99th meridian will also show the largest percentage reduction of over 20 in river flow the arkansas river to the west of the 97th meridian will have a reduction of 15 20 while other areas of the arb will have a relatively smaller percentage reduction of 10 15 fig 8b in the ssp5 rcp85 during 2040 2059 the largest percentage reduction over 20 will happen in the southwestern arb along the canadian river and the north canadian river the percentage reduction of river flow in the arkansas river will be between 15 and 20 fig 8c in the ssp5 rcp85 during 2080 2099 river channels to the west of the 95th meridian including the arkansas river the north canadian river the canadian river and the cimarron river will have a considerable river flow reduction of over 30 the neosho river will have a decrease of 20 25 and the arkansas river to the east of the 95th meridian will have a reduction of 25 30 fig 8d overall river flow in all river channels of the arb will decline in the 21st century with the most significant reduction in the western particularly the southwestern arb 3 5 contributions of environmental factors by calculating differences between the 49 model simulations table 1 we quantified the contributions of four environmental factors climate change cropland change rising co2 concentration and atmospheric nitrogen deposition to the changed river flow at the arb outlet fig 9 percentage contribution of a specific environmental factor was computed as the ratio of its impact on river flow change to the combined effect of the four time varying environmental factors it is noteworthy that the sum of percentage contributions from the four environmental factors does not equal 100 because the interactions between environmental factors will make contributions to the changed river flow but are not presented here in both the ssp2 rcp45 and the ssp5 rcp85 scenarios climate warming and drying were identified as the primary environmental factors for the decreased river flow contributions of climate change to the decreased river flow in the ssp2 rcp45 will be 85 3 during 2040 2059 and 95 3 during 2080 2099 contributions of climate change to the decreased river flow in the ssp5 rcp85 will be 80 6 during 2040 2059 and 77 1 during 2080 2099 cropland area in the arb will increase continuously in the ssp2 rcp45 but keep at a relatively stable level in the ssp5 rcp85 in the ssp2 rcp45 cropland change will decrease river flow in the first half of the 21st century contributing 5 1 to the reduced river flow in 2040 2059 however the effect of cropland change will reverse in the second half of the 21st century during the period 2080 2099 cropland change will increase the river flow of the arkansas river contributing 17 6 to the overall declining river flow pattern in the ssp5 rcp85 cropland change will have a negligible effect and the contributions of cropland change will be 3 8 in 2040 2099 and 2 2 in 2080 2099 the rising co2 concentration will affect ecosystem hydrological processes by altering leaf stomatal conductance stomatal density and vegetation foliage area gedney et al 2006 liu et al 2018 piao et al 2007 tao et al 2014 our results showed that the rising co2 concentrations would reduce river flow in the arb in the ssp2 rcp45 the rising co2 will contribute 11 8 of the decreased river flow in 2040 2099 and 24 9 of the reduced river flow in 2080 2099 in the ssp5 rcp85 the rising co2 will contribute 11 7 of the reduced river flow in 2040 2099 and 13 6 of the decreased river flow in 2080 2099 atmospheric nitrogen deposition can modulate ecosystem evapotranspiration by affecting vegetation conditions dickinson et al 2002 mao et al 2015 shi et al 2013 in this study we found the changes in future nitrogen deposition will have a relatively minor effect compared to the other three factors the reduced nitrogen deposition will result in lower ecosystem evapotranspiration and then increased river flow in the ssp2 rcp45 contributions of the reduced nitrogen deposition to the decreased river flow will be 2 2 in 2040 2099 and 6 4 in 2080 2099 in the ssp5 rcp85 contributions of the reduced nitrogen deposition to the decreased river flow will be 1 3 in 2040 2099 and 1 in 2080 2099 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms controlling long term river flow the long term changes of river flow at the decadal scale largely depend on the balance between precipitation and ecosystem et piao et al 2007 variation in precipitation has a direct impact through changing soil moisture and runoff generation our results identified the widespread reduction in precipitation as one major factor for the decreased river flow in the middle and at the end of the 21st century under both the rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios section 3 5 nevertheless future changes in ecosystem et will have a more complex pattern because it can be modulated by weather conditions soil properties vegetation type and ecosystem physiological and structural characteristics mao et al 2015 piao et al 2007 the arb has a large span of aridity in the east west direction our model simulated contrasting patterns of et changes between the western arb and the eastern arb in the context of future climate warming and drying section 3 3 climate warming will cause increases in atmospheric water demand and ecosystem potential et scheff and frierson 2014 in the arid western arb the increased atmospheric water demand will not lead to higher actual et because of the limited water supply under the impacts of reduced precipitation this result is consistent with the declining et in global semiarid regions over recent decades caused by the limited moisture supply jung et al 2010 yang et al 2019b on the contrary the humid eastern arb will have an increased actual et because of the increased atmospheric water demand and sufficient water supply this contrasting et changing pattern can be well explained by budyko s framework which describes the dependence of evapotranspiration on water and energy availability li et al 2013 co2 impacts on evapotranspiration and river flow have not been fully understood c3 and c4 plants have different photosynthesis processes calvin cycle vs hatch and slack cycle and are different in their response to the increased co2 concentration large scale free air co2 enrichment face experiments showed that leaf stomatal conductance decreased with the rising co2 concentration for c3 species but showed little responses for c4 species ainsworth and long 2005 ainsworth and rogers 2007 some studies attributed a considerable part of the increased global river flow in the 20th century to co2 induced reduction in stomatal conductance gedney et al 2006 while other studies indicated that the rising co2 had a limited effect on river flow because co2 can act as a plant fertilizer to increase foliage area and increase plant transpiration piao et al 2007 the arb and the southern great plains have a large fraction of c4 grasses still et al 2003 which make stomatal conductance less sensitive to the rising co2 compared to c3 grasses and forests in our simulations future rising co2 will increase et and decrease river flow in the arb because the positive co2 effect on et through enhancing foliage area will outweigh its negative effect on et through reducing stomatal conductance impacts of land use change on river flow have been investigated over many basins across the globe the general conclusion is that land conversion from forests to croplands and pastures leads to increased river flow e g schilling et al 2010 siriwardena et al 2006 tao et al 2014 zhang and schilling 2006 our analysis on the luh2 land use data hurtt et al 2020 showed that cropland area in the arb will increase in the ssp2 rcp45 scenario but keep at a relatively stable level in the ssp5 rcp85 scenario in the ssp2 scenario global demand for crop and livestock products increases moderately popp et al 2017 leading to the increased cropland area in the arb in the first half of the 21st century cropland expansion in the arb will primarily happen in the grassland area as grassland and cropland have a similar et magnitude yue et al 2022 our results showed that the replacement of grasslands by croplands will have a small impact on river flow however land conversion from forests to croplands after the 2050 s will lead to increased surface runoff and river flow land use pattern in the ssp5 scenario is characterized by moderate tropical deforestation but little changes in north america because agricultural products are not necessarily produced domestically in the globalized world krause et al 2019 popp et al 2017 therefore our simulation showed a minor effect of cropland change on river flow in the ssp5 rcp85 scenario 4 2 implications for water management agricultural irrigation and public supply consumed a large portion of surface water in the arb the demand for water resources is expected to increase during the 21st century given the continued trends in climate warming and population growth vörösmarty et al 2000 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 however the arb is projected to have less river flow and reduced surface water availability particularly in the western and southwestern arb section 3 4 which requires the implementation of effective water management and conservation strategies to meet the growing water demand to maintain long term water resource sustainability it is essential to improve the efficiency and productivity of agricultural irrigation systems evett et al 2020 and apply more conservative indoor and outdoor water use strategies maggioni 2015 a significant amount 30 of surface water withdrawals have been used for irrigation in the arb tortorelli 2009 thus the improvement in irrigation efficiency is a potential strategy to adapt to the reduced river flow in 2018 over 85 of the irrigated area in the southern high plains used the center pivot sprinkler irrigation system in kansas the irrigated land area with a center pivot sprinkler irrigation system increased from 50 to 92 during 1990 2012 evett et al 2020 rogers and lamm 2008 this irrigation system has greatly improved water use efficiency compared to the traditional gravity irrigation system levidow et al 2014 to further improve irrigation efficiency it could be necessary to adopt more efficient irrigation strategies such as the subsurface drip irrigation system lamm et al 2012 more accurate irrigation scheduling gu et al 2020 and precision irrigation systems to place water where it can be effectively used by crops evett et al 2020 additionally genetic modification is being widely studied to develop new crop cultivars with improved drought tolerance but without yield penalty khan et al 2019 in the future planting drought tolerant crop cultivars could be a helpful strategy to reduce irrigation water use and maintain agricultural sustainability in the arb conservative household water use strategies could be of particular importance for cities in the canadian river basin such as the oklahoma city metropolitan area which will experience more severe river flow reduction than the other watersheds for household water use the current drought related prescriptive policies and price based water conservation strategies wichman et al 2016 may become the norm in the future since outdoor water uses are more elastic mansur and olmstead 2012 the prescriptive policy limiting outdoor irrigation can be effective in reducing the household level of water use maggioni 2015 additionally price based regulation and water conservation incentives can be effective for urban water conservation lee et al 2013 olmstead and stavins 2009 low income households could be more sensitive to price and incentive conservation strategies while prescriptive policies have uniform responses across all household income levels wichman et al 2016 4 3 uncertainties and future needs we used dlem to simulate arb river flow dynamics in the 21st century driven by a series of environmental factors future climate data is one of the major uncertainty sources in this study it is known that gcms produced divergent future climate patterns which come from the incomplete representation of regional scale processes inadequate parameterization skills imperfect initial conditions and relatively coarse resolution almazroui et al 2021 thus we included future climate data simulated by seven gcms in the cmip5 project to drive dlem and reported the standard deviation to document the uncertainty in the projected river flow due to the divergencies in future climate projection it is necessary to keep in mind that some natural and anthropogenic factors that could affect arb hydrological processes were not included in this study as this study intended to project river flow without much human intervention river water diversion for irrigation and dam effect were not considered we acknowledge that river water diversion and dam construction can strongly affect river flow especially in the arid and semiarid regions kondolf and batalla 2005 if these factors are included river flow reduction could be larger than our estimates woody plant encroachment wpe into the arid and semiarid grasslands is a global phenomenon with critical hydrological consequences e g huxman et al 2005 qiao et al 2015 schreiner mcgraw et al 2020 zou et al 2015 compared to the original grasslands wpe species have a higher transpiration which reduces surface runoff and surface water availability eastern redcedar juniper juniperus virginiana and honey mesquite mesquite prosopis glandulosa are the two most common wpe species in the arb and the southern great plains in oklahoma juniper forests expand at a rate of 40 km2 year over recent decades wang et al 2018 it is expected that woody plants will continue to encroach into the grasslands in the arb in the future but its expansion rate is subject to large uncertainties due to the changed climate conditions fire regimes and human willingness and management strategies to control wpe if wpe impacts on ecosystem hydrological processes are considered river flow in the arb may be further reduced likewise government policies on biofuels and tree planting for increased carbon storage are unknown factors related to future land use change that may influence runoff and river flows our results in this study represent a conservative estimate of future river flow reduction given the limitations in our study we recommend the following future research directions in the ssp2 and ssp5 scenarios cropland area in the arb will increase or keep stable at the current level which is not consistent with the declining trend of cropland area in the u s and the great plains over recent decades yu and lu 2018 one future research direction is to include new land use change scenarios with continuously decreased cropland area to evaluate land use change impacts on regional water and other ecological processes dams river water diversion and woody plant encroachment are expected to change regional hydrological processes in the arb but are not included in this study we suggest future work to investigate to which extent human activities and woody plant encroachment would affect river flow additionally it is necessary to examine the impacts of future river flow decline on the habitats of critical aquatic species and the reliability of water supply reservoirs 5 conclusions in this study we projected future river flow changes in the arb using a process based ecosystem model under two climate and socioeconomic scenarios our results showed that river flow in the arb will decrease significantly in the 21st century under both the ssp2 rcp45 and the ssp5 rcp85 scenarios in the ssp2 rcp45 the river flow decline will take place from the beginning to the middle of this century in the ssp5 rcp85 river flow decline will happen across the entire simulation priod compared to the period of 2000 2019 arkansas river flow at the end of the 21st century will decrease by 12 1 in the ssp2 rcp45 and 27 9 in the ssp5 rcp85 most importantly river flow decline will happen in all the major rivers with the largest percentage reduction in the western and southwestern arb climate warming and drying will be the primary factors accounting for this reduction the reduced water availability and growing water demand will require conservative water use strategies and improved agricultural irrigation efficiency to maintain water resource sustainability credit authorship contribution statement jia yang

2234,the arkansas river and its tributaries provide critical water resources for agricultural irrigation hydropower generation and public water supply in the arkansas river basin arb however climate change and other environmental factors have imposed significant impacts on regional hydrological processes resulting in widespread ecological and economic consequences in this study we projected future river flow patterns in the 21st century across the entire arb under two climate and socio economic change scenarios i e ssp2 rcp45 and ssp5 rcp85 using the process based dynamic land ecosystem model dlem we designed baseline simulations all driving factors were kept constant at the level circa 2000 and environmental change simulations at least one driving factor changed over time during 2001 2099 to simulate the inter annual variations of river flow and quantify the contributions of four driving factors i e climate change co2 concentration atmospheric nitrogen deposition and land use change results showed that the arkansas river flow in 2080 2099 would decrease by 12 1 in the ssp2 rcp45 and 27 9 in the ssp5 rcp85 compared to that during 2000 2019 river flow decline would occur from the beginning to the middle of this century in the ssp2 rcp45 and happen throughout the entire century in the ssp5 rcp85 all major rivers in the arb would experience river flow decline with the largest percentage reduction in the western and southwestern arb warming and drying climates would account for 77 95 of the reduction the rising co2 concentration would exacerbate the decline through increasing foliage area and ecosystem evapotranspiration this study provides insight into the spatial patterns of future changes in water availability in the arb and the underlying mechanisms controlling these changes this information is critical for designing watershed specific management strategies to maintain regional water resource sustainability and mitigate the adverse impacts of climate changes on water availability keywords climate change hydrological modeling droughts surface runoff great plains evapotranspiration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the arkansas river is one of the major tributaries of the mississippi river originating in the rocky mountains in new mexico and colorado flowing through the plains and highlands in kansas and oklahoma and finally joining the mississippi river in arkansas the arkansas river basin arb is the largest river basin in the southern great plains spanning a large diversity of climate terrain and vegetation river flow in the arkansas river and its tributaries provide critical water resources for agricultural irrigation hydropower generation and public water supply and provide habitats for several endangered aquatic species however as a prevalent land disturbance in the arb basara et al 2013 droughts disrupt the normal hydrological processes reduce water availability in rivers and lakes and cause widespread ecological consequences and agricultural and economic losses seager et al 2013 many rivers in the arb flow across the boundary of multiple states which requires interstate stream compacts to apportion the waters and resolve conflicts between states schlager and heikkila 2009 in the arb the surface water in rivers and lakes is an essential source for agriculture irrigation and public water supply diversion facilities were constructed in colorado between avondale and la junta to remove water from the arkansas river for irrigation use and substantially decreased streamflow gates et al 2016 ortiz et al 1998 in oklahoma daily surface water withdrawals reached 989 million gallons in 2005 32 of which was used for cropland irrigation tortorelli 2009 additionally a number of important u s cities reside along the arkansas river and its tributaries including oklahoma city and tulsa in oklahoma little rock in arkansas wichita in kansas and pueblo in colorado with the increasing urban population surface water has become the primary public water supply source in the eastern arb in kansas surface water represented 52 61 of the total annual withdrawals for public supply during 1990 2012 kenny 2014 in oklahoma 41 of the surface water withdrawals have been used as public water supply additionally the arkansas river and its tributaries provide critical habitats for multiple endangered aquatic species for example the arkansas river shinner is endemic to the arkansas river system but its abundance and living extent started to shrink in the 1970s pigg 1999 the southern great plains and the arb are prone to various types of droughts multiyear droughts seasonal droughts and flash droughts with severe consequences to regional water availability crop production and livestock health livneh and hoerling 2016 the southern great plains has experienced a number of multiyear droughts such as the droughts in the 1930s and the 1950s when sea surface temperatures in the tropics were lower than normal schubert et al 2004 seasonal droughts were prevalent in the arb in the 20th century and the early 21st century and will likely become more frequent and severe after the 2050s along with climate warming and drying liu et al 2013a over recent years flash droughts at the sub seasonal timescale have been intensively investigated in the u s e g basara et al 2019 chen et al 2019 christian et al 2019 the arb and the central great plains have been identified as hot spots with the most intense flash droughts such as the great plain drought in 2011 christian et al 2019 these drought events decreased river flow and surface water storage for example the water level in lake thunderbird in central oklahoma was 7 feet about 2 1 m below the recommended conservation pool during the 2011 2012 drought threatening the drinking water supply in the three metropolitan areas of midwest city del city and norman another drastic example is lake meredith on the canadian river which historically was a major source of drinking water for cities in the texas panhandle by 2012 however the lake level has dropped to the point that no water was delivered to these cities cepeda 2016 additionally some reaches of the arkansas river such as that between dodge city and garden city in kansas were once perennial but completely dry over recent decades due to the limited water resources over a large portion of the arb disputes regarding river water apportionment have long been common between neighboring states clemons 2003 for example water conflicts between kansas and colorado over the apportionment of arkansas river flows happened multiple times since the early 20th century from 1950 to 1985 colorado intercepted 328 000 acre feet of arkansas river water that was supposed to flow to kansas naeser and bennett 1998 kansas sued colorado in the u s supreme court that colorado deprived kansas of its accustomed flow of the arkansas river to manage and apportion the waters in the arkansas river and its major tributaries many interstate stream compacts have been approved by the united states congress and enacted in federal statutes and the statutes of each agreeing state schlager and heikkila 2009 to design better strategies for surface water allocation information regarding future river flow is urgently needed by the states in the arb climate change has affected and will continue altering river hydrological regimes and endanger water resource sustainability at the regional and global scales seager et al 2013 van vliet et al 2013 quantitative information about future river flow under climate change and water use scenarios is of particular importance for water risk assessment nohara et al 2006 and designing proactive intervention water management strategies palmer et al 2008 future climate change will likely worsen water shortages in the arb by enhancing water demand while reducing water supply changed precipitation regimes will affect soil moisture conditions and runoff generation seager et al 2013 climate warming will likely increase ecosystem evapotranspiration and in turn drive up irrigation water requirements and public water use yang et al 2019a additionally ecosystem evapotranspiration and river flow can be affected by many other environmental factors for example tao et al 2014 reported that under the high emission scenarios human induced rising co2 concentration and land use change would play a more important role than climate change in shaping the river discharge of the mississippi river in contrast piao et al 2007 found that climate change and cropland expansion had a larger impact than the rising co2 concentrations in determining river flow trend one critical pattern of land cover change in the arb is woody plant encroachment in the grasslands which has been found to affect runoff generation and groundwater recharge acharya et al 2018 qiao et al 2017 it can be concluded that an accurate simulation of future river flow needs to consider the impacts of climate change as well as other human caused environmental changes although future river flow has been projected in many basins in the u s and across the world under climate change scenarios e g lauri et al 2012 seager et al 2013 tao et al 2014 we lack an in depth understanding of future river flow patterns in the arb and the southern great plains which is limiting our ability to design water use and management strategies to sustain regional water resource availability in this study we aimed at answering the following two questions 1 how much would river flow change over different parts of the arb in the middle and at the end of the 21st century 2 what are the major environmental factors controlling future river flow changes to answer these two questions we compiled and analyzed future projections of climate conditions and other environmental factors from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 and phase 6 cmip5 and cmip6 and used these compiled future environmental factors to drive the process based dynamic land ecosystem model dlem tian et al 2011 we designed baseline simulations all driving factors were kept constant at the level circa 2000 and environmental change simulations at least one driving factor changed over time during 2001 2099 to simulate the inter annual variations of river flow in the arb and quantify the contributions of four driving factors i e climate change co2 concentration atmospheric nitrogen deposition and land use change contrasting to previous river flow modeling studies that report river flow at one or multiple river outlets our work presented the spatial pattern of future river flow of all major river channels in the arb which is critical for designing water management strategies at the local state and basin levels 2 data and methods 2 1 study domain our study domain is the arkansas river basin fig 1 which has a total land area of 0 41 million km2 and covers parts of 7 states colorado new mexico kansas oklahoma texas missouri and arkansas and 16 epa level iii ecoregions fig s1 we delineated the arb boundary based on the hydro1k digital elevation model dem data using hydrological analysis tools in arcgis 10 8 we identified the major river channels fig 1 from the hydro1k dem by calculating flow accumulation area and then selecting grids with flow accumulation area 16 000 km2 topography presents significant spatial variations in the east west direction fig s2 the ecoregion of the mississippi alluvial plain in arkansas see its location in fig s1 has the lowest elevation mean 61 m while the ecoregion of the southern rockies in colorado and new mexico has the highest elevation mean 2636 m according to the gridmet climate data abatzoglou 2013 arb had an average annual temperature of 8 4 c during 1991 2020 with the highest temperature of 12 2 c in the ecoregion of the mississippi alluvial plain and the lowest temperature of 1 2 c in the ecoregion of the southern rockies fig s3 july was the warmest month 20 7 2 8 c mean 1 std dev same hereafter and january was the coldest month 3 6 2 1 c fig s4 during the last 30 years regional average precipitation was 732 mm year with a distinct declining pattern from east to west may was the month with the highest precipitation 94 7 56 3 mm month and january was the month with the lowest precipitation 28 4 27 9 mm month fig s4 the average potential evapotranspiration was 1490 mm year for the arb potential evapotranspiration was the highest in the southwestern arb 1700 mm year as an indicator of aridity conditions the aridity index ai the ratio of long term precipitation to long term potential evapotranspiration middleton and thomas 1998 was 0 49 in the arb with a large spatial variation from less than 0 3 in the arid west to 1 0 in the humid east the dryland area ai less than 0 65 accounted for 69 7 of the arb and the humid area ai 0 65 accounted for the remaining 31 3 as shown by the national land cover database 2019 fig 1 homer et al 2020 grassland and pasture are the dominant land use and land cover types accounting for 42 5 of the entire arb land area forest and shrub are the second and third largest natural vegetation types representing 14 7 and 13 2 of the arb land area respectively deciduous forests are primarily distributed in the eastern ecoregions such as the cross timbers the boston mountains the arkansas valley and the ozark highlands see their locations in fig s1 evergreen forests are prevalent in the ecoregion of the southern rockies in the west croplands account for 22 5 of the arb land area mostly occurring in the ecoregions of the high plains the central great plains and the mississippi alluvial plain 2 2 model description and experimental design in this study we first evaluated the performance of dynamic land ecosystem model dlem in simulating evapotranspiration and river flow in the arb against usgs measurement and satellite based evapotranspiration products after model evaluation and validation we ran the validated dlem to simulate the annual river flow from 2001 to 2099 in six model simulation scenarios model driving forces included climate change co2 concentration atmospheric nitrogen deposition and land use change fig 2 2 2 1 dynamic land ecosystem model dlem is a process based ecosystem model for simulating ecosystem water carbon and nitrogen processes at the site regional and global scales liu et al 2013b tian et al 2011 yao et al 2020 the terrestrial processes include five major components including biophysical biogeochemical hydrological vegetation dynamics and land use processes tian et al 2010 in the arb dlem includes seven major plant functional types pfts to represent the distribution of natural vegetation which are temperate broadleaf deciduous forest temperate needleleaf evergreen forest evergreen shrub deciduous shrub c3 grass c4 grass and wetland in each grid dlem uses a cohort structure to represent land cover types with a maximum of four natural vegetation pfts and one crop type liu et al 2013b natural and anthropogenic land disturbances such as wildfires forest harvesting and herbivore grazing have been explicitly represented enabling dlem to simulate the impacts of anthropogenic and natural disturbances on ecosystem carbon and water dynamics chen et al 2013 dangal et al 2017 yang et al 2015a dlem also has the capability to evaluate land use change and land management practices such as fertilizer application and timber harvest on the terrestrial and aquatic processes lu et al 2020 pan et al 2021 ren et al 2016 tian et al 2020 yang et al 2015b the aquatic module in dlem simulates sub grid level hydrological processes as well as water nutrient and sediment transport between grids through river networks down to the ocean it is unique in the incorporation of various environmental drivers simultaneous simulations of terrestrial water carbon nitrogen dynamics land to atmosphere gas and water exchanges and land to aquatic mass flows tian et al 2020 yao et al 2020 text s1 provides a brief description of dlem algorithms to estimate et runoff baseflow and water movement along the river network the detailed description can be found in our previous publications liu et al 2013b pan et al 2015 yang et al 2015b yao et al 2020 2 2 2 model input datasets in this study we prepared model input datasets at a spatial resolution of 4 km which is the highest resolution for the downscaled cmip5 future climate data in the arb the static model input variables included soil properties topography and river network we obtained soil property data from the gridded harmonized world soil database hwsd v1 2 wieder 2014 including soil texture ph value and bulk density next we used the arc hydro tools in arcgis djokic et al 2011 to fill sinks in the hydro1k dem data calculate flow direction and accumulation area determine river channels and delineate basin boundary time varying model inputs include daily climate conditions co2 concentration atmospheric nitrogen deposition and annual cropland distribution climate data daily average maximum minimum air temperature precipitation and solar radiation were from two data sources i e the 4 km gridmet climate data from 1979 to 2021 abatzoglou 2013 and downscaled general circulation model gcm outputs in the cmip5 project over the historical period 1980 2005 and future period 2006 2099 in two representative concentration pathways with medium and high greenhouse gas concentrations i e rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios taylor et al 2012 we used cmip5 climate data from seven gcms which are bcc csm1 ccsm4 gfdl esm2g hadgem2 es365 ipsl cm5a lr miroc5 and noresm1 m these data have been downscaled to a spatial resolution of 4 km and bias has been corrected according to the gridmet historical climate data using the multivariate adaptive constructed analogs maca abatzoglou and brown 2012 it is noteworthy that we used the downscaled climate data from the cmip5 rather than the cmip6 although downscaled cmip6 climate data are available such as the nex gddp cmip6 thrasher and nemani 2021 this is because the spatial resolution of current cmip6 downscaled climate data such as 0 25 latitude longitude for the nex gddp cmip6 is not high enough to meet our requirement for hydrological simulations in the arb annual co2 concentration data between 1979 and 2020 were from the noaa global monitoring laboratory and future co2 concentration data in the rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios were obtained from the rcp database version 2 0 the atmospheric nitrogen deposition data nhx and noy 0 5 latitude longitude in the historical and future periods were from the ncar chemistry climate model initiative ccmi which has been used in the global n2o model intercomparison project nmip tian et al 2018 these nitrogen deposition data were simulated by atmospheric chemistry models in scenarios combining shared socioeconomic pathways ssp and rcp i e ssp2 rcp45 and ssp5 rcp85 in this study we further downscaled these data to a spatial resolution of 4 km using the bilinear interpolation method to drive dlem to construct the future distribution of cropland and natural vegetation we first developed a 30 m natural vegetation land cover map by replacing cropland pixels in the nlcd 2019 with their nearest natural vegetation land cover pixels next we downloaded the 1 km historical fractional cropland data 1979 2016 developed by yu and lu 2018 and extracted future fractional cropland data 2015 2099 in the ssp2 rcp45 and ssp5 rcp85 scenarios from the land use harmonization data luh2 hurtt et al 2020 we modified cropland fractions in the luh2 based on cropland fractions in the yu and lu 2018 dataset to make cropland fractions in the two datasets connect seamlessly finally we overlayed the annual cropland fraction datasets on the 30 m natural vegetation land cover map and computed the fractions of vegetation types in each 4 km grid for model simulations during 1979 2099 the major crop types in the arb include winter wheat soybean corn sorghum and hay 2 2 3 model validation and result comparison in this study dlem simulations consisted of two stages which were the equilibrium run and the transient run in the equilibrium run stage the model was driven by the 20 year average climate condition between 1979 and 1998 from gridmet the other driving factors cropland distribution atmospheric nitrogen deposition and co2 concentration were kept constant at the level in 1979 vegetation seeds started to grow from the bare ground with no soil carbon nitrogen and water storage until the system reached an equilibrium state defined as the changes in grid level ecosystem carbon nitrogen and water storage between two consecutive 20 year periods less than 0 5 g c m2 0 5 g n m2 and 0 5 g h2o m2 respectively for most simulation grids in the arb it took 1 000 10 000 years for the model to reach an equilibrium state next we implemented model validation and result comparison by designing the transient run from 1979 to 2021 driven by gridmet climate data and other time varying driving forces the transient run used the simulated carbon water and nitrogen status in the equilibrium run as the starting point dlem parameters controlling ecosystem evapotranspiration and water yield processes such as leaf stomatal conductance and soil surface reflectance were from pan et al 2015 which have been validated against et measurements at 21 ameriflux sites in the u s we obtained other model parameters not directly related to ecosystem water processes from our recent simulations in theinter sectoral impact model intercomparison project phase 2a pan et al 2020 shi et al 2021 then these parameters were used to drive dlem in the equilibrium run and the transient runs we compared dlem simulated monthly et against the data based latent heat product of model tree ensembles mte jung et al 2011 et estimates from the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam martens et al 2017 and modis et product of mod16a3 mu et al 2011 mte et was available from 1982 to 2011 gleam et were available from 2003 to 2020 and modis et was available from 2001 to 2021 in this study we compared dlem et with these three et datasets from 2003 to 2011 during which all these datasets are available also we compared model simulations of river flow against usgs measurements at five gauge stations along the arkansas river and its major tributaries including the site at chouteau ok id 07191500 neosho river the site at muskogee ok id 07194500 arkansas river the site at murray dam ar id 07263450 arkansas river the site at white field ok id 07245000 canadian river and the site at fort smith ar id 07249455 arkansas river the locations of the five sites and their associated watersheds are illustrated in fig s5 we used two goodness of fit metrics i e the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 to evaluate dlem s performance in simulating monthly river flow nse is a normalized statistic metric that quantifies the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the variance of river flow measurements ranging from to 1 0 with nse 1 being the perfect simulation and nse 0 as acceptable levels of performance moriasi et al 2007 pbias measures the tendency of dlem simulated river flow to be larger or smaller than the measurements with pbias 0 being the perfect simulation and a lower absolute value of pbias indicating a more accurate simulation moriasi et al 2007 positive pbias values indicate model underestimates river flow while negative values indicate overestimation 2 2 4 design of model simulations besides the transient run in 1979 2021 for model validation and result comparison section 2 2 3 we designed another 49 model simulations in the period of 1979 2099 table 1 all the 49 simulations used the simulated carbon water and nitrogen status in the equilibrium run as starting points through these model simulations we projected future variations of river flow in the arkansas river and its major tributary of the canadian river and attributed river flow variations to four environmental factors including climate change cropland change cc rising co2 concentration and atmospheric nitrogen deposition ndep while all the 49 simulations started in 1979 our analyses focused on the period of 2000 2099 these simulations can be grouped into five broad categories i e baseline simulations s0 climate only simulations s1 cc only simulations s2 co2 only simulations s3 ndep only simulations s4 and all combined simulations s5 table 1 for the reference simulations s0 all driving factors were kept constant throughout the simulation period of 2001 2099 climate conditions were kept at the level of the 20 year average over the period of 1981 2000 while cropland area co2 concentration and nitrogen deposition were kept at the level in 2000 the fifteen s0 reference simulations were to provide a baseline for s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 simulations to make comparisons in the fourteen s1 climate only simulations climate conditions were the only time varying driving force in the simulation period of 2001 2099 contributions of future climate change to river flow were quantified by calculating the difference between s1 simulations and the corresponding s0 simulations likewise cropland area co2 concentration and nitrogen deposition were the only time varying driving factors in s2 s3 and s4 respectively while climate conditions in s2 s3 and s4 were kept constant in the simulation period of 2001 2099 using the 20 year average of gridmet climate data in 1981 2000 contributions of cropland change rising co2 concentration and nitrogen deposition to river flow were quantified by comparing model results in s2 s3 and s4 with those in the s0 gridmet respectively s5 simulations were the all combined simulations in which all driving factors changed over time simulation results in s5 represent dlem s best estimate of future river flow it is worth noting that future climate data used in this study come from gcms in the cmip5 and were not based on the shared socioeconomic pathways in the cmip6 although we used the same scenario names i e ssp2 rcp45 and ssp5 rcp85 as that in the cmip6 2 3 future river flow analyses we analyzed dlem simulated future annual river flow at two levels for the level 1 analysis we examined river flow at three watershed outlets which were 1 the usgs site id 07245000 canadian river near white field ok 2 the usgs site id 07194500 muskogee ok and 3 the outlet of the entire arkansas river basin associated watersheds for the two usgs sites can be found in fig s5 representing river hydrological conditions in the arb s north and south parts respectively for the level 2 analysis we examined river flow in the grids with major river channels see major river channels in fig 1 to illustrate the spatial pattern of river flow changes across the arb next we calculated the contributions of four environmental factors climate change cropland change rising co2 concentration and atmospheric nitrogen deposition to river flow changes at the arb outlet according to the methods described in section 2 2 4 note that our simulations in this study represent river flow conditions without much human water use and regulation therefore river water diversion and the effects of dams were not considered we detected the temporal trend of annual river flow in the arb over the period of 2000 2099 using the mann kendall m k trend test and the non parametric sen s slope estimator e g ali et al 2019 tosunoglu and kisi 2017 yue and wang 2004 next we analyzed the changed annual river flow in the middle 2040 2059 and at the end 2080 2099 of the 21st century relative to the period from 2000 to 2019 3 results 3 1 comparison and validation over the nine years between 2003 and 2011 dlem simulated et was 594 2 48 mm year which had a similar magnitude as gleam et 570 4 51 3 mm year fig 3 mte and modis had a relatively lower et rate 531 31 3 mm year and 427 9 54 2 mm year respectively according to velpuri et al 2013 modis underestimated et in cropland grassland and shrubland by 8 14 compared to ameriflux measurements which partially explained the lower modis et than the other three datasets in the central and western arb all four datasets simulated a declining et spatial pattern from east to west interannual et variation in the four datasets was similar to each other fig s6 during 2003 2011 the four datasets showed that 2011 was the year with the lowest et which were 19 1 27 5 19 9 and 13 3 lower than the 9 year average et for dlem modis gleam and mte respectively meanwhile the four datasets showed that 2007 was the year with the highest et which were 8 2 15 8 9 8 and 6 1 higher than the 9 year average for dlem modis gleam and mte respectively additionally all four datasets showed annual et in the arb had a significant declining trend over the nine years with declining rates of 8 5 mm year 6 2 mm year 5 9 mm year and 4 0 mm year for dlem modis gleam and mte respectively the dlem simulated monthly river flow was validated against measurements at usgs gauge stations fig 4 nse of dlem simulations reached 0 66 0 65 0 68 0 54 and 0 59 at the five stations of site 07 191 500 chouteau ok site 07 194 500 muskogee ok site 07 263 450 murray dam ar site 07 245 000 canadian river near white field ok and site 07 249 455 fort smith ar nse results indicated that dlem captured the temporal variation of river flow in the arb however pbias was negative at four sites 12 6 at site 07194500 8 3 at site 07263450 23 3 at site 07245000 and 8 8 at site 07249455 and positive at one site 15 4 at site 07191500 pbias results indicated the magnitude of dlem simulated river flow was generally consistent with usgs measurements but with a tendency to overestimate the arb river flow this was likely caused by the diversion of arkansas river water for cropland irrigation and public supply which was not considered in our simulations 3 2 future changes in environmental conditions according to the bias corrected climate data simulated by seven gcms in cmip5 temperature in the arb will increase significantly in both the rcp45 and the rcp85 scenarios throughout the 21st century fig 5 temperature will increase by 1 6 0 29 c and 2 2 0 44 c from the period of 2000 2019 to the period of 2040 2059 in the rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios respectively table 2 and s1 between the first and last 20 year periods in the 21st century temperature will increase by 2 1 0 48 c and 4 7 0 67 c in the rcp45 and the rcp85 scenarios respectively the increasing trend in future temperature is relatively consistent between all the seven gcms fig s7 precipitation will have a different pattern of change to temperature the model ensemble mean results showed that average precipitation in 2040 2059 and 2080 2099 would be lower than that in 2000 2019 table 2 compared to the period of 2000 2019 precipitation in 2040 2059 will decrease by 28 32 9 mm year 3 8 and 28 3 48 8 mm year 3 8 in the rcp45 and the rcp85 respectively compared to the period of 2000 2019 precipitation in 2080 2099 will decrease by 13 1 31 7 mm year 1 8 and 32 7 39 3 mm year 4 4 in the rcp45 and the rcp85 respectively table s1 it is worth noting that the changes in regional precipitation are associated with considerable variations between gcms fig s7 for example in the rcp85 the range of precipitation change between the period of 2080 2099 and the period of 2000 2019 is from 107 7 mm year ipsl cm5a lr to 37 mm year ccsm4 indicating the necessity to include multiple gcms and report the uncertainty range when projecting future river flow regarding the spatial pattern precipitation reduction will occur over most of the arb fig s8 compared to the period of 2000 2019 the reduced precipitation in 2040 2059 will take place in 99 9 of the arb in the rcp45 and 98 1 of the arb in the rcp85 the reduced precipitation in 2080 2099 will take place in 90 6 of the arb in the rcp45 and 91 9 of the arb in the rcp85 precipitation will show a more significnat reduction in the southern arb than the northern arb under both scenarios and the increased precipitation will be primarily in eastern kansas the temporal variations of cropland area in the arb will differ between the ssp2 rcp45 and the ssp5 rcp85 in the ssp2 rcp45 the cropland area will increase from 86 631 km2 in 2000 2019 to 104 765 km2 in 2040 2059 table 2 cropland expansion in this period will primarily happen in the grassland areas fig s9 the cropland area will further increase to 123 356 km2 in 2080 2099 however cropland expansion in this period will be primarily in eastern oklahoma and kansas forest areas in the ssp5 rcp85 the cropland area will be at a relatively stable level of 82 156 km2 over the entire study period co2 concentration will increase continuously at different increasing rates in the rcp45 and the rcp85 fig 4 the average co2 concentration was 388 ppm from 2000 to 2019 in the rcp45 the average co2 concentration will increase to 486 ppm in 2040 2059 and 535 ppm in 2080 2099 compared to the rcp45 co2 concentration in the rcp85 will increase at a faster rate and reach 535 ppm in 2040 2059 and 837 ppm in 2080 2099 atmospheric nitrogen deposition rates in the future will be lower compared to the contemporary period in both the ssp2 rcp45 and the ssp5 rcp85 fig 4 nitrogen deposition in the period of 2000 2019 was 0 88 g n m2 year in the rcp45 the average nitrogen deposition rates will decrease to 0 61 g n m2 year in 2040 2059 and 0 46 g n m2 year in 2080 2099 in the rcp85 the average nitrogen deposition rates will decrease to 0 7 g n m2 year in the 2030 s and be a relatively stable level thereafter the decline in future nitrogen deposition is consistent with the trend over recent two decades as a result of the clean air act and other ruls constraining industrial nitrogen gas emissions gilliam et al 2019 3 3 future evapotranspiration for the arb as a whole the changing trend in regional et will be insignificant during 2000 2099 p value 0 05 m k trend test in both the ssp2 rcp45 and the ssp5 rcp85 fig s10 in the ssp2 rcp45 scenario et in the arb was 608 7 9 3 mm year in 2000 2019 and will be 601 8 16 3 mm year in 2040 2059 and 611 13 2 mm year in 2080 2099 table 3 in the ssp5 rcp85 scenario et in the arb was 605 9 14 mm year in 2000 2019 and will be 601 8 31 5 mm year in 2040 2059 and 609 6 16 1 mm year in 2080 2099 it is apparent that the eastern and western arb with the 98th meridian as the dividing line i e the dotted red line in fig 6 have contrasting patterns of et change table 3 in the eastern arb et in the ssp2 rcp45 scenario will increase by 5 9 mm year during 2040 2059 and 13 3 mm year during 2080 2099 compared to the period of 2000 2019 et in the ssp5 rcp85 scenario will increase by 9 1 mm year during 2040 2059 and 25 9 mm year during 2080 2099 compared to the period of 2000 2019 on the contrary in the western arb et in the ssp2 rcp45 scenario will decrease by 14 7 mm year during 2040 2059 and 4 5 mm year during 2080 2099 compared to the period of 2000 2019 et in the ssp5 rcp85 scenario will decrease by 12 3 mm year during 2040 2059 and 10 2 mm year during 2080 2099 compared to the period of 2000 2019 the eastern arb is a relatively humid region with an aridity index of 0 8 while the western arb is a relatively dry region with an aridity index of 0 32 fig s3 we developed a spatial map of pearson s correlation coefficient between the interannual variations in the dlem simulated et and annual precipitation fig s11 this map shows an increasing trend in the precipitation et correlation from east to west indicating a stronger precipitation impact on et in the western arb than that in the eastern arb according to the budyko curve that describes the geographic difference in annual evapotranspiration in relation to the abundance of annual precipitation and radiation budyko 1951 et is limited by water supply in the dry area and by radiation in the humid zone despite the reduced future precipitation over most of the arb the eastern arb will have an increased et because of the higher evaporative water demand in the atmosphere caused by climate warming in the western arb et will decrease along with the reduced precipitation and limited water supply the different patterns of et change between the eastern arb and the western arb will negate each other resulting in an insignificant et change in the 21st century when considering the entire arb 3 4 future river flow m k trend test showed that annual river flow from 2000 to 2099 will have significant decreasing trends p value less than 0 05 in both the ssp2 rcp45 and the ssp5 rcp85 at the three locations of 1 the usgs site id 07245000 canadian river near white field ok 2 the usgs site id 07194500 muskogee ok and 3 the outlet of the entire arb fig 7 we used the usgs site on the canadian river white field and the usgs site on the arkansas river muskogee to represent river hydrological conditions in the south and north of the arb fig s5 respectively for the canadian river white field changing rates of annual river flow i e sen s slope will be 1 6 107 m3 year in the ssp2 rcp45 and 3 6 107 m3 year in the ssp5 rcp85 for the arkansas river muskogee changing rates of annual river flow will be 4 8 107 m3 year in the ssp2 rcp45 and 1 1 108 m3 year in the ssp5 rcp85 at the outlet of the entire arb changing rates of annual river flow will be 8 5 107 m3 year in the ssp2 rcp45 and 1 9 108 m3 year in the ssp5 rcp85 the declining rate of annual river flow in the ssp5 rcp85 scenario will be 2 2 2 3 times the declining rate in the ssp2 rcp45 scenario at the three locations from the first 20 years to the last 20 years of the 21st century river flow in the ssp2 rcp45 will decrease by 13 4 11 4 and 12 1 at the three locations of the canadian river white field the the arkansas river muskogee and the arb outlet respectively while river flow in the ssp5 rcp85 will decrease by 33 7 27 3 and 27 9 at the three locations respectively table 4 river flow in the canadian river watershed will have a larger percentage reduction than that in the northern arb notably the reduced river flow in the ssp2 rcp45 scenario will take place from the beginning to the middle of the 21st century while the reduced river flow in the ssp5 rcp85 scenario will happen throughout the entire 21st century the shaded area and box plots in fig 7 indicate the general consistency in the decreasing trend of the simulated river flow driven by climate data from 7 gcms for example at the arb outlet in the ssp2 rcp45 simulations driven by 6 climate datasets show declined river flow in the middle of the 21st century and simulations driven by 5 climate datasets show declined river flow by the end of the 21st century additionally in the ssp5 rcp85 simulations driven by 6 climate datasets show declined river flow in the middle of the 21st century and simulations driven by all 7 climate datasets show declined river flow by the end of the 21st century this result consolidates the general declining trend in the arb river flow despite the variations in future climate conditions projected by different gcms the percentage reduction of river flow will show considerable variations over different areas in the arb fig 8 in the ssp2 rcp45 during 2040 2059 the greatest percentage reduction over 20 will happen in the southwestern arb i e the north canadian river the canadian river and the cimarron river to the west of the 99th meridian other areas of the arb will have a reduction in river flow between 10 and 20 fig 8a in the ssp2 rcp45 during 2080 2099 the southwestern arb i e the north canadian river the canadian river and the cimarron river to the west of the 99th meridian will also show the largest percentage reduction of over 20 in river flow the arkansas river to the west of the 97th meridian will have a reduction of 15 20 while other areas of the arb will have a relatively smaller percentage reduction of 10 15 fig 8b in the ssp5 rcp85 during 2040 2059 the largest percentage reduction over 20 will happen in the southwestern arb along the canadian river and the north canadian river the percentage reduction of river flow in the arkansas river will be between 15 and 20 fig 8c in the ssp5 rcp85 during 2080 2099 river channels to the west of the 95th meridian including the arkansas river the north canadian river the canadian river and the cimarron river will have a considerable river flow reduction of over 30 the neosho river will have a decrease of 20 25 and the arkansas river to the east of the 95th meridian will have a reduction of 25 30 fig 8d overall river flow in all river channels of the arb will decline in the 21st century with the most significant reduction in the western particularly the southwestern arb 3 5 contributions of environmental factors by calculating differences between the 49 model simulations table 1 we quantified the contributions of four environmental factors climate change cropland change rising co2 concentration and atmospheric nitrogen deposition to the changed river flow at the arb outlet fig 9 percentage contribution of a specific environmental factor was computed as the ratio of its impact on river flow change to the combined effect of the four time varying environmental factors it is noteworthy that the sum of percentage contributions from the four environmental factors does not equal 100 because the interactions between environmental factors will make contributions to the changed river flow but are not presented here in both the ssp2 rcp45 and the ssp5 rcp85 scenarios climate warming and drying were identified as the primary environmental factors for the decreased river flow contributions of climate change to the decreased river flow in the ssp2 rcp45 will be 85 3 during 2040 2059 and 95 3 during 2080 2099 contributions of climate change to the decreased river flow in the ssp5 rcp85 will be 80 6 during 2040 2059 and 77 1 during 2080 2099 cropland area in the arb will increase continuously in the ssp2 rcp45 but keep at a relatively stable level in the ssp5 rcp85 in the ssp2 rcp45 cropland change will decrease river flow in the first half of the 21st century contributing 5 1 to the reduced river flow in 2040 2059 however the effect of cropland change will reverse in the second half of the 21st century during the period 2080 2099 cropland change will increase the river flow of the arkansas river contributing 17 6 to the overall declining river flow pattern in the ssp5 rcp85 cropland change will have a negligible effect and the contributions of cropland change will be 3 8 in 2040 2099 and 2 2 in 2080 2099 the rising co2 concentration will affect ecosystem hydrological processes by altering leaf stomatal conductance stomatal density and vegetation foliage area gedney et al 2006 liu et al 2018 piao et al 2007 tao et al 2014 our results showed that the rising co2 concentrations would reduce river flow in the arb in the ssp2 rcp45 the rising co2 will contribute 11 8 of the decreased river flow in 2040 2099 and 24 9 of the reduced river flow in 2080 2099 in the ssp5 rcp85 the rising co2 will contribute 11 7 of the reduced river flow in 2040 2099 and 13 6 of the decreased river flow in 2080 2099 atmospheric nitrogen deposition can modulate ecosystem evapotranspiration by affecting vegetation conditions dickinson et al 2002 mao et al 2015 shi et al 2013 in this study we found the changes in future nitrogen deposition will have a relatively minor effect compared to the other three factors the reduced nitrogen deposition will result in lower ecosystem evapotranspiration and then increased river flow in the ssp2 rcp45 contributions of the reduced nitrogen deposition to the decreased river flow will be 2 2 in 2040 2099 and 6 4 in 2080 2099 in the ssp5 rcp85 contributions of the reduced nitrogen deposition to the decreased river flow will be 1 3 in 2040 2099 and 1 in 2080 2099 4 discussion 4 1 mechanisms controlling long term river flow the long term changes of river flow at the decadal scale largely depend on the balance between precipitation and ecosystem et piao et al 2007 variation in precipitation has a direct impact through changing soil moisture and runoff generation our results identified the widespread reduction in precipitation as one major factor for the decreased river flow in the middle and at the end of the 21st century under both the rcp45 and rcp85 scenarios section 3 5 nevertheless future changes in ecosystem et will have a more complex pattern because it can be modulated by weather conditions soil properties vegetation type and ecosystem physiological and structural characteristics mao et al 2015 piao et al 2007 the arb has a large span of aridity in the east west direction our model simulated contrasting patterns of et changes between the western arb and the eastern arb in the context of future climate warming and drying section 3 3 climate warming will cause increases in atmospheric water demand and ecosystem potential et scheff and frierson 2014 in the arid western arb the increased atmospheric water demand will not lead to higher actual et because of the limited water supply under the impacts of reduced precipitation this result is consistent with the declining et in global semiarid regions over recent decades caused by the limited moisture supply jung et al 2010 yang et al 2019b on the contrary the humid eastern arb will have an increased actual et because of the increased atmospheric water demand and sufficient water supply this contrasting et changing pattern can be well explained by budyko s framework which describes the dependence of evapotranspiration on water and energy availability li et al 2013 co2 impacts on evapotranspiration and river flow have not been fully understood c3 and c4 plants have different photosynthesis processes calvin cycle vs hatch and slack cycle and are different in their response to the increased co2 concentration large scale free air co2 enrichment face experiments showed that leaf stomatal conductance decreased with the rising co2 concentration for c3 species but showed little responses for c4 species ainsworth and long 2005 ainsworth and rogers 2007 some studies attributed a considerable part of the increased global river flow in the 20th century to co2 induced reduction in stomatal conductance gedney et al 2006 while other studies indicated that the rising co2 had a limited effect on river flow because co2 can act as a plant fertilizer to increase foliage area and increase plant transpiration piao et al 2007 the arb and the southern great plains have a large fraction of c4 grasses still et al 2003 which make stomatal conductance less sensitive to the rising co2 compared to c3 grasses and forests in our simulations future rising co2 will increase et and decrease river flow in the arb because the positive co2 effect on et through enhancing foliage area will outweigh its negative effect on et through reducing stomatal conductance impacts of land use change on river flow have been investigated over many basins across the globe the general conclusion is that land conversion from forests to croplands and pastures leads to increased river flow e g schilling et al 2010 siriwardena et al 2006 tao et al 2014 zhang and schilling 2006 our analysis on the luh2 land use data hurtt et al 2020 showed that cropland area in the arb will increase in the ssp2 rcp45 scenario but keep at a relatively stable level in the ssp5 rcp85 scenario in the ssp2 scenario global demand for crop and livestock products increases moderately popp et al 2017 leading to the increased cropland area in the arb in the first half of the 21st century cropland expansion in the arb will primarily happen in the grassland area as grassland and cropland have a similar et magnitude yue et al 2022 our results showed that the replacement of grasslands by croplands will have a small impact on river flow however land conversion from forests to croplands after the 2050 s will lead to increased surface runoff and river flow land use pattern in the ssp5 scenario is characterized by moderate tropical deforestation but little changes in north america because agricultural products are not necessarily produced domestically in the globalized world krause et al 2019 popp et al 2017 therefore our simulation showed a minor effect of cropland change on river flow in the ssp5 rcp85 scenario 4 2 implications for water management agricultural irrigation and public supply consumed a large portion of surface water in the arb the demand for water resources is expected to increase during the 21st century given the continued trends in climate warming and population growth vörösmarty et al 2000 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 however the arb is projected to have less river flow and reduced surface water availability particularly in the western and southwestern arb section 3 4 which requires the implementation of effective water management and conservation strategies to meet the growing water demand to maintain long term water resource sustainability it is essential to improve the efficiency and productivity of agricultural irrigation systems evett et al 2020 and apply more conservative indoor and outdoor water use strategies maggioni 2015 a significant amount 30 of surface water withdrawals have been used for irrigation in the arb tortorelli 2009 thus the improvement in irrigation efficiency is a potential strategy to adapt to the reduced river flow in 2018 over 85 of the irrigated area in the southern high plains used the center pivot sprinkler irrigation system in kansas the irrigated land area with a center pivot sprinkler irrigation system increased from 50 to 92 during 1990 2012 evett et al 2020 rogers and lamm 2008 this irrigation system has greatly improved water use efficiency compared to the traditional gravity irrigation system levidow et al 2014 to further improve irrigation efficiency it could be necessary to adopt more efficient irrigation strategies such as the subsurface drip irrigation system lamm et al 2012 more accurate irrigation scheduling gu et al 2020 and precision irrigation systems to place water where it can be effectively used by crops evett et al 2020 additionally genetic modification is being widely studied to develop new crop cultivars with improved drought tolerance but without yield penalty khan et al 2019 in the future planting drought tolerant crop cultivars could be a helpful strategy to reduce irrigation water use and maintain agricultural sustainability in the arb conservative household water use strategies could be of particular importance for cities in the canadian river basin such as the oklahoma city metropolitan area which will experience more severe river flow reduction than the other watersheds for household water use the current drought related prescriptive policies and price based water conservation strategies wichman et al 2016 may become the norm in the future since outdoor water uses are more elastic mansur and olmstead 2012 the prescriptive policy limiting outdoor irrigation can be effective in reducing the household level of water use maggioni 2015 additionally price based regulation and water conservation incentives can be effective for urban water conservation lee et al 2013 olmstead and stavins 2009 low income households could be more sensitive to price and incentive conservation strategies while prescriptive policies have uniform responses across all household income levels wichman et al 2016 4 3 uncertainties and future needs we used dlem to simulate arb river flow dynamics in the 21st century driven by a series of environmental factors future climate data is one of the major uncertainty sources in this study it is known that gcms produced divergent future climate patterns which come from the incomplete representation of regional scale processes inadequate parameterization skills imperfect initial conditions and relatively coarse resolution almazroui et al 2021 thus we included future climate data simulated by seven gcms in the cmip5 project to drive dlem and reported the standard deviation to document the uncertainty in the projected river flow due to the divergencies in future climate projection it is necessary to keep in mind that some natural and anthropogenic factors that could affect arb hydrological processes were not included in this study as this study intended to project river flow without much human intervention river water diversion for irrigation and dam effect were not considered we acknowledge that river water diversion and dam construction can strongly affect river flow especially in the arid and semiarid regions kondolf and batalla 2005 if these factors are included river flow reduction could be larger than our estimates woody plant encroachment wpe into the arid and semiarid grasslands is a global phenomenon with critical hydrological consequences e g huxman et al 2005 qiao et al 2015 schreiner mcgraw et al 2020 zou et al 2015 compared to the original grasslands wpe species have a higher transpiration which reduces surface runoff and surface water availability eastern redcedar juniper juniperus virginiana and honey mesquite mesquite prosopis glandulosa are the two most common wpe species in the arb and the southern great plains in oklahoma juniper forests expand at a rate of 40 km2 year over recent decades wang et al 2018 it is expected that woody plants will continue to encroach into the grasslands in the arb in the future but its expansion rate is subject to large uncertainties due to the changed climate conditions fire regimes and human willingness and management strategies to control wpe if wpe impacts on ecosystem hydrological processes are considered river flow in the arb may be further reduced likewise government policies on biofuels and tree planting for increased carbon storage are unknown factors related to future land use change that may influence runoff and river flows our results in this study represent a conservative estimate of future river flow reduction given the limitations in our study we recommend the following future research directions in the ssp2 and ssp5 scenarios cropland area in the arb will increase or keep stable at the current level which is not consistent with the declining trend of cropland area in the u s and the great plains over recent decades yu and lu 2018 one future research direction is to include new land use change scenarios with continuously decreased cropland area to evaluate land use change impacts on regional water and other ecological processes dams river water diversion and woody plant encroachment are expected to change regional hydrological processes in the arb but are not included in this study we suggest future work to investigate to which extent human activities and woody plant encroachment would affect river flow additionally it is necessary to examine the impacts of future river flow decline on the habitats of critical aquatic species and the reliability of water supply reservoirs 5 conclusions in this study we projected future river flow changes in the arb using a process based ecosystem model under two climate and socioeconomic scenarios our results showed that river flow in the arb will decrease significantly in the 21st century under both the ssp2 rcp45 and the ssp5 rcp85 scenarios in the ssp2 rcp45 the river flow decline will take place from the beginning to the middle of this century in the ssp5 rcp85 river flow decline will happen across the entire simulation priod compared to the period of 2000 2019 arkansas river flow at the end of the 21st century will decrease by 12 1 in the ssp2 rcp45 and 27 9 in the ssp5 rcp85 most importantly river flow decline will happen in all the major rivers with the largest percentage reduction in the western and southwestern arb climate warming and drying will be the primary factors accounting for this reduction the reduced water availability and growing water demand will require conservative water use strategies and improved agricultural irrigation efficiency to maintain water resource sustainability credit authorship contribution statement jia yang
