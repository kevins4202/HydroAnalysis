keywords earthquake induced hydrodynamic force wave force finite element method elliptical absorbing boundary condition multiple cylinders 1 introduction more and more deep water bridges have been constructed around the world in recent years especially in china which makes seismic design of bridges in deep water become an urgent research topic because of these bridges usually located in zones with high seismic intensity moreover wave action may be applied simultaneously with earthquake to bridges in deep water thus the dynamic responses of bridge piers surrounded by deep water require special considerations because of the fluid structure interaction it is well known that it produces an additional hydrodynamic force on the structure when it vibrates in water the additional hydrodynamic force could modify the dynamic properties of the structure and result in structural damage and the wave force has the potential to cause further damage on bridge piers consequently it is important to investigate the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces and wave forces on bridge piers earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces on structures have been studied for decades since westergaard 1933 investigated the interaction between water with gravity dams and jacobsen 1949 investigated the interaction between cylindrical tanks with inside water under horizontal ground excitation the significance of hydrodynamic pressures on the earthquake response of cantilever circular cylinders was initially investigated by liaw and chopra 1974 the authors discovered that water compressibility was negligible for slender cylinders but important for squat cylinders vibrating at high frequency and the surface waves was significant only at very low frequencies therefore water compressibility and surface waves are neglected in the present study when solving the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces then the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces on a single cylinder are investigated by many researchers williams 1986 and tanaka and hudspeth 1988 furtherly studied the dynamic response of a single circular cylinder subjected to high frequency horizontal ground excitation these results illustrate that the presence of the surrounding water can decrease the natural frequencies of the cylinders and effects of surrounding water can be conveniently modeled as the product of a hypothetical mass of water and the acceleration of the structure assuming cylinders rigid the simplified procedure to evaluate the added hydrodynamic mass of single circular elliptical round ended and rectangular cylinders are developed by goyal and chopra 1989 du et al 2014 li and yang 2013 and wang et al 2018a 2019b based on the fundamental frequency reduction rate the simplified formulas for calculating the added hydrodynamic mass of single circular elliptical round ended and rectangular cylinders are developed by han and xu 1996 yang and li 2013 and wang et al 2019a the results indicate that the added mass caused by flexible motion is much less than that caused by rigid motion considering water compressibility wang et al 2018b proposed an accurate and efficient time domain model to replace the 3d infinite water layer in the water cylinder interaction analysis in addition the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces on axisymmetric cylinders were investigated by liaw and chopra 1975 sun and nogami 1991 park et al 1991 avilés and li 2001 wei et al 2015 and wang et al 2018c wave forces on a single vertical cylinder also have been investigated by many researchers morison et al 1950 proposed a semi empirical and semi theoretical formula to estimate the wave forces acting on slender structures the morison equation is made up of a drag force to the square of the velocity and a virtual mass force proportional to the horizontal component of the accelerative force exerted on the mass of water displaced by the cylinder which has been widely used in research and engineering another method to calculate the wave forces on structures is the diffraction wave theory the diffraction wave theory formulated by maccamy and fuchs 1954 has been extensively used to evaluate the wave forces on large circular cylinders immersed in water by many investigators chen and mei 1973 williams 1985 and bhatta 2005 proposed analytical solutions to calculate the wave forces on elliptical cylinders subjected to linear plane waves liu et al 2016 presented an analytical method to calculate the linear wave forces on uniform bottom mounted cylinder with an arbitrary smooth cross section which is simple and accurate to estimate the wave force for the structure design in recent years the scaled boundary finite method 2003 where only the surface boundary was discretized with curved finite elements was developed for wave interaction with cylindrical structures of arbitrary shapes by li et al 2006 song et al 2010 and meng and zou 2012 the solution is analytical in the radial direction while it is numerical in the circumferential direction however only a few studies have been carried out to analyze the hydrodynamic interaction of multiple structures subjected to earthquake motion and incident waves the hydrodynamic interactions between a pair of flexible circular cylinders subjected to horizontal ground motion were investigated by liao 1985 and williams 1987 it was found that the difference of the responses between the single cylinder case and two cylinders case becomes greater as the relative distance decreases wei et al 2013 conducted an experimental program to investigate the effects of fluid structure interaction on the dynamic response of bridge pile foundations submerged partially or totally in water the results indicated that the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces can significantly affect the seismic response of the bridge pile foundations in addition the analytical solutions were presented to investigate the interaction of waves with a row of circular cylinders by linton and evans 1993 and interaction of waves with multiple vertical circular cylinders by kim 1993 it is found that the wave force on multiple structures is quite different from that of a single structure due to the interaction between structures overall the hydrodynamic interaction of multiple structures subjected to earthquake motion or incident waves has not been well understood since most often offshore bridges supported by pile group foundations have multiple circular cylinders and this interaction is selected as the topic of investigation reported herein the influence of neighboring cylinder on the total radiation field and scattered field may lead to earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces and wave forces on the individual structures that differ significantly from the forces they each would experience in isolation liao 1985 linton and evans 1993 numerical models are presented to solve the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces and wave forces on multiple circular cylinders in the present study to solve this problem efficiently and accurately the whole unbounded fluid where the problem is defined into the finite domain and the infinite domain the finite domain is simulated by the finite element method fem the infinite domain is simulated by an elliptical absorbing boundary condition abc which is applied to the virtual boundary of the finite domain to simulate the wave radiation effect of the truncated infinite domain 2 earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid multiple circular cylinders assumed to be rigid are situated in water of uniform depth h the radius of the ith cylinder is a i and the global cartesian coordinate system x y z is defined with an origin located on the seabed level with the z axis directed vertically upwards as shown in fig 1 the center of ith cylinder at x i y i is taken as the origin of a local polar coordinate system r i θ i where θ i is measured counterclockwise from the positive x axis the system is initially at rest the rigid foundation has an earthquake motion of the displacement time history u 0 t whose direction is of an angle α to the positive x axis where t denotes the time 2 1 governing equation and boundary conditions the governing equation in the fluid domain is the laplace equation which in cartesian coordinate is 1 2 p x 2 2 p y 2 2 p z 2 0 where p is the hydrodynamic pressure according to li and yang 2013 free surface waves have less effect on the hydrodynamic force on cylinders in deep water when the earthquake frequency is higher liaw and chopra 1974 also found that free surface waves have little effects on the earthquake response of cylinders surrounded by water which mainly because that the frequencies of the seismic ground motions are usually high therefore free surface waves are not assumed to be generated in solving the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces which is expressed as 2 p z z h 0 the seabed boundary condition and cylinder surfaces boundary condition are summarized as follows 3 p z z 0 0 4 p r i r i a i ρ 2 u 0 2 t cos α θ where ρ is the fluid density in addition the radiation pressure waves propagate away from the structure and decay with the traveling distance the hydrodynamic pressure p in frequency domain can be obtained through fourier transformation by p p e i ω t d t

seabed boundary condition eq 3 are satisfied automatically where λ j 2 j 1 π 2 h the radiation problem is then governed by a two dimensional helmholtz equation with the boundary conditions on the surface of the cylinder 6 2 p j x 2 2 p j y 2 λ j 2 p j 0 7 p j r i r i a i 2 ρ ω 2 1 j 1 u 0 h λ j cos α θ where u 0 denotes the displacement in frequency domain which is obtained through fourier transformation by u 0 u 0 e i ω t d t as shown in fig 2 to model the fluid domain efficiently the whole fluid domain is divided into two subdomains the bounded domain ω1 surrounding the cylinder with the outer elliptical boundary surface γ c with semi major and semi minor axes r a and r b from the origin and unbounded domain ω2 outside of ω1 here the bounded domain is modeled by the finite element method and the unbounded domain is represented by the exact absorbing boundary condition 2 2 elliptical absorbing boundary condition based on the elliptical coordinate system wang et al 2018a 2019a 2019c derived the analytical solution for earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces and wave forces on single elliptical cylinder surrounded by water the elliptical coordinate system is depicted in fig 3 for the elliptical absorbing boundary with semi major and semi minor axes r a and r b the two dimensional helmholtz equation eq 6 in the elliptical coordinate system can be expressed as 8 2 μ 2 cosh 2

investigate the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces and wave forces on pile group with two piles three piles and four piles as shown in fig 4 china ministry of transportation 2013 where d denotes the distance between two adjacent piles two dimensionless parameters namely relative distance dr and width to depth ratio l are introduced which are defined as 36 d r d 2 a 37 l 2 a h according to the code of hydrology for sea harbor china ministry of transportation 2013 the relative distance is about in the range of 0 5 dr 3 therefore the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces and wave forces on pile group are investigated in the range of 0 5 dr 3 in this study 4 1 earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces on pile group to test and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method the cases of a single pile and two piles are verified fig 5 is a comparison of the hydrodynamic force on a circular cylinder with α 0 computed by the present method and the analytical solution liaw and chopra 1974 it can be seen that the proposed method and analytical solutions have a good agreement in addition the el centro wave earthquake motion along x direction shown in fig 6 is used to calculate the total hydrodynamic force on pile group with two piles where the present method and the coupled acoustic structural method in abaqus are adopted fig 7 shows the total hydrodynamic force obtained by the present method and the coupled acoustic structural method in abaqus where a 2 m h 20 m and d 4 m it can be seen that the proposed model agrees well with that by the coupled acoustic structural method the hydrodynamic forces on the cylinders caused by surrounding water can be conveniently modeled as the product of an added mass of water and the acceleration of the structure correspondingly the uniform added mass for ith pile of pile group along the x axis and y axis can be obtained by m i x f i x e h ω 2 u 0 cos α and m i y f i y e h ω 2 u 0 sin α respectively furtherly the uniform added mass for a certain pile of pile group m i x and m i y can be expressed as 38 m i x c e x n m s x 39 m i y c e y n m s x where c e x n and c e y n are the coefficients of pile group for the added mass along the x axis and y axis superscript n denotes the number of pules and m s x is the uniform added mass for a single pile the uniform added mass for a certain pile of pile group can be obtained by the present method and uniform added mass for a single pile is obtained by analytical solution then the coefficients of pile group can be obtained by c e x n m i x m s x and c e y n m i y m s x the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces on two adjacent piles are firstly investigated it should be noted that the hydrodynamic forces on the left and right piles are consistent due to the symmetry of the loading in the case figs 8 and 9 show the coefficients of pile group c e x 2 and c e y 2 respectively it is obvious that the interaction of water with multiple piles have significant influence on the hydrodynamic forces and this influence decrease as relative distance dr increasing and wide depth ratio l increasing compared with a single pile the interaction of water with multiple piles decreases the hydrodynamic forces along the x axis and increases the hydrodynamic forces along the y axis in order to provide convenience for engineering applications the mathematical expressions of the numerical results for the coefficients of pile group can be obtained by curve fitting the simplified formulas of c e x 2 and c e y 2 are written as 40 c e x 2 τ 11 l τ 12 τ 13 41a τ 11 0 302 d r 0 235 0 412 41b τ 12 0 475 d r 0 178 0 0485 41c τ 13 4 38 d r 0 0338 5 19 42 c e y 2 τ 21 l τ 22 τ 23 43a τ 21 0 169 d r 1 536 0 009 43b τ 22 0 102 d r 0 841 0 362 43c τ 23 0 205 d r 1 48 0 98 the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces on three adjacent piles are secondly investigated the hydrodynamic forces on the left and right piles are consistent while hydrodynamic forces on the middle pile are different in the case for the hydrodynamic forces along the x axis the coefficients of pile group c e x 3 for the side and middle piles are shown in fig 10 a and 10b respectively for the hydrodynamic forces along the y axis the coefficients of pile group c e y 3 for the side and middle piles are shown in fig 11 a and 11b respectively compared with a single pile the interaction of water with multiple piles decreases the hydrodynamic forces along the x axis and increases the hydrodynamic forces along the y axis it should be noted that the interaction of water with multiple piles has more significant influence on the middle pile than the side pile for side pile the simplified formulas of c e x 3 and c e y 3 are written as 44 c e x 3 τ 31 l τ 32 τ 33 45a τ 31 0 15 d r 0 464 0 288 45b τ 32 2 75 d r 0 0371 2 287 45c τ 33 0 98 d r 0 156 0 22 46 c e y 3 τ 41 l τ 42 τ 43 47a τ 41 0 21 d r 1 735 0 0017 47b τ 42 0 129 d r 0 792 0 372 47c τ 43 0 241 d r 1 708 0 99 4 2 for middle pile the simplified formulas of c e x 3 and c e y 3 are written as 48 c e x 3 τ 51 l τ 52 τ 53 49a τ 51 0 0987 d r 0 787 0 272 49b τ 52 0 557 d r 0 349 0 0287 49c τ 53 2 832 d r 0 09 3 521 50 c e y 3 τ 61 l τ 62 τ 63 51a τ 61 0 32 d r 3 452 0 076 51b τ 62 0 246 d r 0 66 0 432 51c τ 63 0 363 d r 3 326 1 076 the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces on four adjacent piles are thirdly investigated the coefficients of pile group c e x 4 c e y 4 for the four piles are consistent in the case as shown in fig 12 compared with a single pile the interaction of water with multiple piles decreases the hydrodynamic forces the simplified formula of c e x 4 is written as 52 c e x 4 τ 71 l τ 72 τ 73 53a τ 71 0 0606 d r 0 348 0 1 53b τ 72 0 0395 d r 0 5 0 316 53c τ 73 0 358 d r 0 177 0 537 it also can be concluded from figs 8 12 that effects of the interaction of water with multiple piles on the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces can be neglected when the relative distance dr between two adjacent piles is larger than three fig 13 shows the coefficients of pile group c e y 2 calculated by numerical method and the simplified formulas it can be seen that the simplified formulas agree well with the numerical solutions it should be noted that the applicable range of these simplified formulas proposed in this study are 0 2 l 2 and 0 5 dr 3 in that range higher precision can be assured 4 3 wave forces on pile group to test and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method the problem of fluid with a circular cylinder is firstly verified fig 14 is a comparison of wave forces on circular cylinder with incident wave angle β 0 computed by the present method and the analytical solution maccamy and fuchs 1954 it can be seen that the proposed method and analytical solutions have a good agreement in addition the three dimensional finite element model presented by yue et al 1978 are adopted to verify the present model fig 15 shows the wave forces on pile group with two piles where ka 0 6 β 0 a 2 m h 20 m and d 4 m it can be seen that the proposed model agrees well with that by the method presented by yue et al 1978 the total wave forces on a certain pile of pile group f i t w can be expressed as 54 f i t w c w f s t w where c w is the coefficient of pile group and f s t w is the total wave forces on a single pile the total wave forces on a certain pile of pile group are obtained by the present method and the total wave forces on a single pile are obtained by analytical solution then the coefficient of pile group can be obtained by c w f i t w f s t w the wave forces on two adjacent piles are firstly investigated in the case of incident waves propagating along the x direction the coefficients c w for the left and right piles are quite different due to the phase difference which are shown in fig 16 a and b it can be seen that the interaction of waves with multiple piles have significant influence on the wave forces this influence will be quite different when the wave number ka and relative distance dr is changed the coefficients c w for the left and right piles are quite different in the case of incident waves propagating along the x direction while they are consistent in the case of incident waves propagating along the y direction as shown in fig 17 it can be seen that the interaction of waves with multiple piles is significant when the relative distance dr is 0 5 while the influence is small when dr is larger than 1 5 the wave forces on three adjacent piles are secondly investigated in the case of incident waves propagating along the x direction the coefficients c w for the left middle and right piles are quite different as shown in fig 18 a b and 18c in the case of incident waves propagating along the y direction the coefficients c w for the left and right piles are the same while the coefficients c w for the middle pile are different as shown in fig 19 a and b it also can be seen that interaction of waves with multiple piles has more obvious influence on the middle pile this is mainly because that the middle pile suffers more radiation waves kim 1993 the wave forces on four adjacent piles are thirdly investigated where the wave forces on the front piles will be quite different due to the phase difference along the direction of propagation of waves fig 20 a and b shows the coefficients c w for the front and back piles respectively it can be seen that the coefficients c w for the front and back piles are quite different as shown in figs 16 18 and 20 the coefficients c w for the left or front and right or piles are quite different the reason leads to the phenomenon will be analyzed by the total wave forces f w on each pile in the case of four piles it should be noted that the wave forces on each pile are the sum of incident diffraction and radiation wave forces kim 1993 therefore the amplitude of the wave forces f w can be written as 55 f w f r 2 f i 2 f r i f r r 2 f i i f i r 2 where fr and fi are the real and imaginary parts of the total wave forces f w fri and fii are the real and imaginary parts of the wave forces due to the incident waves and frr and fir are the real and imaginary parts of the wave forces due to the diffraction and radiation wave forces fig 21 a shows the real part of the wave forces fr fri and frr versus wave numbers ka and fig 21b shows the imaginary part of the wave forces fi fii and fir versus wave numbers ka it can be seen that the wave forces fii and fir on the front and back piles are the same while the wave forces fri and frr on the front and back piles have the same value in opposite direction this is the reason causing the wave forces frr and fir on the front and back piles different in general the wave forces fr and fi on the front pile are larger than those on back piles when the wave numbers ka are small while the result is the opposite when the wave numbers ka are large therefore the interaction of waves with four piles has more influence on back piles when the wave numbers ka are small while it has more obvious influence on the front pile when the wave numbers ka are large 5 conclusions the finite element technique incorporating the matching analytical boundary series solutions is applied to evaluate the hydrodynamic forces and wave forces on multiple cylinders surrounded by water in the present study where the boundary value problem is reduced into two dimensions and the elliptical exact artificial boundary condition is used to simulate the unbounded domain the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed models are very high based on the proposed method the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces and wave forces on pile group with two piles three piles and four piles are investigated where the coefficients of pile group are given the following conclusions can be drawn 1 interaction of water with multiple piles has significant influence on the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces when the piles are in close proximity this influence decreases as relative distance and wide depth ratio increasing and it can be neglected when the relative distance between two adjacent piles is larger than three 2 the simplified formulas of the coefficients of pile group for earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces are proposed by curve fitting method the simplified formulas which are simple expression and easy in calculating are only relevant to width depth ratio and relative distance 3 interaction of waves with multiple piles has significant influence on the wave forces and this influence is quite different when the pile number wave number relative distance or incident angle is changed acknowledgements this work was jointly funded by national natural science foundation of china 51708010

keywords earthquake induced hydrodynamic force wave force finite element method elliptical absorbing boundary condition multiple cylinders 1 introduction more and more deep water bridges have been constructed around the world in recent years especially in china which makes seismic design of bridges in deep water become an urgent research topic because of these bridges usually located in zones with high seismic intensity moreover wave action may be applied simultaneously with earthquake to bridges in deep water thus the dynamic responses of bridge piers surrounded by deep water require special considerations because of the fluid structure interaction it is well known that it produces an additional hydrodynamic force on the structure when it vibrates in water the additional hydrodynamic force could modify the dynamic properties of the structure and result in structural damage and the wave force has the potential to cause further damage on bridge piers consequently it is important to investigate the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces and wave forces on bridge piers earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces on structures have been studied for decades since westergaard 1933 investigated the interaction between water with gravity dams and jacobsen 1949 investigated the interaction between cylindrical tanks with inside water under horizontal ground excitation the significance of hydrodynamic pressures on the earthquake response of cantilever circular cylinders was initially investigated by liaw and chopra 1974 the authors discovered that water compressibility was negligible for slender cylinders but important for squat cylinders vibrating at high frequency and the surface waves was significant only at very low frequencies therefore water compressibility and surface waves are neglected in the present study when solving the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces then the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces on a single cylinder are investigated by many researchers williams 1986 and tanaka and hudspeth 1988 furtherly studied the dynamic response of a single circular cylinder subjected to high frequency horizontal ground excitation these results illustrate that the presence of the surrounding water can decrease the natural frequencies of the cylinders and effects of surrounding water can be conveniently modeled as the product of a hypothetical mass of water and the acceleration of the structure assuming cylinders rigid the simplified procedure to evaluate the added hydrodynamic mass of single circular elliptical round ended and rectangular cylinders are developed by goyal and chopra 1989 du et al 2014 li and yang 2013 and wang et al 2018a 2019b based on the fundamental frequency reduction rate the simplified formulas for calculating the added hydrodynamic mass of single circular elliptical round ended and rectangular cylinders are developed by han and xu 1996 yang and li 2013 and wang et al 2019a the results indicate that the added mass caused by flexible motion is much less than that caused by rigid motion considering water compressibility wang et al 2018b proposed an accurate and efficient time domain model to replace the 3d infinite water layer in the water cylinder interaction analysis in addition the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces on axisymmetric cylinders were investigated by liaw and chopra 1975 sun and nogami 1991 park et al 1991 avilés and li 2001 wei et al 2015 and wang et al 2018c wave forces on a single vertical cylinder also have been investigated by many researchers morison et al 1950 proposed a semi empirical and semi theoretical formula to estimate the wave forces acting on slender structures the morison equation is made up of a drag force to the square of the velocity and a virtual mass force proportional to the horizontal component of the accelerative force exerted on the mass of water displaced by the cylinder which has been widely used in research and engineering another method to calculate the wave forces on structures is the diffraction wave theory the diffraction wave theory formulated by maccamy and fuchs 1954 has been extensively used to evaluate the wave forces on large circular cylinders immersed in water by many investigators chen and mei 1973 williams 1985 and bhatta 2005 proposed analytical solutions to calculate the wave forces on elliptical cylinders subjected to linear plane waves liu et al 2016 presented an analytical method to calculate the linear wave forces on uniform bottom mounted cylinder with an arbitrary smooth cross section which is simple and accurate to estimate the wave force for the structure design in recent years the scaled boundary finite method 2003 where only the surface boundary was discretized with curved finite elements was developed for wave interaction with cylindrical structures of arbitrary shapes by li et al 2006 song et al 2010 and meng and zou 2012 the solution is analytical in the radial direction while it is numerical in the circumferential direction however only a few studies have been carried out to analyze the hydrodynamic interaction of multiple structures subjected to earthquake motion and incident waves the hydrodynamic interactions between a pair of flexible circular cylinders subjected to horizontal ground motion were investigated by liao 1985 and williams 1987 it was found that the difference of the responses between the single cylinder case and two cylinders case becomes greater as the relative distance decreases wei et al 2013 conducted an experimental program to investigate the effects of fluid structure interaction on the dynamic response of bridge pile foundations submerged partially or totally in water the results indicated that the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces can significantly affect the seismic response of the bridge pile foundations in addition the analytical solutions were presented to investigate the interaction of waves with a row of circular cylinders by linton and evans 1993 and interaction of waves with multiple vertical circular cylinders by kim 1993 it is found that the wave force on multiple structures is quite different from that of a single structure due to the interaction between structures overall the hydrodynamic interaction of multiple structures subjected to earthquake motion or incident waves has not been well understood since most often offshore bridges supported by pile group foundations have multiple circular cylinders and this interaction is selected as the topic of investigation reported herein the influence of neighboring cylinder on the total radiation field and scattered field may lead to earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces and wave forces on the individual structures that differ significantly from the forces they each would experience in isolation liao 1985 linton and evans 1993 numerical models are presented to solve the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces and wave forces on multiple circular cylinders in the present study to solve this problem efficiently and accurately the whole unbounded fluid where the problem is defined into the finite domain and the infinite domain the finite domain is simulated by the finite element method fem the infinite domain is simulated by an elliptical absorbing boundary condition abc which is applied to the virtual boundary of the finite domain to simulate the wave radiation effect of the truncated infinite domain 2 earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid multiple circular cylinders assumed to be rigid are situated in water of uniform depth h the radius of the ith cylinder is a i and the global cartesian coordinate system x y z is defined with an origin located on the seabed level with the z axis directed vertically upwards as shown in fig 1 the center of ith cylinder at x i y i is taken as the origin of a local polar coordinate system r i θ i where θ i is measured counterclockwise from the positive x axis the system is initially at rest the rigid foundation has an earthquake motion of the displacement time history u 0 t whose direction is of an angle α

x 2 2 p y 2 2 p z 2 0 where p is the hydrodynamic pressure according to li and yang 2013 free surface waves have less effect on the hydrodynamic force on cylinders in deep water when the earthquake frequency is higher liaw and chopra 1974 also found that free surface waves have little effects on the earthquake response of cylinders surrounded by water which mainly because that the frequencies of the seismic ground motions are usually high therefore free surface waves are not assumed to be generated in solving the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces which is expressed as 2 p z z h 0 the seabed boundary condition and cylinder surfaces boundary condition are summarized as follows 3 p z z 0 0 4 p r i r i a i ρ 2 u 0 2 t cos α θ where ρ is the fluid density in addition the radiation

transformation by u 0 u 0 e i ω t d t as shown in fig 2 to model the fluid domain efficiently the whole fluid domain is divided into two subdomains the bounded domain ω1 surrounding the cylinder with the outer elliptical boundary surface γ c with semi major and semi minor axes r a and r b from the origin and unbounded domain ω2 outside of ω1 here the bounded domain is modeled by the finite element method and the unbounded domain is represented by the exact absorbing boundary condition 2 2 elliptical absorbing boundary condition based on the elliptical coordinate system wang et al 2018a 2019a 2019c derived the analytical solution for earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces and wave forces on single elliptical cylinder surrounded by water the elliptical coordinate system is depicted in fig 3

investigate the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces and wave forces on pile group with two piles three piles and four piles as shown in fig 4 china ministry of transportation 2013 where d denotes the distance between two adjacent piles two dimensionless parameters namely relative distance dr and width to depth ratio l are introduced which are defined as 36 d r d 2 a 37 l 2 a h according to the code of hydrology for sea harbor china ministry of transportation 2013 the relative distance is about in the range of 0 5 dr 3 therefore the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces and wave forces on pile group are investigated in the range of 0 5 dr 3 in this study 4 1 earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces on pile group to test and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method the cases of a single pile and two piles are verified fig 5 is a comparison of the hydrodynamic force on a circular cylinder with α 0 computed by the present method and the analytical solution liaw and chopra 1974 it can be seen that the proposed method and analytical solutions have a good agreement in addition the el centro wave earthquake motion along x direction shown in fig 6 is used to calculate the total hydrodynamic force on pile group with two piles where the present method and the coupled acoustic structural method in abaqus are adopted fig 7 shows the total hydrodynamic force obtained by the present method and the coupled acoustic structural method in abaqus where a 2 m h 20 m and d 4 m it can be seen that the proposed model agrees well with that by the coupled acoustic structural method the hydrodynamic forces on the cylinders caused by surrounding water can be conveniently modeled as the product of an added mass of water and the acceleration of the structure correspondingly the uniform added mass for ith pile of pile group along the x axis and y axis can be obtained by m i x f i x e h ω 2 u 0 cos α and m i y f i y e h ω 2 u 0 sin α respectively furtherly the uniform added mass for a certain pile of pile group m i x and m i y can be expressed as 38 m i x c e x n m s x 39 m i y c e y n m s x where c e x n and c e y n are the coefficients of pile group for the added mass along the x axis and y axis superscript n denotes the number of pules and m s x is the uniform added mass for a single pile the uniform added mass for a certain pile of pile group can be obtained by the present method and uniform added mass for a single pile is obtained by analytical solution then the coefficients of pile group can be obtained by c e x n m i x m s x and c e y n m i y m s x the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces on two adjacent piles are firstly investigated it should be noted that the hydrodynamic forces on the left and right piles are consistent due to the symmetry of the loading in the case figs 8 and 9 show the coefficients of pile group c e x 2 and c e y 2 respectively it is obvious that the interaction of water with multiple piles have significant influence on the hydrodynamic forces and this influence decrease as relative distance dr increasing and wide depth ratio l increasing compared with a single pile the interaction of water with multiple piles decreases the hydrodynamic forces along the x axis and increases the hydrodynamic forces along the y axis in order to provide convenience for engineering applications the mathematical expressions of the numerical results for the coefficients of pile group can be obtained by curve fitting the simplified formulas of c e x 2 and c e y 2 are written as 40 c e x 2 τ 11 l τ 12 τ 13 41a τ 11 0 302 d r 0

earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces on three adjacent piles are secondly investigated the hydrodynamic forces on the left and right piles are consistent while hydrodynamic forces on the middle pile are different in the case for the hydrodynamic forces along the x axis the coefficients of pile group c e x 3 for the side and middle piles are shown in fig 10 a and 10b respectively for the hydrodynamic forces along the y axis the coefficients of pile group c e y 3 for the side and middle piles are shown in fig 11 a and 11b respectively compared with a single pile the interaction of water with multiple piles decreases the hydrodynamic forces along the x axis and increases the hydrodynamic forces along the y axis it should be noted that the interaction of water with multiple piles has more significant influence on the middle pile than the side pile for side pile the simplified formulas of c e x 3 and c e y 3 are written as 44 c e x 3 τ 31 l τ 32 τ 33 45a τ 31 0 15 d r 0 464 0

pile the simplified formulas of c e x 3 and c e y 3 are written as 48 c e x 3 τ 51 l τ 52 τ 53 49a τ 51 0 0987 d r 0 787 0 272 49b τ 52 0 557 d r 0 349 0 0287 49c τ 53 2 832 d r 0 09 3 521 50 c e y 3

the coefficients of pile group c e x 4 c e y 4 for the four piles are consistent in the case as shown in fig 12 compared with a single pile the interaction of water with multiple piles decreases the hydrodynamic forces the simplified formula of c e x 4 is written as 52 c e x 4 τ 71 l τ 72 τ 73 53a τ 71 0 0606 d r 0 348 0 1 53b τ 72 0 0395 d r 0 5 0 316 53c τ 73 0 358 d r 0 177 0 537 it also can be concluded from figs 8 12 that effects of the interaction of water with multiple piles on the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces can be neglected when the relative distance dr between two adjacent piles is larger than three fig 13 shows the coefficients of pile group c e y 2 calculated by numerical method and the simplified formulas it can be seen that the simplified formulas agree well with the numerical solutions it should be noted that the applicable range of these simplified formulas proposed in this study are 0 2 l 2 and 0 5 dr 3 in that range higher precision can be assured 4 3 wave forces on pile group to test and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method the problem of fluid with a circular cylinder is firstly verified fig 14 is a comparison of wave forces on circular cylinder with incident wave angle β 0 computed by the present method and the analytical solution maccamy and fuchs 1954 it can be seen that the proposed method and analytical solutions have a good agreement in addition the three dimensional finite element model presented by yue et al 1978 are adopted to verify the present model fig 15 shows the wave forces on pile group with two piles where ka 0 6 β 0 a 2 m h 20 m and d 4 m it can be seen that the proposed model agrees well with that by the method presented by yue et al 1978 the total wave forces on a certain pile of pile group f i t w can be expressed as 54 f i t w c w f s t w where c w is the coefficient of pile group and f s t w is the total wave forces on a single pile the total wave forces on a certain pile of pile group are obtained by the present method and the total wave forces on a single pile are obtained by analytical solution then the coefficient of pile group can be obtained by c w f i t w f s t w the wave forces on two adjacent piles are firstly investigated in the case of incident waves propagating along the x direction the coefficients c w for the left and right piles are quite different due to the phase difference which are shown in fig 16 a and b it can be seen that the interaction of waves with multiple piles have significant influence on the wave forces this influence will be quite different when the wave number ka and relative distance dr is changed the coefficients c w for the left and right piles are quite different in the case of incident waves propagating along the x direction while they are consistent in the case of incident waves propagating along the y direction as shown in fig 17 it can be seen that the interaction of waves with multiple piles is significant when the relative distance dr is 0 5 while the influence is small when dr is larger than 1 5 the wave forces on three adjacent piles are secondly investigated in the case of incident waves propagating along the x direction the coefficients c w for the left middle and right piles are quite different as shown in fig 18 a b and 18c in the case of incident waves propagating along the y direction the coefficients c w for the left and right piles are the same while the coefficients c w for the middle pile are different as shown in fig 19 a and b it also can be seen that interaction of waves with multiple piles has more obvious influence on the middle pile this is mainly because that the middle pile suffers more radiation waves kim 1993 the wave forces on four adjacent piles are thirdly investigated where the wave forces on the front piles will be quite different due to the phase difference along the direction of propagation of waves fig 20 a and b shows the coefficients c w for the front and back piles respectively it can be seen that the coefficients c w for the front and back piles are quite different as shown in figs 16 18 and 20 the coefficients c w for the left or front and right or piles are quite different the reason leads to the phenomenon will be analyzed by the total wave forces f w on each pile in the case of four piles it should be noted that the wave forces on each pile are the sum of incident diffraction and radiation wave forces kim 1993 therefore the amplitude of the wave forces f w can be written as 55 f w f r 2 f i 2 f r i f r r 2 f i i f i r 2 where fr and fi are the real and imaginary parts of the total wave forces f w fri and fii are the real and imaginary parts of the wave forces due to the incident waves and frr and fir are the real and imaginary parts of the wave forces due to the diffraction and radiation wave forces fig 21 a shows the real part of the wave forces fr fri and frr versus wave numbers ka and fig 21b shows the imaginary part of the wave forces fi fii and fir versus wave numbers ka it can be seen that the wave forces fii and fir on the front and back piles are the same while the wave forces fri and frr on the front and back piles have the same value in opposite direction this is the reason causing the wave forces frr and fir on the front and back piles different in general the wave forces fr and fi on the front pile are larger than those on back piles when the wave numbers ka are small while the result is the opposite when the wave numbers ka are large therefore the interaction of waves with four piles has more influence on back piles when the wave numbers ka are small while it has more obvious influence on the front pile when the wave numbers ka are large 5 conclusions the finite element technique incorporating the matching analytical boundary series solutions is applied to evaluate the hydrodynamic forces and wave forces on multiple cylinders surrounded by water in the present study where the boundary value problem is reduced into two dimensions and the elliptical exact artificial boundary condition is used to simulate the unbounded domain the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed models are very high based on the proposed method the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces and wave forces on pile group with two piles three piles and four piles are investigated where the coefficients of pile group are given the following conclusions can be drawn 1 interaction of water with multiple piles has significant influence on the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces when the piles are in close proximity this influence decreases as relative distance and wide depth ratio increasing and it can be neglected when the relative distance between two adjacent piles is larger than three 2 the simplified formulas of the coefficients of pile group for earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces are proposed by curve fitting method the simplified formulas which are simple expression and easy in calculating are only relevant to width depth ratio and relative distance 3 interaction of waves with multiple piles has significant influence on the wave forces and this influence is quite different when the pile number wave number relative distance or incident angle is changed acknowledgements this work was jointly funded by national natural science foundation of china 51708010

22481,this study presented a vulnerability assessment of a selected coastal bridge located at haitan strait on the east china sea through experimental study the extreme wave is simulated using the solitary wave that generated by piston type wave maker in a medium sized wave flow flume at southwest jiaotong university s deep water long span bridge laboratory horizontal and vertical wave forces acting on the deck with a box girder due to solitary wave are measured through laboratory experiments seventy five cases included three water depths five wave heights and five submergence coefficients are conducted in the experiment although there is plenty of work addressing the extreme wave forces on the coastal bridge s superstructures the experimental study that focuses on the vulnerability assessment of coastal bridge superstructures subjected to extreme wave forces especially for the box girder geometry are absent combined with the experimental data and snapshots the effects of non dimensional wave heights and submergence coefficients on wave forces are discussed in detail the structural capacity is determined according to the structural parameters of the approach span of the selected prototype coastal bridges in addition the dominant structural failure modes of the simply support superstructures are assumed to be uplift and lateral displacement the vulnerability assessment of the given coastal bridge superstructure is accessed by comparing wave forces with superstructure s capacities the results indicate that 1 compared to the submerged condition the elevated superstructure suffers larger horizontal and vertical wave forces 2 the impulsive wave force plays an important role in the vertical wave force on the deck with a box girder especially for the high elevated superstructure 3 the failure probability of coastal bridge superstructure subjected to extreme wave conditions will be effectively reduced by increasing the elevation height of the superstructure this study provides a further understanding of the fragility of the box type superstructure under the extreme disaster keywords solitary wave experiments solitary wave forces coastal bridge superstructures 1 introduction with the development of the social economic coastal communications will play an important role in supporting the important economic supports transport supplies and recreational services to people near the coastal regions as an indispensable part of coastal communications coastal bridges are easily damaged during the tsunami events in recent years the study of tsunami forces on coastal bridges has received considerable attention because of devastating damage to coastal structures the 2011 japan tsunami caused by tohoku earthquake imposed severe damages on both coastal bridges and traffic aisles during this devastating hazard nearly 300 bridges were destroyed by the tsunami induced wave carey 2015 kawashima et al 2011 motley et al 2015 wong 2015 the still water level rise brought by tsunami makes the tsunami induced wave hits the superstructure of coastal bridges easily which further induced the removal and collapse of bridge superstructures there is an urgent need to address the safety problems of coastal bridge superstructures caused by extreme waves bricker and nakayama 2014 douglass and krolak 2008 shoji and moriyama 2007 yeh et al 2007 therefore the study of the experimental measurement of the wave forces on coastal bridge superstructures and the vulnerability assessment of coastal bridge superstructures under extreme wave conditions like tsunamis is carried out in this paper to obtain the vulnerability assessment of the bridge superstructure under the action of extreme wave conditions accurate wave forces on the deck with a box girder should be investigated firstly in this paper the extreme wave is simulated by the solitary wave model there are a large number of published studies investigate extreme wave forces on coastal bridge superstructures through numerical simulations hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015 huang et al 2018a shoji et al 2011 wei and dalrymple 2016 wei et al 2015 effect including entrapped air bozorgnia et al 2011 cuomo et al 2009 henry 2011 qu et al 2017 seiffert et al 2014 2015 xu et al 2016a istrati et al 2018 twin bridge decks xu et al 2016c 2017 inclinations of deck xu and cai 2014 motley et al 2015 and displacements of deck cai et al 2017 xu and cai 2015 2017 on wave forces was comprehensively investigated using numerical methods among them xu and cai 2015 used a mass spring damper system in cfd computational fluid dynamics computer program to simulate the bridge deck wave interaction and they took the effect of the general dynamic characteristics of the structural vibration on wave forces in the bridge deck wave interaction under solitary waves into consideration moreover istrati and buckle 2014 conducted 2d numerical simulations using ls dyna to investigate the effect of structure flexibility on tsunami loads on bridge by adding both horizontal and vertical flexible springs to bridge model they found that the dynamic properties of the bridge brought significant influence on the tsunami loads on bridges additionally empirical equations for predicting the wave forces on coastal bridge superstructures were proposed by many researchers aashto 2008 douglass et al 2006 huang et al 2018b mcpherson 2008 xu et al 2016b 2018 huang et al 2019 however there is a relative paucity of experimental studies investigating the solitary induced wave forces on coastal bridge superstructures measurements of tsunami history wave force on a reinforced concrete bridge and a steel bridge was conducted by sugimoto and unjoh 2007 the 1 50 scale bridge models referenced from the interstate10 twin span bridge were selected to investigate the relationship between wave forces and wave conditions results of the experiments by araki et al 2008 shows that the clearance between the bridge and wave play an important role in the in line force on pc girder bridges bradner et al 2011 conducted an experimental study to explore the wave and bridge interaction with consideration of the dynamic response of the structure the measured wave forces on a highway bridge superstructure are compared to the aashto guidelines lau et al 2011 evaluated the behavior of bridges under solitary impacts using both experimental and numerical methods they took the effect of the bridge substructure and compound bed slope on wave forces into consideration and proposed an empirical equation to calculate the maximum wave forces on bridge decks hayashi 2013 selected a pc box girder bridge adopted for the expressway bridge as an experimental model to investigate the solitary wave force on the bridge superstructure and the velocity field around structures comparison of wave forces between the bridge superstructure and other cross sections shows that the geometrical shape is a major factor that affects the wave force seiffert et al 2014 carried out experiments on a 1 35 scale bridge model to evaluate the effect of the entrapped air on solitary wave forces experimental results show that the entrapped air between girders significantly increases vertical wave forces under fully elevated or slightly submerged girders comprehensive experimental tests were performed to investigate solitary wave forces on the deck with a six girder bridge model by hayatdavoodi et al 2014 the effects of the wave condition submergence depth elevation height and water depth on solitary wave forces were evaluated experimental results show that the horizontal positive wave forces increase with the increase in elevation height under large wave height large scale experiments were conducted at oregon state university demonstrated that the significant 3d effects caused by the wave air interaction should take into consideration in estimating the tsunami induced wave forces on the deck with t types girders the 1 5 large scale experiments were conducted by istrati et al 2016 to investigate the effect of the air vents and the role of the flexibility of the connections and the substructure on tsunami wave forces on bridges they found the air vents can significantly reduce the tsunami wave forces on bridge a large scale wave bridge interaction experiment was conducted at oregon state university to study the influence of the trapped air on the wave forces on bridges istrati et al 2017 the significant efficiency of the air vent in reducing the vertical forces was proposed in their study however how the geometrical shape of girders affects the solitary wave forces on bridge superstructures remains poorly understood the previous study conducted by hayashi 2013 was involved the influence of the wave height and flow velocity on solitary wave forces azadbakht 2013 explored the horizontal and vertical forces and overturning moments on the malibu lagoon bridge which is a cip cast in place box girder bridge in located west of santa monica he conducted a comparison between tsunami loads on a deck girder bridge and a box girder bridge and found that the geometrical shape of girders has a significant influence on tsunami loads istrati 2017 conducted a comprehensive study on the wave forces on different types of bridge girders through experimental tests demonstrating the i girder and box girder bridges witness significantly different tsunami induced force patterns and magnitudes experimental tests conducted by huang et al 2018b were focused on the behavior of the bridges under periodic wave impacts during hurricanes events these four studies show the geometrical shape of girders is closely related to the wave forces on bridge superstructures apart from the wave parameter water depth and submerged condition of the girder with the experimental results for the time history of wave forces on the deck with a box girder the vulnerability of the selected simply supported coastal bridge can be accessed by comparing the time history of wave forces with bridge s capacities plenty of significant works about the vulnerability of highway bridges subjected to earthquakes have been done in the past few years ghosh and padgett 2012 ghosh et al 2013 nielson 2005 padgett and desroches 2009 rokneddin et al 2014 the vulnerability analysis of coastal bridges subjected to extreme waves is different from seismic risk analysis drawing on the experience of seismic risk analysis the parameterized fragility based multi hazard risk assessment pf mhra method were proposed by kameshwar and padgett 2014 for the risk assessment of highway bridges that subjected to earthquake and hurricane events several metamodels and the stepwise logistic regression are applied to get the annual risk of a concrete bridge located in south carolina in their study through conducting the risk assessment of coastal bridge subjected to storm surge and hurricane induced waves balomenos and padgett 2018 found the uplift failure is the dominant bridge failure mode under hurricane events however assessments that relate to the box girder superstructure subjected to solitary waves are quite limited the dominant structural failure modes of simply support superstructures are assumed to be uplift and lateral displacement in this study and the vulnerability of the box girder superstructure are directly assessed by comparing the wave forces obtained from experimental tests to the selected bridge s capacities hayatdavoodi et al 2015 also used this method to conduct the vulnerability assessment of four coastal bridges subjected to storm surge and hurricane induced waves by numerical studies in section 2 the experimental setup is introduced in detail and the validation of wave generation are presented in this section the experimental results of solitary induced wave forces on the deck with a box girder discussed in section 3 the bridge superstructure s capacity and vulnerability assessment of the selected coastal bridge are conducted in section 4 finally this study closes with a conclusion about the present work and future study 2 experimental setup 2 1 facilities and instrumentation experiments are carried out at the southwest jiaotong university s deep water long span bridge laboratory in the school of civil engineering medium sized wave flow flume measures 60 m long 2 m wide and 1 8 m deep see fig 1 the piston type wave maker is installed at the left hand of the wave flume the servo controller of the wave system is used to receive the control signal translated from the target wave then the servo motor drives the reciprocating movement of the servomotor connected to the ball screw which in turn drives the wave plate of the wave generator to push and pull the corresponding wave and pushes the water body to produce the wave train moreover a wave absorber is utilized to eliminate most of the waves at different depths and consume most of the wave energy the wave absorber installed at the right hand of the wave flume can guarantee the elimination efficiency is not less than 92 in the main wavelength range additionally the instrument test frame at the top of the wave flume can slide in the test section in three directions to facilitate the adjustment of the model position the 3 component dynamometer is wrapped in plastic bags to prevent water splashing the connection as shown in fig 2 a between bridge model and 3 component dynamometer with a very thin rigid steel frame can significantly reduce the influence of dynamometer on wave forces to determine the sampling rate of the 3 component dynamometer used in experiments the sensitivity tests with the sampling frequency between 100 and 500 hz have been conducted the 200 hz sampling frequency of 3 component dynamometer is proved a frequency that can effectively capture the peak force after testing the stiffness value and resonant frequency of the 3 component dynamometer are large enough to avoid affecting the measurement of wave force during the experiment two wave gauges are used to measure the wave elevations and both have 200 hz sampling frequency and 0 1 mm resolution to determine the cutoff frequency of the filter used for processing the wave forces data the frequencies of the dynamometer with the reaction frame and the bridge model were determined through an impact test based on our experimental tests the natural frequencies of the bridge model was found to be 75 hz the resonant frequency of the dynamometer with the steel frame was found to be 173 hz and the resonant frequency of the dynamometer with the steel frame and the bridge model was found to be 127 hz therefore an 8th order chebyshev type i lowpass filter with a cutoff frequency of 50 hz was used to filter the wave forces data in the present study 2 2 test model and configuration the test model is chosen from an under construction coastal bridge located at haitan strait which is the nearshore area of china east sea the test model is made of polymethyl methacrylate and is fully enclosed outside the specific parameters of the test model and corresponding prototype are provided in table 1 the detail arrangements and sizes of test model are shown in fig 2 the test model is composed of a deck and a box girder which is the common type of the coastal bridge superstructure in the southeast coastal region of china the deck length l 0 198 m which is the normal direction to the wave propagation the deck width b 0 5 m and the thickness of deck is t d 0 01 m the connection part between the deck and box girder is a beveled flange slab it can be predicted that the complex geometrical shape of the deck with a box girder will bring huge different wave forces compared to the wave forces on the deck with typical t type girder as shown in the sketch of wave flume fig 3 the test model is placed at a distance of 28 m from the left vertical wall two wave gauges are used to measure surface elevations at a distance of two deck widths upstream of the edge of the deck the solitary wave is generated by the piston type wave maker many laboratory generation methods were proposed to generate solitary waves farhadi et al 2016 goring 1978 liu et al 2006 wu et al 2014 2016 the most common solitary wave generation method was proposed by goring 1978 goring proposed an equation to calculate the position of the wave paddle during each time step the equation was further modified by introducing a higher order solitary wave solution to achieve stable wave generations during this study the trajectory of the wave paddle following the equations as below to generate the solitary wave 1 d ξ d t u ξ t c η x ξ d η x ξ 2 η d h d sech 2 q 0 75 h 2 d 2 sech 2 q tanh 2 q 3 q 3 h 4 d 3 1 5 8 h d ξ c t x 0 4 c g d 1 1 2 h d 3 20 h d 2 where ξ is the position of the wave paddle h is the wave height c is the wave speed d is the water depth t is the time η is the wave surface and g is the acceleration of gravity x 0 is the initial position of the wave crest which is chosen as a negative value and set to away from the front face of the wave paddle once the initial position of the wave crest has been chosen the motion of the wave paddle ξ can be calculated based on eq 1 4 with wave parameters the trajectory data of the wave paddle is used as the input data of the piston type wave maker besides the comparisons of surface elevations between measure data and computation results are conducted to validate the accuracy of wave generations computational surface elevations are obtained by the theoretical solutions eq 2 4 of the second order solitary wave theory the comparisons in fig 4 show that the measurements of surface elevations are agreed well with the second order solitary wave theory in addition the accuracy wave generation can ensure sufficiently accurate wave forces 2 3 test procedure and data acquisition a series of 75 cases shown in fig 5 were conducted to evaluate the influence of the wave height water depth and submergence coefficient on wave forces on the bridge superstructure based on the measured data of the coastal region where the bridge is under construction three target water depths are considered d 0 533 m 0 623 m and 0 713 m water depths were chosen to cover a range of real water depths which are the real water depth of the selected bridge located at haitan strait and the water depth is around 15 23 m for each water depth five types of wave heights from 0 1 m to 0 233 with an interval of 0 033 and five types of non dimensional submergence coefficients from 1 to 1 with an interval of 0 5 were selected a negative value of submergence coefficient represents that the bridge superstructure is submerged in the water and the submergence coefficient c s d c h d c is the distance measured from the still water level to the bottom of the girder which has a negative direction h represents the height of the bridge superstructure whereas a positive value of submergence coefficient represent that the bridge superstructure is elevated above the water and the submergence coefficient c s d c h d c is the distance measured from the still water level to the bottom of the girder which has a positive direction to reduce the repeatable errors of experimental results each of the experimental cases was conducted several times in this study the measured value of the dynamometer was set to zero at the initial time of each case that is to say the buoyancy force is subtracted from the uplift force under submerged condition additionally the buoyancy forces can be easily obtained according to the volume of the test model if necessary in this paper the wave forces are normalized as two dimensional form by dividing the deck length l four kinds of wave forces are considered in this study we define the maximum vertical forces as uplift forces f v the minimum vertical forces as downward forces f v the maximum horizontal forces as positive forces f h and the minimum horizontal forces as negative forces f h 3 experimental results and discussion the solitary waves are often characterized by the wave height to water depth ratio h d h d the ratios considered in this study are from 0 14 to 0 44 this range covers the vast majority of extreme wave conditions that can occur in this bridge site area the three different water depths were determined based on the actual depths of the sea where the bridge substructures are located and the water depth is around 15 23 m therefore we chose three different values of water depths in this range in the present study as for the wave heights they were determined from the historical data and the measured data of the wave characteristics in the bridge area the marine station of the state oceanic administration near the bridge site tested and analyzed the wave conditions in the sea near the bridge site of the selected bridge they found that the annual maximum wave height is mostly 5 7 m thus the 7 m is chosen as the largest wave height in this study then the range of the wave height to water depth ratio was determined additionally the wave height to water depth ratio h d is known as the non dimensional wave height for convenience in this study the four types of maximum wave forces with water depths equal to 0 533 0 623 and 0 713 m are plotted against the non dimensional wave height in figs 6 8 respectively fig 6 shows that the horizontal positive and negative wave forces present an increasing trend with the increase of non dimensional wave heights while within different submergence and elevation conditions they give different trends as for the submergence cases c s 1 and 0 5 the effect of solitary wave on the wave forces on the deck with a box girder is quite limited when the superstructure is submerged into the water shown in fig 6 a which could be attributed to the small differences in the wave velocities for example the horizontal velocities for the submergence cases with wave height equal to 0 233 m are 0 983 m s c s 1 and 0 988 m s c s 0 5 which are calculated based on the velocity equation of second order solitary wave at the position of the middle of the box girder the difference between the two horizontal velocities does not exceed 0 5 likely this phenomenon indicates that the effect of solitary wave on the horizontal velocity of the underwater field is quite limited however the horizontal negative forces are larger for the shallower submergence depth conditions compared to other submergence cases combined with this two phenomenon it can be obtained that the wave bridge interaction gives a larger positive contributions to horizontal negative wave forces with shallower submergence depth furthermore the existence of bridge superstructures near the still water surface influences the wave propagation and further brings more wave energy on the back of the structure with the increase in non dimensional wave height the horizontal wave forces increase nonlinearly especially for the largest elevated cases c s 1 fig 9 presents snapshots of wave acting on the deck with a box girder with the non dimensional wave height is equal to 0 438 and the water depth is equal to 0 533 m it should be noted that all snapshots in this study show wave coming from right to left which is the opposite direction from fig 3 because the camera is on the other side of the wave flume the measurement of the wave force and the test video are performed simultaneously to correspond to the wave force and the snapshots of the wave acting on the bridge model they show the conditions of the horizontal positive wave forces reach their maximum values under c s 0 0 5 and 1 respectively it can be obtained from fig 9 b and c that when the submerged coefficient is 1 the impact effect on superstructure is obviously larger than the impact effect when the submerged coefficient is 0 5 and this impact forces should be increased as the wave height increases therefore in the case of largest elevation the horizontal wave forces will show a more significant nonlinear effect compare to the smaller elevation distance the horizontal wave forces with larger elevation distance are smaller for small non dimensional wave heights e g h d 0 3 this trend is owing to waves can only act on less parts of the girder within larger elevation distance which further brings a smaller horizontal wave force with the increase in the non dimensional height horizontal positive wave forces are larger for larger elevation distance of the deck with a box girder because with the increase in the elevation distance the larger horizontal velocity of waves acting on the lateral of the girder and further causes larger horizontal wave forces it can be concluded from fig 9 c that the upper part of waves act on the web of girder with a large elevation distance and larger velocities of water particles near the upper part lead to larger horizontal positive wave forces however the larger elevation distance also easily causes wave breakings in the process of wave acting on the deck with a box girder which induces larger proportion of wave energy transmissions shown in fig 9 in addition the high elevation height also makes less waves act on the back of the girder which is the main reason that causes the decrease in horizontal negative forces this decrease reachs the largest value when the non dimensional wave height is equal to 0 438 and elevation distance is equal to 0 09 m fig 10 illustrates the snapshots of wave acting on the deck with a box girder when the horizontal negative forces reach their maximum values under the same wave condition with fig 9 compare to the small elevated distance shown in fig 10 a the large elevated distance of the superstructure shown in fig 10 b makes only a small part of the wave can act on the back of the box girder and lots of wave breakings which further reduces horizontal negative wave forces the rise in vertical uplift forces with increasing non dimensional wave height is expected the vertical uplift forces are larger for smaller submergence depths and the submergence coefficient has very few effects on horizontal positive forces when the substructure is submerged therefore it can be concluded that the submergence coefficient has a larger influence on vertical uplift forces than on horizontal positive forces this influence makes the vertical uplift forces to be larger on the box girder bridge when it gets closer to the water surface in the submerged condition because with the decrease in submergence depths the wave can act on the bottom of the deck and bring a larger vertical uplift force for the case c s 1 0 5 and 0 in fig 6 c however the horizontal positive forces with these three submerged conditions are almost constant this phenomenon demonstrates that compared to the submerged conditions the elevated superstructure suffers larger horizontal positive and vertical uplift wave forces during extreme wave events furthermore larger vertical uplift forces for larger non dimensional wave height with elevation distance equal to 0 09 m c s 1 also support this conclusion it is noteworthy that the vertical uplift forces with submergence coefficient equal to 0 are larger than that with other submergence coefficients this phenomenon largely caused by the empty part shown in fig 2 b of the deck with a box girder and the wave impact on the lateral side of the deck the empty part prevents wave moves forward and further makes the wave acts on the bottom of the deck the condition for the bottom of the girder equal to the water surface lead to zero clearance between the girder and water surface and this great blocking effect brings larger wave forces on the web of the girder and the bottom of the deck the wave acts on the lateral side of the deck always accompany with wave breakings which leads to great wave impact pressure with the notable exception that the largest vertical uplift force does not correspond with submergence coefficient equal to 0 but rather the condition with elevation distance equal to 0 09 m c s 1 and 0 438 non dimensional wave height as shown in fig 6 d larger submergence depths lead to larger vertical downward forces c s 0 with non dimensional wave height smaller than 0 4 because the deck with a box fully submerged in the water with c s 1 which causes the smallest energy loss during the wave acting on the deck with box girder as for the case with large non dimensional wave height and elevated condition the wave blocking effect caused by the front empty part gives rise to the wave impact pressure on the top of the deck and further increases the vertical downward force to understand the wave forces process on the deck with a box girder the history of wave forces are given in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 a time point a represents the wave acts on the whole part of the girder web which leads to a rise in horizontal wave forces with the wave propagation the horizontal wave forces gradually increase to its maximum value time point b then the wave acts on the back of the girder brings horizontal negative forces fig 11 b shows that vertical wave forces have two peaks during the wave actions the first peak time point c occurs when the wave is acting on the bottom of the girder while the second peak time point d appears when the wave is acting on the bottom of the deck and girder it can be found that the duration of positive vertical forces is very long this novel situation is caused by the horizontal forces on the back of the deck with a box girder which brings large uplift forces on the back of the girder due to the web angle in addition this also gives an explanation for the phenomena that the vertical downward forces with c s 0 smaller than that with most of other submergence coefficients under the same wave height figs 7 and 8 present the numerical results for the same wave conditions with the cases of fig 6 but different water depths they show that different water depths lead to different horizontal and vertical wave forces with the increase in water depth most of wave forces show decreasing trends with same water conditions in addition to the vertical uplift forces which show a similar trend with the increase in water depth this is probably caused by the change of wavelength and the velocity of water particles with different water depths to give a clear understanding of this phenomenon and clarify the mechanism of the influence of water depth on wave forces the time history of wave forces and the corresponding experimental snapshots are presented the horizontal positive and vertical uplift wave forces decrease with an increase in water depths under submergence coefficient c s 1 and wave height h 0 233 m and wave forces are smaller with d 0 713 m compared to the wave forces with d 0 533 m because the rise in water depths leads to the decrease of the wave speed with same wave heights and further affects the wave forces on superstructures fig 12 show experimental snapshots for the conditions of wave acts on the web of the girder a horizontal positive force reaches its maximum value b vertical uplift force reaches its maximum value c and vertical downward force reaches its maximum value d under h 0 233 m c s 1 and d 0 533 m and snapshots for d 0 713 m is given in fig 13 for comparison it can be easily obtained that the wave is acting on the structure with stronger impact for smaller water depths from figs 12 a and 13 a and this stronger impact may be caused by the higher horizontal velocities in addition the rise in wave speed further causes larger horizontal wave forces a mass of wave breakings is generated in a shallower water condition as shown in fig 12 due to the high wave speed this impact effect increases horizontal and vertical forces on the deck with a box girder therefore larger wave forces with shallower water depths owe much to the impulsive forces additionally the decrease in water depth has a great influence on vertical uplift forces with a higher elevated height as shown in figs 7 c and 8 c compared to other elevated cases the vertical uplift forces with c s 1 suffered the greatest reduction it indicates that impulsive forces relate to the velocity of waves that act on the lateral side of superstructures and higher wave forces often generated when the height of the wave is similar to the elevated height of superstructures therefore a conclusion can be drawn that the impulsive wave forces play an important role in the vertical wave forces on the deck with a box girder especially for the high elevated superstructures 4 vulnerability assessment the east china sea region is located on the pacific rim volcanic seismic belt and because of the low terrain on the eastern coast of china it is greatly affected by the extreme waves due to the development of the economy and transportation the construction of large scale coastal bridges is underway extreme wave events not only cause structure damages but also affect the rescue after disasters thus an investigation of the vulnerability assessment of the coastal bridge in a region subjected to extreme hazards is necessary the selected coastal bridge is vulnerable to solitary wave forces especially for the simply supported approach span based on the experimental study of solitary wave forces investigated in the previous section and the capacity of the bridge the vulnerability assessment of the simply supported approach span of the selected coastal bridge are evaluated in this section 4 1 bridge s capacity and failure mode approach spans of the selected bridge are simply supported reinforced concrete bridges and they are easily damaged during the extreme wave conditions due to their low elevations because the approach spans are the transition parts between the main spans and coast region the geometrical parameters of the selected coastal bridges that located at haitan strait on the east china sea are already listed in section 2 2 table 1 according to the bridge design parameters the density of the reinforced concrete is around 2500 kg m3 thus we take ρ c 2500 kg m3 as the reinforce concrete density of the approach span in this study the capacity of a bridge in the vertical direction is determined by the total weight of the bridge which is calculated by multiplying the volume of bridge span by the relative density of the reinforced concrete since the deck with a box girder is submerged in the water under the cases of c s 0 5 and 1 the buoyancy force of the superstructure should be considered the buoyancy force of the deck with a box girder is calculated based on the volume of structure that submerged in the water and the saltwater density ρ w 1025 kg m3 since the prototype bridge is a multi span simply supported bridge only the condition where the vertical resistance is completely provided by the bridge weight is studied in this paper in addition the horizontal resistance comes from the friction forces between the superstructure and the substructure the capacity of bridge in the horizontal and vertical directions are calculated by 5 f h c t μ f w f b f v t 6 f v c f w f b where the horizontal resistance forces f hc t are expressed as the form of time history forces due to the vertical wave force f v t changes over time f w and f b represents for the weight and buoyancy force of the deck with a box girder respectively μ is the static friction coefficient that determined by the connection between the superstructure and substructure in the following study the failure of the superstructure with the commonly used direct contact and rubber bearing between the superstructure and the substructure are separately studied and discussed based on studies of lum et al 2011 and hayatdavoodi et al 2015 the friction coefficient is equal to 0 1 for direct contact dc for short and 0 8 for rubber bearing rb for short the detailed bridge capacity parameters are presented in table 2 in addition the experimental wave forces are transformed into the wave forces f he and f ve acts on the prototype superstructure based on the froude s criterion to compare with bridge s capacity at the same level according to the post disaster investigation and some vulnerability assessments of costal bridges under hazard events balomenos and padgett 2018 lau et al 2011 shoji and moriyama 2007 2011 yeh et al 2007 the failure of the simply support span under extreme wave events is defined if the deck is displaced either in the vertical or horizontal direction that is to say the unseating failure is determined as long as the experimental wave force exceeds the structure s capacity either in the vertical or horizontal direction 4 2 vulnerability assessment for dc and rb types the vulnerability assessment of the deck with a box girder for two contact forms dc and rb of the superstructure and substructure are separately investigated in this section to give a clear expression of the failure of the simply support span under extreme wave events the ratios of the time history of the experimental wave forces to the capacity of the bridge in the horizontal and vertical directions are presented the ratio larger than 1 represents the solitary wave forces on the selected bridge superstructure exceeds the bridge resistance the failure of vertical direction state that the vertical wave forces can directly cause the bridge deck to detach from the substructure and the failure of horizontal direction indicated that the combination of vertical and horizontal wave force causes the unseating of superstructure all the conditions illustrated in fig 5 are tested in this section based on the experimental results and bridge s capacity figs 14 and 15 show the time history ratios of the wave forces to the bridge capacity both in horizontal and vertical direction for two wave conditions as shown in figs 14 b and 15 b the ratio of the wave forces to the bridge capacity both exceed the limit 1 which means the large vertical wave forces in both two wave conditions can completely separate the deck with a box girder from the substructure obviously large wave heights will cause large vertical ratio values also the large ratio value in vertical direction represents the vertical wave force is greater than the weight of the bridge span compare to the rb type dc type gives larger ratios in the horizontal direction the extreme large horizontal ratios in figs 14 and 15 are generated because the lateral resistance is too small relative to the horizontal wave forces due to large vertical wave forces the bridge itself can be completely unseated during the wave action in the partial enlargement of figs 14 and 15 they show that the large friction coefficient rb type can bring a huge reduction in horizontal ratios to give a clear comparison of failure probability between dc and rb type the failure possibilities for the selected range of wave conditions were calculated it should be noted that the failure probabilities of the deck with a box girder are calculated only based on the limited number of wave conditions presented in this manuscript and consequently the results shown in figs 16 and 17 correspond only to these conditions comprehensive wave conditions should be conducted and developed to investigate the accurate fragility curves or fragility surfaces of the bridge vulnerability in the future works fig 16 provides the variations of the failure probability of dc and rb types varies with the submergence coefficient it should be noted that if the wave condition satisfies any failure mode in the horizontal or vertical direction it is included in the total failure number finally dividing the total failure number by the total number of working conditions is the failure probability of the dc or rb type compared to the dc type the rb type can significantly reduce the failure probability of the deck with a box girder this shows that if the lateral resistance of the bridge structure can be improved it will help to increase the survival probability of the coastal bridge superstructure under extreme wave events as for the case with submergence coefficient is 0 5 the large vertical wave forces and buoyancy forces caused by the water are the main reason that brings the high failure probability of the bridge structure fig 16 also demonstrates that the failure probability will be effectively reduced by increasing the elevation height of the superstructure fig 17 shows that increasing the lateral resistance has a greater benefit in reducing the failure probability of the superstructure when the wave height is small failure probabilities of dc and rb types for the horizontal and vertical directions separately are shown in table 3 table 3 shows that both the failure of vertical and horizontal direction can happen and the failure probability of horizontal direction for rb type are smaller than that for dc type due to the larger coefficient of friction therefore it is necessary to simultaneously increase the horizontal and vertical resistance of the bridge superstructure to survive the extreme wave conditions 5 conclusion this study addresses the vulnerability assessment of the superstructure in the coastal region by conducting an experimental investigation of wave forces on the deck with a box girder subjected to solitary wave forces the solitary induced horizontal and vertical wave forces are tested on 1 30 scale coastal bridge superstructure model in a medium sized wave flow flume in the southwest jiaotong university s deep water long span bridge laboratory the vulnerability assessment of simply supported superstructures subjected to solitary wave forces is determined based on the experimental wave forces and the structural capacity the failure probabilities of dc and rb connection types between the superstructure and substructure are analyzed based on these investigations the following conclusion is reached 1 compare to the submerged conditions the elevated superstructure suffers larger positive horizontal and

solitary wave that generated by piston type wave maker in a medium sized wave flow flume at southwest jiaotong university s deep water long span bridge laboratory horizontal and vertical wave forces acting on the deck with a box girder due to solitary wave are measured through laboratory experiments seventy five cases included three water depths five wave heights and five submergence coefficients are conducted in the experiment although there is plenty of work addressing the extreme wave forces on the coastal bridge s superstructures the experimental study that focuses on the vulnerability assessment of coastal bridge superstructures subjected to extreme wave forces especially for the box girder geometry are absent combined with the experimental data and snapshots the effects of non dimensional wave heights and submergence coefficients on wave forces are discussed in detail the structural capacity is determined according to the structural parameters of the approach span of the

bridge superstructures 1 introduction with the development of the social economic coastal communications will play an important role in supporting the important economic supports transport supplies and recreational services to people near the coastal regions as an indispensable part of coastal communications coastal bridges are easily damaged during the tsunami events in recent years the study of tsunami forces on coastal bridges has received considerable attention because of devastating damage to coastal structures the 2011 japan tsunami caused by tohoku earthquake imposed severe damages on both coastal bridges and traffic aisles during this devastating hazard nearly 300 bridges were destroyed by the tsunami induced wave carey 2015 kawashima et al 2011 motley et al 2015 wong 2015 the still water level rise brought by tsunami makes the tsunami induced wave hits the superstructure of coastal bridges easily which further induced the removal and collapse of bridge superstructures there is an urgent need to address the safety problems of coastal bridge superstructures caused by extreme waves bricker and nakayama 2014 douglass and krolak 2008 shoji and moriyama 2007 yeh et al 2007 therefore the study of the experimental measurement of the wave forces on coastal bridge superstructures and the vulnerability assessment of coastal bridge superstructures under extreme wave conditions like tsunamis is carried out in this paper to obtain the vulnerability assessment of the bridge superstructure under the action of extreme wave conditions accurate wave forces on the deck with a box girder should be investigated firstly in this paper the extreme wave is simulated by the solitary wave model there are a large number of published studies investigate extreme wave forces on coastal bridge superstructures through numerical simulations hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015 huang et al 2018a shoji et al 2011 wei and dalrymple 2016 wei et al 2015 effect including entrapped air bozorgnia et al 2011 cuomo et al 2009 henry 2011 qu et al 2017 seiffert et al 2014 2015 xu et al 2016a istrati et al 2018 twin bridge decks xu et al 2016c 2017 inclinations of deck xu and cai 2014 motley et al 2015 and displacements of deck cai et al 2017 xu and cai 2015 2017 on wave forces was comprehensively investigated using numerical methods among them xu and cai 2015 used a mass spring damper system in cfd computational fluid dynamics computer program to simulate the bridge deck wave interaction and they took the effect of the general dynamic characteristics of the structural vibration on wave forces in the bridge deck wave interaction under solitary waves into consideration moreover istrati and buckle 2014 conducted 2d numerical simulations using ls dyna to investigate the effect of structure flexibility on tsunami loads on bridge by adding both horizontal and vertical flexible springs to bridge model they found that the dynamic properties of the bridge brought significant influence on the tsunami loads on bridges additionally empirical equations for predicting the wave forces on coastal bridge superstructures were proposed by many researchers aashto 2008 douglass et al 2006 huang et al 2018b mcpherson 2008 xu et al 2016b 2018 huang et al 2019 however there is a relative paucity of experimental studies investigating the solitary induced wave forces on coastal bridge superstructures measurements of tsunami history wave force on a reinforced concrete bridge and a steel bridge was conducted by sugimoto and unjoh 2007 the 1 50 scale bridge models referenced from the interstate10 twin span bridge were selected to investigate the relationship between wave forces and wave conditions results of the experiments by araki et al 2008 shows that the clearance between the bridge and wave play an important role in the in line force on pc girder bridges bradner et al 2011 conducted an experimental study to explore the wave and bridge interaction with consideration of the dynamic response of the structure the measured wave forces on a highway bridge superstructure are compared to the aashto guidelines lau et al 2011 evaluated the behavior of bridges under solitary impacts using both experimental and numerical methods they took the effect of the bridge substructure and compound bed slope on wave forces into consideration and proposed an empirical equation to calculate the maximum wave forces on bridge decks hayashi 2013 selected a pc box girder bridge adopted for the expressway bridge as an experimental model to investigate the solitary wave force on the bridge superstructure and the velocity field around structures comparison of wave forces between the bridge superstructure and other cross sections shows that the geometrical shape is a major factor that affects the wave force seiffert et al 2014 carried out experiments on a 1 35 scale bridge model to evaluate the effect of the entrapped air on solitary wave forces experimental results show that the entrapped air between girders significantly increases vertical wave forces under fully elevated or slightly submerged girders comprehensive experimental tests were performed to investigate solitary wave forces on the deck with a six girder bridge model by hayatdavoodi et al 2014 the effects of the wave condition submergence depth elevation height and water depth on solitary wave forces were evaluated experimental results show that the horizontal positive wave forces increase with the increase in elevation height under large wave height large scale experiments were conducted at oregon state university demonstrated that the significant 3d effects caused by the wave air interaction should take into consideration in estimating the tsunami induced wave forces on the deck with t types girders the 1 5 large scale experiments were conducted by istrati et al 2016 to investigate the effect of the air vents and the role of the flexibility of the connections and the substructure on tsunami wave forces on bridges they found the air vents can significantly reduce the tsunami wave forces on bridge a large scale wave bridge interaction experiment was conducted at oregon state university to study the influence of the trapped air on the wave forces on bridges istrati et al 2017 the significant efficiency of the air vent in reducing the vertical forces was proposed in their study however how the geometrical shape of girders affects the solitary wave forces on bridge superstructures remains poorly understood the previous study conducted by hayashi 2013 was involved the influence of the wave height and flow velocity on solitary wave forces azadbakht 2013 explored the horizontal and vertical forces and overturning moments on the malibu lagoon bridge which is a cip cast in place box girder bridge in located west of santa monica he conducted a comparison between tsunami loads on a deck girder bridge and a box girder bridge and found that the geometrical shape of girders has a significant influence on tsunami loads istrati 2017 conducted a comprehensive study on the wave forces on different types of bridge girders through experimental tests demonstrating the i girder and box girder bridges witness significantly different tsunami induced force patterns and magnitudes experimental tests conducted by huang et al 2018b were focused on the behavior of the bridges under periodic wave impacts during hurricanes events these four studies show the geometrical shape of girders is closely related to the wave forces on bridge superstructures apart from the wave parameter water depth and submerged condition of the girder with the experimental results for the time history of wave forces on the deck with a box girder the vulnerability of the selected simply supported coastal bridge can be accessed by comparing the time history of wave forces with bridge s capacities plenty of significant works about the vulnerability of highway bridges subjected to earthquakes have been done in the past few years ghosh and padgett 2012 ghosh et al 2013 nielson 2005 padgett and desroches 2009 rokneddin et al 2014 the vulnerability analysis of coastal bridges subjected to extreme waves is different from seismic risk analysis drawing on the experience of seismic risk analysis the parameterized fragility based multi hazard risk assessment pf mhra method were proposed by kameshwar and padgett 2014 for the risk assessment of highway bridges that subjected to earthquake and hurricane events several metamodels and the stepwise logistic regression are applied to get the annual risk of a concrete bridge located in south carolina in their study through conducting the risk assessment of coastal bridge subjected to storm surge and hurricane induced waves balomenos and padgett 2018 found the uplift failure is the dominant bridge failure mode under hurricane events however assessments that relate to the box girder superstructure subjected to solitary waves are quite limited the dominant structural failure modes of simply support superstructures are assumed to be uplift and lateral displacement in this study and the vulnerability of the box girder superstructure are directly assessed by comparing the wave forces obtained from experimental tests to the selected bridge s capacities hayatdavoodi et al 2015 also used this method to conduct the vulnerability assessment of four coastal bridges subjected to storm surge and hurricane induced waves by numerical studies in section 2 the experimental setup is introduced in detail and the validation of wave generation are presented in this section the experimental results of solitary induced wave forces on the deck with a box girder discussed in section 3 the bridge superstructure s capacity and vulnerability assessment of the selected coastal bridge are conducted in section 4 finally this study closes with a conclusion about the present work and future study 2 experimental setup 2 1 facilities and instrumentation experiments are carried out at the southwest jiaotong university s deep water long span bridge laboratory in the school of civil engineering medium sized wave flow flume measures 60 m long 2 m wide and 1 8 m deep see fig 1 the piston type wave maker is installed at the left hand of the wave flume the servo controller of the wave system is used to receive the control signal translated from the target wave then the servo motor drives the reciprocating movement of the servomotor connected to the ball screw which in turn drives the wave plate of the wave generator to push and pull the corresponding wave and pushes the water body to produce the wave train moreover a wave absorber is utilized to eliminate most of the waves at different depths and consume most of the wave energy the wave absorber installed at the right hand of the wave flume can guarantee the elimination efficiency is not less than 92 in the main wavelength range additionally the instrument test frame at the top of the wave flume can slide in the test section in three directions to facilitate the adjustment of the model position the 3 component dynamometer is wrapped in plastic bags to prevent water splashing the connection as shown in fig 2 a between bridge model and 3 component dynamometer with a very thin rigid steel frame can significantly reduce the influence of dynamometer on wave forces to determine the sampling rate of the 3 component dynamometer used in experiments the sensitivity tests with the sampling frequency between 100 and 500 hz have been conducted the 200 hz sampling frequency of 3 component dynamometer is proved a frequency that can effectively capture the peak force after testing the stiffness value and resonant frequency of the 3 component dynamometer are large enough to avoid affecting the measurement of wave force during the experiment two wave gauges are used to measure the wave elevations and both have 200 hz sampling frequency and 0 1 mm resolution to determine the cutoff frequency of the filter used for processing the wave forces data the frequencies of the dynamometer with the reaction frame and the bridge model were determined through an impact test based on our experimental tests the natural frequencies of the bridge model was found to be 75 hz the resonant frequency of the dynamometer with the steel frame was found to be 173 hz and the resonant frequency of the dynamometer with the steel frame and the bridge model was found to be 127 hz therefore an 8th order chebyshev type i lowpass filter with a cutoff frequency of 50 hz was used to filter the wave forces data in the present study 2 2 test model and configuration the test model is chosen from an under construction coastal bridge located at haitan strait which is the nearshore area of china east sea the test model is made of polymethyl methacrylate and is fully enclosed outside the specific parameters of the test model and corresponding prototype are provided in table 1 the detail arrangements and sizes of test model are shown in fig 2 the test model is composed of a deck and a box girder which is the common type of the coastal bridge superstructure in the southeast coastal region of china the deck length l 0 198 m which is the normal direction to the wave propagation the deck width b 0 5 m and the thickness of deck is t d 0 01 m the connection part between the deck and box girder is a beveled flange slab it can be predicted that the complex geometrical shape of the deck with a box girder will bring huge different wave forces compared to the wave forces on the deck with typical t type girder as shown in the sketch of wave flume fig 3 the test model is placed at a distance of 28 m from the left vertical wall two wave gauges are used to measure surface elevations at a distance of two deck widths upstream of the edge of the deck the solitary wave is generated by the piston type wave maker many laboratory generation methods were proposed to generate solitary waves farhadi et al 2016 goring 1978 liu et al 2006 wu et al 2014 2016 the most common solitary wave generation method was proposed by goring 1978 goring proposed an equation to calculate the position of the wave paddle during each time step the equation was further modified by introducing a higher order solitary wave solution to achieve stable wave generations during this study the trajectory of the wave paddle following the equations as below to generate the solitary wave 1 d ξ d t u ξ t c η x ξ d η x ξ 2 η d h d sech 2 q 0 75 h 2 d 2 sech 2 q tanh 2 q 3 q 3 h 4 d 3 1 5 8 h d ξ c t x 0 4 c g d 1 1 2 h d 3 20 h d 2 where ξ is the position of the wave paddle h is the wave height c is the wave speed d is the water depth t is the time η is the wave surface and g is the acceleration of gravity x 0 is the initial position of the wave crest which is chosen as a negative value and set to away from the front face of the wave paddle once the initial position of the wave crest has been chosen the motion of the wave paddle ξ can be calculated based on eq 1 4 with wave parameters the trajectory data of the wave paddle is used as the input data of the piston type wave maker besides the comparisons of surface elevations between measure data and computation results are conducted to validate the accuracy of wave generations computational surface elevations are obtained by the theoretical solutions eq 2 4 of the second order solitary wave theory the comparisons in fig 4 show that the measurements of surface elevations are agreed well with the second order solitary wave theory in addition the accuracy wave generation can ensure sufficiently accurate wave forces 2 3 test procedure and data acquisition a series of 75 cases shown in fig 5 were conducted to evaluate the influence of the wave height water depth and submergence coefficient on wave forces on the bridge superstructure based on the measured data of the coastal region where the bridge is under construction three target water depths are considered d 0 533 m 0 623 m and 0 713 m water depths were chosen to cover a range of real water depths which are the real water depth of the selected bridge located at haitan strait and the water depth is around 15 23 m for each water depth five types of wave heights from 0 1 m to 0 233 with an interval of 0 033 and five types of non dimensional submergence coefficients from 1 to 1 with an interval of 0 5 were selected a negative value of submergence coefficient represents that the bridge superstructure is submerged in the water and the submergence coefficient c s d c h d c is the distance measured from the still water level to the bottom of the girder which has a negative direction h represents the height of the bridge superstructure whereas a positive value of submergence coefficient represent that the bridge superstructure is elevated above the water and the submergence coefficient c s d c h d c is the distance measured from the still water level to the bottom of the girder which has a positive direction to reduce the repeatable errors of experimental results each of the experimental cases was conducted several times in this study the measured value of the dynamometer was set to zero at the initial time of each case that is to say the buoyancy force is subtracted from the uplift force under submerged condition additionally the buoyancy forces can be easily obtained according to the volume of the test model if necessary in this paper the wave forces are normalized as two dimensional form by dividing the deck length l four kinds of wave forces are considered in this study we define the maximum vertical forces as uplift forces f v the minimum vertical forces as downward forces f v the maximum horizontal forces as positive forces f h and the minimum horizontal forces as negative forces f h 3 experimental results and discussion the solitary waves are often characterized by the wave height to water depth ratio h d h d the ratios considered in this study are from 0 14 to 0 44 this range covers the vast majority of extreme wave conditions that can occur in this bridge site area the three different water depths were determined based on the actual depths of the sea where the bridge substructures are located and the water depth is around 15 23 m therefore we chose three different values of water depths in this range in the present study as for the wave heights they were determined from the historical data and the measured data of the wave characteristics in the bridge area the marine station of the state oceanic administration near the bridge site tested and analyzed the wave conditions in the sea near the bridge site of the selected bridge they found that the annual maximum wave height is mostly 5 7 m thus the 7 m is chosen as the largest wave height in this study then the range of the wave height to water depth ratio was determined additionally the wave height to water depth ratio h d is known as the non dimensional wave height for convenience in this study the four types of maximum wave forces with water depths equal to 0 533 0 623 and 0 713 m are plotted against the non dimensional wave height in figs 6 8 respectively fig 6 shows that the horizontal positive and negative wave forces present an increasing trend with the increase of non dimensional wave heights while within different submergence and elevation conditions they give different trends as for the submergence cases c s 1 and 0 5 the effect of solitary wave on the wave forces on the deck with a box girder is quite limited when the superstructure is submerged into the water shown in fig 6 a which could be attributed to the small differences in the wave velocities for example the horizontal velocities for the submergence cases with wave height equal to 0 233 m are 0 983 m s c s 1 and 0 988 m s c s 0 5 which are calculated based on the velocity equation of second order solitary wave at the position of the middle of the box girder the difference between the two horizontal velocities does not exceed 0 5 likely this phenomenon indicates that the effect of solitary wave on the horizontal velocity of the underwater field is quite limited however the horizontal negative forces are larger for the shallower submergence depth conditions compared to other submergence cases combined with this two phenomenon it can be obtained that the wave bridge interaction gives a larger positive contributions to horizontal negative wave forces with shallower submergence depth furthermore the existence of bridge superstructures near the still water surface influences the wave propagation and further brings more wave energy on the back of the structure with the increase in non dimensional wave height the horizontal wave forces increase nonlinearly especially for the largest elevated cases c s 1 fig 9 presents snapshots of wave acting on the deck with a box girder with the non dimensional wave height is equal to 0 438 and the water depth is equal to 0 533 m it should be noted that all snapshots in this study show wave coming from right to left which is the opposite direction from fig 3 because the camera is on the other side of the wave flume the measurement of the wave force and the test video are performed simultaneously to correspond to the wave force and the snapshots of the wave acting on the bridge model they show the conditions of the horizontal positive wave forces reach their maximum values under c s 0 0 5 and 1 respectively it can be obtained from fig 9 b and c that when the submerged coefficient is 1 the impact effect on superstructure is obviously larger than the impact effect when the submerged coefficient is 0 5 and this impact forces should be increased as the wave height increases therefore in the case of largest elevation the horizontal wave forces will show a more significant nonlinear effect compare to the smaller elevation distance the horizontal wave forces with larger elevation distance are smaller for small non dimensional wave heights e g h d 0 3 this trend is owing to waves can only act on less parts of the girder within larger elevation distance which further brings a smaller horizontal wave force with the increase in the non dimensional height horizontal positive wave forces are larger for larger elevation distance of the deck with a box girder because with the increase in the elevation distance the larger horizontal velocity of waves acting on the lateral of the girder and further causes larger horizontal wave forces it can be concluded from fig 9 c that the upper part of waves act on the web of girder with a large elevation distance and larger velocities of water particles near the upper part lead to larger horizontal positive wave forces however the larger elevation distance also easily causes wave breakings in the process of wave acting on the deck with a box girder which induces larger proportion of wave energy transmissions shown in fig 9 in addition the high elevation height also makes less waves act on the back of the girder which is the main reason that causes the decrease in horizontal negative forces this decrease reachs the largest value when the non dimensional wave height is equal to 0 438 and elevation distance is equal to 0 09 m fig 10 illustrates the snapshots of wave acting on the deck with a box girder when the horizontal negative forces reach their maximum values under the same wave condition with fig 9 compare to the small elevated distance shown in fig 10 a the large elevated distance of the superstructure shown in fig 10 b makes only a small part of the wave can act on the back of the box girder and lots of wave breakings which further reduces horizontal negative wave forces the rise in vertical uplift forces with increasing non dimensional wave height is expected the vertical uplift forces are larger for smaller submergence depths and the submergence coefficient has very few effects on horizontal positive forces when the substructure is submerged therefore it can be concluded that the submergence coefficient has a larger influence on vertical uplift forces than on horizontal positive forces this influence makes the vertical uplift forces to be larger on the box girder bridge when it gets closer to the water surface in the submerged condition because with the decrease in submergence depths the wave can act on the bottom of the deck and bring a larger vertical uplift force for the case c s 1 0 5 and 0 in fig 6 c however the horizontal positive forces with these three submerged conditions are almost constant this phenomenon demonstrates that compared to the submerged conditions the elevated superstructure suffers larger horizontal positive and vertical uplift wave forces during extreme wave events furthermore larger vertical uplift forces for larger non dimensional wave height with elevation distance equal to 0 09 m c s 1 also support this conclusion it is noteworthy that the vertical uplift forces with submergence coefficient equal to 0 are larger than that with other submergence coefficients this phenomenon largely caused by the empty part shown in fig 2 b of the deck with a box girder and the wave impact on the lateral side of the deck the empty part prevents wave moves forward and further makes the wave acts on the bottom of the deck the condition for the bottom of the girder equal to the water surface lead to zero clearance between the girder and water surface and this great blocking effect brings larger wave forces on the web of the girder and the bottom of the deck the wave acts on the lateral side of the deck always accompany with wave breakings which leads to great wave impact pressure with the notable exception that the largest vertical uplift force does not correspond with submergence coefficient equal to 0 but rather the condition with elevation distance equal to 0 09 m c s 1 and 0 438 non dimensional wave height as shown in fig 6 d larger submergence depths lead to larger vertical downward forces c s 0 with non dimensional wave height smaller than 0 4 because the deck with a box fully submerged in the water with c s 1 which causes the smallest energy loss during the wave acting on the deck with box girder as for the case with large non dimensional wave height and elevated condition the wave blocking effect caused by the front empty part gives rise to the wave impact pressure on the top of the deck and further increases the vertical downward force to understand the wave forces process on the deck with a box girder the history of wave forces are given in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 a time point a represents the wave acts on the whole part of the girder web which leads to a rise in horizontal wave forces with the wave propagation the horizontal wave forces gradually increase to its maximum value time point b then the wave acts on the back of the girder brings horizontal negative forces fig 11 b shows that vertical wave forces have two peaks during the wave actions the first peak time point c occurs when the wave is acting on the bottom of the girder while the second peak time point d appears when the wave is acting on the bottom of the deck and girder it can be found that the duration of positive vertical forces is very long this novel situation is caused by the horizontal forces on the back of the deck with a box girder which brings large uplift forces on the back of the girder due to the web angle in addition this also gives an explanation for the phenomena that the vertical downward forces with c s 0 smaller than that with most of other submergence coefficients under the same wave height figs 7 and 8 present the numerical results for the same wave conditions with the cases of fig 6 but different water depths they show that different water depths lead to different horizontal and vertical wave forces with the increase in water depth most of wave forces show decreasing trends with same water conditions in addition to the vertical uplift forces which show a similar trend with the increase in water depth this is probably caused by the change of wavelength and the velocity of water particles with different water depths to give a clear understanding of this phenomenon and clarify the mechanism of the influence of water depth on wave forces the time history of wave forces and the corresponding experimental snapshots are presented the horizontal positive and vertical uplift wave forces decrease with an increase in water depths under submergence coefficient c s 1 and wave height h 0 233 m and wave forces are smaller with d 0 713 m compared to the wave forces with d 0 533 m because the rise in water depths leads to the decrease of the wave speed with same wave heights and further affects the wave forces on superstructures fig 12 show experimental snapshots for the conditions of wave acts on the web of the girder a horizontal positive force reaches its maximum value b vertical uplift force reaches its maximum value c and vertical downward force reaches its maximum value d under h 0 233 m c s 1 and d 0 533 m and snapshots for d 0 713 m is given in fig 13 for comparison it can be easily obtained that the wave is acting on the structure with stronger impact for smaller water depths from figs 12 a and 13 a and this stronger impact may be caused by the higher horizontal velocities in addition the rise in wave speed further causes larger horizontal wave forces a mass of wave breakings is generated in a shallower water condition as shown in fig 12 due to the high wave speed this impact effect increases horizontal and vertical forces on the deck with a box girder therefore larger wave forces with shallower water depths owe much to the impulsive forces additionally the decrease in water depth has a great influence on vertical uplift forces with a higher elevated height as shown in figs 7 c and 8 c compared to other elevated cases the vertical uplift forces with c s 1 suffered the greatest reduction it indicates that impulsive forces relate to the velocity of waves that act on the lateral side of superstructures and higher wave forces often generated when the height of the wave is similar to the elevated height of superstructures therefore a conclusion can be drawn that the impulsive wave forces play an important role in the vertical wave forces on the deck with a box girder especially for the high elevated superstructures 4 vulnerability assessment the east china sea region is located on the pacific rim volcanic seismic belt and because of the low terrain on the eastern coast of china it is greatly affected by the extreme waves due to the development of the economy and transportation the construction of large scale coastal bridges is underway extreme wave events not only cause structure damages but also affect the rescue after disasters thus an investigation of the vulnerability assessment of the coastal bridge in a region subjected to extreme hazards is necessary the selected coastal bridge is vulnerable to solitary wave forces especially for the simply supported approach span based on the experimental study of solitary wave forces investigated in the previous section and the capacity of the bridge the vulnerability assessment of the simply supported approach span of the selected coastal bridge are evaluated in this section 4 1 bridge s capacity and failure mode approach spans of the selected bridge are simply supported reinforced concrete bridges and they are easily damaged during the extreme wave conditions due to their low elevations because the approach spans are the transition parts between the main spans and coast region the geometrical parameters of the selected coastal bridges that located at haitan strait on the east china sea are already listed in section 2 2 table 1 according to the bridge design parameters the density of the reinforced concrete is around 2500 kg m3 thus we take ρ c 2500 kg m3 as the reinforce concrete density of the approach span in this study the capacity of a bridge in the vertical direction is determined by the total weight of the bridge which is calculated by multiplying the volume of bridge span by the relative density of the reinforced concrete since the deck with a box girder is submerged in the water under the cases of c s 0 5 and 1 the buoyancy force of the superstructure should be considered the buoyancy force of the deck with a box girder is calculated based on the volume of structure that submerged in the water and the saltwater density ρ w 1025 kg m3 since the prototype bridge is a multi span simply supported bridge only the condition where the vertical resistance is completely provided by the bridge weight is studied in this paper in addition the horizontal resistance comes from the friction forces between the superstructure and the substructure the capacity of bridge in the horizontal and vertical directions are calculated by 5 f h c t μ f w f b f v t 6 f v c f w f b where the horizontal resistance forces f hc t are expressed as the form of time history forces due to the vertical wave force f v t changes over time f w and f b represents for the weight and buoyancy force of the deck with a box girder respectively μ is the static friction coefficient that determined by the connection between the superstructure and substructure in the following study the failure of the superstructure with the commonly used direct contact and rubber bearing between the superstructure and the substructure are separately studied and discussed based on studies of lum et al 2011 and hayatdavoodi et al 2015 the friction coefficient is equal to 0 1 for direct contact dc for short and 0 8 for rubber bearing rb for short the detailed bridge capacity parameters are presented in table 2 in addition the experimental wave forces are transformed into the wave forces f he and f ve acts on the prototype superstructure based on the froude s criterion to compare with bridge s capacity at the same level according to the post disaster investigation and some vulnerability assessments of costal bridges under hazard events balomenos and padgett 2018 lau et al 2011 shoji and moriyama 2007 2011 yeh et al 2007 the failure of the simply support span under extreme wave events is defined if the deck is displaced either in the vertical or horizontal direction that is to say the unseating failure is determined as long as the experimental wave force exceeds the structure s capacity either in the vertical or horizontal direction 4 2 vulnerability assessment for dc and rb types the vulnerability assessment of the deck with a box girder for two contact forms dc and rb of the superstructure and substructure are separately investigated in this section to give a clear expression of the failure of the simply support span under extreme wave events the ratios of the time history of the experimental wave forces to the capacity of the bridge in the horizontal and vertical directions are presented the ratio larger than 1 represents the solitary wave forces on the selected bridge superstructure exceeds the bridge resistance the failure of vertical direction state that the vertical wave forces can directly cause the bridge deck to detach from the substructure and the failure of horizontal direction indicated that the combination of vertical and horizontal wave force causes the unseating of superstructure all the conditions illustrated in fig 5 are tested in this section based on the experimental results and bridge s capacity figs 14 and 15 show the time history ratios of the wave forces to the bridge capacity both in horizontal and vertical direction for two wave conditions as shown in figs 14 b and 15 b the ratio of the wave forces to the bridge capacity both exceed the limit 1 which means the large vertical wave forces in both two wave conditions can completely separate the deck with a box girder from the substructure obviously large wave heights will cause large vertical ratio values also the large ratio value in vertical direction represents the vertical wave force is greater than the weight of the bridge span compare to the rb type dc type gives larger ratios in the horizontal direction the extreme large horizontal ratios in figs 14 and 15 are generated because the lateral resistance is too small relative to the horizontal wave forces due to large vertical wave forces the bridge itself can be completely unseated during the wave action in the partial enlargement of figs 14 and 15 they show that the large friction coefficient rb type can bring a huge reduction in horizontal ratios to give a clear comparison of failure probability between dc and rb type the failure possibilities for the selected range of wave conditions were calculated it should be noted that the failure probabilities of the deck with a box girder are calculated only based on the limited number of wave conditions presented in this manuscript and consequently the results shown in figs 16 and 17 correspond only to these conditions comprehensive wave conditions should be conducted and developed to investigate the accurate fragility curves or fragility surfaces of the bridge vulnerability in the future works fig 16 provides the variations of the failure probability of dc and rb types varies with the submergence coefficient it should be noted that if the wave condition satisfies any failure mode in the horizontal or vertical direction it is included in the total failure number finally dividing the total failure number by the total number of working conditions is the failure probability of the dc or rb type compared to the dc type the rb type can significantly reduce the failure probability of the deck with a box girder this shows that if the lateral resistance of the bridge structure can be improved it will help to increase the survival probability of the coastal bridge superstructure under extreme wave events as for the case with submergence coefficient is 0 5 the large vertical wave forces and buoyancy forces caused by the water are the main reason that brings the high failure probability of the bridge structure fig 16 also demonstrates that the failure probability will be effectively reduced by increasing the elevation height of the superstructure fig 17 shows that increasing the lateral resistance has a greater benefit in reducing the failure probability of the superstructure when the wave height is small failure probabilities of dc and rb types for the horizontal and vertical directions separately are shown in table 3 table 3 shows that both the failure of vertical and horizontal direction can happen and the failure probability of horizontal direction for rb type are smaller than that for dc type due to the larger coefficient of friction therefore it is necessary to simultaneously increase the horizontal and vertical resistance of the bridge superstructure to survive the extreme wave conditions 5 conclusion this study addresses the vulnerability assessment of the superstructure in the coastal region by conducting an experimental investigation of wave forces on the deck with a box girder subjected to solitary wave forces the solitary induced horizontal and vertical wave forces are tested on 1 30 scale coastal bridge superstructure model in a medium sized wave flow flume in the southwest jiaotong university s deep water long span bridge laboratory the vulnerability assessment of simply supported superstructures subjected to solitary wave forces is determined based on the experimental wave forces and the structural capacity the failure probabilities of dc and rb connection types between the superstructure and substructure are analyzed based on these investigations the following conclusion is reached 1 compare to the submerged conditions the elevated superstructure suffers larger positive horizontal and vertical uplift wave forces in most cases 2 impulsive wave forces play an important role in the vertical wave forces on the deck with a box girder especially for the high elevated superstructures 3 the increasing of the horizontal resistance and the elevation height of the deck with a box girder can reduce the failure probability of coastal bridge superstructures under extreme wave events 4 it is necessary to simultaneously increase the horizontal and vertical resistance of the bridge superstructure to survive the extreme wave conditions 5 it should be noted that only the simply supported box type superstructure is included in the present study and further efforts should be made to consider the uncertainty of wave forces and structural capability and various connection types

22482,a way to quantified diffuser rotor interaction is presented for a micro diffuser augmented hydrokinetic turbine mdaht base on the actuator disc theory jamieson 2011 the large eddy simulation reynolds averaged navier stokes model des for computational fluid dynamics were employed to simulate for bare turbine bare diffuser and diffuser augmented turbine respectively the axial induction factor of bare diffuser was obtained via the average speed of the turbine center plane and that of both bare turbine and diffuser augmented turbine were obtained based on the computational c p and c t the result shows that the interaction between the diffuser and rotor are corresponding to equivalent axial induction factor a i and a i a d which is tightly relative to diffuser shape parameters and the operational parameters bigger angle of attack and camber of diffusers contributes to higher positive a i and higher negative a i a d and more energy harvesting performance on mdaht is acquired besides angle of attack and camber of diffuser also affected the variation of the c p and c t curve the maximum tsr point was shifted to higher tsr position with the increase of angle of attack and camber of diffuser and the angle of attack has a larger influence on the energy harvesting performance for mdaht comparing with the camber of diffuser moreover the influences of the tip clearances and diffuser contraction ratios on energy harvesting performance versus tsrs were also investigated keywords micro diffuser augmented hydrokinetic turbine rotor diffuser interaction equivalent axial induction factor computational fluid dynamics 1 introduction in recent years environmentally friendly almost zero impact on ecology and directly use of kinetic energy of flowing are more interesting paish 2002 tanbhir et al 2011 li et al 2018 and this kind of hydrokinetic energy is widely used in rivers artificial channels and ocean the local micro grid in rural and remote mountainous areas far from the national backbone power grid is also suitable for utilizing abundant ocean energy in the offshore area and supplementing the energy consumption of developed coastal industry herman et al 2014 therefore as a main core device for the utilization of hydrodynamic energy hydrokinetic turbines have received unprecedented attention in recent years brian 2005 khan et al 2008 2009 lago et al 2010 wang et al 2019 the main methods of developing a power turbine are still theoretical analysis experimental research and numerical simulation chipo and golden 2016 the first efforts to theoretical analysis was mainly based on the one dimensional idealized disk theory proposed by lanchester 1915 and betz 1920 which points out the maximum power coefficient is 0 593 for a actuator disc immersed into a free flow until 2008 jamieson 2008 presented a generalized actuator disc theory to deduce the limit for energy extraction from the flow experimental research has one of the main research methods for hydrokinetic turbines for example sabzevari 1977 studied hydrokinetic turbines placed in a simple shape guide and experimental tests found that the front duct can significantly increase the turbine rotation speed but it is difficult to increase the rotation speed by placing the free flow however these early studies focused on the fixed flow direction while the mechanism for increasing the speed of the hydrokinetic turbine with varying flow directions was rarely studied gilbert et al 1978 conducted experimental tests for wind turbine with diffuser and found that the performance is improved nearly 2 times compared to that of turbine only igra 1981 found that the wind turbine was placed in the shroud and the special tail vortex structure was generated at the tail and the outlet pressure was lower so as to extract more kinetic energy anzai et al 2004 analyzed in detail the influence of the position of the front duct with different cylindrical shapes and dimensions and the relative position of the wind turbine and the front duct on the performance of the wind turbine and optimized the design of the front duct batten et al 2007 numerically simulate and tested the power and thrust of a marine turbine based on blade element momentum bem theory ghajar and badr 2008 explored the effects of different wind directionality on the performance of wind turbines and experimentally compared under different shroud combinations ie without shroud front shroud rear shroud they found that the wind direction within 45 had little effect on the energy extract characteristics of the front and rear shroud wind turbines cresswell et al 2015 conducted a wind tunnel experiment for a turbine with diffuser and found that the yawed angle within 30 can maintain good performance shahsavarifard et al 2015 tested two types of hydrokinetic turbines with shrouds in the tank and found that the maximum power coefficient was 1 91 times higher than that without the shroud nunes et al 2019 used wind tunnel to test a ducted hydrokinetic turbine performance pointing out that duct design is important to the minimization of the volume of material song et al 2019 implemented numerical and experimental tests for a micro diffuser augmented turbine with the development of computational fluid dynamics and computer technology recent numerical methods have gradually become a more popular research method the simple and classical calculating methods are usually based on the bem theory which has been studied and adopted by many scholars fletcher 1980 murray and barone 2011 burton 2011 garrad 2012 troncoso et al 2015 allsop et al 2017 but because the model is based on the idealized energy equation its studies on complex hydrokinetic turbines with shrouds are somewhat inadequate the more complex numerical model applied at this stage is mainly based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd model which is represented by the reynolds averaged navier stokes computational fluid dynamics rans cfd model but it needs higher computing resources and computing time hansen et al 2000 shives and crawford 2011 chen and zhou 2014 fleming and willden 2016 for example hansen et al 2000 simplified the turbine to a disk and studied the influence of the shroud on its energy extracted characteristics it was found that the maximum power coefficient can exceed the limit of betz theory due to the relative increase of mass flow rate through the disk shives and crawford 2011 used rans cfd to propose an empirical prediction model for the shroud power turbine it is believed that the shroud geometry shape has a great influence on the energy harvesting performance of the turbine but the turbine is still simplified to disc chen and zhou 2014 performed a rans cfd numerical simulation on a rotating ducted turbine and found that energy extracted of ducted turbine in all operating conditions was higher than that of corresponding bare turbine ghassemi et al 2018 used rans solver to study the effect of duct and number of blades on a tidal turbine performance showing that a great number of blades can extract more energy from water shi et al 2015 used rans cfd and model test to study a thin wall diffuser turbine for tide energy showing that diffuser can increase the power coefficient and the drag coefficient over the whole varying range of tsrs chica et al 2018 used rans cfd to study the diffuser effect on hydrodynamic performance of a hydrokinetic turbine showing the extracted power can be larger than that of a bare turbine and an increase in the mass flow through the turbine blades was achieved nishi et al 2019 used piv method and cfd tool to carry out a study on small hydro hydrokinetic turbine showing the type of vortexes that occur downstream of the hydraulic turbine are different and the process and distance of velocity recovery differ depending on the vortex due to the influence of free surface and channel bottom nugroho et al 2018 studied the hydrodynamic performance of a diffuser augmented turbine by different airfoil diffuser section showing the best performance of naca 11414 2 5r is on angle of 16 which numerically has stream velocity 0 91 m s fleming and willden 2016 analyzed many double ducted turbines and found that energy harvesting efficiency was reduced relative to a turbine without a duct but it still simplified the turbine to a disk tampier et al 2017 used transient rans cfd to analyze the hydrodynamic characteristics and axial induction factors of a single diffuser a single turbine and a diffuser turbine it is considered that the interaction between the diffuser and the turbine is critical and should be considered when designing a diffuser hydrokinetic turbine in order to save computing resources some researcher combined cfd and bem theory to develop a compromise calculation model namely reynolds averaged navier stokes blade element momentum rans bem model fleming et al 2011 turnock 2011 belloni et al 2017 for example belloni et al 2017 used a coupled rans bem model to analyze a double directed ducted turbine and their conclusions was consistent with the literature fleming and willden 2016 recently bontempo and manna 2016 studied the influence of the duct thrust on the efficiency of the wind turbine and believed that the increase of the duct thrust is beneficial to the efficiency of the wind turbine kosasih and saleh 2016 studied the influence of turbulence intensity on the energy extracting characteristics of the bare and ducted wind turbine and found that the efficiency of both turbine are all decreases with the increase of turbulence intensity within a certain range of tip speed ratio however the efficiency of the ducted wind turbine is always higher than that of the corresponding bare wind turbine jerson and david 2016 used the bem theory to optimize the design of the ducted wind turbine and explored the possible maximum energy extracting efficiency of the ducted wind turbine allsop et al 2018 used the adapted rans bem to carry out a study on a 3 bladed tidal stream turbine showing the proposed model reduces the computational effort by several orders of magnitude compared to the reference coupled cfd making it suitable for engineering assessments from the above research results it can be seen that the researches on power turbines with duct are still in the stage of theoretical exploration and concept machine especially for micro ducted hydrokinetic turbines these research results mainly focused on three aspects 1 optimal design of placement position length and inflow angle of the diffuser 2 correction and development of bem theory combined cfd 3 the influence of turbulence vortex structure flow direction and wake flow field on energy extracting performance despite this there are still some key technical problems in the development of hydrokinetic turbines for example the interference of the stationary and rotating components of the unit the interaction between the diffuser and rotor and how this interaction affects the hydrodynamic behavior and energy extracting performance of the hydrokinetic turbine in this study we present a method to calculate the interaction between the diffuser and turbine and directly obtain the magnitude of interaction between the diffuser and turbine with an equivalent axial induce factor based on the numerical results of cfd the rest of this paper is organized as follows the generalized actuator disc theory and its relation to the axial induction factor will be simply introduced in section 2 the case application and describe are introduced in section 3 the numerical method and computational set up is introduced in section 4 results and discuss in section 5 and 6 finally the paper is concluded in section 7 2 generalized actuator disc theory the generalized actuator disc theory gadt was proposed by jamieson 2011 which considered the diffuser effects through a new axial induction factor as illustrated in fig 1 application of bernoulli s equation in the upstream side of the extracted plane leads to 1 p 0 1 2 ρ v 0 2 p 1 1 2 ρ v 0 2 1 a 2 and on the downstream side of the extraction plane 2 p 1 δ p 1 2 ρ v 0 2 1 a 2 p 0 1 2 ρ v 0 2 1 f a 2 where f a is the axial induction in the far wake consider the relation between the pressure variations at any plane with the thrust coefficient c t 3 δ p a 1 2 ρ v 0 2 a c t hence 4 c t 2 δ p ρ v 0 2 the relation of the thrust coefficient with the axial induction is obtained via eqs 1 2 and 4 namely 5 c t 2 f a f a 2 the function f a is unknown but restricted to the following three conditions according to jamieson 2011 namely 1 in the presence of the rotor since energy is extracted out from the system the velocity in the far wake must be less than the ambient i e f a 0 for a a 0 2 when the flow is fully blocked a 1 and c t 0 3 when without energy extraction the axial induction at the energy extraction plane is a 0 and f a 0 and when there is no blockage a 0 0 considering conservation of mass in the flow according to jamieson 2011 then 6 f a 2 a a 0 1 a 0 it can be seen that the blockage of diffuser is considered in the gadt the far wake induction f a 2 a a 0 1 a 0 if there is no diffuser for the open flow rotor a 0 0 the far wake induction f a 2 a they correspond as they must to the established equations for open flow now substituting for f a in eq 5 gives 7 c t 4 a a 0 1 a 1 a 0 2 and the power coefficient c p can be expressed as 8 c p 4 a a 0 1 a 2 1 a 0 2 since the power coefficient c p has a relation with thrust coefficient c t c p and c t is obtained by cfd the axial induction factor a can be calculated by eq 9 9 a 1 c p c t for investigation on the interaction between the diffuser and rotor a decomposition of the axial induction factor a is presented as follows 10 a a t a d a i a d is the axial induction factor of the bare diffuser which is obtained from the average speed of the turbine plane a and a t is corresponding to the axial induction factor of diffuser augmented turbine and bare turbine respectively which can be obtained via eq 9 once the power coefficients and thrust coefficient for a diffuser augmented turbine and a bare turbine are known then the interaction term a i can be obtained via eq 10 then the axial induction factors of diffuser only is obtained via the average flowing speed in the turbine centre plane tampier et al 2017 and that of both bare turbine and diffuser augmented turbine are obtained via the generalized actuator disc theory based on the computational power coefficient and thrust 3 application for a diffuser augmented turbine a hydrofoils developed by the fluid structure coupling innovation team of kmust are applied to design the rotor based on the bem theory with tip loss correction shen et al 2005 the rotor has three blades and its diameter is 1 98 m which is shown in fig 2 in this study the generic mdaht diffuser is based on an asymmetrical naca0012 airfoil chord length is 1 2d d is the diameter of rotor shown in fig 3 the rotor was the same general configuration as the one used for the bare turbine the influences of diffuser parameters on hydrodynamic performance of mdaht are discussed by altering the cambers and angles of attack of diffuser cross section for the convenience of differentiating the diffuser the notation f x1 x2 is applied where x1 represents the relative camber divided by maximum thickness and x2 represents the angle between the airfoil chord and the diffuser axis for instance f 0 75 15 stands for the relative camber is 0 75 and the attack angle is 15 4 numerical methods and computational setup the computations were performed using ansys fluent software and the iteration convergence criteria for all flowing variable was set 0 0001 according to the geometry of the turbine and the actual flow conditions the computational domain is cylinder the diameter of the domain is 10d d is diameter of turbine the distance between the center plane of the turbine and the inlet is 4d and the distance between the center planet and the outlet is 7d the mrf model frank 2015 is used to simulate the rotating effects and the computational domain is divided into rotatory zone and stationary zone the rotatory zone was set as a small cylinder enveloping the rotor boundary conditions were set as velocity inlet an outflow outlet and a free slip wall condition for the domain walls the rotor was configured inside a rotatory zone as a no slip wall the diffuser surface was also set as a no slip wall the rotatory domain kept the same diameter as the turbine for different mdaht cases fig 4 shows the computational domain and boundary conditions for mdaht for a current velocity of 2 0 m s assuming a reference length equal to the rotor diameter 1 98 m the reynolds number is about 4 0 106 and assuming a reference length equal to the length of chord line at blade tip element section 0 113 m a reference velocity is the absolute velocity at blade tip it is 12 165 at tsr 6 0 the maximum reynolds number is about 1 38 106 at blade tip section when tsr is 6 0 the hybrid turbulent model des les combined with k ω sst was used the unsteady k ω sst model is employed in the boundary layer and the les treatment is applied to the separated regions the les region is normally associated with the core turbulent region where large unsteady turbulence scales play a dominant role in this region the hybrid les rans models recover les like sub grid models in the near wall region the respective k ω sst model is recovered details of this model can be referenced to menter s work menter et al 2003 three different computational configurations for the simulations of the bare turbine diffuser only and diffuser augmented turbine were implemented respectively which is corresponding to obtain the bare turbine induction factor a t diffuser induction factor a d and total induction factor a respectively fig 5 shows the mesh for computational domain of diffuser augmented turbine to satisfy the requirements of the transition k ω sst model the grid is more dense and the surface is configured to have a prism layer including 7 inflation layers and a y 18 based on re 4 0 106 for the rotor and diffuser surfaces first layer the roughness was set at 0 5 as no slip wall a mesh independence assessment domain size independence assessment and y wall distribution independence assessment were implemented by compare the c p and c t of mdaht at current velocity of 2 m s and tsr 4 0 shown in tables 1 3 which suggested that the 11m 4d 7d 10d and y 18 respect to the references belloni et al 2017 y 15 kosasih and saleh 2016 y 10 shi et al 2015 y 10 were considered adequate the whole computational zone is around 7 million elements for the bare diffuser case and around 11 million for the diffuser augmented turbine case and around 4 million for bare turbine case besides it is worth to mention that the channel blockage ratio β for the bare turbine case is 0 00997 and the β for the mdaht of f 1 0 20 diffuser with the largest outlet case is 0 0413 according to tampier and zilic 2018 therefore such small β have a little effect on blockage correction of c p and c t which is neglected in our study 5 mdaht hydrodynamic performance in this section the f 0 75 15 mdaht was applied when a rotor with radius r is rotating with angular velocity ω and inlet velocity v it generates thrust and torque the hydrodynamic performance characteristics of the rotor can be defined as the non dimensional coefficients such as the tip speed ratio tsr the power coefficient c p and the thrust coefficient c t which can be computed respectively as follows 11 t s r ω r v π n r 30 v 12 c p p 0 5 ρ a v 3 13 c t t 0 5 ρ a v 2 where p represents the output power of rotor t represents rotor axis thrust ρ represents fluid density a r represents area of a reference surface for a bare turbine case a is the swept area π r 2 results listed in this section all numerical simulations are implemented at current velocity of 2 m s the experiments and cfd results for bare turbine are shown in fig 6 a the cfd results are in good agreement with the experimental results song et al 2019 the c p by cfd at five current speeds are all near to the experimental results and the maximum deviation is 3 0 which verifying the reliability of the numerical method the c p c t and axial inductions at current velocity of 2 m s with different tsrs of bare turbine and mdaht are shown in fig 6 b c d the maximum c p of the bare turbine is around 0 4 at tsr of 4 0 which is firstly increased with the rising of the tsr and reached its maximum then decreased with the rising of the tsr the maximum c p of the mdaht is around 0 8 at tsr of 5 0 it is observed that the mdaht features a sensibly higher power level and thrust coefficient across the range of tsr values with respect to the bare turbine the corresponding axial induction factor can be obtained via eq 9 it is observed that the mdaht induction a is lower than the bare turbine induction a t over the whole range of tsr and both of them increased with the rising of the tsr figs 7 and 8 show the axial velocities in transversal and longitudinal planes respectively it can be seen that the tsr have an important influence on the distribution of the flowing wake which leads to power coefficient c p changing with the tsr 5 1 effects of diffuser contraction ratios in order to study the hydrodynamic performance of mhadt under different diffuser contraction ratios let the relative camber and attack angle keep constant simultaneously diffuser contraction ratio γ is defined as the ratio of the diffuser outlet diameter to rotor diameter three different contraction ratios were selected namely 1 832 2 015 and 2 382 the relationship between the c p and c t against tsr of mhadt with different diffuser contraction ratios at speed of 2 m s is shown in fig 9 it can be observed that c p and c t all increase with the rising of contraction ratios at the same tsr while the tsr has some effects on the magnitude of increasing of power coefficient it is also investigated that there is a relative small variation on the c p and c t versus the contraction ratios when tsr is lower than 4 0 and it is a considerable growing when tsr is larger than 4 0 when compared with γ 1 832 case c p of γ 2 015 case increases by an average of 5 while c t increases by an average of 1 7 c p of γ 2 382 case increases by an average of 15 while c t increases by an average of 6 the increased diffuser outlet diameter enables a lower cavity pressure due to enhanced diffusion potential and a greater rotor plane velocity moreover contraction ratio of diffuser has some effect on the variation of the c p and c t curve the maximum tsr point of γ 2 382 case was shifted from 5 0 to 5 5 due to a larger inlet and outlet aero thus the topology of the curve line of power and thrust coefficient against tsr will be changed when beyond a certain range of contraction ratio 5 2 effects of tip clearances in order to study the hydrodynamic performance of mhadt under tip clearances between rotor and diffuser let other set keep constant four different tip clearances were selected namely 2 3 5 5 and 10 which is defined as the distance between the tip of rotor blade and the interface surface of diffuser on the throat divided by the rotor diameter the relationship between the c p c t and tsr of mhadt with different tip clearances at speed of 2 m s is shown in fig 10 it can be observed that tip clearances have little effect on c t and c p at tsr from 3 0 to 4 0 and c t and c p increase slightly with increasing of the tip clearance at tsr from 4 0 to 6 0 when the tip clearance is less than 5 however when the tip clearance reaches 10 it is observed that c t and c p have dropped comparing with 5 case besides a smaller tip clearance is not helpful to reduce the water flow resistance and when the tip clearance is small the water flow in the tip clearance is subjected to a large shear force while the relative flow channel is small therefore the leakage flow can only influence a small area which is advantageous from the hydrodynamic by providing a decrease in the amount of leakage and hence losses suspend the strong blade tip vortex krishnababu et al 2009 figs 11 and 12 shows the axial velocities of mdaht on longitudinal section under different tip clearances which has demonstrated that the bigger tip clearance has more leakage through the tip especially at higher tsr when the tip clearance reaches a certain height the interaction between rotor and diffuser becomes very weak at this time the performance of the mdaht does not substantially change with increasing of tip clearance and more leakage maybe decreases the energy harvesting efficient therefore it is suggested it is better to have a small tip clearance between diffuser and rotor within the range of the actual permit jia et al 2001 peacock 1982 6 interaction between rotor and diffuser varying camber and angle of attack in this section the γ 1 832 and 3 5 tip clearance keep invariable the results of the diffuser axial inductions a d at turbine plane for diffusers of different cambers and angles of attack are illustrated in fig 13 at current velocity of 2 m s it is shown that the diffuser axial inductions keep being nearly constant as long as large separation does not occur if there is a significant separation on the diffuser surface a small oscillating induction factors appears due to transient effects it is observed that a d are all negative which means an increase of the local velocity at the diffuser center plane and the value of diffuser axial inductions increase with the rising of camber when the angle of attack keeps constant however the absolute values of diffuser axial inductions firstly increase and then decrease with the rising of angle of attack when the camber keeps constant for some stall and separation occur on the diffusers with an angle of 20 which means there is an optimal angle of attack for different cambers the hydrodynamic performance of the sixteen mdaht cases at different tsrs and current velocity of 2 m s is reported in fig 14 it can be observed that the c p and c t values of each case are all first increasing and then decreasing with the rising of tsrs when the camber and angle and attack of diffuser keeps invariant both camber and angle of attack have a great influence on c p and c t when angle of attack remains unchanged c p and c t values increase with the rising of camber at all tsrs and the same pattern occurs when the camber remains unchanged it is also seen that the angle of attack has a bigger influence on the energy harvesting performance for mdaht comparing with the camber of diffuser therefore the angle of attack is the main factor to consider when designing a diffuser however it should be noted that an over big angle of attack may result in stall and separation for example when the angle of attack is bigger than 20 which is not conducive to the operation of mhadt e g ohya et al 2008 igra 1981 moreover the angle of attack and camber also affects the variation of the c p and c t curve on mdaht the maximum tsr point was shifted to higher tsr position with the increase of angle of attack and camber of diffuser such effect is in good agreement with those of coiro et al 2017 and nugroho et al 2018 who presented a similar trend for c p and c t from experiments and numerical simulations corresponding axial induction factor a is calculated based on the c p and c t of mdaht at different tsrs induction factors a i and a d a i of the sixteen mdaht cases are closely related to energy extraction behaviors of mdaht reported in fig 14 c f i and l it is observed that the a i increases with an increase in cambers over the range of tsr values when angles of attack remain unchanged in presented study the interaction induction factors a i are all positive at different tsrs for the same diffuser which means that the interactions between the turbine and diffuser are helpful to energy extraction it is also observed that cambers and angles of attack have a great influence on a d a i fig 14 c f i and l show a d a i follow different trends and they are all negative with varying tsrs which are helpful to improve the energy extraction on rotor comparing with corresponding c p and c t the bigger angle of attack and camber of diffusers is the higher positive a i and higher negative a i a d is which means to increase the velocity of rotor plane in another word extracting more momentum of flow and more energy harvesting performance on mdaht is achieved form these results it can be concluded that the key point for designing of mdaht is optimized attack angle of diffuser under moderate camber considering the interaction effects between rotor and diffuser 7 conclusions a method to evaluate the interaction between rotor and diffuser for mdaht based on the generalized actuator disc theory and des models for cfd method was presented a series of data under different diffuser shape parameters of mdaht including bare turbine bare diffuser and diffuser augmented turbine was to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance and the rotor diffuser interaction the following conclusions are drawn diffuser contraction ratios and tip clearances both have effects on the hydrodynamic performance of mdaht system c p and c t values increase with an increase in diffuser contraction ratios γ within whole tsr range in presented case for every 10 increase in contraction ratio c p will increase by 5 and c t will increase by 2 the deviations of c t and c p for different tip clearances basically remain unchanged at lower tsrs 3 0 4 0 and the deviations of c t and c p become more obvious with increasing of the tip clearance when at higher tsrs 4 0 6 0 the interaction effects between the diffuser and rotor is closely related to the diffuser shape parameters the axis induction factors based on the generalized actuator disc theory for mdaht can prove very helpful for understanding interaction effects between each component of mdaht which is not only relevant to the bare diffuser shape parameters but also to the operational parameters given this a i and a d a i performs a strong reference function in terms of the energy extraction capacities of a system within a certain range of angle of attack and camber the bigger angle of attack and camber of diffusers is the higher positive a i and higher negative a i a d is which means to increase the velocity of rotor plane in another word extracting more momentum of flow and more energy harvesting performance on mdaht is achieved the angle of attack and camber of diffuser have an impact on the variation of the c p and c t curve on mdaht the maximum tsr point was shifted to higher tsr position with the increase of angle of attack and camber of diffuser and the angle of attack has a bigger influence on the energy harvesting performance for mdaht comparing with the camber of diffuser mdaht design is required a suitable diffuser shape parameter it is better to compromise in consideration of all parameters according to the local actual situation considering the interaction between the rotor and diffuser it is hoped that the study presented in this paper will prove useful for those wishing to design and enhance performance of hydro turbines and diffuser energy extraction devices

the result shows that the interaction between the diffuser and rotor are corresponding to equivalent axial induction factor a i and a i a d which is tightly relative to diffuser shape parameters and the operational parameters bigger angle of attack and camber of diffusers contributes to higher positive a i and higher negative a i a d and more energy harvesting performance on mdaht is acquired besides angle of attack and camber of diffuser also affected the variation of the c p and c t curve the maximum tsr point was shifted to higher tsr position with the increase of angle of attack and camber of diffuser and the angle of attack has a larger influence on the energy harvesting performance for mdaht comparing with the camber of diffuser moreover the influences of the tip clearances and diffuser contraction ratios on energy harvesting performance versus tsrs were also investigated keywords micro diffuser augmented hydrokinetic turbine rotor diffuser interaction equivalent axial induction factor computational fluid dynamics 1 introduction in recent years environmentally friendly almost zero impact on ecology and directly use of kinetic energy of flowing are more interesting paish 2002 tanbhir et al 2011 li et al 2018 and this kind of hydrokinetic energy is widely used in rivers artificial channels and ocean the local micro grid in rural and remote mountainous areas far from the national backbone power grid is also suitable for utilizing abundant ocean energy in the offshore area and supplementing the energy consumption of developed coastal industry herman et al 2014 therefore as a main core device for the utilization of hydrodynamic energy hydrokinetic turbines have received unprecedented attention in recent years brian 2005 khan et al 2008 2009 lago et al 2010 wang et al 2019 the main methods of developing a power turbine are still theoretical analysis experimental research and numerical simulation chipo and golden 2016 the first efforts to theoretical analysis was mainly based on the one dimensional idealized disk theory proposed by lanchester 1915 and betz 1920 which points out the maximum power coefficient is 0 593 for a actuator disc immersed into a free flow until 2008 jamieson 2008 presented a generalized actuator disc theory to deduce the limit for energy extraction from the flow experimental research has one of the main research methods for hydrokinetic turbines for example sabzevari 1977 studied hydrokinetic turbines placed in a simple shape guide and experimental tests found that the front duct can significantly increase the turbine rotation speed but it is difficult to increase the rotation speed by placing the free flow however these early studies focused on the fixed flow direction while the mechanism for increasing the speed of the hydrokinetic turbine with varying flow directions was rarely studied gilbert et al 1978 conducted experimental tests for wind turbine with diffuser and found that the performance is improved nearly 2 times compared to that of turbine only igra 1981 found that the wind turbine was placed in the shroud and the special tail vortex structure was generated at the tail and the outlet pressure was lower so as to extract more kinetic energy anzai et al 2004 analyzed in detail the influence of the position of the front duct with different cylindrical shapes and dimensions and the relative position of the wind turbine and the front duct on the performance of the wind turbine and optimized the design of the front duct batten et al 2007 numerically simulate and tested the power and thrust of a marine turbine based on blade element momentum bem theory ghajar and badr 2008 explored the effects of different wind directionality on the performance of wind turbines and experimentally compared under different shroud combinations ie without shroud front shroud rear shroud they found that the wind direction within 45 had little effect on the energy extract characteristics of the front and rear shroud wind turbines cresswell et al 2015 conducted a wind tunnel experiment for a turbine with diffuser and found that the yawed angle within 30 can maintain good performance shahsavarifard et al 2015 tested two types of hydrokinetic turbines with shrouds in the tank and found that the maximum power coefficient was 1 91 times higher than that without the shroud nunes et al 2019 used wind tunnel to test a ducted hydrokinetic turbine performance pointing out that duct design is important to the minimization of the volume of material song et al 2019 implemented numerical and experimental tests for a micro diffuser augmented turbine with the development of computational fluid dynamics and computer technology recent numerical methods have gradually become a more popular research method the simple and classical calculating methods are usually based on the bem theory which has been studied and adopted by many scholars fletcher 1980 murray and barone 2011 burton 2011 garrad 2012 troncoso et al 2015 allsop et al 2017 but because the model is based on the idealized energy equation its studies on complex hydrokinetic turbines with shrouds are somewhat inadequate the more complex numerical model applied at this stage is mainly based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd model which is represented by the reynolds averaged navier stokes computational fluid dynamics rans cfd model but it needs higher computing resources and computing time hansen et al 2000 shives and crawford 2011 chen and zhou 2014 fleming and willden 2016 for example hansen et al 2000 simplified the turbine to a disk and studied the influence of the shroud on its energy extracted characteristics it was found that the maximum power coefficient can exceed the limit of betz theory due to the relative increase of mass flow rate through the disk shives and crawford 2011 used rans cfd to propose an empirical prediction model for the shroud power turbine it is believed that the shroud geometry shape has a great influence on the energy harvesting performance of the turbine but the turbine is still simplified to disc chen and zhou 2014 performed a rans cfd numerical simulation on a rotating ducted turbine and found that energy extracted of ducted turbine in all operating conditions was higher than that of corresponding bare turbine ghassemi et al 2018 used rans solver to study the effect of duct and number of blades on a tidal turbine performance showing that a great number of blades can extract more energy from water shi et al 2015 used rans cfd and model test to study a thin wall diffuser turbine for tide energy showing that diffuser can increase the power coefficient and the drag coefficient over the whole varying range of tsrs chica et al 2018 used rans cfd to study the diffuser effect on hydrodynamic performance of a hydrokinetic turbine showing the extracted power can be larger than that of a bare turbine and an increase in the mass flow through the turbine blades was achieved nishi et al 2019 used piv method and cfd tool to carry out a study on small hydro hydrokinetic turbine showing the type of vortexes that occur downstream of the hydraulic turbine are different and the process and distance of velocity recovery differ depending on the vortex due to the influence of free surface and channel bottom nugroho et al 2018 studied the hydrodynamic performance of a diffuser augmented turbine by different airfoil diffuser section showing the best performance of naca 11414 2 5r is on angle of 16 which numerically has stream velocity 0 91 m s fleming and willden 2016 analyzed many double ducted turbines and found that energy harvesting efficiency was reduced relative to a turbine without a duct but it still simplified the turbine to a disk tampier et al 2017 used transient rans cfd to analyze the hydrodynamic characteristics and axial induction factors of a single diffuser a single turbine and a diffuser turbine it is considered that the interaction between the diffuser and the turbine is critical and should be considered when designing a diffuser hydrokinetic turbine in order to save computing resources some researcher combined cfd and bem theory to develop a compromise calculation model namely reynolds averaged navier stokes blade element momentum rans bem model fleming et al 2011 turnock 2011 belloni et al 2017 for example belloni et al 2017 used a coupled rans bem model to analyze a double directed ducted turbine and their conclusions was consistent with the literature fleming and willden 2016 recently bontempo and manna 2016 studied the influence of the duct thrust on the efficiency of the wind turbine and believed that the increase of the duct thrust is beneficial to the efficiency of the wind turbine kosasih and saleh 2016 studied the influence of turbulence intensity on the energy extracting characteristics of the bare and ducted wind turbine and found that the efficiency of both turbine are all decreases with the increase of turbulence intensity within a certain range of tip speed ratio however the efficiency of the ducted wind turbine is always higher than that of the corresponding bare wind turbine jerson and david 2016 used the bem theory to optimize the design of the ducted wind turbine and explored the possible maximum energy extracting efficiency of the ducted wind turbine allsop et al 2018 used the adapted rans bem to carry out a study on a 3 bladed tidal stream turbine showing the proposed model reduces the computational effort by several orders of magnitude compared to the reference coupled cfd making it suitable for engineering assessments from the above research results it can be seen that the researches on power turbines with duct are still in the stage of theoretical exploration and concept machine especially for micro ducted hydrokinetic turbines these research results mainly focused on three aspects 1 optimal design of placement position length and inflow angle of the diffuser 2 correction and development of bem theory combined cfd 3 the influence of turbulence vortex structure flow direction and wake flow field on energy extracting performance despite this there are still some key technical problems in the development of hydrokinetic turbines for example the interference of the stationary and rotating components of the unit the interaction between the diffuser and rotor and how this interaction affects the hydrodynamic behavior and energy extracting performance of the hydrokinetic turbine in this study we present a method to calculate the interaction between the diffuser and turbine and directly obtain the magnitude of interaction between the diffuser and turbine with an equivalent axial induce factor based on the numerical results of cfd the rest of this paper is organized as follows the generalized actuator disc theory and its relation to the axial induction factor will be simply introduced in section 2 the case application and describe are introduced in section 3 the numerical method and computational set up is introduced in section 4 results and discuss in section 5 and 6 finally the paper is concluded in section 7 2 generalized actuator disc theory the generalized actuator disc theory gadt was proposed by jamieson 2011 which considered the diffuser effects through a new axial induction factor as illustrated in fig 1 application of bernoulli s equation in the upstream side of the extracted plane leads to 1 p 0 1 2 ρ v 0 2 p 1 1 2 ρ v 0 2 1 a 2 and on the downstream side of the extraction plane 2 p 1 δ p 1 2 ρ v 0 2 1 a 2 p 0 1 2 ρ v 0 2 1 f a 2 where f a is the axial induction in the far wake consider the relation between the pressure variations at any plane with the thrust coefficient c t 3 δ p a 1 2 ρ v 0 2 a c t hence 4 c t 2 δ p ρ v 0 2 the relation of the thrust coefficient with the axial induction is obtained via eqs 1 2 and 4 namely 5 c t 2 f a f a 2 the function f a is unknown but restricted to the following three conditions according to jamieson 2011 namely 1 in the presence of the rotor since energy is extracted out from the system the velocity in the far wake must be less than the ambient i e f a 0 for a a 0 2 when the flow is fully blocked a 1 and c t 0 3 when without energy extraction the axial induction at the energy extraction plane is a 0 and f a 0 and when there is no blockage a 0 0 considering conservation of mass in the flow according to jamieson 2011 then 6 f a 2 a a 0 1 a 0 it can be seen that the blockage of diffuser is considered in the gadt the far wake induction f a 2 a a 0 1 a 0 if there is no diffuser for the open flow rotor a 0 0 the far wake induction f a 2 a they correspond as they must to the established equations for open flow now substituting for f a in eq 5 gives 7 c t 4 a a 0 1 a 1 a 0 2 and the power coefficient c p can be expressed as 8 c p 4 a a 0 1 a 2 1 a 0 2 since the power coefficient c p has a relation with thrust coefficient c t c p and c t is obtained by cfd the axial induction factor a can be calculated by eq 9 9 a 1 c p c t for investigation on the interaction between the diffuser and rotor a decomposition of the axial induction factor a is presented as follows 10 a a t a d a i a d is the axial induction factor of the bare diffuser which is obtained from the average speed of the turbine plane a and a t is corresponding to the axial induction factor of diffuser augmented turbine and bare turbine respectively which can be obtained via eq 9 once the power coefficients and thrust coefficient for a diffuser augmented turbine and a bare turbine are known then the interaction term a i can be obtained via eq 10 then the axial induction factors of diffuser only is obtained via the average flowing speed in the turbine centre plane tampier et al 2017 and that of both bare turbine and diffuser augmented turbine are obtained via the generalized actuator disc theory based on the computational power coefficient and thrust 3 application for a diffuser augmented turbine a hydrofoils developed by the fluid structure coupling innovation team of kmust are applied to design the rotor based on the bem theory with tip loss correction shen et al 2005 the rotor has three blades and its diameter is 1 98 m which is shown in fig 2 in this study the generic mdaht diffuser is based on an asymmetrical naca0012 airfoil chord length is 1 2d d is the diameter of rotor shown in fig 3 the rotor was the same general configuration as the one used for the bare turbine the influences of diffuser parameters on hydrodynamic performance of mdaht are discussed by altering the cambers and angles of attack of diffuser cross section for the convenience of differentiating the diffuser the notation f x1 x2 is applied where x1 represents the relative camber divided by maximum thickness and x2 represents the angle between the airfoil chord and the diffuser axis for instance f 0 75 15 stands for the relative camber is 0 75 and the attack angle is 15 4 numerical methods and computational setup the computations were performed using ansys fluent software and the iteration convergence criteria for all flowing variable was set 0 0001 according to the geometry of the turbine and the actual flow conditions the computational domain is cylinder the diameter of the domain is 10d d is diameter of turbine the distance between the center plane of the turbine and the inlet is 4d and the distance between the center planet and the outlet is 7d the mrf model frank 2015 is used to simulate the rotating effects and the computational domain is divided into rotatory zone and stationary zone the rotatory zone was set as a small cylinder enveloping the rotor boundary conditions were set as velocity inlet an outflow outlet and a free slip wall condition for the domain walls the rotor was configured inside a rotatory zone as a no slip wall the diffuser surface was also set as a no slip wall the rotatory domain kept the same diameter as the turbine for different mdaht cases fig 4 shows the computational domain and boundary conditions for mdaht for a current velocity of 2 0 m s assuming a reference length equal to the rotor diameter 1 98 m the reynolds number is about 4 0 106 and assuming a reference length equal to the length of chord line at blade tip element section 0 113 m a reference velocity is the absolute velocity at blade tip it is 12 165 at tsr 6 0 the maximum reynolds number is about 1 38 106 at blade tip section when tsr is 6 0 the hybrid turbulent model des les combined with k ω sst was used the unsteady k ω sst model is employed in the boundary layer and the les treatment is applied to the separated regions the les region is normally associated with the core turbulent region where large unsteady turbulence scales play a dominant role in this region the hybrid les rans models recover les like sub grid models in the near wall region the respective k ω sst model is recovered details of this model can be referenced to menter s work menter et al 2003 three different computational configurations for the simulations of the bare turbine diffuser only and diffuser augmented turbine were implemented respectively which is corresponding to obtain the bare turbine induction factor a t diffuser induction factor a d and total induction factor a respectively fig 5 shows the mesh for computational domain of diffuser augmented turbine to satisfy the requirements of the transition k ω sst model the grid is more dense and the surface is configured to have a prism layer including 7 inflation layers and a y 18 based on re 4 0 106 for the rotor and diffuser surfaces first layer the roughness was set at 0 5 as no slip wall a mesh independence assessment domain size independence assessment and y wall distribution independence assessment were implemented by compare the c p and c t of mdaht at current velocity of 2 m s and tsr 4 0 shown in tables 1 3 which suggested that the 11m 4d 7d 10d and y 18 respect to the references belloni et al 2017 y 15 kosasih and saleh 2016 y 10 shi et al 2015 y 10 were considered adequate the whole computational zone is around 7 million elements for the bare diffuser case and around 11 million for the diffuser augmented turbine case and around 4 million for bare turbine case besides it is worth to mention that the channel blockage ratio β for the bare turbine case is 0 00997 and the β for the mdaht of f 1 0 20 diffuser with the largest outlet case is 0 0413 according to tampier and zilic 2018 therefore such small β have a little effect on blockage correction of c p and c t which is neglected in our study 5 mdaht hydrodynamic performance in this section the f 0 75 15 mdaht was applied when a rotor with radius r is rotating with angular velocity ω and inlet velocity v it generates thrust and torque the hydrodynamic performance characteristics of the rotor can be defined as the non dimensional coefficients such as the tip speed ratio tsr the power coefficient c p and the thrust coefficient c t which can be computed respectively as follows 11 t s r ω r v π n r 30 v 12 c p p 0 5 ρ a v 3 13 c t t 0 5 ρ a v 2 where p represents the output power of rotor t represents rotor axis thrust ρ represents fluid density a r represents area of a reference surface for a bare turbine case a is the swept area π r 2 results listed in this section all numerical simulations are implemented at current velocity of 2 m s the experiments and cfd results for bare turbine are shown in fig 6 a the cfd results are in good agreement with the experimental results song et al 2019 the c p by cfd at five current speeds are all near to the experimental results and the maximum deviation is 3 0 which verifying the reliability of the numerical method the c p c t and axial inductions at current velocity of 2 m s with different tsrs of bare turbine and mdaht are shown in fig 6 b c d the maximum c p of the bare turbine is around 0 4 at tsr of 4 0 which is firstly increased with the rising of the tsr and reached its maximum then decreased with the rising of the tsr the maximum c p of the mdaht is around 0 8 at tsr of 5 0 it is observed that the mdaht features a sensibly higher power level and thrust coefficient across the range of tsr values with respect to the bare turbine the corresponding axial induction factor can be obtained via eq 9 it is observed that the mdaht induction a is lower than the bare turbine induction a t over the whole range of tsr and both of them increased with the rising of the tsr figs 7 and 8 show the axial velocities in transversal and longitudinal planes respectively it can be seen that the tsr have an important influence on the distribution of the flowing wake which leads to power coefficient c p changing with the tsr 5 1 effects of diffuser contraction ratios in order to study the hydrodynamic performance of mhadt under different diffuser contraction ratios let the relative camber and attack angle keep constant simultaneously diffuser contraction ratio γ is defined as the ratio of the diffuser outlet diameter to rotor diameter three different contraction ratios were selected namely 1 832 2 015 and 2 382 the relationship between the c p and c t against tsr of mhadt with different diffuser contraction ratios at speed of 2 m s is shown in fig 9 it can be observed that c p and c t all increase with the rising of contraction ratios at the same tsr while the tsr has some effects on the magnitude of increasing of power coefficient it is also investigated that there is a relative small variation on the c p and c t versus the contraction ratios when tsr is lower than 4 0 and it is a considerable growing when tsr is larger than 4 0 when compared with γ 1 832 case c p of γ 2 015 case increases by an average of 5 while c t increases by an average of 1 7 c p of γ 2 382 case increases by an average of 15 while c t increases by an average of 6 the increased diffuser outlet diameter enables a lower cavity pressure due to enhanced diffusion potential and a greater rotor plane velocity moreover contraction ratio of diffuser has some effect on the variation of the c p and c t curve the maximum tsr point of γ 2 382 case was shifted from 5 0 to 5 5 due to a larger inlet and outlet aero thus the topology of the curve line of power and thrust coefficient against tsr will be changed when beyond a certain range of contraction ratio 5 2 effects of tip clearances in order to study the hydrodynamic performance of mhadt under tip clearances between rotor and diffuser let other set keep constant four different tip clearances were selected namely 2 3 5 5 and 10 which is defined as the distance between the tip of rotor blade and the interface surface of diffuser on the throat divided by the rotor diameter the relationship between the c p c t and tsr of mhadt with different tip clearances at speed of 2 m s is shown in fig 10 it can be observed that tip clearances have little effect on c t and c p at tsr from 3 0 to 4 0 and c t and c p increase slightly with increasing of the tip clearance at tsr from 4 0 to 6 0 when the tip clearance is less than 5 however when the tip clearance reaches 10 it is observed that c t and c p have dropped comparing with 5 case besides a smaller tip clearance is not helpful to reduce the water flow resistance and when the tip clearance is small the water flow in the tip clearance is subjected to a large shear force while the relative flow channel is small therefore the leakage flow can only influence a small area which is advantageous from the hydrodynamic by providing a decrease in the amount of leakage and hence losses suspend the strong blade tip vortex krishnababu et al 2009 figs 11 and 12 shows the axial velocities of mdaht on longitudinal section under different tip clearances which has demonstrated that the bigger tip clearance has more leakage through the tip especially at higher tsr when the tip clearance reaches a certain height the interaction between rotor and diffuser becomes very weak at this time the performance of the mdaht does not substantially change with increasing of tip clearance and more leakage maybe decreases the energy harvesting efficient therefore it is suggested it is better to have a small tip clearance between diffuser and rotor within the range of the actual permit jia et al 2001 peacock 1982 6 interaction between rotor and diffuser varying camber and angle of attack in this section the γ 1 832 and 3 5 tip clearance keep invariable the results of the diffuser axial inductions a d at turbine plane for diffusers of different cambers and angles of attack are illustrated in fig 13 at current velocity of 2 m s it is shown that the diffuser axial inductions keep being nearly constant as long as large separation does not occur if there is a significant separation on the diffuser surface a small oscillating induction factors appears due to transient effects it is observed that a d are all negative which means an increase of the local velocity at the diffuser center plane and the value of diffuser axial inductions increase with the rising of camber when the angle of attack keeps constant however the absolute values of diffuser axial inductions firstly increase and then decrease with the rising of angle of attack when the camber keeps constant for some stall and separation occur on the diffusers with an angle of 20 which means there is an optimal angle of attack for different cambers the hydrodynamic performance of the sixteen mdaht cases at different tsrs and current velocity of 2 m s is reported in fig 14 it can be observed that the c p and c t values of each case are all first increasing and then decreasing with the rising of tsrs when the camber and angle and attack of diffuser keeps invariant both camber and angle of attack have a great influence on c p and c t when angle of attack remains unchanged c p and c t values increase with the rising of camber at all tsrs and the same pattern occurs when the camber remains unchanged it is also seen that the angle of attack has a bigger influence on the energy harvesting performance for mdaht comparing with the camber of diffuser therefore the angle of attack is the main factor to consider when designing a diffuser however it should be noted that an over big angle of attack may result in stall and separation for example when the angle of attack is bigger than 20 which is not conducive to the operation of mhadt e g ohya et al 2008 igra 1981 moreover the angle of attack and camber also affects the variation of the c p and c t curve on mdaht the maximum tsr point was shifted to higher tsr position with the increase of angle of attack and camber of diffuser such effect is in good agreement with those of coiro et al 2017 and nugroho et al 2018 who presented a similar trend for c p and c t from experiments and numerical simulations corresponding axial induction factor a is calculated based on the c p and c t of mdaht at different tsrs induction factors a i and a d a i of the sixteen mdaht cases are closely related to energy extraction behaviors of mdaht reported in fig 14 c f i and l it is observed that the a i increases with an increase in cambers over the range of tsr values when angles of attack remain unchanged in presented study the interaction induction factors a i are all positive at different tsrs for the same diffuser which means that the interactions between the turbine and diffuser are helpful to energy extraction it is also observed that cambers and angles of attack have a great influence on a d a i fig 14 c f i and l show a d a i follow different trends and they are all negative with varying tsrs which are helpful to improve the energy extraction on rotor comparing with corresponding c p and c t the bigger angle of attack and camber of diffusers is the higher positive a i and higher negative a i a d is which means to increase the velocity of rotor plane in another word extracting more momentum of flow and more energy harvesting performance on mdaht is achieved form these results it can be concluded that the key point for designing of mdaht is optimized attack angle of diffuser under moderate camber considering the interaction effects between rotor and diffuser 7 conclusions a method to evaluate the interaction between rotor and diffuser for mdaht based on the generalized actuator disc theory and des models for cfd method was presented a series of data under different diffuser shape parameters of mdaht including bare turbine bare diffuser and diffuser augmented turbine was to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance and the rotor diffuser interaction the following conclusions are drawn diffuser contraction ratios and tip clearances both have effects on the hydrodynamic performance of mdaht system c p and c t values increase with an increase in diffuser contraction ratios γ within whole tsr range in presented case for every 10 increase in contraction ratio c p will increase by 5 and c t will increase by 2 the deviations of c t and c p for different tip clearances basically remain unchanged at lower tsrs 3 0 4 0 and the deviations of c t and c p become more obvious with increasing of the tip clearance when at higher tsrs 4 0 6 0 the interaction effects between the diffuser and rotor is closely related to the diffuser shape parameters the axis induction factors based on the generalized actuator disc theory for mdaht can prove very helpful for understanding interaction effects between each component of mdaht which is not only relevant to the bare diffuser shape parameters but also to the operational parameters given this a i and a d a i performs a strong reference function in terms of the energy extraction capacities of a system within a certain range of angle of attack and camber the bigger angle of attack and camber of diffusers is the higher positive a i and higher negative a i a d is which means to increase the velocity of rotor plane in another word extracting more momentum of flow and more energy harvesting performance on mdaht is achieved the angle of attack and camber of diffuser have an impact on the variation of the c p and c t curve on mdaht the maximum tsr point was shifted to higher tsr position with the increase of angle of attack and camber of diffuser and the angle of attack has a bigger influence on the energy harvesting performance for mdaht comparing with the camber of diffuser mdaht design is required a suitable diffuser shape parameter it is better to compromise in consideration of all parameters according to the local actual situation considering the interaction between the rotor and diffuser it is hoped that the study presented in this paper will prove useful for those wishing to design and enhance performance of hydro turbines and diffuser energy extraction devices

22483,wind energy plays an important role in the field of renewable energy due to its lower cost and the maturity of its manufacturing technology during the last few years there has been an increase in offshore wind turbine owt projects especially in china considering the fact that ocean environment where these offshore wind turbines operate usually has a negative impact on their structural health the demand for investigating the dynamic characteristics of offshore wind turbines based on sea test is increasing however current studies are mainly focused on method development theoretical analysis and numerical simulation and few attention has been given to the study of the dynamic characteristics of an actual owt in different operational states based on sea test to improve the current studies in september 2016 november 2016 and april 2017 a series of monitoring campaigns of an actual in service owt and its monopile were conducted at an offshore wind farm in the sea area near jiangsu province china for the purpose of acquiring high quality vibration signal one type of artificial excitation was adopted to excite the owt vibration in these monitoring campaigns with the help of a group of wireless health monitoring sensor nodes developed by ocean university of china ouc we successfully acquired the vibration signal of the wind turbine in parked state and normal operational state and acquired the vibration signal of the monopile in construction which means no tower was installed afterwards two modal analysis methods the eigensystem realization algorithm era and stochastic subspace identification ssi were used to obtain the modal parameters of the tested structure using the vibration signal under artificial excitation and random wave excitation respectively the results show that the era method can successfully identify the first two order modal parameters of the monopile and the first three order modal parameters of the wind turbine in parked or operational state however the ssi method failed to identify the third order modal parameters of the wind turbine regardless of whether it is in parked state or operational state only the first two order modal parameters can be identified meanwhile ssi failed to identify the modal parameters of the monopile concerning the high level environmental noise in an offshore site we applied weak mode identification wmi for the first time to obtain the modal parameters of owt using vibration signal under both artificial excitation and random wave excitation the results indicated that wmi has achieved the same good performance as the era when the vibration signal under artificial excitation is used when the vibration signal under random wave is used wmi successfully identified the first order modal parameters of the monopile and the first three order modal parameters of the wind turbine in parked or operational state which indicated a better ability than that of the ssi method we can conclude that the modal parameters of the wind turbine can be obtained by the wmi method and era method and the era method is the best way to obtain the modal parameters of monopile under artificial excitation these monitoring campaign of an actual owt not only provide modal information support for structural maintenance and operation safety assessment but also provide a real data

of owts has become a goal that has attracted attention from the owners of these offshore wind turbines martinez luengo et al 2016 structural health monitoring shm can improve the reliability of owts and provides guidance for reasonably arranging the maintenance schedule which can reduce the operation failure the vibration data acquirement under different conditions is the key point in understanding the structural health of owts with the improvement of the shm system and powerful algorithms for modal identification researchers have more opportunities to accurately understand the modal parameters of owts 1 1 monitoring systems for shm wireless sensor networks wsn are widely used in shm with the intensive study of wireless sensors wsn has tended to replace wired monitoring

electromagnetic noise in the study of the signal processing capability of sensor nodes bengherbia bengherbia et al 2017 introduced a set of wireless vibration signal acquisition equipment based on fpga for vibration monitoring and fault diagnosis as described by the author the ability of signal processing and data encryption were achieved by ip core and the system reaches a synchronization error of 60 ns which is far less than 10 μ s with no compromise of the accuracy of the structural analysis krishnamurthy et al 2008 herrasti herrasti et al 2016 developed a kind of wireless autonomous sensor node for the shm of wind turbines that is cheaper and easier to deploy with no requirement for power lines or communication cables and the sensor nodes proposed by the author have a signal conditioning circuit enabling the conditioning of accelerometers and strain gages so the universality of the system is greatly enhanced a high quality monitoring system is essential for shm and the current research has made great progress on the networking and node intelligence of monitoring systems for the shm of owts the monitoring system is required to be portable and to possess a high signal acquisition accuracy and a high time synchronization accuracy which is very important for the modal analysis during this monitoring campaign we applied a new type of wireless health monitoring system developed by ouc to acquire the vibration signal of the structure this monitoring system has 24 bits adc and a high time synchronization quality which guarantees the modal identification of the monitored structure detailed information of the monitoring systems will be introduced in section 2 1 2 modal identification theory once the vibration data is obtained the modal analysis can be conducted which is the most important step in diagnosing the damage or predicting the possible operation failures in the future in the modal analysis of civil structures era method is the most popular algorithm zhang et al 2014 era is a modal parameter identification method based on the impulse excitation response which was developed by juang and pappa based on the ho kalman system implementation algorithm and the theory of dynamic system in cybernetics since this algorithm was proposed various improvements and related research have been on going guowen zhang zhang et al 2014 proposed a modal similarity index to estimate the reliability of the modes identified by the era in which the energy contribution of each mode can be confirmed by the use of the mode energy level thus allowing the dominant mode is known in li et al 2011 the author discussed the noise issues when the era is applied in qu et al 2018 the author presented a modal response contribution index which can be used in distinguishing spurious modes in the use of era and the method was verified through both a numerical example and a practical bridge in addition to era method ssi method is a modal parameter identification method based on random excitation that was proposed by peeters b and roeck g in 1995 ssi has also been widely used in the field of modal identification the research and development of the ssi method has been on going guowen zhang zhang et al 2012 proposed an improved ssi for operational modal analysis to solve the low computational efficiency problem for dynamic systems with hysteretic damping an output only identification method was presented by anela bajrić and høgsberg 2018 on the basis of ssi in addition to the study of modal identification theory many other researchers also study the responses of owts under different sea states agarwal and manuel 2009 amirinia and jung 2017 jung et al 2015 kim and manuel 2013 2014 kim et al 2016 and the interaction between the vibration of tower and the vibration of blades has also been investigated gong and chen 2015 during this monitoring campaign we acquired the vibration signal of the structures under artificial excitation and random waves i e environmental excitation and the modal parameters are identified using the vibration data from the two kinds of excitation era is applied in artificial excitation condition and ssi is applied in random wave excitation condition however all field test data will inevitably contain noise and the identified modal parameters will inevitably contain errors as well li et al 2012 liu et al 2019 liu liu et al 2016 took the environmental noise issue in offshore sites into account and noted that this environmental noise would overwhelm the excited true mode once the singular value decomposition svd technique is used so there is a great possibility these true modes will be eliminated to avoid eliminating the true mode as noise we also apply wmi to identify the modal parameters of the structure the wmi method was verified by both numerical experiments and modal identification of two real offshore platforms liu et al 2016 this will be the first time the wmi is used to identify the modal parameters of an owt it is not difficult to conclude that the current studies are mainly focused on the simulation and mathematical proof of the new method even though excellent results have been achieved in the development of modal analysis theories such as the era and ssi few field tests have been conducted to identify the modal parameters of an actual owt otherwise the designers of owts have few opportunities to verify the errors between the actual modal parameters and the design modal parameters of owts the field monitoring campaign presented in this paper has selected an owt as the research object and investigates its dynamic characteristics during its construction and normal operation during the construction of the owt the research object is simply a monopile without a wind turbine tower being installed after the wind turbine tower was installed we acquired the vibration signal of the wind turbine both in the operational state and parked state subsequently we applied three kinds of modal analysis methods the era ssi and wmi methods to obtain modal parameters of the monitored structures this paper is divided into five parts the entire monitoring campaign will be introduced in section 2 including the location and characteristics of the measured wind turbine additionally the condition in which the monitored wind turbine was working the artificial method of generating excitation to make the monitored structures vibrate and the wireless monitoring system are all presented in this section in section 3 modal parameter identification theory including the era ssi and wmi is introduced a numerical verification of the wmi is presented in section 3 and the results of the modal parameter identification are shown in section 4 finally the conclusions from this field monitoring campaign are summarized in section 5 2 monitoring campaign of offshore wind turbine 2 1 monitored objects and working conditions these monitoring campaigns were conducted in september 2016 november 2016 and april 2017 the offshore wind farm shown in fig 1 is located in the yellow sea of china close to rudong county in jiangsu province fig 2 displays the monitored structures including the entire wind turbine and its monopile without the turbine tower being installed in september 2016 monopile was monitored in november 2016 after the wind turbine tower was installed the entire wind turbine in parked state was monitored in april 2017 the same wind turbine in operational state was monitored we essentially conducted a series of monitoring campaigns for an actual owt from its construction state to its normal operational state the monopile has a total length of 73 m and is 5 5 m in diameter of which 50 35 m are buried below the seabed and 22 65 m are from the seabed to the top of the monopile after completion of the construction of owt it has an installed capacity of 4 mw the total height of tower is 86 m and the length of blade is 88 m the monitored monopile was in the process of constructing without the tower being installed and the entire wind turbine was monitored in two working conditions the parked state and the normal operational state to obtain accurate modal analysis results artificial excitation was applied to the monitored structures which helped generate sufficient vibration 2 2 wireless structural health monitoring system in general structural health monitoring systems can be divided into two types the wired monitoring system and the wireless monitoring system during actual use the former system is to blame for its high cost and difficulties in installation and maintenance during these monitoring campaigns a set of wireless structural health monitoring systems developed by ouc was chosen to acquire the vibration signal of the monitored structure the system consists of several sensor nodes that are based on an fpga chip and powered by a lithium battery which can guarantee at least 48 h of power supply a laptop plays the role of the host computer and the sensor nodes are used as slave computers the connection between the host computer and a slave computer is achieved by the zigbee network and instruction information and status information are transmitted through the zigbee network the gps modules are integrated into the sensor nodes to achieve time synchronization among the different nodes the vibration signal is acquired through the three axis acceleration sensor and converted to a digital signal by a 24 bits 4 channel simultaneous sampling sigma delta adc after analogue to digital converting the digital signal will be stored in an sd card plugged in the sensor nodes taking the convenience of obtaining the vibration data into account a wi fi module has been added to the node so the acceleration data can be obtained by wi fi or directly by reading the sd card if necessary the working process of the wireless vibration acquisition equipment is shown in fig 3 these wireless sensor nodes have no power lines or communication cables so the difficulty of installation is smaller than that in traditional equipment with cables during the monitoring campaign all these sensor nodes are working at a 500 hz sampling rate 2 3 an artificial method to excite wind turbine vibration and the sensor node arrangement 2 3 1 an artificial method to excite wind turbine vibration taking into account the fact that the vibration generated by ocean waves is weak and almost completely overwhelmed by noise it is difficult for modal identification using a vibration signal under random wave excitation to deal with this problem a novel method was invented to make the wind turbine vibrate and it has been proven to be effective just like fig 4 shows an engineering ship is used as the excitation when the vibration signal acquiring equipment is installed well and has already entered the state of data acquisition the engineering ship will gently lean against the turbine the impact is so light that it will not cause any damage to the structure of the turbine but it will generate enough vibration for a better modal analysis result through this method the vibration signals of the monopile and wind turbine both in the parked state and operational state were generated 2 3 2 sensor nodes arrangement fig 5 shows the arrangement of wireless structural health monitoring equipment on the wind turbine tower five sensor nodes were used to record the vibration signal of the monitored structure on the top point is a5 sensor node and a1 sensor node is located at the junction of the tower and foundation the remainder of the five wireless sensor nodes are evenly arranged on the tower between a1 test point and a5 test point regarding the monopile these five sensor nodes are arranged at a distance of 2 m contrary to the wind turbine occasion on the top point is a1 sensor node while on the lowest point is a5 sensor node the other sensor nodes are evenly arranged between a1 sensor node and a5 sensor node fig 6 shows the sensor nodes arrangement on the monopile 2 4 structural vibration signal under different excitations the vibration signal acquired from the offshore structure is often overwhelmed by high level environment noise which introduces extra difficulty for the modal analysis fig 7 and fig 8 show different vibration signals acquired from wind turbine fig 7 shows a signal segment acquired under a random wave excitation and fig 8 shows a signal segment acquired under artificial excitation a fast fourier transform fft is performed upon each signal segment to further understand the signal characteristics in the frequency domain it can be easily concluded from fig 7 a and fig 8 a that the vibration signal under random wave excitation is much weaker than that under artificial excitation in the frequency domain just like fig 7 b and fig 8 b show there are more noise components in the vibration signal under random wave excitation which may turn out to be a case where the true weak mode may be eliminated as noise liu et al 2016 3 methodology 3 1 modal analysis method to interpret the massive vibration signals the modal parameters of the monitored structure were identified by three modal analysis methods namely era ssi and wmi for the vibration signal acquired under artificial excitation we applied the era method to identify the modal parameters of the structure and for the vibration signal acquired under random wave excitation ssi was applied to identify the modal parameters of the structure considering the high level noise in an offshore environment the true weak mode may be overwhelmed by ambient noise so wmi was applied to solve the problem where that true weak mode is buried in noise in the current section we mainly discuss the mathematical theory of these three modal analysis methods era and ssi are two typical mode identification methods which were developed for two different working conditions of the structures when there is an impulse excitation on the structure and the vibration response of the structure shows attenuation characteristics era is then adopted era is based on an impulse excitation response which was developed by juang and pappa based on the ho kalman system implementation algorithm and dynamic system theory of cybernetics according to the era theory one can form the generalized hankel matrix via markov parameters as shown in eq 1 1 h t k 1 h k h k 1 h k s h k 1 h k 2 h k s 1 h k r h k r 1 h k r s next working with the era formula and singular value decomposition the minimum realization of the system can be obtained and the structural modal parameters of the structure can be obtained by further calculation however one thing should be emphasized in a natural environment very few impulse excitations are applied to the structure which means artificial excitation is required when the era method is used unlike the era method the ssi method makes no request for impulse excitation which means the ssi method can be used to obtain the modal parameters of a structure when there is only ambient excitation according to ssi theory the hankel matrix is formed as shown in eq 2 2 y 0 2 i 1 1 j y 0 y 1 y 2 y j 1 y 1 y 2 y 3 y j y i 1 y i y i 1 y i j 2 y i y i 1 y i 2 y i j 1 y i 1 y i 2 y i 3 y i j y 2 i 1 y 2 i y 2 i 1 y 2 i j 2 y 0 i 1 y i 2 i 1 y p y f within the above formula y p and y f represent the past row space and future row space respectively once the projection of the future row space y f to the past row space y p is obtained the system matrix can be obtained as can the modal parameters dong et al 2018 the wmi method has been verified to be efficient in identifying the modal parameters of offshore platforms taking the ambient similarity between an offshore platform and an owt into account we adopted this method to investigate the dynamic characteristics of owts for the first time successfully obtaining modal parameters the basic idea of wmi is introduced as follows in regard to describing a system a system differential equation is usually the first thought that comes to mind for a low order system describing issue a system differential equation is the best choice and has been widely verified to be very efficient however the solution for a high order system is rather complicated to avoid this problem the transfer function is introduced to describe a high order system and its system poles and zeroes will be sufficient to determine the system response according to wmi theory the unforced response y t of a single input single output siso system can be written as 3 y t n 1 n m γ n e λ n t in eq 3 the constants γ n i e the residues are associated with the initial conditions and n m represents how many components that y t can be decomposed into solving the characteristic equation shown in eq 4 the roots will be λ n namely the system poles 4 d s s n a n 1 s n 1 a n 2 s n 2 a 0 in practice the response signal y t is sampled at a certain sampling frequency thus eq 3 has a discrete expression 5 y k y t k n 1 n m γ n e λ n k δ t among which t k is the discrete time series t k k δ t k 0 1 2 n 1 based on the discrete sampling points one can obtain a hankel matrix h k that has ξ rows and η columns according to the properties of the hankel matrix we know that ξ η n 1 6 h k y k y k 1 y k η 1 y k 1 y k 2 y k η y k ξ 1 y k ξ y k ξ η 2 with the help of a singular value decomposition and eigenvalue decomposition the estimated poles λ n can be obtained then the residues γ n can be calculated by eq 5 to separate the weak modes a frequency window f l f u that contains the unknown weak mode f t is required once the frequency window is determined the poles window λ l λ u and residue window γ l γ u can be determined according to eq 5 we can reconstruct the weak mode once its pole and residue are confirmed the proposed method normally requires a high model order but this will create unexpected fake modes according to the pole window and residue window the isolated poles and residues are as follows 7 λ w n w λ 1 λ 2 λ n o i λ 1 λ 2 λ n t 8 γ w n w γ 1 γ 2 γ n o i γ 1 γ 2 γ n t in the above formulas the fake modes are noted by a superscript and n o i represents the amount of fake modes and n t represents the amount of true modes additionally n w n o i n t should be emphasized substituting eq 7 and eq 8 into eq 5 we can reconstruct a signal that includes the weak modes and fake i e noisy modes 9 y k w y n o i y n t eq 9 indicates that we can obtain the weak modes buried in noise in practical engineering we often use time frequency analysis liu et al 2015 as reference to set an approximate estimate of the frequency window f w the above shows how to use wmi to obtain a weak mode using a single response signal however in the mode identification of an owt multiple sensors are deployed to collect the response of the structure in this way a mode shape plot can be obtained and the accuracy of the identified modal parameters can also be improved to deal with multiple response signals issue the above theory is generalized and the sampled data y k can be represented by a vector y k 10 y k y k 1 y k 2 y k m y k s substituting eq 10 into eq 6 and repeating the process described above the weak mode can be identified with multiple response signals 3 2 numerical verification of wmi in the actual monitoring campaign the modal information of the structure is usually identified by the signals from multiple observation points the following numerical example is used to introduce the method of identifying the mode information from multiple signals using wmi the simulated signal is synthesized by eq 11 11 y k n 1 3 b n e ξ n t k sin 2 π f n t k θ n in the example two synthesized signals are simulated as two different monitored signals from different test points the two signals share the same pole but have different noises table 1 shows the three components of signal 1 among the three components above the true weak mode is at 10 hz two noise modes are at 9 hz and 15 hz the synthesized signal is plotted in fig 9 a fig 9 b shows the synthesized signal in frequency domain using fft from fig 9 b it can be seen that the true mode is the weakest table 2 shows the three components of signal 2 the true mode is at 10 hz and the two noise components are at 9 5 hz and 12 hz the two signals share the same pole at 10 hz but different amplitudes for the purpose of simulating the actual monitoring environment the noise components of the two synthesized signals are different from one another because different test points may suffer from different noise environments fig 10 is the synthesized signal both in time and frequency domain for both of the two synthesized signal we set a sampling rate of 50 hz and the total sampled data points n 50 which means a total time duration of 1s substituting the sampled data into eq 10 then we can obtain eq 6 setting the model order to be 10 and with the help of singular value decomposition and eigenvalue decomposition and the estimated poles λ n can be obtained λ n 0 0200 56 5487 i 0 0150 59 6903 i 0 0200 62 8319 i 0 0100 75 3982 i and 0 0600 94 2478 i according to the estimated poles the corresponding frequencies are 9 hz 9 5 hz 10 hz 12 hz and 15 hz respectively similarly the residues can be estimated 12 γ 0 1000 0 1732 i 0 0000 0 0000 i 0 0000 0 0000 i 0 1469 0 2023 i 0 1299 0 0750 i 0 1732 0 1000 i 0 0000 0 0000 i 0 2250 0 3897 i 0 4243 0 4243 i 0 0000 0 0000 i applying the same frequency windows of f l 9 hz and f u 11 hz the isolated poles are λ n 0 0200 56 5487 i 0 0150 59 6903 i and 0 0200 62 8319 i the first three rows of eq 12 are the isolated residues we can conclude that the true weak mode is λ w e a k 0 0200 62 8319 i i e f weak 10 hz and the corresponding residue of the two signals are γ w e a k 1 0 1299 0 0750 i γ w e a k 2 0 1732 0 1000 i furthermore based on eq 5 we can reconstruct the weak signal shown in fig 11 it can be seen that the reconstructed weak signal can precisely match the original weak signal for the purpose of simulating the real acquired signal a white noise is added to the two synthesized signals and we set the signal noise ratio equal to 40 db afterwards the era method ssi method and wmi method are applied to identify the weak mode for the three methods we all set the model order to be 10 and the results are shown in table 3 it can be easily concluded that wmi has the best performance compared to the other two methods in addition neither the era method nor the ssi method could be used to reconstruct the weak signal 4 results of the modal parameter identification in the current section the modal parameters of monopile and wind turbine in different states are introduced for modal parameter identification the data segments under both artificial excitation and random wave excitation are selected for the data segment acquired under artificial excitation the era method is used to obtain the modal parameters for the data segment acquired under random wave excitation the ssi method is used to obtain the modal parameters considering the high level noise in offshore environment wmi is applied to both of these two kinds of data segments to avoid true weak mode being eliminated as noise as discussed above when wmi is applied a frequency window must be set in advance in this paper we use the time frequency analysis as a reference 4 1 modal parameter identification of monopile to choose an appropriate data segment for modal analysis of the monopile fig 12 a time frequency plot of the x direction acceleration signal of a1 sensor node is made from fig 13 three artificial excitation i e berthing excitation signals can be clearly distinguished 6 5 12 s 26 33 s and 106 3 113 s are relatively stable and the second time interval has the largest energy thus we chose the 26 33 s data segment for the modal analysis additionally the data segment of 19 24 s under random wave excitation is also selected for the modal analysis fig 14 and fig 15 are the two selected data segments in the time and frequency domains respectively by picking up peaks in the frequency domain the possible modal frequencies under artificial excitation are 2 444 hz and 5 621 hz and the possible modal frequencies under random wave excitation is 2 686 hz for the purpose of acquiring modal information of monopile the three modal identification theories mentioned above were used for the vibration signal under an artificial excitation we applied the era method to identify the modal parameters of monopile while for the vibration signal acquired under random wave excitation we applied the ssi method to identify the modal parameter we simultaneously applied the wmi method to the modal identification using the vibration signal both under artificial excitation and random wave excitation the modal parameters identified by the three methods are listed as are the mode shapes identified by the three methods the same modal identification process is reused in the modal parameter identification of the wind turbine in normal operational state and parked state table 4 displays the modal parameters obtained by different theory fig 16 fig 17 and fig 18 show the identified mode shapes using vibration signal under artificial excitation the first two order parameters of monopile can be identified by the era and wmi the first two order modal parameters identified by era method are 2 4140 hz and 5 6219 with their corresponding damping ratio of 0 0405 and 0 0137 the first two order modal parameters identified by wmi are 2 4131 hz and 5 6778 hz with their corresponding damping ratio of 0 0333 and 0 0090 however using the vibration signal under random wave excitation ssi failed to identify the modal parameters of monopile wmi which showed a better performance identified the first order modal parameters which are 2 5491 hz with its corresponding damping ratio of 0 0589 taking into account the fact that neither the ssi nor wmi methods could identify the second order mode we may conclude that random wave cannot excite the second order mode of monopile the modal identification results suggest that for modal identification of monopile it is best to use the era and wmi methods additionally artificial excitation is of vital importance 4 2 modal parameter identification of owt in parked state the tested owt in parked state is shown in fig 19 through the time frequency analysis fig 20 we can choose the 1283 1290 s time interval which is under the artificial excitation for the modal analysis meanwhile we also chose a time interval under the random wave excitation for modal analysis based on ssi which is the 1640 1660 s time interval fig 21 and fig 22 are the two selected data segments in the time and frequency domains picking up the peaks in frequency domain a possible modal frequency under artificial excitation is 1 709 hz frequencies at 1 587 hz and 1 831 hz might be the possible modal frequency under random wave excitation from the spectrum plot shown in figs 21 and 22 the peaks in the frequency domain are obvious regardless of whether they are under artificial excitation or random excitation which means there is a great possibility that we can obtain the modal parameters based on ssi table 5 shows the modal parameters of wind turbine under artificial excitation and random wave excitation fig 23 fig 24 fig 25 and fig 26 show the mode shapes identified by the three methods the results show that the era method can identify the first three order modal parameters using vibration signal under artificial excitation ssi failed to identify the third order modal parameter using the vibration signal under random wave excitation and the wmi method can identify the first three order modal parameters using the vibration signal regardless of whether it is under artificial excitation or random wave excitation wmi method shows a better performance than ssi in the identification of higher order modal parameters for the case of artificial excitation the first three modal parameters identified by era are 0 2972 hz 1 7863 hz and 3 8518 hz the corresponding damping ratio are 0 0291 0 0080 and 0 0205 the first three modal parameters identified by wmi are 0 2969 hz 1 7861 hz and 3 8537 hz with their corresponding damping ratio of 0 0284 0 0083 and 0 0278 for the case of random wave excitation the first two order modal parameters identified by ssi are 0 3147 hz and 1 7948 hz with the corresponding damping ratio of 0 0564 and 0 0388 the first three order modal parameters identified by wmi are 0 3040 hz 1 9009 hz and 3 9809 hz and the corresponding damping ratio are 0 0369 0 0386 and 0 0209 4 3 modal parameter identification of owt in operational state the tested owt in operation state is shown in fig 27 as mentioned above we use a time frequency analysis plot fig 28 to select the representative time interval we chose the 454 468 s time interval which is under artificial excitation and the 1100 1120 s time interval which is under the random wave excitation fig 29 and fig 30 are the two selected data segments in the time and frequency domains peaks in frequency domain indicate that frequencies at 0 2441 hz and 1 831 hz are the possible modal frequencies under artificial excitation and frequencies at 0 3052 hz and 1 831 hz are the possible modal frequencies under random wave excitation table 6 displays the results of the modal parameter identification of running wind turbine under different external excitations fig 31 fig 32 fig 33 and fig 34 show the identified mode shapes from table 6 we can see that the performance of the three modal identification theory is similar to what we have obtained in the modal identification of parked wind turbine using data segment under artificial excitation the era and wmi successfully identified the first three modal parameters using data segment under random wave excitation ssi failed to identify the third order modal parameter while wmi identified all of the first three modal parameters the result is similar to the modal identification case of wind turbine under parked state for the case of artificial excitation the first three order modal parameters identified by era are 0 3097 hz 1 7762 hz and 3 9910 hz with their corresponding damping ratio of 0 0269 0 0661 and 0 0277 the first three order modal parameters identified by wmi are 0 2966 hz 1 8348 hz and 3 9205 hz the corresponding damping ratio are 0 0367 0 0354 and 0 0289 for the case of random wave excitation the first two order modal parameters identified by ssi are 0 3118 hz and 1 7553 hz the corresponding damping ratio are 0 0043 and 0 0243 the first three order modal parameters identified by wmi are 0 3087 hz 1 7250 hz and 4 0607 hz with their corresponding damping ratio are 0 0129 0 0356 and 0 0295 4 4 effect of external excitation and operation state on modal parameter identification of owt from table 5 the damping ratio of the parked owt identified by wmi has large difference under different external excitation for the damping ratio result identified under random wave excitation is larger than that identified under artificial excitation this phenomenon is caused by different snr of the two different vibration signal with artificial excitation the snr is higher which means the true modal signals of the tower occupied the most energy and that will be beneficial for calculating the damping ratio of owt however when the external excitation is only the random wave the true mode signals can be overwhelmed by noise which resulted in a bad snr furthermore this will lead to errors in the calculation of damping ratio it is well known knowledge that the dynamic characteristics of owts especially damping ratios are greatly affected by the environment waves winds and etc because the external environment of the monitored owt in these two different time periods was different the large difference between the damping ratio results under different excitation just validated the interference of environment on modal parameter identification of owt in sea test comparing tables 5 and 6 the influence of external excitation on 1st order damping ratio is different table 5 shows that the damping ratio under random wave excitation are larger than that under artificial excitation while table 6 shows a contrary phenomenon one reason for this phenomenon is that these two sea tests were conducted at different time the external noise of the two sea tests is different what s more important is that the operation state of the monitored owt during these two sea tests is different what should be emphasized is that the vibration of the tower especially the low order modes can be excited by the rotating blades which means the identified modal parameters will be polluted by the vibration of rotating blades when there is artificial excitation the excited modes were purer the identified modal parameters are less affected by the rotating blades from tables 5 and 6 one can conclude that the effect of external interference on modal identification is uncertain which implies modal parameters identified under ambient excitation have large errors compared with that under artificial excitation this phenomenon also validates the necessity of artificial excitation when acquiring modal parameters of owt through a sea test 5 conclusion in this paper a series of field monitoring campaigns of an actual owt from its construction state to its normal operational state were introduced the vibration signals of monopile and wind turbine in parked state and normal operational state were acquired by a group of wireless sensor nodes developed by ouc the results show that these wireless sensor nodes can effectively collect vibration signals and reduce the load of the engineering maintenance staff and difficulty in the sensor installation with no need for power lines or communication cables to generate enough vibration for the modal analysis an artificial method of generating the vibration was proposed which was proven to be very effective subsequently modal identification was achieved by the era ssi and wmi methods among which the wmi method was the first time used to analyse the modal parameters of an actual owt using the vibration response under artificial excitation the era method and wmi method can successfully identify the first three order modal parameters of wind turbine in parked or operational state and these two methods can identify the first two order modal parameters of monopile using vibration signal under random wave excitation the ssi method failed to identify the third order modal parameters of wind turbine under parked or operational state while the wmi method identified all the first three order modal parameters besides ssi method cannot identify the modal parameters of the monopole but wmi method can identify the first order modal parameters the results of the modal identification indicated that wmi method shows a better performance than the ssi method when there is only random wave excitation for the purpose of obtaining the modal information of a wind turbine and its monopile era method and wmi method can both be selected however if the modal parameters of monopile are required era method is the best choice it should be noted that artificial excitation is necessary in the utilization of era method besides external excitation and operation state have effect on the modal parameter identification of owt modal parameters identified under ambient excitation have large errors compared with that under artificial excitation artificial excitation is necessary when acquiring modal parameters of owt in a sea test through these campaigns we successfully identified the modal parameters of wind turbine under different working states and the modal parameters of its monopile the results of these campaigns will be beneficial for both design verification and arranging maintenance schedule in the future a long term online monitoring system will be developed in order to monitor the structural health of owts in real time and to detect potential operation failure in a timely manner based on an online monitoring system it will be easier to establish an intelligent wind farm in this way the huge economic losses caused by downtime will be avoided acknowledgements the study presented in this paper was

22483,wind energy plays an important role in the field of renewable energy due to its lower cost and the maturity of its manufacturing technology during the last few years there has been an increase in offshore wind turbine owt projects especially in china considering the fact that ocean environment where these offshore wind turbines operate usually has a negative impact on their structural health the demand for investigating the dynamic characteristics of offshore wind turbines based on sea test is increasing however current studies are mainly focused on method development theoretical analysis and numerical simulation and few attention has been given to the study of the dynamic characteristics of an actual owt in different operational states based on sea test to improve the current studies in september 2016 november 2016 and april 2017 a series of monitoring campaigns of an actual in service owt and its monopile were conducted at an offshore wind farm in the sea area near jiangsu province china for the purpose of acquiring high quality vibration signal one type of artificial excitation was adopted to excite the owt vibration in these monitoring campaigns with the help of a group of wireless health monitoring sensor nodes developed by ocean university of china ouc we successfully acquired the vibration signal of the wind turbine in parked state and normal operational state and acquired the vibration signal of the monopile in construction which means no tower was installed afterwards two modal analysis methods the eigensystem realization algorithm era and stochastic subspace identification ssi were used to obtain the modal parameters of the tested structure using the vibration signal under artificial excitation and random wave excitation respectively the results show that the era method can successfully identify the first two order modal parameters of the monopile and the first three order modal parameters of the wind turbine in parked or operational state however the ssi method failed to identify the third order modal parameters of the wind turbine regardless of whether it is in parked state or operational state only the first two order modal parameters can be identified meanwhile ssi failed to identify the modal parameters of the monopile concerning the high level environmental noise in an offshore site we applied weak mode identification wmi for the first time to obtain the modal parameters of owt using vibration signal under both artificial excitation and random wave excitation the results indicated that wmi has achieved the same good performance as the era when the vibration signal under artificial excitation is used when the vibration signal under random wave is used wmi successfully identified the first order modal parameters of the monopile and the first three order modal parameters of the wind turbine in parked or operational state which indicated a better ability than that of the ssi method we can conclude that the modal parameters of the wind turbine can be obtained by the wmi method and era method and the era method is the best way to obtain the modal parameters of monopile under artificial excitation these monitoring campaign of an actual owt not only provide modal information support for structural maintenance and operation safety assessment but also provide a real data

turbines owts are receiving an increasing amount of attention and the installed capacity of wind turbines continues to increase due to its renewability and the maturity of its manufacturing technology additionally wind energy can not only optimize the current energy structure but also produces no pollution and has little impact on the ecological environment especially owt has been the focus in the utilization of wind energy for the higher wind speed and lower turbulence compared to land amirinia et al 2017a amirinia et al 2017b bilgili et al 2011 benallouch et al 2018 m taylor et al 2015 for the purpose of enlarging the efficiency of energy capture the size of modern owts has increased dramatically yang and sun 2013 consequently improving the profitability reliability and sustainability of owts has become a goal that has attracted attention from the owners of these offshore wind turbines martinez luengo et al 2016 structural health monitoring shm can improve the reliability of owts and provides guidance for reasonably arranging the maintenance schedule which can reduce the operation failure the vibration data acquirement under different conditions is the key point in understanding the structural health of owts with the improvement of the shm system and powerful algorithms for modal identification researchers have more opportunities to accurately understand the modal parameters of owts 1 1 monitoring systems for shm wireless sensor networks wsn are widely used in shm with the intensive study of wireless sensors wsn has tended to replace wired monitoring systems recent research on wsn mainly focuses on two aspects one is its networking mode and improving the quality of the network the other one is the signal processing capability of the sensor nodes in the network in the study of the network working mode liu zhiqiang liu zhiqiang et al 2017 proposed a wsn system for bridge structural health monitoring as well as a lower energy cost time synchronization algorithm lp tpsn which can meet the time accuracy requirements of the system ma ma xiaxia 2012 designed a monitoring system based on the zigbee wireless sensor networks and gprs technology for owts and a monitoring platform software was also developed based on labview developed by national instruments usa liu zenghua liu zenghua et al 2017 proposed a kind of wireless monitoring system for a bracket structure based on zigbee and gprs technology which has successfully achieved remote monitoring sabato sabato et al 2016 proposed a novel wireless mems accelerometer board embedding a v f converter that can convert the input signal into a frequency modulated signal proportional to its voltage allowing for a more stable signal transmission and a high resistance to electromagnetic noise in the study of the signal processing capability of sensor nodes bengherbia bengherbia et al 2017 introduced a set of wireless vibration signal acquisition equipment based on fpga for vibration monitoring and fault diagnosis as described by the author the ability of signal processing and data encryption were achieved by ip core and the system reaches a synchronization error of 60 ns which is far less than 10 μ s with no compromise of the accuracy of the structural analysis krishnamurthy et al 2008 herrasti herrasti et al 2016 developed a kind of wireless autonomous sensor node for the shm of wind turbines that is cheaper and easier to deploy with no requirement for power lines or communication cables and the sensor nodes proposed by the author have a signal conditioning circuit enabling the conditioning of accelerometers and strain gages so the universality of the system is greatly enhanced a high quality monitoring system is essential for shm and the current research has made great progress on the networking and node intelligence of monitoring systems for the shm of owts the monitoring system is required to be portable and to possess a high signal acquisition accuracy and a high time synchronization accuracy which is very important for the modal analysis during this monitoring campaign we applied a new type of wireless health monitoring system developed by ouc to acquire the vibration signal of the structure this monitoring system has 24 bits adc and a high time synchronization quality which guarantees the modal identification of the monitored structure detailed information of the monitoring systems will be introduced in section 2 1 2 modal identification theory once the vibration data is obtained the modal analysis can be conducted which is the most important step in diagnosing the damage or predicting the possible operation failures in the future in the modal analysis of civil structures era method is the most popular algorithm zhang et al 2014 era is a modal parameter identification method based on the impulse excitation response which was developed by juang and pappa based on the ho kalman system implementation algorithm and the theory of dynamic system in cybernetics since this algorithm was proposed various improvements and related research have been on going guowen zhang zhang et al 2014 proposed a modal similarity index to estimate the reliability of the modes identified by the era in which the energy contribution of each mode can be confirmed by the use of the mode energy level thus allowing the dominant mode is known in li et al 2011 the author discussed the noise issues when the era is applied in qu et al 2018 the author presented a modal response contribution index which can be used in distinguishing spurious modes in the use of era and the method was verified through both a numerical example and a practical bridge in addition to era method ssi method is a modal parameter identification method based on random excitation that was proposed by peeters b and roeck g in 1995 ssi has also been widely used in the field of modal identification the research and development of the ssi method has been on going guowen zhang zhang et al 2012 proposed an improved ssi for operational modal analysis to solve the low computational efficiency problem for dynamic systems with hysteretic damping an output only identification method was presented by anela bajrić and høgsberg 2018 on the basis of ssi in addition to the study of modal identification theory many other researchers also study the responses of owts under different sea states agarwal and manuel 2009 amirinia and jung 2017 jung et al 2015 kim and manuel 2013 2014 kim et al 2016 and the interaction between the vibration of tower and the vibration of blades has also been investigated gong and chen 2015 during this monitoring campaign we acquired the vibration signal of the structures under artificial excitation and random waves i e environmental excitation and the modal parameters are identified using the vibration data from the two kinds of excitation era is applied in artificial excitation condition and ssi is applied in random wave excitation condition however all field test data will inevitably contain noise and the identified modal parameters will inevitably contain errors as well li et al 2012 liu et al 2019 liu liu et al 2016 took the environmental noise issue in offshore sites into account and noted that this environmental noise would overwhelm the excited true mode once the singular value decomposition svd technique is used so there is a great possibility these true modes will be eliminated to avoid eliminating the true mode as noise we also apply wmi to identify the modal parameters of the structure the wmi method was verified by both numerical experiments and modal identification of two real offshore platforms liu et al 2016 this will be the first time the wmi is used to identify the modal parameters of an owt it is not difficult to conclude that the current studies are mainly focused on the simulation and mathematical proof of the new method even though excellent results have been achieved in the development of modal analysis theories such as the era and ssi few field tests have been conducted to identify the modal parameters of an actual owt otherwise the designers of owts have few opportunities to verify the errors between the actual modal parameters and the design modal parameters of owts the field monitoring campaign presented in this paper has selected an owt as the research object and investigates its dynamic characteristics during its construction and normal operation during the construction of the owt the research object is simply a monopile without a wind turbine tower being installed after the wind turbine tower was installed we acquired the vibration signal of the wind turbine both in the operational state and parked state subsequently we applied three kinds of modal analysis methods the era ssi and wmi methods to obtain modal parameters of the monitored structures this paper is divided into five parts the entire monitoring campaign will be introduced in section 2 including the location and characteristics of the measured wind turbine additionally the condition in which the monitored wind turbine was working the artificial method of generating excitation to make the monitored structures vibrate and the wireless monitoring system are all presented in this section in section 3 modal parameter identification theory including the era ssi and wmi is introduced a numerical verification of the wmi is presented in section 3 and the results of the modal parameter identification are shown in section 4 finally the conclusions from this field monitoring campaign are summarized in section 5 2 monitoring campaign of offshore wind turbine 2 1 monitored objects and working conditions these monitoring campaigns were conducted in september 2016 november 2016 and april 2017 the offshore wind farm shown in fig 1 is located in the yellow sea of china close to rudong county in jiangsu province fig 2 displays the monitored structures including the entire wind turbine and its monopile without the turbine tower being installed in september 2016 monopile was monitored in november 2016 after the wind turbine tower was installed the entire wind turbine in parked state was monitored in april 2017 the same wind turbine in operational state was monitored we essentially conducted a series of monitoring campaigns for an actual owt from its construction state to its normal operational state the monopile has a total length of 73 m and is 5 5 m in diameter of which 50 35 m are buried below the seabed and 22 65 m are from the seabed to the top of the monopile after completion of the construction of owt it has an installed capacity of 4 mw the total height of tower is 86 m and the length of blade is 88 m the monitored monopile was in the process of constructing without the tower being installed and the entire wind turbine was monitored in two working conditions the parked state and the normal operational state to obtain accurate modal analysis results artificial excitation was applied to the monitored structures which helped generate sufficient vibration 2 2 wireless structural health monitoring system in general structural health monitoring systems can be divided into two types the wired monitoring system and the wireless monitoring system during actual use the former system is to blame for its high cost and difficulties in installation and maintenance during these monitoring campaigns a set of wireless structural health monitoring systems developed by ouc was chosen to acquire the vibration signal of the monitored structure the system consists of several sensor nodes that are based on an fpga chip and powered by a lithium battery which can guarantee at least 48 h of power supply a laptop plays the role of the host computer and the sensor nodes are used as slave computers the connection between the host computer and a slave computer is achieved by the zigbee network and instruction information and status information are transmitted through the zigbee network the gps modules are integrated into the sensor nodes to achieve time synchronization among the different nodes the vibration signal is acquired through the three axis acceleration sensor and converted to a digital signal by a 24 bits 4 channel simultaneous sampling sigma delta adc after analogue to digital converting the digital signal will be stored in an sd card plugged in the sensor nodes taking the convenience of obtaining the vibration data into account a wi fi module has been added to the node so the acceleration data can be obtained by wi fi or directly by reading the sd card if necessary the working process of the wireless vibration acquisition equipment is shown in fig 3 these wireless sensor nodes have no power lines or communication cables so the difficulty of installation is smaller than that in traditional equipment with cables during the monitoring campaign all these sensor nodes are working at a 500 hz sampling rate 2 3 an artificial method to excite wind turbine vibration and the sensor node arrangement 2 3 1 an artificial method to excite wind turbine vibration taking into account the fact that the vibration generated by ocean waves is weak and almost completely overwhelmed by noise it is difficult for modal identification using a vibration signal under random wave excitation to deal with this problem a novel method was invented to make the wind turbine vibrate and it has been proven to be effective just like fig 4 shows an engineering ship is used as the excitation when the vibration signal acquiring equipment is installed well and has already entered the state of data acquisition the engineering ship will gently lean against the turbine the impact is so light that it will not cause any damage to the structure of the turbine but it will generate enough vibration for a better modal analysis result through this method the vibration signals of the monopile and wind turbine both in the parked state and operational state were generated 2 3 2 sensor nodes arrangement fig 5 shows the arrangement of wireless structural health monitoring equipment on the wind turbine tower five sensor nodes were used to record the vibration signal of the monitored structure on the top point is a5 sensor node and a1 sensor node is located at the junction of the tower and foundation the remainder of the five wireless sensor nodes are evenly arranged on the tower between a1 test point and a5 test point regarding the monopile these five sensor nodes are arranged at a distance of 2 m contrary to the wind turbine occasion on the top point is a1 sensor node while on the lowest point is a5 sensor node the other sensor nodes are evenly arranged between a1 sensor node and a5 sensor node fig 6 shows the sensor nodes arrangement on the monopile 2 4 structural vibration signal under different excitations the vibration signal acquired from the offshore structure is often overwhelmed by high level environment noise which introduces extra difficulty for the modal analysis fig 7 and fig 8 show different vibration signals acquired from wind turbine fig 7 shows a signal segment acquired under a random wave excitation and fig 8 shows a signal segment acquired under artificial excitation a fast fourier transform fft is performed upon each signal segment to further understand the signal characteristics in the frequency domain it can be easily concluded from fig 7 a and fig 8 a that the vibration signal under random wave excitation is much weaker than that under artificial excitation in the frequency domain just like fig 7 b and fig 8 b show there are more noise components in the vibration signal under random wave excitation which may turn out to be a case where the true weak mode may be eliminated as noise liu et al 2016 3 methodology 3 1 modal analysis method to interpret the massive vibration signals the modal parameters of the monitored structure were identified by three modal analysis methods namely era ssi and wmi for the vibration signal acquired under artificial excitation we applied the era method to identify the modal parameters of the structure and for the vibration signal acquired under random wave excitation ssi was applied to identify the modal parameters of the structure considering the high level noise in an offshore environment the true weak mode may be overwhelmed by ambient noise so wmi was applied to solve the problem where that true weak mode is buried in noise in the current section we mainly discuss the mathematical theory of these three modal analysis methods era and ssi are two typical mode identification methods which were developed for two different working conditions of the structures when there is an impulse excitation on the structure and the vibration response of the structure shows attenuation characteristics era is then adopted era is based on an impulse excitation response which was developed by juang and pappa based on the ho kalman system implementation algorithm and dynamic system theory of cybernetics according to the era theory one can form the generalized hankel matrix via markov parameters as shown in eq 1 1 h t k 1 h k h k 1 h k s h k 1 h k 2 h k s 1 h k r h k r 1 h k r s next working with the era formula and singular value decomposition the minimum realization of the system can be obtained and the structural modal parameters of the structure can be obtained by further calculation however one thing should be emphasized in a natural environment very few impulse excitations are applied to the structure which means artificial excitation is required when the era method is used unlike the era method the ssi method makes no request for impulse excitation which means the ssi method can be used to obtain the modal parameters of a structure when there is only ambient excitation according to ssi theory the hankel matrix is formed as shown in eq 2 2 y 0 2 i 1 1 j y 0 y 1 y 2 y j 1 y 1 y 2 y 3 y j y i 1 y i y i 1 y i j 2 y i y i 1 y i 2 y i j 1 y i 1 y i 2 y i 3 y i j y 2 i 1 y 2 i y 2 i 1 y 2 i j 2 y 0 i 1 y i 2 i 1 y p y f within the above formula y p and y f represent the past row space and future row space respectively once the projection of the future row space y f to the past row space y p is obtained the system matrix can be obtained as can the modal parameters dong et al 2018 the wmi method has been verified to be efficient in identifying the modal parameters of offshore platforms taking the ambient similarity between an offshore platform and an owt into account we adopted this method to investigate the dynamic characteristics of owts for the first time successfully obtaining modal parameters the basic idea of wmi is introduced as follows in regard to describing a system a system differential equation is usually the first thought that comes to mind for a low order system describing issue a system differential equation is the best choice and has been widely verified to be very efficient however the solution for a high order system is rather complicated to avoid this problem the transfer function is introduced to describe a high order system and its system poles and zeroes will be sufficient to determine the system response according to wmi theory the unforced response y t of a single input single output siso system can be written as 3 y t n 1 n m γ n e λ n t in eq 3 the constants γ n i e the residues are associated with the initial conditions and n m represents how many components that y t can be decomposed into solving the characteristic equation shown in eq 4 the roots will be λ n namely the system poles 4 d s s n a n 1 s n 1 a n 2 s n 2 a 0 in practice the response signal y t is sampled at a certain sampling frequency thus eq 3 has a discrete expression 5 y k y t k n 1 n m γ n e λ n k δ t among which t k is the discrete time series t k k δ t k 0 1 2 n 1 based on the discrete sampling points one can obtain a hankel matrix h k that has ξ rows and η columns according to the properties of the hankel matrix we know that ξ η n 1 6 h k y k y k 1 y k η 1 y k 1 y k 2 y k η y k ξ 1 y k ξ y k ξ η 2 with the help of a singular value decomposition and eigenvalue decomposition the estimated poles λ n can be obtained then the residues γ n can be calculated by eq 5 to separate the weak modes a frequency window f l f u that contains the unknown weak mode f t is required once the frequency window is determined the poles window λ l λ u and residue window γ l γ u can be determined according to eq 5 we can reconstruct the weak mode once its pole and residue are confirmed the proposed method normally requires a high model order but this will create unexpected fake modes according to the pole window and residue window the isolated poles and residues are as follows 7 λ w n w λ 1 λ 2 λ n o i λ 1 λ 2 λ n t 8 γ w n w γ 1 γ 2 γ n o i γ 1 γ 2 γ n t in the above formulas the fake modes are noted by a superscript and n o i represents the amount of fake modes and n t represents the amount of true modes additionally n w n o i n t should be emphasized substituting eq 7 and eq 8 into eq 5 we can reconstruct a signal that includes the weak modes and fake i e noisy modes 9 y k w y n o i y n t eq 9 indicates that we can obtain the weak modes buried in noise in practical engineering we often use time frequency analysis liu et al 2015 as reference to set an approximate estimate of the frequency window f w the above shows how to use wmi to obtain a weak mode using a single response signal however in the mode identification of an owt multiple sensors are deployed to collect the response of the structure in this way a mode shape plot can be obtained and the accuracy of the identified modal parameters can also be improved to deal with multiple response signals issue the above theory is generalized and the sampled data y k can be represented by a vector y k 10 y k y k 1 y k 2 y k m y k s substituting eq 10 into eq 6 and repeating the process described above the weak mode can be identified with multiple response signals 3 2 numerical verification of wmi in the actual monitoring campaign the modal information of the structure is usually identified by the signals from multiple observation points the following numerical example is used to introduce the method of identifying the mode information from multiple signals using wmi the simulated signal is synthesized by eq 11 11 y k n 1 3 b n e ξ n t k sin 2 π f n t k θ n in the example two synthesized signals are simulated as two different monitored signals from different test points the two signals share the same pole but have different noises table 1 shows the three components of signal 1 among the three components above the true weak mode is at 10 hz two noise modes are at 9 hz and 15 hz the synthesized signal is plotted in fig 9 a fig 9 b shows the synthesized signal in frequency domain using fft from fig 9 b it can be seen that the true mode is the weakest table 2 shows the three components of signal 2 the true mode is at 10 hz and the two noise components are at 9 5 hz and 12 hz the two signals share the same pole at 10 hz but different amplitudes for the purpose of simulating the actual monitoring environment the noise components of the two synthesized signals are different from one another because different test points may suffer from different noise environments fig 10 is the synthesized signal both in time and frequency domain for both of the two synthesized signal we set a sampling rate of 50 hz and the total sampled data points n 50 which means a total time duration of 1s substituting the sampled data into eq 10 then we can obtain eq 6 setting the model order to be 10 and with the help of singular value decomposition and eigenvalue decomposition and the estimated poles λ n can be obtained λ n 0 0200 56 5487 i 0 0150 59 6903 i 0 0200 62 8319 i 0 0100 75 3982 i and 0 0600 94 2478 i according to the estimated poles the corresponding frequencies are 9 hz 9 5 hz 10 hz 12 hz and 15 hz respectively similarly the residues can be estimated 12 γ 0 1000 0 1732 i 0 0000 0 0000 i 0 0000 0 0000 i 0 1469 0 2023 i 0 1299 0 0750 i 0 1732 0 1000 i 0 0000 0 0000 i 0 2250 0 3897 i 0 4243 0 4243 i 0 0000 0 0000 i applying the same frequency windows of f l 9 hz and f u 11 hz the isolated poles are λ n 0 0200 56 5487 i 0 0150 59 6903 i and 0 0200 62 8319 i the first three rows of eq 12 are the isolated residues we can conclude that the true weak mode is λ w e a k 0 0200 62 8319 i i e f weak 10 hz and the corresponding residue of the two signals are γ w e a k 1 0 1299 0 0750 i γ w e a k 2 0 1732 0 1000 i furthermore based on eq 5 we can reconstruct the weak signal shown in fig 11 it can be seen that the reconstructed weak signal can precisely match the original weak signal for the purpose of simulating the real acquired signal a white noise is added to the two synthesized signals and we set the signal noise ratio equal to 40 db afterwards the era method ssi method and wmi method are applied to identify the weak mode for the three methods we all set the model order to be 10 and the results are shown in table 3 it can be easily concluded that wmi has the best performance compared to the other two methods in addition neither the era method nor the ssi method could be used to reconstruct the weak signal 4 results of the modal parameter identification in the current section the modal parameters of monopile and wind turbine in different states are introduced for modal parameter identification the data segments under both artificial excitation and random wave excitation are selected for the data segment acquired under artificial excitation the era method is used to obtain the modal parameters for the data segment acquired under random wave excitation the ssi method is used to obtain the modal parameters considering the high level noise in offshore environment wmi is applied to both of these two kinds of data segments to avoid true weak mode being eliminated as noise as discussed above when wmi is applied a frequency window must be set in advance in this paper we use the time frequency analysis as a reference 4 1 modal parameter identification of monopile to choose an appropriate data segment for modal analysis of the monopile fig 12 a time frequency plot of the x direction acceleration signal of a1 sensor node is made from fig 13 three artificial excitation i e berthing excitation signals can be clearly distinguished 6 5 12 s 26 33 s and 106 3 113 s are relatively stable and the second time interval has the largest energy thus we chose the 26 33 s data segment for the modal analysis additionally the data segment of 19 24 s under random wave excitation is also selected for the modal analysis fig 14 and fig 15 are the two selected data segments in the time and frequency domains respectively by picking up peaks in the frequency domain the possible modal frequencies under artificial excitation are 2 444 hz and 5 621 hz and the possible modal frequencies under random wave excitation is 2 686 hz for the purpose of acquiring modal information of monopile the three modal identification theories mentioned above were used for the vibration signal under an artificial excitation we applied the era method to identify the modal parameters of monopile while for the vibration signal acquired under random wave excitation we applied the ssi method to identify the modal parameter we simultaneously applied the wmi method to the modal identification using the vibration signal both under artificial excitation and random wave excitation the modal parameters identified by the three methods are listed as are the mode shapes identified by the three methods the same modal identification process is reused in the modal parameter identification of the wind turbine in normal operational state and parked state table 4 displays the modal parameters obtained by different theory fig 16 fig 17 and fig 18 show the identified mode shapes using vibration signal under artificial excitation the first two order parameters of monopile can be identified by the era and wmi the first two order modal parameters identified by era method are 2 4140 hz and 5 6219 with their corresponding damping ratio of 0 0405 and 0 0137 the first two order modal parameters identified by wmi are 2 4131 hz and 5 6778 hz with their corresponding damping ratio of 0 0333 and 0 0090 however using the vibration signal under random wave excitation ssi failed to identify the modal parameters of monopile wmi which showed a better performance identified the first order modal parameters which are 2 5491 hz with its corresponding damping ratio of 0 0589 taking into account the fact that neither the ssi nor wmi methods could identify the second order mode we may conclude that random wave cannot excite the second order mode of monopile the modal identification results suggest that for modal identification of monopile it is best to use the era and wmi methods additionally artificial excitation is of vital importance 4 2 modal parameter identification of owt in parked state the tested owt in parked state is shown in fig 19 through the time frequency analysis fig 20 we can choose the 1283 1290 s time interval which is under the artificial excitation for the modal analysis meanwhile we also chose a time interval under the random wave excitation for modal analysis based on ssi which is the 1640 1660 s time interval fig 21 and fig 22 are the two selected data segments in the time and frequency domains picking up the peaks in frequency domain a possible modal frequency under artificial excitation is 1 709 hz frequencies at 1 587 hz and 1 831 hz might be the possible modal frequency under random wave excitation from the spectrum plot shown in figs 21 and 22 the peaks in the frequency domain are obvious regardless of whether they are under artificial excitation or random excitation which means there is a great possibility that we can obtain the modal parameters based on ssi table 5 shows the modal parameters of wind turbine under artificial excitation and random wave excitation fig 23 fig 24 fig 25 and fig 26 show the mode shapes identified by the three methods the results show that the era method can identify the first three order modal parameters using vibration signal under artificial excitation ssi failed to identify the third order modal parameter using the vibration signal under random wave excitation and the wmi method can identify the first three order modal parameters using the vibration signal regardless of whether it is under artificial excitation or random wave excitation wmi method shows a better performance than ssi in the identification of higher order modal parameters for the case of artificial excitation the first three modal parameters identified by era are 0 2972 hz 1 7863 hz and 3 8518 hz the corresponding damping ratio are 0 0291 0 0080 and 0 0205 the first three modal parameters identified by wmi are 0 2969 hz 1 7861 hz and 3 8537 hz with their corresponding damping ratio of 0 0284 0 0083 and 0 0278 for the case of random wave excitation the first two order modal parameters identified by ssi are 0 3147 hz and 1 7948 hz with the corresponding damping ratio of 0 0564 and 0 0388 the first three order modal parameters identified by wmi are 0 3040 hz 1 9009 hz and 3 9809 hz and the corresponding damping ratio are 0 0369 0 0386 and 0 0209 4 3 modal parameter identification of owt in operational state the tested owt in operation state is shown in fig 27 as mentioned above we use a time frequency analysis plot fig 28 to select the representative time interval we chose the 454 468 s time interval which is under artificial excitation and the 1100 1120 s time interval which is under the random wave excitation fig 29 and fig 30 are the two selected data segments in the time and frequency domains peaks in frequency domain indicate that frequencies at 0 2441 hz and 1 831 hz are the possible modal frequencies under artificial excitation and frequencies at 0 3052 hz and 1 831 hz are the possible modal frequencies under random wave excitation table 6 displays the results of the modal parameter identification of running wind turbine under different external excitations fig 31 fig 32 fig 33 and fig 34 show the identified mode shapes from table 6 we can see that the performance of the three modal identification theory is similar to what we have obtained in the modal identification of parked wind turbine using data segment under artificial excitation the era and wmi successfully identified the first three modal parameters using data segment under random wave excitation ssi failed to identify the third order modal parameter while wmi identified all of the first three modal parameters the result is similar to the modal identification case of wind turbine under parked state for the case of artificial excitation the first three order modal parameters identified by era are 0 3097 hz 1 7762 hz and 3 9910 hz with their corresponding damping ratio of 0 0269 0 0661 and 0 0277 the first three order modal parameters identified by wmi are 0 2966 hz 1 8348 hz and 3 9205 hz the corresponding damping ratio are 0 0367 0 0354 and 0 0289 for the case of random wave excitation the first two order modal parameters identified by ssi are 0 3118 hz and 1 7553 hz the corresponding damping ratio are 0 0043 and 0 0243 the first three order modal parameters identified by wmi are 0 3087 hz 1 7250 hz and 4 0607 hz with their corresponding damping ratio are 0 0129 0 0356 and 0 0295 4 4 effect of external excitation and operation state on modal parameter identification of owt from table 5 the damping ratio of the parked owt identified by wmi has large difference under different external excitation for the damping ratio result identified under random wave excitation is larger than that identified under artificial excitation this phenomenon is caused by different snr of the two different vibration signal with artificial excitation the snr is higher which means the true modal signals of the tower occupied the most energy and that will be beneficial for calculating the damping ratio of owt however when the external excitation is only the random wave the true mode signals can be overwhelmed by noise which resulted in a bad snr furthermore this will lead to errors in the calculation of damping ratio it is well known knowledge that the dynamic characteristics of owts especially damping ratios are greatly affected by the environment waves winds and etc because the external environment of the monitored owt in these two different time periods was different the large difference between the damping ratio results under different excitation just validated the interference of environment on modal parameter identification of owt in sea test comparing tables 5 and 6 the influence of external excitation on 1st order damping ratio is different table 5 shows that the damping ratio under random wave excitation are larger than that under artificial excitation while table 6 shows a contrary phenomenon one reason for this phenomenon is that these two sea tests were conducted at different time the external noise of the two sea tests is different what s more important is that the operation state of the monitored owt during these two sea tests is different what should be emphasized is that the vibration of the tower especially the low order modes can be excited by the rotating blades which means the identified modal parameters will be polluted by the vibration of rotating blades when there is artificial excitation the excited modes were purer the identified modal parameters are less affected by the rotating blades from tables 5 and 6 one can conclude that the effect of external interference on modal identification is uncertain which implies modal parameters identified under ambient excitation have large errors compared with that under artificial excitation this phenomenon also validates the necessity of artificial excitation when acquiring modal parameters of owt through a sea test 5 conclusion in this paper a series of field monitoring campaigns of an actual owt from its construction state to its normal operational state were introduced the vibration signals of monopile and wind turbine in parked state and normal operational state were acquired by a group of wireless sensor nodes developed by ouc the results show that these wireless sensor nodes can effectively collect vibration signals and reduce the load of the engineering maintenance staff and difficulty in the sensor installation with no need for power lines or communication cables to generate enough vibration for the modal analysis an artificial method of generating the vibration was proposed which was proven to be very effective subsequently modal identification was achieved by the era ssi and wmi methods among which the wmi method was the first time used to analyse the modal parameters of an actual owt using the vibration response under artificial excitation the era method and wmi method can successfully identify the first three order modal parameters of wind turbine in parked or operational state and these two methods can identify the first two order modal parameters of monopile using vibration signal under random wave excitation the ssi method failed to identify the third order modal parameters of wind turbine under parked or operational state while the wmi method identified all the first three order modal parameters besides ssi method cannot identify the modal parameters of the monopole but wmi method can identify the first order modal parameters the results of the modal identification indicated that wmi method shows a better performance than the ssi method when there is only random wave excitation for the purpose of obtaining the modal information of a wind turbine and its monopile era method and wmi method can both be selected however if the modal parameters of monopile are required era method is the best choice it should be noted that artificial excitation is necessary in the utilization of era method besides external excitation and operation state have effect on the modal parameter identification of owt modal parameters identified under ambient excitation have large errors compared with that under artificial excitation artificial excitation is necessary when acquiring modal parameters of owt in a sea test through these campaigns we successfully identified the modal parameters of wind turbine under different working states and the modal parameters of its monopile the results of these campaigns will be beneficial for both design verification and arranging maintenance schedule in the future a long term online monitoring system will be developed in order to monitor the structural health of owts in real time and to detect potential operation failure in a timely manner based on an online monitoring system it will be easier to establish an intelligent wind farm in this way the huge economic losses caused by downtime will be avoided acknowledgements the study presented in this paper was

unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs have resulted in a wide range of applications in oceanography marine engineering geomorphology and physiognomy in most applications the uuv is navigating in unknown

shortest time consumption or minimum energy consumption etc and satisfy the constraints of various types such as avoiding obstacles maximum speed maximum acceleration maximum energy consumption and time consumption traditional obstacle avoidance planning methods include rapidly exploring random tree hernandez et al 2015 vector polar histogram method wang et al 2013 potential field solari et al

et al 2014 zhuang et al 2016 however traditional uuv obstacle avoidance planning methods have the following limitations i the detection sensor used in the underwater environment is usually forward looking sonar fls however fls is susceptible to environmental interference high levels of noise false alarms and missed alarm signals based on such sensor data traditional obstacle avoidance planning methods can only make low confidence decisions which may cause the uuv to adjust its motion frequently according to the online sensing information ii traditional obstacle avoidance algorithms are based on mathematical models accurate modeling to reflect small changes in the system is difficult especially for uncertain systems iii the complexity of the obstacle avoidance planning algorithm increases with the complexity of the environment traditional obstacle avoidance algorithms solve an optimization problem using a random search strategy over a large feasible solution space the computational cost of the algorithm is reflected in the time and space complexity however more complicated algorithms have a greater probability of error and may not guarantee convergence to the approximate global optimal solution therefore it is difficult to meet the timeliness requirements of online real time planning and the requirements for optimization goals iv traditional obstacle avoidance planning methods are usually designed for certain optimization goals when the environmental conditions or mission requirements change it is necessary to redesign the corresponding optimization goal model therefore traditional planning methods do not have sufficient portability interoperability or adaptability to improve the autonomy of the obstacle avoidance system some researchers have introduced reinforcement learning and improved the avoidance performance ye et al 2003 presented a neural fuzzy system with a mixed learning algorithm in which a supervised learning method is used to determine the input and output membership functions simultaneously and a reinforcement learning algorithm is employed to fine tune the output membership functions for obstacle avoidance huang et al 2005 integrated quantum q learning and a neural network for obstacle avoidance in an indoor mobile robot whereas jiao et al 2006 implemented q learning in a neural network and applied it to local path planning for an autonomous underwater vehicle vien et al 2007 used the ant q framework which extends aco with reinforcement learning to solve the problem of obstacle avoidance path planning for a mobile robot and qiao et al 2008 integrated reinforcement learning with a behavior based architecture for obstacle avoidance in a dynamic environment kurozumi et al 2010 presented a minimum vector field histogram method that modifies the user manipulation of an electric wheelchair to avoid obstacles in this method the modification rate is adjusted by reinforcement learning according to the environment and the user condition megherbi and malayia 2012 combined a potential field with reinforcement learning to solve the problem of multi agent based autonomous path planning in a dynamic time varying unstructured environment li et al 2013 proposed an obstacle avoidance algorithm for a robot based on a combination of the state action reward state action sarsa λ algorithm and supervised learning and demonstrated that the hybrid learning algorithm could significantly reduce the learning time for obstacle avoidance in unmanned surface vehicles zhang et al 2014 proposed a sarsa reinforcement learning algorithm composed of local avoidance and adaptive learning modules duguleana and mogan 2016 used q learning and a neural network planner to solve the problem of autonomous movement in four wheeled robots in unknown environments cheng and zhang 2017 proposed a deep reinforcement learning obstacle avoidance algorithm with the deep q network architecture for underactuated unmanned marine vessels under unknown environment dynamics fathinezhad et al 2016 proposed a method of supervised fuzzy sarsa learning for robot navigation in various environments with obstacles dabooni and wunsch 2016 presented a direct heuristic dynamic programming approach for online model learning in a markov decision process this shortens the computation time and improves stability when compared with other traditional reinforcement learning algorithms despite the considerable advances made in the abovementioned research it is difficult to design the reward functions and action strategy for reinforcement learning based obstacle avoidance planning methods additionally even the most reasonable rewards cannot avoid the problem of local minima in particular when uuvs navigate in narrow marine environments it is difficult to formulate an optimal collision avoidance strategy based on reinforcement learning from limited local environmental information recurrent neural networks rnns were first proposed as a network model for time series elman 1990 werbos 1988 rnns remember previous information and apply it to the calculation of the current output the input to the hidden layer of an rnn includes the output of the input layer and the output from the previous hidden layer therefore the internal state of this network can exhibit dynamic timing behavior for the problem of uuv obstacle avoidance planning uuv control commands must be generated according to temporal sensor information for uuvs environment information is detected by sonar which means that the input to the obstacle avoidance planning system is a temporal sonar detection data sequence however traditional rnns cannot extract environment features effectively and contain many network parameters to overcome these problems this paper proposes an rnn with convolution crnn in which a convolution connection replaces the full connection between adjacent layers of the rnn based on crnn a system of uuv autonomous obstacle avoidance planning is constructed offline training and testing is adopted to modify the neural network parameters of the uuv autonomous obstacle avoidance learning system so that self learning is applied to the collision avoidance planning combining this learning system with fls simulation data enables online autonomous obstacle avoidance planning in an unknown environment the ability of crnn based obstacle avoidance planning systems is validated through simulations for various static and unknown obstacle environments using a nonlinear uuv model the self learning and memory capabilities of the crnn mean that the adjustment range for uuv motion is small and consistent with the input time series which is beneficial to uuv motion control the proposed crnn has good generalization capabilities and fully trained crnn obstacle avoidance planning methods can be applied to a wider range of environmental conditions and mission requirements the convolutional connections allow the crnn to solve complex obstacle avoidance planning problems with fewer parameters 2 simulation model of uuv and fls 2 1 system model of uuv obstacle avoidance planning on the vertical plane is usually achieved through depth adjustment however depth adjustment strategies often require large pitch adjustments which affect the attitude control of the target vehicle considering the need to maintain a constant height when employing fls and to reduce energy consumption this study employs the strategy of horizontal plane obstacle avoidance regulation priority therefore a horizontal three degrees of freedom 3dof control model is defined for the uuv which means the dynamics of the vessel associated with heave roll and pitch motions are ignored the global and local coordinate systems are shown in fig 1 the 3dof control model of the uuv is described as follows fossen 2002 1 η r ψ v 2 m v c v v d v v τ where m m r b m a and c v c r b v c a v

r c 32 x u y v the motion of the uuv is controlled by two propellers distributed in the horizontal plane of the uuv τ is modeled as 8 τ u τ r 1 1 l l t n a t n b 2 2 simulation model of fls one of the most important sensors in a uuv is sonar which can detect obstacles and return the distance from the vehicle to the obstacle a two dimensional fls simulation model is established as shown in fig 2 in this model the maximum scan radius of the sonar is 120 m the open angle is 120 the number of beams is set to be 80 which means that the beam angle is 1 5 in the two dimensional sonar simulation model the beam is represented by rays and the arrows represent the current heading of the uuv as the index increases in a clockwise direction every ray is assigned an index from 0 to 79 the detection information of every beam is stored in a vector d t d t 0 d t 1 d t 79 if d t i 120 then we set d t i 120 to decrease the redundancy of information and reduce the complexity of the computations the input distance vector is defined as δ d t 120 d t 0 120 d t 1 120 d t 79 the detection frequency of the simulation sonar is set to be 9 h z 2 3 structure of the crnn the structure of the proposed crnn is shown in fig 3 the main difference between crnn and a standard rnn is how the adjacent layers are connected in standard rnn the nodes between any two adjacent layers are connected to each other in the crnn however only some of the nodes between two adjacent layers are connected in the form of a convolution the forward propagation of the crnn is as follows pad the edge of x t to give a t 1 for l

dimensional vector consisting of the 80 dimensional input distance vector δ d t obtained from the sonar and an input direction vector φ t the two dimensional output vector from the obstacle avoidance planning network at time step t consists of the yaw δψ t and the velocity v t of the uuv the dataset used to test the proposed method consists of 100772 training samples and 899 test samples in the offline training process training the labels used for supervised learning are obtained by traditional obstacle avoidance planning methods such as ant colony optimization genetic algorithm artificial potential field and fuzzy control method all labels in the training set are obtained by intelligent optimization algorithm in simple environments and there is no detection noise in the simulated sonar in these environments obstacles are composed of 30 randomly distributed rectangles and the average obstacle coverage rate is 4 62 and the start and target positions are generated at random the training data set is composed of the excellent results of the above intelligent optimization algorithms each sample in the dataset includes an input vector and a label 16b i n p u t t δ d t φ t 17b l a b e l t δ ψ t v t data normalization is a critical step in the use of neural networks there are two general methods to normalize the data min max normalization and z score normalization the input data used in this paper include many zero values and z score normalization would complicate these data thus min max normalization is applied for each column in i n p u t t the data are normalized according to 18b i n p u t i n p u t min max min 3 2 training to compare the obstacle avoidance planning performance of the crnn against that of a regular rnn and gated recurrent units grus all three models were trained with the same architecture i e input layer hidden layer middle layer and output layer the input layer consists of 81 neurons corresponding to the input vector the hidden layer consists of one of three network structures the middle layer contains 24 neurons and the output layer has two neurons corresponding to the yaw and velocity of the uuv dropout is used to deal with the problem of overfitting with the keep probability of neurons set to be 0 6 the time step is set to be 9 batch size is set to be 5000 and the maximum number of iterations is set to be 10000 the mean squared error mse loss function and the adam optimizer are used to evaluate model performance and optimize the parameters respectively and the weights are updated using backpropagation through time mini batch gradient descent with the objective of minimizing the loss function the results in table 1 and fig 4 indicate that the training time of the networks increases as the number of parameters rises when the number of parameters is similar the number of connections in crnn is much higher than in both rnn and gru and crnn always obtains the best mse with fewer parameters crnn1 obtains a smaller mse than rnn2 and is close to the performance of gru2 as shown in fig 4 the convergence speed of the networks decreased as the number of parameters increased in general crnn outperforms the rnn and gru models in terms of both mse and convergence 4 simulation experiments and results analysis in this section the performance of rnn obstacle avoidance planning networks is validated through a comparison with aco on a series of experiments as a statistical experiment three sets of maps were generated based on the coverage of obstacles with each set containing 100 random maps three test cases examine the generalization ability of the obstacle avoidance planning networks to verify the performance of the proposed crnn obstacle avoidance planner in the presence of noise 10 and 20 noise are then added to the fls signals to conduct noise jamming experiments in all test cases the initial velocity of the uuv is set to be 8 knots in order to facilitate the control uuv and save energy each obstacle avoidance planning algorithm mainly realizes obstacle avoidance planning in static environment by output stable speed and real time adjustment of yaw therefore each algorithm outputs a stable speed to guide uuv to navigate at a uniform speed since each algorithm can output a stable speed we pay more attention to experimental results that reflect the differences between algorithms such as time consumption path cost and sensitivity to noise 4 1 statistical experiment design information about the map sets and the performance of the obstacle avoidance planners are shown in table 2 this section compares the performance of aco with six deep learning based obstacle avoidance planners in terms of computation time planning success rate and path cost note that the coverage of obstacles in the training dataset is 4 62 less than any map in the statistical experiment in complex environments all obstacle avoidance planners except rnn1 obtained high success rates the experimental results show that the planners have sufficient generalization ability to solve obstacle avoidance problems in complex environments after being trained in simple environments this strong generalization ability makes it easy to collect sufficient training data in practical applications as shown in table 2 compared with the aco obstacle avoidance system the obstacle avoidance planners based on deep learning offer better performance in terms of both computation time and path cost the mean computation time of the four types of networks is basically proportional to the number of parameters and the coverage of the obstacles in any one network type more parameters lead to better performance in terms of path cost and planning success rate but a longer computation time the gru and crnn models outperform rnn in terms of path cost and planning success rate compared with gru2 crnn1 achieves competitive performance both in path cost and planning success rate it is worth noting that crnn1 requires less than one third the cpu time of gru2 4 2 typical simulation cases without noise jamming 4 2 1 test case 1 in test case 1 the start position is 524 33 and the target position at 340 1075 as shown in fig 5 all methods can plan safe and collision free paths from the start position to the target position in this test case the deep learning based obstacle avoidance planners have learned to adjust the uuv s heading to navigate toward the target position quickly after avoiding obstacles compared with aco the obstacle avoidance planner based on deep learning produces shorter and smoother paths the yaw control adjustments output by the different obstacle avoidance planners are shown in fig 6 a the uuv motion controller s propeller speed control feedback as shown in fig 6 b and c corresponds with the yaw control adjustment instructions output by the obstacle avoidance planner as shown in fig 6 the adjustment range obtained by the deep learning based obstacle avoidance planners is much smaller than that of aco both in yaw adjustment and propeller speed this improves the kinematics of the uuv and reduces the energy consumption of the actuators which increases their lifespan 4 2 2 test case 2 to test the obstacle avoidance planning networks a complex wharf map is considered in test case 2 the start and target positions are 262 37 and 320 1077 respectively the simulation results are shown in figs 7 and 8 in this case the performance of rnn2 gru1 2 and crnn1 2 is satisfactory but rnn1 fails to complete the obstacles avoidance task there is a lot of turbulence in the path planned by aco whereas the paths obtained by the deep learning obstacle avoidance planners are very smooth this is because of the strong memory and learning ability of deep learning methods which enhance the environmental awareness of the obstacle avoidance planning system 4 2 3 test case 3 in test case 3 a maze map tests the ability of obstacle avoidance planning networks still further note that the training dataset used in this study does not contain any maze maps the simulation results are shown in figs 9 and 10 in this environment rnn1 2 and gru1 failed to complete the obstacle avoidance planning gru2 and crnn1 2 still exhibit good performance which proves their excellent learning and generalization abilities although the path planned by aco is the shortest it is not appropriate for the kinematics of uuvs 4 3 simulation cases under noise jamming 4 3 1 test case 4 in test case 4 10 noise is added to the data detected by fls the performance of the seven obstacle avoidance planners is shown in figs 11 and 12 all deep learning based planners perform well and are not affected by the noise however the aco based obstacle avoidance planner is sensitive to noise 4 3 2 test case 5 we added 20 noise to the data detected by fls in test case 5 as shown by the simulation results in figs 13 and 14 the deep learning based planners are clearly less sensitive to noise in contrast there are many fluctuations on the path planned by the aco based obstacle avoidance planner 4 4 analysis of simulation experiments compared with the conventional aco obstacle avoidance planning method the deep learning based obstacle avoidance planning systems require offline training and learning under the support of a large number of training datasets once fully trained the deep learning based obstacle avoidance planning systems offer shorter planning times economical paths and low propeller use because of the strong associative memory function learning and generalization capabilities of neural networks the deep learning based uuv obstacle avoidance planning systems can directly and autonomously output obstacle avoiding motion control instructions according to the environmental sensing from fls as the deep learning based planning systems have some memory of the environment both the speed adjustment of the propeller and the heading adjustment are smooth and change over relatively small ranges the autonomous learning ability of neural networks gives uuv obstacle avoidance planning systems higher planning success rate and stronger environmental adaptive ability test cases 4 and 5 show that deep learning based obstacle avoidance planners are less sensitive to noise which is important for obstacle avoidance planning based on sonar statistical experimental results show that crnn1 is comparable to gru2 and superior to gru1 and rnn1 2 in other words the proposed crnn can solve the problem of uuv obstacle avoidance planning with fewer parameters and shorter computation times the simulation results for test case 1 demonstrate that all six structures have excellent learning ability and fitting ability test cases 2 and 3 show that the generalization ability of crnn is better than that of rnn and gru even with a similar number of parameters for any given network the generalization ability is related to the number of parameters in other words compared with rnn and gru crnn has the advantages of a simpler structure fewer parameters faster training speed and better learning generalization and robustness 5 conclusion in this paper by improving the connection between the hidden layers of an rnn a convolution network structure has been proposed and applied to obstacle avoidance planning in uuvs to investigate the performance of the proposed crnn for uuv path planning the training time computation time fitting learning and generalization of crnn were compared with those of a regular rnn and gru the crnn obstacle avoidance planner was found to have the advantages of a short training time simple network structure better generalization performance and reliability compared with the aco algorithm the proposed crnn based obstacle avoidance planners require less computing time obtain shorter paths use less energy through their actuators and are insensitive to noise because of its strong feature extraction ability the crnn based obstacle avoidance planner can automatically reveal and memorize environmental features thereby overcoming the weak observation characteristics of the environment and enhancing the capability of environmental perception and anti noise jamming acknowledgments this research work is supported by national natural science foundation of china no 61633008 no 51609046 and

looking sonar fls however fls is susceptible to environmental interference high levels of noise false alarms and missed alarm signals based on such sensor data traditional obstacle avoidance planning methods can only make low confidence decisions which may cause the uuv to adjust its motion frequently according to the online sensing information ii traditional obstacle avoidance algorithms are based on mathematical models accurate modeling to reflect small changes in the system is difficult especially for uncertain systems iii the complexity of the obstacle avoidance planning algorithm increases with the complexity of the environment traditional obstacle avoidance algorithms solve an optimization problem using a random search strategy over a large feasible solution space the computational cost of the algorithm is reflected in the time and space complexity however more complicated algorithms have a greater probability of error and may not guarantee convergence to the approximate global optimal solution therefore it is difficult to meet the timeliness requirements of online real time planning and the requirements for optimization goals iv traditional obstacle avoidance planning methods are usually designed for certain optimization goals when the environmental conditions or mission requirements change it is necessary to redesign the corresponding optimization goal model therefore traditional planning methods do not have sufficient portability interoperability or adaptability to improve the autonomy of the obstacle avoidance system some researchers have introduced reinforcement learning and improved the avoidance performance ye et al 2003 presented a neural fuzzy system with a mixed learning algorithm in which a supervised learning method is used to determine the input and output membership functions simultaneously and a reinforcement learning algorithm is employed to fine tune the output membership functions for obstacle avoidance huang et al 2005 integrated quantum q learning and a neural network for obstacle avoidance in an indoor mobile robot whereas jiao et al 2006 implemented q learning in a neural network and applied it to local path planning for an autonomous underwater vehicle vien et al 2007 used the ant q framework which extends aco with reinforcement learning to solve the problem of obstacle avoidance path planning for a mobile robot and qiao et al 2008 integrated reinforcement learning with a behavior based architecture for obstacle avoidance in a dynamic environment kurozumi et al 2010 presented a minimum vector field histogram method that modifies the user manipulation of an electric wheelchair to avoid obstacles in this method the modification rate is adjusted by reinforcement learning according to the environment and the user condition megherbi and malayia 2012 combined a potential field with reinforcement learning to solve the problem of multi agent based autonomous path planning in a dynamic time varying unstructured environment li et al 2013 proposed an obstacle avoidance algorithm for a robot based on a combination of the state action reward state action sarsa λ algorithm and supervised learning and demonstrated that the hybrid learning algorithm could significantly reduce the learning time for obstacle avoidance in unmanned surface vehicles zhang et al 2014 proposed a sarsa reinforcement learning algorithm composed of local avoidance and adaptive learning modules duguleana and mogan 2016 used q learning and a neural network planner to solve the problem of autonomous movement in four wheeled robots in unknown environments cheng and zhang 2017 proposed a deep reinforcement learning obstacle avoidance algorithm with the deep q network architecture for underactuated unmanned marine vessels under unknown environment dynamics fathinezhad et al 2016 proposed a method of supervised fuzzy sarsa learning for robot navigation in various environments with obstacles dabooni and wunsch 2016 presented a direct heuristic dynamic programming approach for online model learning in a markov decision process this shortens the computation time and improves stability when compared with other traditional reinforcement learning algorithms despite the considerable advances made in the abovementioned research it is difficult to design the reward functions and action strategy for reinforcement learning based obstacle avoidance planning methods additionally even the most reasonable rewards cannot avoid the problem of local minima in particular when uuvs navigate in narrow marine environments it is difficult to formulate an optimal collision avoidance strategy based on reinforcement learning from limited local environmental information recurrent neural networks rnns were first proposed as a network model for time series elman 1990 werbos 1988 rnns remember previous information and apply it to the calculation of the current output the input to the hidden layer of an rnn includes the output of the input layer and the output from the previous hidden layer therefore the internal state of this network can exhibit dynamic timing behavior for the problem of uuv obstacle avoidance planning uuv control commands must be generated according to temporal sensor information for uuvs environment information is detected by sonar which means that the input to the obstacle avoidance planning system is a temporal sonar detection data sequence however traditional rnns cannot extract environment features effectively and contain many network parameters to overcome these problems this paper proposes an rnn with convolution crnn in which a convolution connection replaces the full connection between adjacent layers of the rnn based on crnn a system of uuv autonomous obstacle avoidance planning is constructed offline training and testing is adopted to modify the neural network parameters of the uuv autonomous obstacle avoidance learning system so that self learning is applied to the collision avoidance planning combining this learning system with fls simulation data enables online autonomous obstacle avoidance planning in an unknown environment the ability of crnn based obstacle avoidance planning systems is validated through simulations for various static and unknown obstacle environments using a nonlinear uuv model the self learning and memory capabilities of the crnn mean that the adjustment range for uuv motion is small and consistent with the input time series which is beneficial to uuv motion control the proposed crnn has good generalization capabilities and fully trained crnn obstacle avoidance planning methods can be applied to a wider range of environmental conditions and mission requirements the convolutional connections allow the crnn to solve complex obstacle avoidance planning problems with fewer parameters 2 simulation model of uuv and fls 2 1 system model of uuv obstacle avoidance planning on the vertical plane is usually achieved through depth adjustment however depth adjustment strategies often require large pitch adjustments which affect the attitude control of the target vehicle considering the need to maintain a constant height when employing fls and to reduce energy consumption this study employs the strategy of horizontal plane obstacle avoidance regulation priority therefore a horizontal three degrees of freedom 3dof control model is defined for the uuv which means the dynamics of the vessel associated with heave roll and pitch motions are ignored the global and local coordinate systems are shown in fig 1 the 3dof control model of the uuv is described as follows fossen 2002 1 η r ψ v 2 m v c v v d v v τ where m m r b m a and c v c r b v c a v

r c 32 x u y v the motion of the uuv is controlled by two propellers distributed in the horizontal plane of the uuv τ is modeled as 8 τ u τ r 1 1 l l t n a t n b 2 2 simulation model of fls one of the most important sensors in a uuv is sonar which can detect obstacles and return the distance from the vehicle to the obstacle a two dimensional fls simulation model is established as shown in fig 2 in this model the maximum scan radius of the sonar is 120 m the open angle is 120 the number of beams is set to be 80 which means that the beam angle is 1 5 in the two dimensional sonar simulation model the beam is represented by rays and the arrows represent the current heading of the uuv as the index increases in a clockwise direction every ray is assigned an index from 0 to 79 the detection information of every beam is stored in a vector d t d t 0 d t 1 d t 79 if d t i 120 then we set d t i 120 to decrease the redundancy of information and reduce the complexity of the computations the input distance vector is defined as δ d t 120 d t 0 120 d t 1 120 d t 79 the detection frequency of the simulation sonar is set to be 9 h z 2 3 structure of the crnn the structure of the proposed crnn is shown in fig 3 the main difference between crnn and a standard rnn is how the adjacent layers are connected in standard rnn the nodes between any two adjacent layers are connected to each other in the crnn however only some of the nodes between two adjacent layers are connected in the form of a convolution the forward propagation of the crnn is as follows pad the edge of x t to give a t 1 for l

dimensional vector consisting of the 80 dimensional input distance vector δ d t obtained from the sonar and an input direction vector φ t the two dimensional output vector from the obstacle avoidance planning network at time step t consists of the yaw δψ t and the velocity v t of the uuv the dataset used to test the proposed method consists of 100772 training samples and 899 test samples in the offline training process training the labels used for supervised learning are obtained by traditional obstacle avoidance planning methods such as ant colony optimization genetic algorithm artificial potential field and fuzzy control method all labels in the training set are obtained by intelligent optimization algorithm in simple environments and there is no detection noise in the simulated sonar in these environments obstacles are composed of 30 randomly distributed rectangles and the average obstacle coverage rate is 4 62 and the start and target positions are generated at random the training data set is composed of the excellent results of the above intelligent optimization algorithms each sample in the dataset includes an input vector and a label 16b i n p u t t δ d t φ t 17b l a b e l t δ ψ t v t data normalization is a critical step in the use of neural networks there are two general methods to normalize the data min max normalization and z score normalization the input data used in this paper include many zero values and z score normalization would complicate these data thus min max normalization is applied for each column in i n p u t t the data are normalized according to 18b i n p u t i n p u t min max min 3 2 training to compare the obstacle avoidance planning performance of the crnn against that of a regular rnn and gated recurrent units grus all three models were trained with the same architecture i e input layer hidden layer middle layer and output layer the input layer consists of 81 neurons corresponding to the input vector the hidden layer consists of one of three network structures the middle layer contains 24 neurons and the output layer has two neurons corresponding to the yaw and velocity of the uuv dropout is used to deal with the problem of overfitting with the keep probability of neurons set to be 0 6 the time step is set to be 9 batch size is set to be 5000 and the maximum number of iterations is set to be 10000 the mean squared error mse loss function and the adam optimizer are used to evaluate model performance and optimize the parameters respectively and the weights are updated using backpropagation through time mini batch gradient descent with the objective of minimizing the loss function the results in table 1 and fig 4 indicate that the training time of the networks increases as the number of parameters rises when the number of parameters is similar the number of connections in crnn is much higher than in both rnn and gru and crnn always obtains the best mse with fewer parameters crnn1 obtains a smaller mse than rnn2 and is close to the performance of gru2 as shown in fig 4 the convergence speed of the networks decreased as the number of parameters increased in general crnn outperforms the rnn and gru models in terms of both mse and convergence 4 simulation experiments and results analysis in this section the performance of rnn obstacle avoidance planning networks is validated through a comparison with aco on a series of experiments as a statistical experiment three sets of maps were generated based on the coverage of obstacles with each set containing 100 random maps three test cases examine the generalization ability of the obstacle avoidance planning networks to verify the performance of the proposed crnn obstacle avoidance planner in the presence of noise 10 and 20 noise are then added to the fls signals to conduct noise jamming experiments in all test cases the initial velocity of the uuv is set to be 8 knots in order to facilitate the control uuv and save energy each obstacle avoidance planning algorithm mainly realizes obstacle avoidance planning in static environment by output stable speed and real time adjustment of yaw therefore each algorithm outputs a stable speed to guide uuv to navigate at a uniform speed since each algorithm can output a stable speed we pay more attention to experimental results that reflect the differences between algorithms such as time consumption path cost and sensitivity to noise 4 1 statistical experiment design information about the map sets and the performance of the obstacle avoidance planners are shown in table 2 this section compares the performance of aco with six deep learning based obstacle avoidance planners in terms of computation time planning success rate and path cost note that the coverage of obstacles in the training dataset is 4 62 less than any map in the statistical experiment in complex environments all obstacle avoidance planners except rnn1 obtained high success rates the experimental results show that the planners have sufficient generalization ability to solve obstacle avoidance problems in complex environments after being trained in simple environments this strong generalization ability makes it easy to collect sufficient training data in practical applications as shown in table 2 compared with the aco obstacle avoidance system the obstacle avoidance planners based on deep learning offer better performance in terms of both computation time and path cost the mean computation time of the four types of networks is basically proportional to the number of parameters and the coverage of the obstacles in any one network type more parameters lead to better performance in terms of path cost and planning success rate but a longer computation time the gru and crnn models outperform rnn in terms of path cost and planning success rate compared with gru2 crnn1 achieves competitive performance both in path cost and planning success rate it is worth noting that crnn1 requires less than one third the cpu time of gru2 4 2 typical simulation cases without noise jamming 4 2 1 test case 1 in test case 1 the start position is 524 33 and the target position at 340 1075 as shown in fig 5 all methods can plan safe and collision free paths from the start position to the target position in this test case the deep learning based obstacle avoidance planners have learned to adjust the uuv s heading to navigate toward the target position quickly after avoiding obstacles compared with aco the obstacle avoidance planner based on deep learning produces shorter and smoother paths the yaw control adjustments output by the different obstacle avoidance planners are shown in fig 6 a the uuv motion controller s propeller speed control feedback as shown in fig 6 b and c corresponds with the yaw control adjustment instructions output by the obstacle avoidance planner as shown in fig 6 the adjustment range obtained by the deep learning based obstacle avoidance planners is much smaller than that of aco both in yaw adjustment and propeller speed this improves the kinematics of the uuv and reduces the energy consumption of the actuators which increases their lifespan 4 2 2 test case 2 to test the obstacle avoidance planning networks a complex wharf map is considered in test case 2 the start and target positions are 262 37 and 320 1077 respectively the simulation results are shown in figs 7 and 8 in this case the performance of rnn2 gru1 2 and crnn1 2 is satisfactory but rnn1 fails to complete the obstacles avoidance task there is a lot of turbulence in the path planned by aco whereas the paths obtained by the deep learning obstacle avoidance planners are very smooth this is because of the strong memory and learning ability of deep learning methods which enhance the environmental awareness of the obstacle avoidance planning system 4 2 3 test case 3 in test case 3 a maze map tests the ability of obstacle avoidance planning networks still further note that the training dataset used in this study does not contain any maze maps the simulation results are shown in figs 9 and 10 in this environment rnn1 2 and gru1 failed to complete the obstacle avoidance planning gru2 and crnn1 2 still exhibit good performance which proves their excellent learning and generalization abilities although the path planned by aco is the shortest it is not appropriate for the kinematics of uuvs 4 3 simulation cases under noise jamming 4 3 1 test case 4 in test case 4 10 noise is added to the data detected by fls the performance of the seven obstacle avoidance planners is shown in figs 11 and 12 all deep learning based planners perform well and are not affected by the noise however the aco based obstacle avoidance planner is sensitive to noise 4 3 2 test case 5 we added 20 noise to the data detected by fls in test case 5 as shown by the simulation results in figs 13 and 14 the deep learning based planners are clearly less sensitive to noise in contrast there are many fluctuations on the path planned by the aco based obstacle avoidance planner 4 4 analysis of simulation experiments compared with the conventional aco obstacle avoidance planning method the deep learning based obstacle avoidance planning systems require offline training and learning under the support of a large number of training datasets once fully trained the deep learning based obstacle avoidance planning systems offer shorter planning times economical paths and low propeller use because of the strong associative memory function learning and generalization capabilities of neural networks the deep learning based uuv obstacle avoidance planning systems can directly and autonomously output obstacle avoiding motion control instructions according to the environmental sensing from fls as the deep learning based planning systems have some memory of the environment both the speed adjustment of the propeller and the heading adjustment are smooth and change over relatively small ranges the autonomous learning ability of neural networks gives uuv obstacle avoidance planning systems higher planning success rate and stronger environmental adaptive ability test cases 4 and 5 show that deep learning based obstacle avoidance planners are less sensitive to noise which is important for obstacle avoidance planning based on sonar statistical experimental results show that crnn1 is comparable to gru2 and superior to gru1 and rnn1 2 in other words the proposed crnn can solve the problem of uuv obstacle avoidance planning with fewer parameters and shorter computation times the simulation results for test case 1 demonstrate that all six structures have excellent learning ability and fitting ability test cases 2 and 3 show that the generalization ability of crnn is better than that of rnn and gru even with a similar number of parameters for any given network the generalization ability is related to the number of parameters in other words compared with rnn and gru crnn has the advantages of a simpler structure fewer parameters faster training speed and better learning generalization and robustness 5 conclusion in this paper by improving the connection between the hidden layers of an rnn a convolution network structure has been proposed and applied to obstacle avoidance planning in uuvs to investigate the performance of the proposed crnn for uuv path planning the training time computation time fitting learning and generalization of crnn were compared with those of a regular rnn and gru the crnn obstacle avoidance planner was found to have the advantages of a short training time simple network structure better generalization performance and reliability compared with the aco algorithm the proposed crnn based obstacle avoidance planners require less computing time obtain shorter paths use less energy through their actuators and are insensitive to noise because of its strong feature extraction ability the crnn based obstacle avoidance planner can automatically reveal and memorize environmental features thereby overcoming the weak observation characteristics of the environment and enhancing the capability of environmental perception and anti noise jamming acknowledgments this research work is supported by national natural science foundation of china no 61633008 no 51609046 and
