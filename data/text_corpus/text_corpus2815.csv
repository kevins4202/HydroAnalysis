biological aerated filter baf is a widely used water treatment system with the advantages of small area low cost and high purification efficiency which is mainly depends on growing biofilm 14 in a baf

metabolism to achieve the purpose of water purification showing that the performance of porous biofilter material has a decisive influence on the implementation effect of baf process 15 in addition the investment cost of porous filter material is also a crucial factor of the practical application except for the performance therefore porous ceramsite material with both advantage of low cost and high porosity has been widely investigated and applied 14 16 18 recently the common raw materials for preparing porous ceramsites are sludge fly ash 19 drinking water treatment sludge 20 and other waste materials wherein iron tailings as a global existence of solid waste material have the characteristic of abundant reserves however its storage not only occupies resources but pollutes the environment therefore how to utilize iron tailings effectively is of great research significance compared with other solid waste materials with little or no silicon dioxide the existence of high content of sio2 in high silicon iron tailings makes it easier to form the ceramsite skeleton and has excellent pressure resistance thus this paper adopts high silicon iron tailings as raw material to prepare porous ceramsites previous studies showed porous ceramsites used as biological carriers must to be characterized for its large surface area coarse pore wall high porosity and interconnection of pores so as to assess its effectiveness 21 23 in addition inoculation of microorganisms acclimatization of microorganism through mucus secretion and its attraction to the colloidal outer polymer are sequence of steps in the process of immobilization of microorganism on the ceramsites the porosity and surface roughness of ceramsites are key parameters to improve the contact of microorganisms 14 the continuous maturation of microorganisms contributes to the formation of a steady structure on the surface of ceramsites containing manifold species and the complete degradation of complex wastes in this microecosystem in addition complete degradation of pollutants from organic wastewater involves a complex oxidative decomposition process among microorganisms 24 25 herein instead of the natural minerals we report a facile methodology to prepare porous ceramsites with the waste high silica iron tailings as the matrix by adding binders pore forming agent and fluxing agent and used it

whole field simulation and analysis were carried out by cad and cfd software to simplify the problem the following basic assumptions or conditions are set i the flow direction was from bottom to up ii the flow was regarded as an isothermal process neglecting the possible temperature effect iii the parameters such as fluid density and viscosity were considered in water at 20 and the influence of chemical reagents on the physical properties of fluids used in artificial sewage preparation was ignored among them the fluid density was ρ 1000 kg m3 and the kinematic viscosity was υ 1 011 10 6 m2 s

and discussion 3 1 the basic physical and chemical properties of ceramsites according to the characterization results of porous ceramsites with different calcination temperatures table s2 fig s1 and section s2 1 in supporting information the calcination temperature was determined to be 1100 therefore x ray diffraction xrd is used to investigate the detailed chemical states of the as prepared samples prepared by calcination at 1100 as reflected in fig 2 a the main phases of porous ceramites are quartz diopside camgsi2o6 and hematite fe2o3 wherein the existence of silica is attributed to iron tailings fig 2c additionally diopside is a silicate containing ca and mg of which ca and mg mainly come from the ferrotschermakite in iron tailings and attapulgite respectively fig 2a and b the physical and chemical properties of iron tailings matrix multi pore ceramsites calcined at 1100 are shown in table s3 it can be seen that the sum of damage and wear rate and hydrochloric acid soluble rate of the samples meet the industrial standards as per cj t 299 2008 artificial ceramic particle filter material for water treatment with the sum of damage and wear rate c 6 and the hydrochloric acid soluble rate c 2 additionally the specific surface area bulk density and porosity are 5 54 m2 g 0 78 g cm3 and 49 8 respectively further guaranty the suitability of the iron tailings ceramsites matrix for waste water treatment fig 3 provides the pore size distribution of porous ceramsites calcinated at 1100 it can be seen from the picture the major proportion of pore diameter is in the mesoporous range of 2 6 nm which is suitable for the growth and formation of a biofilm 3 2 characteristics of biofilm growth and biofilm flow field 3 2 1 growth of microorganism on the porous ceramsites surface the adherence of microbial flora on the surface of porous ceramsites occurs in three stages bacterial initial adhesion biofilm development and mature diffusion fig 4 shows the typical images of biofilm during different stages 1 bacterial initial adhesion the biological flora inoculated with sludge was alive with the tangible formation of film starting after 3 days fig 4a shows the initial flora begins to adapt to the new environment and induce the enzymes needed for anabolism in this phase the growth rate was slow after aeration for 3 days only a small amount of orange floccus could be observed in the water body at this stage sludge began to decompose and expand and facilitate gradual adherence of bacteria at this time the voidage was 55 2 biofilm development after 7 days of aeration domestication was completed the microorganism has adapted to the new environment due to the metabolic rate gets increasing and they start to grow multiplying quickly with the growth rate exhibiting a logarithmic increase fig 4b shows formation of white biofilm on the local surface of the ceramsites at around day 10 and gradually spreading to the surrounding areas fig 4c 3 mature diffusion after 27 days of aeration a thick biofilm can be observed in the walls of the reactor as shown in fig 4d at this time the voidage also gradually decrease to 20 during this phase due to aging the color of biofilm changed to black and peeled off from the surface of cermisites the above results indicate that the growth and extinction of biofilm in the porous ceramsites are periodic which is usually 30 35 days due to the growth and death of biofilm the upper part of the reactor filter bed began to appear as flocs with physical appearance being light purple the appearance of flocs is because of some biofilm containing microorganisms detached from the surface of the filter media and flowed into the upper space but these biofilm still have a positive contribution to sewage treatment after a few days the number of flocculent bodies increased and developed adhesion between each other as result of the pore structure of the filter changed it contributes to a significant change in the internal flow channel notably water flowed from the right and then forming circumfluence area on the left ultimately the floccus accumulated and deposited on the wall fig 4e to further investigate the composition of biofilm fig 5 shows the microscopic pictures of the stained bacteria which are in the upper body of the reactor wherein crystal violet staining solution was used as the dye as revealed in the pictures microorganisms continue to evolve until various rod shaped bacteria and more advanced linear bacteria are formed at mid and late stages of artificial wastewater treatment the presence of abundant bacterial communities such as different forms of rod shaped bacteria fig 5a c and linear bacteria fig 5d e indicates the maturity of biofilm and symbolizes the successful formation of porous ceramic biofilm 4 27 28 fig 6 shows the scanning electron microscope sem images of the surface morphology of porous ceramisites without biofilm and with biofilm fig 6a displays the ceramic particles have excellent porous characteristics and rough surface which are suitable for microbial implantation fig 6b clearly indicates the presence of grown biofilm on the surface of porous ceramisites this result reveals the excellent biological adhesion properties of iron tailing ceramsites with a positive effect on the biofilm considering the mass of microorganisms loaded on porous ceramsite affects the efficiency of baf reactor the biological mass on the surface of porous ceramsite was measured by in situ weighing method the results exhibit that the mass of the biofilm is 0 34 1 76 and 2 50 g respectively at the bacterial initial adhesion biofilm development and mature diffusion which are shown in supporting information section s2 2 3 2 2 evaluation of organic matter removal fig 7 displays the plot of reduction in cod nh3 n and t p with duration of exposure to the ceramsites with the membrane cultured in the bioreactor for 7 days under the temperature range of 20 30 at an air purging rate of 20 l h bacteria began to adhere on the surface of porous ceramsites on the third day and the removal rate of cod nh3 n and t p in waste liquid was 9 15 and 9 respectively the poor degradation rate could be attributed to the fact that the biofilm had just begun to form however with the aging of the biofilm in the range of 7 15 days at an air purging rate of 40 l h the removal rate of cod nh3 n and t p increased significantly to 53 42 and 47 respectively which could be attributed to the larger mass of microorganism due to rapid multiplication during this phase with the biofilm aging at the mature diffusion stage the removal rates of cod nh3 n and t p were as high as 91 85 and 80 respectively and the removal rate also become stable the comparison of degradation effectiveness of the ceramsites with similar work in literature is shown in table 2 the results clearly indicate that ceramistes is comparable to other similar reports in the literatures 3 3 flow field and resistance characteristics of pores between biofilm 3 3 1 simulation of biofilm growth process it was found that in the process biofilm formation on porous ceramisites as the time increased the biofilm also thickened which great effected the internal pore and flow state of porous ceramsite therefore the growth and decontamination of biofilm were affected in view of this we simulated the growth process of biofilm on the filter surface by using the quartet structure generation set qsgs method to explore the characteristics of flow field and resistance characteristics between the pores of biofilm 34 fig 8 shows the images of stimulated the growth process of biofilm on porous ceramsite bioreactor at different stages where the white part represents ceramsites and the black part represents pore water or air while the blue part represents biofilm as can be seen from fig 8 in the initial stage the sludge discharged was evenly deposited on the surface of the porous ceramsites and in the small pores between the particles fig 8a the biological cultivation and domestication start as time goes on fig 8b d the biofilm became thicker the flow channel became narrower the resistance increased sharply and the flow became more difficult it can be concluded that the pores between porous ceramisites provide an important place and space for the growth and evolution of biofilm 3 3 2 simulation of pore flow between porous ceramsites and biofilm for further numerical simulation the main process on pore structure image of porous ceramsites is shown in fig s2 the pore structure image of porous ceramsites in fig 8 is processed by edge processing and image vectorization then the whole field simulation and analysis were carried out by cad and cfd software on the basis of previous assumptions correlated flow control equations were provided in supporting information section s2 3 the simulation was carried out by using fluent numerical calculation software utilizing unstructured triangular grids verification by grid independence the number of computational grids is about 500 000 the flow path was encrypted as shown in fig s3 the inner flow field or velocity field distribution cloud map of porous ceramsites at different biofilm formation stages are reflected in fig s4 and fig 9 wherein re values are 5 and 10 respectively as shown in the picture with the continuous growth of biofilm the advantageous circulation channel is gradually reduced specifically for the stacked ceramsites before biofilm forming biofilm there are more dominant channels for water flow fig 9a as biofilm accumulates the number of dominant channels decrease thus the flow channels change fig 9b and c leading to the increases in flow resistance and changes in the growth and development of local biofilm in addition the detailed analysis for the selection of re value is shown in supporting information section s2 4 fig 10 shows the inner streamline re 10 of porous ceramsites at different biofilm formation stages the number and density of the intergranular flow lines changed along with the development of different stages in the initial stage the internal streamline is relatively abundant fig 10a as the biofilm continues to grow the internal streamline decreases fig 10b c leading to the outflow direction significantly changed ultimately the outflow concentrated on one side for the other side there are many circumfluence areas causing to form the floc regurgitation between supernatant more easily which is one of the typical features of porous media flow which is in agreement with fig 4e description fig 11 a shows the relation curve between the pressure drop inlet and outlet and the reynolds number re in the reactor with porous ceramsites as shown in the picture when re was lesser than 20 the inlet and outlet pressure drop increased with the increase of inlet velocity especially if it is less than 10 the growth is relatively slow on the contrary when re was greater than 20 flow states tended to be turbulent flow the pressure drop of import and export increased rapidly therefore re number should be controlled within 20 preferably within 10 fig 11b demonstrates the curve of flow pressure drop between porous ceramisites at different stages it can be seen that the pressure drop of import and export increase with the continuous growth of biofilm in the case of the present study when re 10 the import and export pressure drop of the biofilm in the middle stage is about 46 times larger than early stage of before biofilm forms which indicates that the internal blockage of the ceramisites is serious when the inlet and outlet pressure of the porous ceramisite layer is more than 0 12 pa the cleaning of the ceramsite layer must be conducted as soon as possible at this point with a cycle of about 27 days otherwise the effect of biofilm on the degradation of organic matter may be affected in conclusion simulation method can largely restore the changes of water flow and resistance after biofilm growth in the baf reactor thus providing guidance for future experiments 4 conclusions in conclusion the waste high silica iron tailings were used as the matrix to prepare porous ceramsites wherein the specific surface area bulk density and porosity can be reached to 5 54 m2 g 0 78 g cm3 and 49 8 respectively after inoculation and domestication with sludge the surface of ceramsites experienced three stages bacterial initial adhesion biofilm development and mature diffusion to obtain biofilm the removal rates of cod nh3 n and t p were 91 85 and 80 respectively which is much better than most of the other filter materials ever reported based on the cfd method the results of the simulation of the flow field and resistance of organic wastewater in the pore of biofilm showed that the pore size between ceramisites had an obvious effect on the growth of biofilm after the biofilm entered the development stage the pressure drop of inlet and outlet increased by 46 times compared with before the biofilm formation which indicated that the resistance between ceramisites was too large at this time and the bioreactor needed to be cleaned in time to ensure the efficient degradation of organic matter declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest

mature diffusion after 27 days of aeration a thick biofilm can be observed in the walls of the reactor as shown in fig 4d at this time the voidage also gradually decrease to 20 during this phase due to aging the color of biofilm changed to black and peeled off from the surface of cermisites the above results indicate that the growth and extinction of biofilm in the porous ceramsites are periodic which is usually 30 35 days due to the growth and death of biofilm the upper part of the reactor filter bed began to appear as flocs with physical appearance being light purple the appearance of flocs is because of some biofilm containing microorganisms detached from the surface of the filter media and flowed into the upper space but these biofilm still have a positive contribution to sewage treatment after a few days the number of flocculent bodies increased and developed adhesion between each other as result of the pore structure of the filter changed it contributes to a significant change in the internal flow channel notably water flowed from the right and then forming circumfluence area on the left ultimately the floccus accumulated and deposited on the wall fig 4e to further investigate the composition of biofilm fig 5 shows the microscopic pictures of the stained bacteria which are in the upper body of the reactor wherein crystal violet staining solution was used as the dye as revealed in the pictures microorganisms continue to evolve until various rod shaped bacteria and more advanced linear bacteria are formed at mid and late stages of artificial wastewater treatment the presence of abundant bacterial communities such as different forms of rod shaped bacteria fig 5a c and linear bacteria fig 5d e indicates the maturity of biofilm and symbolizes the successful formation of porous ceramic biofilm 4 27 28 fig 6 shows the scanning electron microscope sem images of the surface morphology of porous ceramisites without biofilm and with biofilm fig 6a displays the ceramic particles have excellent porous characteristics and rough surface which are suitable for microbial implantation fig 6b clearly indicates the presence of grown biofilm on the surface of porous ceramisites this result reveals the excellent biological adhesion properties of iron tailing ceramsites with a positive effect on the biofilm considering the mass of microorganisms loaded on porous ceramsite affects the efficiency of baf reactor the biological mass on the surface of porous ceramsite was measured by in situ weighing method the results exhibit that the mass of the biofilm is 0 34 1 76 and 2 50 g respectively at the bacterial initial adhesion biofilm development and mature diffusion which are shown in supporting information section s2 2 3 2 2 evaluation of organic matter removal fig 7 displays the plot of reduction in cod nh3 n and t p with duration of exposure to the ceramsites with the membrane cultured in the bioreactor for 7 days under the temperature range of 20 30 at an air purging rate of 20 l h bacteria began to adhere on the surface of porous ceramsites on the third day and the removal rate of cod nh3 n and t p in waste liquid was 9 15 and 9 respectively the poor degradation rate could be attributed to the fact that the biofilm had just begun to form however with the aging of the biofilm in the range of 7 15 days at an air purging rate of 40 l h the removal rate of cod nh3 n and t p increased significantly to 53 42 and 47 respectively which could be attributed to the larger mass of microorganism due to rapid multiplication during this phase with the biofilm aging at the mature diffusion stage the removal rates of cod nh3 n and t p were as high as 91 85 and 80 respectively and the removal rate also become stable the comparison of degradation effectiveness of the ceramsites with similar work in literature is shown in table 2 the results clearly indicate that ceramistes is comparable to other similar reports in the literatures 3 3 flow field and resistance characteristics of pores between biofilm 3 3 1 simulation of biofilm growth process it was found that in the process biofilm formation on porous ceramisites as the time increased the biofilm also thickened which great effected the internal pore and flow state of porous ceramsite therefore the growth and decontamination of biofilm were affected in view of this we simulated the growth process of biofilm on the filter surface by using the quartet structure generation set qsgs method to explore the characteristics of flow field and resistance characteristics between the pores of biofilm 34 fig 8 shows the images of stimulated the growth process of biofilm on porous ceramsite bioreactor at different stages where the white part represents ceramsites and the black part represents pore water or air while the blue part represents biofilm as can be seen from fig 8 in the initial stage the sludge discharged was evenly deposited on the surface of the porous ceramsites and in the small pores between the particles fig 8a the biological cultivation and domestication start as time goes on fig 8b d the biofilm became thicker the flow channel became narrower the resistance increased sharply and the flow became more difficult it can be concluded that the pores between porous ceramisites provide an important place and space for the growth and evolution of biofilm 3 3 2 simulation of pore flow between porous ceramsites and biofilm for further numerical simulation the main process on pore structure image of porous ceramsites is shown in fig s2 the pore structure image of porous ceramsites in fig 8 is processed by edge processing and image vectorization then the whole field simulation and analysis were carried out by cad and cfd software on the basis of previous assumptions correlated flow control equations were provided in supporting information section s2 3 the simulation was carried out by using fluent numerical calculation software utilizing unstructured triangular grids verification by grid independence the number of computational grids is about 500 000 the flow path was encrypted as shown in fig s3 the inner flow field or velocity field distribution cloud map of porous ceramsites at different biofilm formation stages are reflected in fig s4 and fig 9 wherein re values are 5 and 10 respectively as shown in the picture with the continuous growth of biofilm the advantageous circulation channel is gradually reduced specifically for the stacked ceramsites before biofilm forming biofilm there are more dominant channels for water flow fig 9a as biofilm accumulates the number of dominant channels decrease thus the flow channels change fig 9b and c leading to the increases in flow resistance and changes in the growth and development of local biofilm in addition the detailed analysis for the selection of re value is shown in supporting information section s2 4 fig 10 shows the inner streamline re 10 of porous ceramsites at different biofilm formation stages the number and density of the intergranular flow lines changed along with the development of different stages in the initial stage the internal streamline is relatively abundant fig 10a as the biofilm continues to grow the internal streamline decreases fig 10b c leading to the outflow direction significantly changed ultimately the outflow concentrated on one side for the other side there are many circumfluence areas causing to form the floc regurgitation between supernatant more easily which is one of the typical features of porous media flow which is in agreement with fig 4e description fig 11 a shows the relation curve between the pressure drop inlet and outlet and the reynolds number re in the reactor with porous ceramsites as shown in the picture when re was lesser than 20 the inlet and outlet pressure drop increased with the increase of inlet velocity especially if it is less than 10 the growth is relatively slow on the contrary when re was greater than 20 flow states tended to be turbulent flow the pressure drop of import and export increased rapidly therefore re number should be controlled within 20 preferably within 10 fig 11b demonstrates the curve of flow pressure drop between porous ceramisites at different stages it can be seen that the pressure drop of import and export increase with the continuous growth of biofilm in the case of the present study when re 10 the import and export pressure drop of the biofilm in the middle stage is about 46 times larger than early stage of before biofilm forms which indicates that the internal blockage of the ceramisites is serious when the inlet and outlet pressure of the porous ceramisite layer is more than 0 12 pa the cleaning of the ceramsite layer must be conducted as soon as possible at this point with a cycle of about 27 days otherwise the effect of biofilm on the degradation of organic matter may be affected in conclusion simulation method can largely restore the changes of water flow and resistance after biofilm growth in the baf reactor thus providing guidance for future experiments 4 conclusions in conclusion the waste high silica iron tailings were used as the matrix to prepare porous ceramsites wherein the specific surface area bulk density and porosity can be reached to 5 54 m2 g 0 78 g cm3 and 49 8 respectively after inoculation and domestication with sludge the surface of ceramsites experienced three stages bacterial initial adhesion biofilm development and mature diffusion to obtain biofilm the removal rates of cod nh3 n and t p were 91 85 and 80 respectively which is much better than most of the other filter materials ever reported based on the cfd method the results of the simulation of the flow field and resistance of organic wastewater in the pore of biofilm showed that the pore size between ceramisites had an obvious effect on the growth of biofilm after the biofilm entered the development stage the pressure drop of inlet and outlet increased by 46 times compared with before the biofilm formation which indicated that the resistance between ceramisites was too large at this time and the bioreactor needed to be cleaned in time to ensure the efficient degradation of organic matter declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest

14076,the aim of this work was to investigate the performances of a spinning disk reactor for the removal of nitrate from aqueous solutions by using iron nanoparticles as reducing agent the influence of three operating parameters i e rotational velocity feed injection point position and recirculation flow rate was investigated through evaluating the nitrate reduction efficiency and kinetics increasing the rotational velocity led to a better nitrate reduction efficiency and faster kinetics the optimal rotational velocity was 147 rad s whereas the optimal feed injection point distance from disk centre and recirculation flow rate were 3 cm and 250 ml min respectively the data were compared with those reported in literature and obtained by classical batch reactor and clearly demonstrated the better performances obtained by this intensified equipment finally a mass transfer based kinetic model was proposed and a computational fluid dynamic model was implemented to simulate the fluid dynamics of the rotating liquid film keywords nitrate process intensification nzvi cfd sdr 1 introduction nitrate is often present in wastewater and groundwater 1 3 it is considered relatively non toxic however in reducing environments nitrate anion tends to transform in nitrite species that are considered toxic for every organism 4 5 nitrates enter water bodies such as lakes or rivers due to the uncontrolled discharge of animal manures wastewaters 6 such as tannery effluents and due to the intensified use of fertilizers in agriculture 7 the most dangerous consequence of nitrate pollution in water bodies is the eutrophication process causing the uncontrolled algal biomass growth and related issues oxygen levels depletion aquatic organism death etc 8 9 regarding the effect of ingesting high level of nitrate from drinking water the possible consequences can be liver damages methemoglobinemia and cancer mainly due to the generation of nitrites from nitrate reduction in reducing environment such as the human stomach 10 various technologies have been proposed for the removal of nitrates from aqueous media such as membrane treatment 11 sorption onto biomass or synthetic adsorbent 12 13 biological and chemical denitrification 4 14 17 between these processes chemical denitrification represents the most effective since allows to transform nitrates species in ammonium or nitrogen that can be recovered stripped in atmosphere leading to the complete removal of n compounds from the treated medium 18 19 in this context zero valent iron nanoparticles nzvi have been already demonstrated their efficiency and fast kinetics in the removal of different contaminants 20 22 and in the nitrate conversion to nitrogen and ammonia as well reported in literature 23 24 the main disadvantages of this technology are the necessity of an inert atmosphere during the treatment 22 25 and the requirement of very high fe 0 no3 mol mol ratio to obtain removal efficiencies larger than 80 in some hours of treatment 26 27 the main mechanisms occurring during nitrate removal by nzvi are 28 indirect nitrate reduction due to the production of hydrogen in liquid bulk because of the oxidation of iron nanoparticles in the presence of hydrogen protons direct nitrate reduction onto the nzvi surface carried out by the electron transfer from fe 0 core to the sorbed nitrate species on the nanoparticle s surface in both cases the mixing intensity in the vessel used for the treatment plays a fundamental role for the enhancement of both mass transfer and apparent kinetics to intensify the chemical denitrification process induced by nzvi two main ways can be followed varying the operating parameter values such as temperature or nzvi nitrate molar ratio or using different equipment with respect to classical stirred tank reactors in particular spinning disk reactor sdr has already demonstrated its effectiveness in wastewater treatment processes 29 it has been mainly used to overcome the mass transfer limitations that characterized photocatalysis processes when adopted in large scale equipment 30 process intensification techniques aim at minimizing plant size of continuous high yield equipment capable to produce specific sized high quality nanoparticles combined with an increase in energy efficiency safety and cost reduction 31 in particular the sdr consists of a rotating disk with a jet of one two or more liquid feeds impinging onto the top surface of the disk creating a thin and highly sheared film due to the high centrifugal forces leading to very rapid mixing and short residence time 32 34 the uniform and rapid micromixing environment generation on the rotating disk represents the main advantage offered by sdr in mass transfer based processes such as wastewater treatment as well reported by various authors 35 38 in the present work a spinning disk reactor was used to intensify the chemical denitrification by nzvi various operating parameters have been investigated to optimize the process and the analogy between plug flow reactor pfr and sdr flow has been adopted for the kinetic modelling of the obtained results the data were interpreted through a mass transfer model coupled with a fluid dynamic model built in ansys fluent environment for the estimation of both radial velocity fields and water residence time onto the rotating disk surface 2 experimental 2 1 materials and equipment all the reagents were purchased from sigma aldrich milan and were of analytical grade the solutions were prepared with deionized water in detail the following reagents were used nabh4 feso4 7h2o cmc 20 000 g mol and nano3 the equipment used in this work is schematized in fig 1 the sdr was composed of a static external cylinder and an inner rotating disc of teflon radius rd of 4 25 cm where reaction took place the feed streams temperature was kept constant at 25 c through a water bath the iron nanoparticles synthetized according to a previous work 39 had a mean size of 28 nm the nitrate solution was fed onto the disk surface for the initial mixing the outlet was linked to a stirred tank str 250 ml of volume from which a peristaltic pump recirculated the mixed solution onto the rotating disk surface the feed injection point distance from the disk centre ri could be varied the rotational velocity of the disk could be increased up to 147 rad s and the intern diameter of feed streamlines was 1 mm 2 2 experimental procedure the experiments were conducted in batch mode the same solution 250 ml was treated and recirculated on the rotating disk surface up to the end of the reaction 1 3 f e 0 n o 3 3 h 2 o f e 3 o 4 n h 4 2 o h from which a stoichiometric fe 0 no3 molar ratio equal to 3 can be deduced 50 ml of nanoparticle solution was initially mixed with 200 ml of a 150 mg l nitrate solution to achieve an initial nitrate concentration of 120 mg l the inlet flowrate of 50 ml fe 0 solution was fixed at 100 ml min whereas the flowrate of nitrate solution was 400 ml min each run started after mixing the two solutions 36 runs were performed at different recirculation flow rate q 100 250 and 400 ml min ri 2 2 5 3 and 3 5 cm while the rotational disk velocity ω varied as 53 105 and 147 rad s in all the tests the fe 0 no3 was set at 3 5 mol mol slightly larger than the stoichiometric ratio to take into account the initial oxidation of the nzvi once all the optimal operating parameter values were assessed additional 3 runs were conducted at different fe 0 no3 ratios 4 4 5 and 5 mol mol the temperature of the solution was kept constant at 25 c using a water bath and process kinetic was investigated collecting every 5 min 2 ml samples from the sampling point shown in fig 1 until an asymptote for nitrate removal efficiency was observed the liquid sample was filtered by a 220 nm syringe filter and the residual nitrate concentration was measured by ionic chromatography dionex ics 1100 the final ph of the solution was also measured by a crison 421 ph meter whereas the initial ph of the solution was 6 8 before sending to the rotating disk the nitrate solution was de oxygenated for 4 h at 50 c under ar atmosphere all the runs were conducted without the use of inert atmosphere considering that according to preliminary results under inert atmosphere no significant variation in process performances have been observed the storage tank was mechanically stirred with a paddle impeller at the maximum rotational velocity of 105 rad s all the runs were conducted in duplicate the mean values of the measured nitrate concentrations were reported the standard deviation in all the tests was 3 8 2 3 fluid dynamic modelling the experimental results were interpreted according to three fluid dynamic models the flow regime was predicted basing on the reynolds rotational number defined as follows 40 2 r e ω r 2 ν where ω in this equation expressed in 1 s in the following it will be reported as rpm or rad s is the rotational velocity of the disk ν m2 s is the fluid kinematic viscosity and r m is the radius at the measurement point on the disc according to a number of experiments reported in a previous work 40 the flow on a free rotating disk can be considered laminar for re numbers lower than 104 since in the range 104 105 the flow instabilities become significant and the flow can be considered in transition to turbulent conditions fully established for re number larger than 105 another useful dimensionless number for the investigation of fluid dynamics on rotating disk is the ekman number e ν δ 2 ω defined as the ratio between the inertial and viscous contributions referred to the flow of a fluid on the spinning disc usually e dimensionless number value can be calculated to assess the occurrence of rotational synchronized conditions when e 2 the inertial contributions have a considerable contributions and simplified model such as nusselt and related ones cannot be adopted for the interpretation of fluid dynamics of rotating liquid film in those cases more reliable model or directly cfd computational fluid dynamics instruments should be considered the rate of mixing heat and mass transfer in the fluid is affected by the type of flow prevailing on a rotating disc surface under given conditions of flowrate and rotational speed the fluid dynamics of a rotating liquid film can be described by the classical navier stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates r θ z obtaining a very complex differential equations system in the following paragraph the cfd modelling in ansys fluent environment is reported and discussed 2 3 1 computational fluid dynamic cfd model in ansys fluent environment the average film thickness was evaluated using cfd simulations performed with the software ansys fluent 17 0 the geometry reported in fig 2 was built with gambit the mesh details are reported by de caprariis and co workers 41 the simulations were performed using a multiphase model in order to reproduce the interphase between the air and the liquid phase the volume of fluid vof model was adopted since it is the most suitable to tack the interphase the vof considers that in each cell one of the two phases is present or at the interphase a mixture of the two the continuity equation when the vof is used becomes 3 δ α q δ t v α q 0 where α q is the mass fraction that must satisfy the mass conservation law i 1 n α q i 0 and v is the velocity given by the momentum equation 4 t ρ v ρ v v p μ v v t ρ g f where f represents the external body forces for this system mainly coriolis forces in such equation the fluid density and viscosity are calculated as the volume mean value for each phase 5 ρ i 1 n α q i ρ q i 6 μ i 1 n α q i μ q i the turbulence was modeled with the traditional k ε model the resolution methods are reported in table 1 the simulations were performed with a rotating disk velocity of 150 rad s and the influence of the distance between the disk center and the feed injection point was evaluated varying this distance between 2 cm 3 5 cm these simulations were conducted with a flow rate of 250 ml min then two further simulations at a feed injection point of 2 5 cm were made for 100 ml min and 400 ml min since in the experimental tests the injected solutions were composed by the reagents diluted in water for the fluid dynamic analysis the fed liquid phase was considered as water finally the mixing time was calculated as 41 7 t m i x 12 υ ε 0 5 2 4 kinetic modelling the analogy between plug flow reactor pfr and sdr has been proposed by various authors 42 43 at high rotational velocity values 1000 rpm low viscosities close to that of water and high inlet flowrates the bulk flow behaviour of sdr and pfr were proved to be very close 44 45 assuming pfr flow conditions the kinetic modelling of the denitrification process can be simplified and therefore the mass balance in the storage tank ideally modelled as a continuous stirred tank reactor and the mass balance on the rotating disk can be written as follows fig 3 8 d n t d t q v n 0 n r r 1 9 d n r d r 2 π r q δ r r 2 where v m3 is the stirred tank volume n mol m3 is the nitrate concentration n0 mol m3 is the initial nitrate concentration and r1 mol s and r2 mol m3 s are the reaction rates the values of δ were from cfd simulations whereas the reaction rates can be expressed as apparent first order kinetic and apparent nth order kinetic for str and sdr respectively yielding to 10 d n t d t q v n 0 n r k 1 n t 11 d n r d r 2 π r q δ r k 2 n r n where k1 1 s is the pseudo first order kinetic constant k2 m3 n 1 mol1 n s is the pseudo nth order kinetic constant per unit of volume and n is the reaction order the system of eq 10 and 11 was iteratively solved according to the following initial and boundary conditions 12 n t n 0 t 0 n r n f e e d s d r r r i n r n o u t s d r r r d the kinetic data modelling was carried out in gproms environment ver 4 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 the influence of operating parameters on nzvi induced denitrification fig 4 shows the results of the first experimental runs at fixed ri 2 cm at the different tested flowrates as expected increasing the rotational velocity of the disk led to an increase of the process efficiency since the ε and mixing intensity resulted enhanced leading to a larger energy amount dispersed on the rotating disk surface an asymptotic nitrate removal efficiency was reached within 35 45 min depending on the rotational velocity of the disk in detail for ω 53 rad s the maximum nitrate removal efficiency at 45 min was 69 whereas for ω 105 and 147 rad s the process efficiency raised up to 76 and 82 respectively reached at 40 and 35 min the influence of q on the nitrate removal efficiency was initially negligible the process efficiency only increased of about 3 from 100 to 250 ml min whereas a worsening was observed at larger q at 400 ml min the process efficiency decreased of about 7 8 when ω remain was 105 and 147 rad s whereas the decrease at 53 rad s was negligible fig 5 displays the results of the others experimental runs at different ri q and ω to simplify the data illustration only the complete kinetics of six runs were reported the variation of ri led to a shape modification and initially to an increase in nitrate removal efficiency in detail the asymptotic nitrate removal efficiency passed from 82 3 at ri 2 cm to 85 at ri 2 5 cm whereas an additional increase of ri caused a worsening of the final efficiency that dropped to 78 for ri 3 5 cm this behaviour can be probably attributed to the decrease of tres on the disk surface caused by the increase of ri that initially led to an improvement of the process efficiency mainly due to the increase of ε and mixing intensity on the other hand this enhancement became not appreciable when ri reached 3 or 3 5 cm because of the substantial reduction of the residence time on the disk surface in particular since the reaction occurred both on rotating disk surface and in the stirred tank reactor when the ri overcome a limit value 3 cm in the present experiments the contribution of the first reactor to the overall process may be reduced due to a too short residence time of the solution on the disk surface notwithstanding the local ε values near the edge of the disk surface were larger in comparison with those calculated for lower ri values thus in this work the optimal ri value was assumed to be equal to 2 5 cm regarding the influence of q fig 5b it can be observed that as well as for ri an initial process efficiency increase has been observed when q was increased from 100 to 250 ml min whereas an additional increase of this parameter led to a partial reduction of the process efficiency in comparison with the influence of ri on nitrate removal efficiency and kinetics the influence of q appeared to be not substantial however when q is increased the residence time in the stirred tank decreased from 2 5 min down to 0 625 min increasing q from 100 up to 400 ml min as well as the residence time on the disk surface in this work the optimal q value was found to be equal to 250 ml min at the end of each run the ph of the treated solution was measured and in all cases the final value was larger with respect to the initial ph 6 8 in particular the measured ph laid in the range 8 6 8 8 as reported also in other studies 27 46 in literature a number of studies reported experimental data of nitrate removal by nzvi in mechanically or magnetically stirred batch reactor one of the more comprehensive work has been performed by hwang and co authors 9 those authors reported a complete nitrate removal in 60 min by using a mechanical stirred tank reactor and adopting a fe 0 no3 molar ratio equal to about 14 i e more than 3 fold larger in comparison with that adopted in the present study initial nitrate concentration of 100 mg l and fe 0 particles mean size of 17 nm conversely other authors 47 reported a maximum removal efficiency of 60 after 90 min adopting a fe 0 no3 molar ratio equal to about 4 5 initial nitrate concentration of 177 mg l in a reciprocal shaker water bath at 200 rpm faster kinetics has been observed by khalil and co authors 48 that reported a nitrate removal efficiency of 90 in 30 min adopting a fe 0 no3 molar ratio equal to about 22 initial nitrate concentration of 100 mg l therefore comparing the results obtained in the present study with those reported in literature it can be highlighted that the use of sdr effectively allowed an intensification of the denitrification process thus leading to large removal efficiency higher than 90 at a shorter contact time about 30 min and without the need of a substantial increase of fe 0 no3 molar ratio 3 2 cfd modelling and data interpretation a deeper discussion of the obtained results can be made once the experimental data have been interpreted in light of the different fluid dynamic conditions established in the sdr when important parameters ω ri and q were varied as regard the hydrodynamics of the film fig 6 displays the re and e numbers variation along the radial coordinate on the disk the re value rapidly increased from 10 000 rm 2 5 cm up to 40 000 near the disk edge implying that the flow was mainly in transient conditions the e number has been calculated using the values of δ estimated by cfd model as reported in fig 8 the e number was always higher than 2 regardless the q value the lower value was about 10 at injection point for q 400 ml min thus indicating that the inertial forces were not significant for the generation of the liquid film and therefore they could be neglected in the fluid dynamic modelling fluid dynamic simulations were used to estimate the film thickness on the disk surface and evaluate the influence of the operative parameters in fig 7 a picture of the disk filled with the water phase for an injection point of 2 5 cm has been reported in the fig 7a the injection point is clearly visible the film thickness profiles are shown in figs 8 and 9 as expected the film height at the injection point decreased as the distance between the disk centre and the feeding location increased since the coriolis forces are higher as the disk radius raises furthermore the thickness of the liquid film decreased from the disk centre to the edge due to higher centrifugal forces the film thickness was always of 12 μm at the disk periphery the very thin liquid film generated onto the rotating surface guaranteed the maximization of external mass transfer processes leading to the intensification of the denitrification process as previously discussed it can be also noticed that for a lower distance of the feeding point from the disk centre the minimum film height was reached for lower radius values meaning that the mass transfer are more favourite as confirmed by experimental data for which the best performances were reached for an injection point of 2 5 cm the thickness trends along disk radius were quite similar and showed a decrease at increasing r considering the higher centrifugal forces as already observed both experimentally and in other studies 44 49 50 the thickness of the liquid film decreased from the disk centre to the edge due to the higher centrifugal forces that also increased with a q increase results show that the thickness trend slightly changed when the flowrate was larger than 100 ml min probably due to larger volume of liquid injected onto the disk surface from the results obtained by the cfd simulations the dispersed energy power on the disk surface ε was calculated according to the equation 13 ԑ 1 2 t r e s r e 2 ω 2 v r e 2 r i 2 ω 2 v r i 2 where vr was the radial velocity and tres was the residence time calculated as 14 t r e s 2 r e r i v r e v r i as regard the average radial velocity trends a particular trend can be observed in fig 10 the reported trend s shapes are very similar to those showed in a previous work where a deep investigation on the fluid dynamic of rotating disk has been reported using the pigford model 51 according to the authors three different zones can be individuated from the radial velocity trend injection zone acceleration zone and synchronized zone the local minimum observed in fig 10 delimitates the injection zone from the acceleration one whereas the synchronized zone begins after the subsequent local maximum the synchronization among liquid film velocity field and rotating surface velocity field occurred after the local maximum the zone of transition among acceleration and synchronization ones has been named zone of spin up and according to burns and co authors 51 the distance from the disk centre where the spin up zone appears rs m can be calculated by the following equation d m is the diameter of fluid injection tube λ q 2 ων 1 4 and k2 is from 51 15 r s 0 88 λ d 2 λ 0 025 k 2 0 37 that yields to values of 0 03 0 033 and 0 038 m that were in agreement with the local minimum observed in fig 10 the dispersed energy power represents the energy transferred to the fluid by the disc in fig 11 the values are reported as a function of the feeding point distance the energy values increase for higher distance of the feeding point whereas the residence time decrease as a consequence the optimal value of these two variables should be found from experimental results theoretically the feeding point should be placed as far as possible from the disk center such to allow a suitable residence time to complete the ongoing processes increasing ri allows an increase of ε and this usually leads to a reduction of the size of the produced nanoparticles in the reported case the denitrification process reached the maximum removal efficiency for ri 2 5 3 cm but not at the maximum ri value as previously discussed a possible explanation of this behaviour could be the substantial decrease of residence time value that reached values lower than 0 2 s at the higher ri fig 12 a thus resulting too short to promote the denitrification reaction analogous consideration can be made regarding the influence of q on the denitrification process performances as reported previously the maximum nitrate removal efficiency was reached for q 250 ml min and not for the maximum q value of 400 ml min as expected as reported in figs 12b and 12c although a q value increase the relevant ε value at maximum q value the residence time on the disk was again lower than 0 2 s finally another important consideration can be made considering the mixing time calculated basing on the ε values reported in fig 13 as expected an increase of q induced a decrease of the mixing time and the correlation can be observed in fig 13b according to the values reported in fig 13b in all cases the mixing time reached the order of magnitude of 1 ms that according to previous studies represents the typical value required for a very homogeneous and intensive mixing at molecular scale micromixing conditions 32 basing on power law used to fit ε q and tmix q trends the following relation among tmix and ε can be calculated tmix ε 0 514 that is very similar to those reported in literature 52 3 3 kinetic data modelling once the optimal operating parameter values have been assessed the kinetic of the process was studied at different fe 0 no3 molar ratio and modelled according to the kinetic model reported in paragraph 2 4 fig 14 an increase of the fe 0 no3 molar ratio led to a negligible increase of the process efficiency probably since the maximum nitrate conversion can be reached only in the presence of a large excess of nanoparticles only an increase of the fe 0 no3 molar ratio up to 8 ensured a total nitrate removal in 60 min however based on the results obtained in this work a good compromise among costs and process efficiency can be found at fe 0 no3 4 where a nitrate removal efficiency of about 90 was achieved regarding the kinetic parameters obtained by data modelling the three data set have been employed in a multiple non linear data regression and the following parameter values were estimated k1 1 29 10 8 1 s k2 2 18 m3 n 1 mol1 n s and n 3 as expected the apparent order of the reaction kinetics on the rotating disk surface was substantially larger with respect to that reported in a number of studies for a common str 33 36 45 53 56 4 conclusions this study reports about the intensification of nano fe 0 induced denitrification by means of a spinning disk reactor the experimental runs conducted allowed to found the optimal operating parameter values i e disk rotational velocity 147 rad s distance among injection point and disk centre 2 5 cm inlet

14076,the aim of this work was to investigate the performances of a spinning disk reactor for the removal of nitrate from aqueous solutions by using iron nanoparticles as reducing agent the influence of three operating parameters i e rotational velocity feed injection point position and recirculation flow rate was investigated through evaluating the nitrate reduction efficiency and kinetics increasing the rotational velocity led to a better nitrate reduction efficiency and faster kinetics the optimal rotational velocity was 147 rad s whereas the optimal feed injection point distance from disk centre and recirculation flow rate were 3 cm and 250 ml min respectively the data were compared with those reported in literature and obtained by classical batch reactor and clearly demonstrated the better performances obtained by this intensified equipment finally a mass transfer based kinetic model was proposed and a computational fluid dynamic model was implemented to simulate the fluid dynamics of the rotating liquid film keywords nitrate process intensification nzvi cfd sdr 1 introduction nitrate is often present in wastewater and groundwater 1 3 it is considered relatively non toxic however in reducing environments nitrate anion tends to transform in nitrite species that are considered toxic for every organism 4 5 nitrates enter water bodies such as lakes or rivers due to the uncontrolled discharge of animal manures wastewaters 6 such as tannery effluents and due to the intensified use of fertilizers in agriculture 7 the most dangerous consequence of nitrate pollution in water bodies is the eutrophication process causing the uncontrolled algal biomass growth and related issues oxygen levels depletion aquatic organism death etc 8 9 regarding the effect of ingesting high level of nitrate from drinking water the possible consequences can be liver damages methemoglobinemia and cancer mainly due to the generation of nitrites from nitrate reduction in reducing environment such as the human stomach 10 various technologies have been proposed for the removal of nitrates from aqueous media such as membrane treatment 11 sorption onto biomass or synthetic adsorbent 12 13 biological and chemical denitrification 4 14 17 between these processes chemical denitrification represents the most effective since allows to transform nitrates species in ammonium or nitrogen that can be recovered stripped in atmosphere leading to the complete removal of n compounds from the treated medium 18 19 in this context zero valent iron nanoparticles nzvi have been already demonstrated their efficiency and fast kinetics in the removal of different contaminants 20 22 and in the nitrate conversion to nitrogen and ammonia as well reported in literature 23 24 the main disadvantages of this technology are the necessity of an inert atmosphere during the treatment 22 25 and the requirement of very high fe 0 no3 mol mol ratio to obtain removal efficiencies larger than 80 in some hours of treatment 26 27 the main mechanisms occurring during nitrate removal by nzvi are 28 indirect nitrate reduction due to the production of hydrogen in liquid bulk because of the oxidation of iron nanoparticles in the presence of hydrogen protons direct nitrate reduction onto the nzvi surface carried out by the electron transfer from fe 0 core to the sorbed nitrate species on the nanoparticle s surface in both cases the mixing intensity in the vessel used for the treatment plays a fundamental role for the enhancement of both mass transfer and apparent kinetics to intensify the chemical denitrification process induced by nzvi two main ways can be followed varying the operating parameter values such as temperature or nzvi nitrate molar ratio or using different equipment with respect to classical stirred tank reactors in particular spinning disk reactor sdr has already demonstrated its effectiveness in wastewater treatment processes 29 it has been mainly used to overcome the mass transfer limitations that characterized photocatalysis processes when adopted in large scale equipment 30 process intensification techniques aim at minimizing plant size of continuous high yield equipment capable to produce specific sized high quality nanoparticles combined with an increase in energy efficiency safety and cost reduction 31 in particular the sdr consists of a rotating disk with a jet of one two or more liquid feeds impinging onto the top surface of the disk creating a thin and highly sheared film due to the high centrifugal forces leading to very rapid mixing and short residence time 32 34 the uniform and rapid micromixing environment generation on the rotating disk represents the main advantage offered by sdr in mass transfer based processes such as wastewater treatment as well reported by various authors 35 38 in the present work a spinning disk reactor was used to intensify the chemical denitrification by nzvi various operating parameters have been investigated to optimize the process and the analogy between plug flow reactor pfr and sdr flow has been adopted for the kinetic modelling of the obtained results the data were interpreted through a mass transfer model coupled with a fluid dynamic model built in ansys fluent environment for the estimation of both radial velocity fields and water residence time onto the rotating disk surface 2 experimental 2 1 materials and equipment all the reagents were purchased from sigma aldrich milan and were of analytical grade the solutions were prepared with deionized water in detail the following reagents were used nabh4 feso4 7h2o cmc 20 000 g mol and nano3 the equipment used in this work is schematized in fig 1 the sdr was composed of a static external cylinder and an inner rotating disc of teflon radius rd of 4 25 cm where reaction took place the feed streams temperature was kept constant at 25 c through a water bath the iron nanoparticles synthetized according to a previous work 39 had a mean size of 28 nm the nitrate solution was fed onto the disk surface for the initial mixing the outlet was linked to a stirred tank str 250 ml of volume from which a peristaltic pump recirculated the mixed solution onto the rotating disk surface the feed injection point distance from the disk centre ri could be varied the rotational velocity of the disk could be increased up to 147 rad s and the intern diameter of feed streamlines was 1 mm 2 2 experimental procedure the experiments were conducted in batch mode the same solution 250 ml was treated and recirculated on the rotating disk surface up to the end of the reaction 1 3 f e 0 n o 3 3 h 2 o f e 3 o 4 n h 4 2 o h from which a stoichiometric fe 0 no3 molar ratio equal to 3 can be deduced 50 ml of nanoparticle solution was initially mixed with 200 ml of a 150 mg l nitrate solution to achieve an initial nitrate concentration of 120 mg l the inlet flowrate of 50 ml fe 0 solution was fixed at 100 ml min whereas the flowrate of nitrate solution was 400 ml min each run started after mixing the two solutions 36 runs were performed at different recirculation flow rate q 100 250 and 400 ml min ri 2 2 5 3 and 3 5 cm while the rotational disk velocity ω varied as 53 105 and 147 rad s in all the tests the fe 0 no3 was set at 3 5 mol mol slightly larger than the stoichiometric ratio to take into account the initial oxidation of the nzvi once all the optimal operating parameter values were assessed additional 3 runs were conducted at different fe 0 no3 ratios 4 4 5 and 5 mol mol the temperature of the solution was kept constant at 25 c using a water bath and process kinetic was investigated collecting every 5 min 2 ml samples from the sampling point shown in fig 1 until an asymptote for nitrate removal efficiency was observed the liquid sample was filtered by a 220 nm syringe filter and the residual nitrate concentration was measured by ionic chromatography dionex ics 1100 the final ph of the solution was also measured by a crison 421 ph meter whereas the initial ph of the solution was 6 8 before sending to the rotating disk the nitrate solution was de oxygenated for 4 h at 50 c under ar atmosphere all the runs were conducted without the use of inert atmosphere considering that according to preliminary results under inert atmosphere no significant variation in process performances have been observed the storage tank was mechanically stirred with a paddle impeller at the maximum rotational velocity of 105 rad s all the runs were conducted in duplicate the mean values of the measured nitrate concentrations were reported the standard deviation in all the tests was 3 8 2 3 fluid dynamic modelling the experimental results were interpreted according to three fluid dynamic models the flow regime was predicted basing on the reynolds rotational number defined as follows 40 2 r e ω r 2 ν where ω in this equation expressed in 1 s in the following it will be reported as rpm or rad s is the rotational velocity of the disk ν m2 s is the fluid kinematic viscosity and r m is the radius at the measurement point on the disc according to a number of experiments reported in a previous work 40 the flow on a free rotating disk can be considered laminar for re numbers lower than 104 since in the range 104 105 the flow instabilities become significant and the flow can be considered in transition to turbulent conditions fully established for re number larger than 105 another useful dimensionless number for the investigation of fluid dynamics on rotating disk is the ekman number e ν δ 2 ω defined as the ratio between the inertial and viscous contributions referred to the flow of a fluid on the spinning disc usually e dimensionless number value can be calculated to assess the occurrence of rotational synchronized conditions when e 2 the inertial contributions have a considerable contributions and simplified model such as nusselt and related ones cannot be adopted for the interpretation of fluid dynamics of rotating liquid film in those cases more reliable model or directly cfd computational fluid dynamics instruments should be considered the rate of mixing heat and mass transfer in the fluid is affected by the type of flow prevailing on a rotating disc surface under given conditions of flowrate and rotational speed the fluid dynamics of a rotating liquid film can be described by the classical navier stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates r θ z obtaining a very complex differential equations system in the following paragraph the cfd modelling in ansys fluent environment is reported and discussed 2 3 1 computational fluid dynamic cfd model in ansys fluent environment the average film thickness was evaluated using cfd simulations performed with the software ansys fluent 17 0 the geometry reported in fig 2 was built with gambit the mesh details are reported by de caprariis and co workers 41 the simulations were performed using a multiphase model in order to reproduce the interphase between the air and the liquid phase the volume of fluid vof model was adopted since it is the most suitable to tack the interphase the vof considers that in each cell one of the two phases is present or at the interphase a mixture of the two the continuity equation when the vof is used becomes 3 δ α q δ t v α q 0 where α q is the mass fraction that must satisfy the mass conservation law i 1 n α q i 0 and v is the velocity given by the momentum equation 4 t ρ v ρ v v p μ v v t ρ g f where f represents the external body forces for this system mainly coriolis forces in such equation the fluid density and viscosity are calculated as the volume mean value for each phase 5 ρ i 1 n α q i ρ q i 6 μ i 1 n α q i μ q i the turbulence was modeled with the traditional k ε model the resolution methods are reported in table 1 the simulations were performed with a rotating disk velocity of 150 rad s and the influence of the distance between the disk center and the feed injection point was evaluated varying this distance between 2 cm 3 5 cm these simulations were conducted with a flow rate of 250 ml min then two further simulations at a feed injection point of 2 5 cm were made for 100 ml min and 400 ml min since in the experimental tests the injected solutions were composed by the reagents diluted in water for the fluid dynamic analysis the fed liquid phase was considered as water finally the mixing time was calculated as 41 7 t m i x 12 υ ε 0 5 2 4 kinetic modelling the analogy between plug flow reactor pfr and sdr has been proposed by various authors 42 43 at high rotational velocity values 1000 rpm low viscosities close to that of water and high inlet flowrates the bulk flow behaviour of sdr and pfr were proved to be very close 44 45 assuming pfr flow conditions the kinetic modelling of the denitrification process can be simplified and therefore the mass balance in the storage tank ideally modelled as a continuous stirred tank reactor and the mass balance on the rotating disk can be written as follows fig 3 8 d n t d t q v n 0 n r r 1 9 d n r d r 2 π r q δ r r 2 where v m3 is the stirred tank volume n mol m3 is the nitrate concentration n0 mol m3 is the initial nitrate concentration and r1 mol s and r2 mol m3 s are the reaction rates the values of δ were from cfd simulations whereas the reaction rates can be expressed as apparent first order kinetic and apparent nth order kinetic for str and sdr respectively yielding to 10 d n t d t q v n 0 n r k 1 n t 11 d n r d r 2 π r q δ r k 2 n r n where k1 1 s is the pseudo first order kinetic constant k2 m3 n 1 mol1 n s is the pseudo nth order kinetic constant per unit of volume and n is the reaction order the system of eq 10 and 11 was iteratively solved according to the following initial and boundary conditions 12 n t n 0 t 0 n r n f e e d s d r r r i n r n o u t s d r r r d the kinetic data modelling was carried out in gproms environment ver 4 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 the influence of operating parameters on nzvi induced denitrification fig 4 shows the results of the first experimental runs at fixed ri 2 cm at the different tested flowrates as expected increasing the rotational velocity of the disk led to an increase of the process efficiency since the ε and mixing intensity resulted enhanced leading to a larger energy amount dispersed on the rotating disk surface an asymptotic nitrate removal efficiency was reached within 35 45 min depending on the rotational velocity of the disk in detail for ω 53 rad s the maximum nitrate removal efficiency at 45 min was 69 whereas for ω 105 and 147 rad s the process efficiency raised up to 76 and 82 respectively reached at 40 and 35 min the influence of q on the nitrate removal efficiency was initially negligible the process efficiency only increased of about 3 from 100 to 250 ml min whereas a worsening was observed at larger q at 400 ml min the process efficiency decreased of about 7 8 when ω remain was 105 and 147 rad s whereas the decrease at 53 rad s was negligible fig 5 displays the results of the others experimental runs at different ri q and ω to simplify the data illustration only the complete kinetics of six runs were reported the variation of ri led to a shape modification and initially to an increase in nitrate removal efficiency in detail the asymptotic nitrate removal efficiency passed from 82 3 at ri 2 cm to 85 at ri 2 5 cm whereas an additional increase of ri caused a worsening of the final efficiency that dropped to 78 for ri 3 5 cm this behaviour can be probably attributed to the decrease of tres on the disk surface caused by the increase of ri that initially led to an improvement of the process efficiency mainly due to the increase of ε and mixing intensity on the other hand this enhancement became not appreciable when ri reached 3 or 3 5 cm because of the substantial reduction of the residence time on the disk surface in particular since the reaction occurred both on rotating disk surface and in the stirred tank reactor when the ri overcome a limit value 3 cm in the present experiments the contribution of the first reactor to the overall process may be reduced due to a too short residence time of the solution on the disk surface notwithstanding the local ε values near the edge of the disk surface were larger in comparison with those calculated for lower ri values thus in this work the optimal ri value was assumed to be equal to 2 5 cm regarding the influence of q fig 5b it can be observed that as well as for ri an initial process efficiency increase has been observed when q was increased from 100 to 250 ml min whereas an additional increase of this parameter led to a partial reduction of the process efficiency in comparison with the influence of ri on nitrate removal efficiency and kinetics the influence of q appeared to be not substantial however when q is increased the residence time in the stirred tank decreased from 2 5 min down to 0 625 min increasing q from 100 up to 400 ml min as well as the residence time on the disk surface in this work the optimal q value was found to be equal to 250 ml min at the end of each run the ph of the treated solution was measured and in all cases the final value was larger with respect to the initial ph 6 8 in particular the measured ph laid in the range 8 6 8 8 as reported also in other studies 27 46 in literature a number of studies reported experimental data of nitrate removal by nzvi in mechanically or magnetically stirred batch reactor one of the more comprehensive work has been performed by hwang and co authors 9 those authors reported a complete nitrate removal in 60 min by using a mechanical stirred tank reactor and adopting a fe 0 no3 molar ratio equal to about 14 i e more than 3 fold larger in comparison with that adopted in the present study initial nitrate concentration of 100 mg l and fe 0 particles mean size of 17 nm conversely other authors 47 reported a maximum removal efficiency of 60 after 90 min adopting a fe 0 no3 molar ratio equal to about 4 5 initial nitrate concentration of 177 mg l in a reciprocal shaker water bath at 200 rpm faster kinetics has been observed by khalil and co authors 48 that reported a nitrate removal efficiency of 90 in 30 min adopting a fe 0 no3 molar ratio equal to about 22 initial nitrate concentration of 100 mg l therefore comparing the results obtained in the present study with those reported in literature it can be highlighted that the use of sdr effectively allowed an intensification of the denitrification process thus leading to large removal efficiency higher than 90 at a shorter contact time about 30 min and without the need of a substantial increase of fe 0 no3 molar ratio 3 2 cfd modelling and data interpretation a deeper discussion of the obtained results can be made once the experimental data have been interpreted in light of the different fluid dynamic conditions established in the sdr when important parameters ω ri and q were varied as regard the hydrodynamics of the film fig 6 displays the re and e numbers variation along the radial coordinate on the disk the re value rapidly increased from 10 000 rm 2 5 cm up to 40 000 near the disk edge implying that the flow was mainly in transient conditions the e number has been calculated using the values of δ estimated by cfd model as reported in fig 8 the e number was always higher than 2 regardless the q value the lower value was about 10 at injection point for q 400 ml min thus indicating that the inertial forces were not significant for the generation of the liquid film and therefore they could be neglected in the fluid dynamic modelling fluid dynamic simulations were used to estimate the film thickness on the disk surface and evaluate the influence of the operative parameters in fig 7 a picture of the disk filled with the water phase for an injection point of 2 5 cm has been reported in the fig 7a the injection point is clearly visible the film thickness profiles are shown in figs 8 and 9 as expected the film height at the injection point decreased as the distance between the disk centre and the feeding location increased since the coriolis forces are higher as the disk radius raises furthermore the thickness of the liquid film decreased from the disk centre to the edge due to higher centrifugal forces the film thickness was always of 12 μm at the disk periphery the very thin liquid film generated onto the rotating surface guaranteed the maximization of external mass transfer processes leading to the intensification of the denitrification process as previously discussed it can be also noticed that for a lower distance of the feeding point from the disk centre the minimum film height was reached for lower radius values meaning that the mass transfer are more favourite as confirmed by experimental data for which the best performances were reached for an injection point of 2 5 cm the thickness trends along disk radius were quite similar and showed a decrease at increasing r considering the higher centrifugal forces as already observed both experimentally and in other studies 44 49 50 the thickness of the liquid film decreased from the disk centre to the edge due to the higher centrifugal forces that also increased with a q increase results show that the thickness trend slightly changed when the flowrate was larger than 100 ml min probably due to larger volume of liquid injected onto the disk surface from the results obtained by the cfd simulations the dispersed energy power on the disk surface ε was calculated according to the equation 13 ԑ 1 2 t r e s r e 2 ω 2 v r e 2 r i 2 ω 2 v r i 2 where vr was the radial velocity and tres was the residence time calculated as 14 t r e s 2 r e r i v r e v r i as regard the average radial velocity trends a particular trend can be observed in fig 10 the reported trend s shapes are very similar to those showed in a previous work where a deep investigation on the fluid dynamic of rotating disk has been reported using the pigford model 51 according to the authors three different zones can be individuated from the radial velocity trend injection zone acceleration zone and synchronized zone the local minimum observed in fig 10 delimitates the injection zone from the acceleration one whereas the synchronized zone begins after the subsequent local maximum the synchronization among liquid film velocity field and rotating surface velocity field occurred after the local maximum the zone of transition among acceleration and synchronization ones has been named zone of spin up and according to burns and co authors 51 the distance from the disk centre where the spin up zone appears rs m can be calculated by the following equation d m is the diameter of fluid injection tube λ q 2 ων 1 4 and k2 is from 51 15 r s 0 88 λ d 2 λ 0 025 k 2 0 37 that yields to values of 0 03 0 033 and 0 038 m that were in agreement with the local minimum observed in fig 10 the dispersed energy power represents the energy transferred to the fluid by the disc in fig 11 the values are reported as a function of the feeding point distance the energy values increase for higher distance of the feeding point whereas the residence time decrease as a consequence the optimal value of these two variables should be found from experimental results theoretically the feeding point should be placed as far as possible from the disk center such to allow a suitable residence time to complete the ongoing processes increasing ri allows an increase of ε and this usually leads to a reduction of the size of the produced nanoparticles in the reported case the denitrification process reached the maximum removal efficiency for ri 2 5 3 cm but not at the maximum ri value as previously discussed a possible explanation of this behaviour could be the substantial decrease of residence time value that reached values lower than 0 2 s at the higher ri fig 12 a thus resulting too short to promote the denitrification reaction analogous consideration can be made regarding the influence of q on the denitrification process performances as reported previously the maximum nitrate removal efficiency was reached for q 250 ml min and not for the maximum q value of 400 ml min as expected as reported in figs 12b and 12c although a q value increase the relevant ε value at maximum q value the residence time on the disk was again lower than 0 2 s finally another important consideration can be made considering the mixing time calculated basing on the ε values reported in fig 13 as expected an increase of q induced a decrease of the mixing time and the correlation can be observed in fig 13b according to the values reported in fig 13b in all cases the mixing time reached the order of magnitude of 1 ms that according to previous studies represents the typical value required for a very homogeneous and intensive mixing at molecular scale micromixing conditions 32 basing on power law used to fit ε q and tmix q trends the following relation among tmix and ε can be calculated tmix ε 0 514 that is very similar to those reported in literature 52 3 3 kinetic data modelling once the optimal operating parameter values have been assessed the kinetic of the process was studied at different fe 0 no3 molar ratio and modelled according to the kinetic model reported in paragraph 2 4 fig 14 an increase of the fe 0 no3 molar ratio led to a negligible increase of the process efficiency probably since the maximum nitrate conversion can be reached only in the presence of a large excess of nanoparticles only an increase of the fe 0 no3 molar ratio up to 8 ensured a total nitrate removal in 60 min however based on the results obtained in this work a good compromise among costs and process efficiency can be found at fe 0 no3 4 where a nitrate removal efficiency of about 90 was achieved regarding the kinetic parameters obtained by data modelling the three data set have been employed in a multiple non linear data regression and the following parameter values were estimated k1 1 29 10 8 1 s k2 2 18 m3 n 1 mol1 n s and n 3 as expected the apparent order of the reaction kinetics on the rotating disk surface was substantially larger with respect to that reported in a number of studies for a common str 33 36 45 53 56 4 conclusions this study reports about the intensification of nano fe 0 induced denitrification by means of a spinning

the kinetic of the denitrification process was also studied using a simplified kinetic model based on a 2 steps process in batch a maximum nitrate removal efficiency of about 90 in less than 30 min has been achieved adopting the optimal operating parameter values clearly demonstrating the suitability of the spinning disk reactor technology to be used also in environmental chemical processes

degradation for mb dye while 80 50 and 69 degradation was observed for mo dye within total time of 180 min effect of various operational parameters such as catalyst loading ph and various scavengers was evaluated in detail morever in situ investigations were also carried out in order to determine the active species and hence the mechanism for catalytic reactions these results for dye detoxification and corresponding reaction mechanism suggested the synthesized metal oxides as promising candidates for real toxic water wastes cleanup applications keywords metal oxides photocatalysts solar light methylene blue methyl orange 1 introduction most of the organic dyes used in industry such as textile paper paint and bio medical are non biodegradable these dyes have created many negative consequences and are thus categorized as a serious issue for environment these dyes are highly toxic and cause various human health problems such as heavy perspiration cerebral misperception and methemoglobinemia 1 2 adverse and long lasting effects are being recognized upon ecological systems it is estimated that dyeing process utilizes only 10 of total dyestuff and rest of the amount being released into water reservoirs these hazardous dyes form a foam layer on water surface thus decreasing supply of oxygen to aquatic life for both flora and fauna industries such as metal plating ammunition and battery manufacturing release lead and heavy metals which enter into body through food chain causing adverse effects on human health special attention must be paid in order to remove these hazardous dyestuff from waste water keeping in view their toxicity non biodegradable nature and slow decolorating rate 3 5 there are two main types of dyes cationic and anionic anionic dyes are water soluble and cause a bright color removal of such dyes is thus difficult the common forms of cationic dyes are azo methane phthalocyanine anthraquinone polycarbocyclic while anionic dyes are acid dyes which are typically applied to a textile at low ph values 6 10 mb and mo are the most common contaminants affecting both water quality and human health mb is a cationic dye highly toxic to environment causing various health issues like eye infection breathing complications worming abundant sweating mental weaknesses and blood disorders 11 13 mo is a hazardous azodye which has also been documented as mutagenic or cytotoxic 14 19 various techniques such as adsorption coagulation precipitation and photocatalytic oxidation have been adopted for remediation of contaminated water 20 25 photocatalytic technique can be utilized as an excellent strategy for waste water treatment in photocatalysis organic elements of the dyes are disintegrated into safe and harmless constituents i e co2 h2o and mineral ions 20 nanotechnology involving nanosize particles ranged from 1 100 nm is believed to be a major development in 21st century demonstrating high photocatalytic efficiency 26 28 semiconducting nanomaterials are emerged as a popular class to function as photocatalysts due to their diverse composition morphology size and structure they have been fabricated through simple synthetic procedures with attractive optical properties 29 30 however these photocatalysts have the ability to absorb only uv radiation due to their large band gap energies moreover low quantum yield has greatly affected photo degradation efficiency of semiconducting nanocatalysts 31 33 therefore visible light active catalysts have been developed through different strategies for clean environment and energy applications addition of transition rare earth metals non metal ions fabrication of composite photocatalysts with single and heterogeneous metal oxides can be validated for exclusive properties with maximum yield product under easy and mild conditions recombination between charge carriers within a composite material can be greatly suppressed by adjusting charge transfer mechanism between various constituents metal nanostructures are favored for the fixation of organic dyes not only because of their efficient performance but also due to low cost and non toxic final products which are easily degradable catalytic performance of transition metals has been enhanced by doping with other elements 34 ru doped co3o4 significantly improved number of surface oxygen species acting towards a higher hydro thermal stability and catalytic activity absorption of surface oxygen and electron density is highly promoted by adding k and cs to co al catalyst smaller particle size and increased surface area is reported in a similar study for sno2 co3o4 and mgxceyco1 x yco2o4 catalysts in mixed metal oxides cations provide best support for catalytic activity stress and defects with increased chemical activity are induced into host lattice of mixed metal oxides by adding various dopants increased photocatalytic activity with efficient separation of charge carriers is reported for tio2 cdo decorated with pd similarly ce and cu doping has induced a rapid degradation of mo with enhanced efficiency for zno al2o3 nanocomposites materials among various transition metals cu nanoparticles pure as well as doped are greatly contributing towards various valuable applications at relatively low cost when compared to expensive noble metals such as pt ag and au 35 38 nanocomposites such as cuo zno and zno nio have been reported for novel technological applications as compared to single oxides various protecting elements i e polymers and organic ligands have been employed to prevent the aggregation of cu nanoparticles 39 but most of the active sites within these nanoparticles are blocked by heavy polymers acting as protecting agents and hence restricting their efficient implementation as heterogeneous catalysts 40 41 several studies have been conducted to propose some reductant and antioxidants for protecting the cu nanoparticles similarly partial substitution of sr into copper oxide composites has offered a wide range of promising opportunities to optimize and enhance the catalytic performance faster degradation 60 min for orange 8 is obtained by using srfeo3 compounds after replacing ba by sr 42 cdo of nano scale size has been found to degrade various organic dyes quite effectively due to its thermal stability high carrier mobility and favorable visible light adsorption 43 however cdo has a limited degradation efficiency due to lower band gap and rapid recombination of charge carriers additionally release of toxic cd ions is a critical issue which cannot be overlooked in practical applications previous studies have shown that these problems could be solved either by preparing cdo through green synthesis routes 44 45 or by addition of non toxic metal oxides 46 47 therfore these strategies are adopted here to remove the toxicity of cdo various synthesis routes have been adopted for the preparation of nanoparticles including thermal decomposition sol gel co precipitation and aqueous chemical reduction the method being usually favoured has to be simple cost effective and efficient in many aspects size microstructure surface area and uniformity of nanoparticles can be effectively controlled through various processing conditions such as precursors time temperature and reducing agent 48 52 the most effective and result oriented methods for the fixation and detoxification of toxic dyes organic compounds and heavy metals consist in advanced oxidation processes aops during photocatalysis in photocatalytic reactions light of suitable frequency strikes the surface of photocatalysts which excite negative charge carriers between valance band and conduction band this excitation creates an electron hole e h pair which leads to redox reactions photocatalytic reaction produces highly reactive radicals oh produced from oh anions and o2 radicals by reduction of o2 which can cause degradation of toxic pollutants 53 in this current work we have developed several catalysts with great efficiency in solar light for degradation of toxic dyes this work has been carried out to adopt a mild low cost and an effective method to fabricate stable and oxidation resistant nanomaterials with small and uniform size distribution in aqueous solution cu sr and cd based metal oxides were synthesized and validated for catalytic treatment of some of the commonly used toxic organic dyes in textile industry such as mb and mo these photocatalysts have been selected due to their interesting

in fig 1b bands associated with 3375 3475 cm 1 and 1643 cm 1 were ascribed to oh stretching and oh bending vibrations respectively due to presence of water vapor 42 47 bands in range from 1340 1400 cm

oxides were determined by tg analysis initial weight loss was started from room temperature up to 250 c attributed towards the loss of moisture and various volatile contents as explained in fig 1 c e 52 highest mass loss of 21 17 was found in cd cu metal oxides displaying lower stability when compared to cu sr and sr cd metal oxides weight loss in corresponding oxides is helpful in calculating the real content as 90 61 95 30 and 78 83 for cu sr sr cd and cd cu metal oxides respectively sr cd metal oxides were found to be the most stable ones with the lowest mass loss of 4 70 3 2 xps analysis xps was subsequently used to investigate the chemical state and elemental composition of as synthesized metal oxides 47 as shown in fig 2 a peaks for cu2p sr3d cd3d and o1s indicated the co existence of constituent elements within fabricated catalysts low resolution scans with 1 ev of step energy were collected for each characterization over total energy range of 0 1361 ev while detailed spectra collected are summarized as in table 1 cu sr metal oxides revealed four peaks for cu2p at 962 18 ev s1 to 2p1 2 or s2 to 2p1 2 954 17 ev cuo 2p1 2 943 12 ev s1 to 2p3 2 cuo or s2 to 2p3 2 cuo and 935 24 933 35 ev cu 2p3 2 or cuo2 2p3 2 revealing the presence of either cuo or cuo2 or both 64 65 similarly cd cu metal oxides had six distinct peaks for cu2p as s1 to 2p1 2 s2 to 2p1 2 cu 2p3 2 and cuo 2p3 2 at binding energies 963 73 955 50 945 08 942 83 and 935 47 ev respectively 49 as explained in fig 2 b and g sr3d doublets 3d3 2 and 3d5 2 were detected for cu sr and sr cd metal oxides as shown in fig 2 c and d main peaks were found at 135 64 and 133 87 ev for cu sr metal oxides first doublet could be due to sr o at surface whereas second doublet showed presence of sr2 second doublet is caused by desorption of carbon srco3 from surface due to increased sensitivity of xps equipment some sr2 was initially expected but that probably overlapped with c1s region 27 in sr cd metal oxides sr3d3 2 and sr3d5 2 peaks were shifted from 135 64 133 87 ev towards 135 62 133 84 ev respectively cd3d peaks had well separated spin orbit components and were recorded at 411 83 ev 3d3 2 and 405 06 ev 3d5 2 within sr cd metal oxides but for cd cu metal oxides peaks were shifted to 411 96 ev 3d3 2 and 405 16 ev 3d5 2 respectively as shown in fig 2d previously similar results were concluded for binding energy of cd 3d to the cd2 bonding state 28 30 high resolution spectrum for oxygen contained one component at 532 09 ev for cu sr metal oxides one component at 532 45 ev for sr cd oxides while two peaks were found in cd cu metal oxides at 531 63 and 530 17 ev as shown in fig 2 h j peaks at low binding energies could be assigned to o but higher energy peaks revealed presence of co3 at the surface highest peak at 532 45 ev could be associated with adsorbed oxygen species 24 3 3 sem analysis sem images suggested that all the metal oxides were grown in aggregates of small particles particle morphology and shapes are shown by low and high resolution images in figs 3 a f nanomaterials in diameter range of 44 97 52 26 and 87 9 8 nm were observed for cu sr sr cd and cd cu metal oxides respectively 3 4 drs and bet studies the in resonance effect of light and prevention to electron hole carriers may be attributed to effective photocatalytic activity of various nanomaterials a proper band gap is necessary for generation of free radicals energy difference between highest occupied and lowest un occupied orbitals was measured by solid state drs calculated band gap energies were 1 57 1 64 and 1 61 ev for cu sr sr cd and cd cu metal oxides respectively as shown in fig 4 a c band gap variations were attributed towards structural transitions by mixing various metals together band gap can be decreased inside transition metals due to p d spin exchange interactions between band electrons and localized d electrons 42 43 another reason for decreased band gap is due to strong p d mixing of o and cu 24 second order perturbation for s d and p d exchange interactions are the theoretical basis for shift in band gap interactions originated from many bodies could also narrow the band gap due to merging effects of an impurity band into conduction band 49 bet adsorption desorption isotherms for cu sr sr cd and cd cu metal oxides are displayed in fig 4 d f bet surface area as well as total pore volume and average pore radius are reported in table 2 maximum surface area was found for cd cu metal oxides 49 78 m2 g with total pore volume as 0 1080 ml g and average pore radius as 0 9254 nm 3 5 photocatalytic degradation of dyes cu sr sr cd and cd cu metal oxides were examined for photocatalytic degradation of mb and mo dyes under solar light exposure these dyes showed no degradation when exposed to solar light without catalysts indicating the fact that light alone has no prominent effect on degradation process initially degradation experiments were performed for 30 min in dark to know the adsorption desorption mechanism afterwards reactions were transferred to solar light 5 ml of sample solution extracted after every 30 min through pipette was investigated by uv vis spectrum a small decrease in mb and mo was recorded during first half hour revealing low efficiency of catalysts in dark as shown in fig 5 a f degradation of mb and mo dyes is represented by absorbance recorded by uv vis spectrum with maximum peak at 665 nm for mb and 485 nm for mo dye decreased absorption intensity for mb and mo dyes was recorded as function of time and decreased intensity of uv light concentration decrease and increase in degradation for mb and mo dyes with synthesized metal oxides are shown in fig 6 a and b cu sr sr cd and cd cu metal oxides showed 88 78 and 67 degradation for mb dye while 80 50 and 69 degradation for mo dye respectively total time recorded for complete degradation was 180 min pollutant reduction rate was evaluated by utilizing first order kinetics and linear correlation between ln ct co and reduction time as explained in eq 2 and depicted in fig 6 c f numerical data for degradation experiments is summarized in table 3 revealing a sequence as cu sr sr cd cd cu for mb and cu sr cd cu sr cd for mo dye and as a whole it is cu sr mb cu sr mo sr cd mb cd cu mo cd cu mb sr cd mo a comparison between present work and previous reported literature is summarized in table 4 effects of various parameters such as catalytic amount ph and different types of scavengers were also investigated all these parameters were studied by utilizing 0 03 mm of mb and mo dyes with 85 mg of each catalyst 3 5 1 effect of catalytic amount greater amount of catalysts provide more active sites for removal of pollutants however there is a certain limit beyond which the degradation rate is decreased even with increasing catalytic amount 58 as shown in fig 7 a reaction rate was decreased with decreased catalytic amount from 80 mg 85 ml to 10 mg 85 ml 3 5 2 effect of ph ph of catalyst can greatly influence surface charge which in turn can effect degradation efficiency degradation of mb and mo dyes was thoroughly investigated against all the catalysts at ph values of 3 6 9 and 12 sr cd metal oxides indicated lowest catalytic activity for degradation of mb dye at ph value of 3 whereas cu sr metal oxides showed highest performance for mo dye at ph value of 6 as shown in fig 7b 3 5 3 free radical scavenging study free radical scavenging activity was performed using ethanol and h2o2 as scavengers rate of photocatalytic degradation of dyes in presence of h2o2 scavenger was a little higher than that of ethanol scavenger as shown in fig 7c 3 5 4 reusibility and stabilty test the synthesized metal oxides were utilized over three successive cycles in order to evaluate their regeneration the photocatalysts were recovered after each degradation experiment washed with enough acetone and water mixture and were reused for three consecutive cycles as shown in fig 7d and table 5 degradation efficiency for all the samples were found to be more or less decreased indicating the reduced recycled amount and accumulated pollutant particles at active sites of photocatalysts 13 19 additionally stability of the prepared metal oxides was also tested by investigating xrd and ftir patterns after degrading mb and mo dye as shown in fig 7 e h no apparent change was indicated in xrd peaks and ftir functional groups the results indicated that the as synthesized nanoparticles had great stability and potential to be applied as an efficient photocatalyst 3 6 active species determination and mechanism for photocatalytic degradation active species such as holes h electrons e hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide radicals o2 were analyzed through in situ method 0 1 ml of ethanol and hydrogen peroxides were added as scavengers to capture holes and superoxide radicals and the role of active species was determined through change in concentration of dyes addition of ethanol decreased degradation for cu sr mo from 80 64 enhanced for sr cd mo from 50 to 67 whereas no effect was observed for cd cu mo similarly addition of h2o2 scavenger enhanced catalytic performance for cu sr mo from 80 72 sr cd mo from 50 to 74 and from 69 to 80 similar observations were made for mb dye degradation against all the synthesized catalysts under solar light irradiations variations in degradation efficieny could be explained as electrons were excited from valance band to conduction band with exposure to solar light generating an electro hole pair recombination of excited electrons and holes induced photocatalytic activities addition of ethanol and h2o2 controlled recombination by capturing holes and hence more electrons were excited at surface of the photcatalyst which reacted with o2 to produce more superoxides o2 these super oxides radicals reacted with h producing hydrogen peroxide hydroxyl radicals oh2 afterwards oh2 were decomposed into hydrogen peroxides h2o2 and combined with o2 to generate oh h2o2 could also be decomposed into oh by absorbing solar light the complete pheneomenon can be expressed by the following eqs 4 10 4 hf energy nanomaterials nanomaterials e h 5 hf energy cu sr sr cd cd cu cu sr sr cd cd cu e h 6 e o2 o2 7 o2 h oh2 8 2 oh2 o2 h2o2 9 h2o2 o2 oh oh o2 10 h2o2 oh2 these results have revealed that super oxide free radicals o2 are the main active species and hydroxyl radicals oh have played a supplementary role during photocatalytic reactions based on the suggested active species a mechanism for photocatalytic degaradtion can be explained as the oh and o2 were generated by electron hole pair h and h2o2 were produced when water molecules reacted with generated hole h dyes were degraded when two oh ions were obtained by splitting of h2o2 molecule similarly h2o2 molecules were formed due to high reactive nature of super oxides free radicals o2 within conduction band 59 61 the overall degradation mechanism from oh o2 to h2o co2 is summarized in eqs 11 17 and fig 8 11 cu sr sr cd cd cu h mb mo h2o h cu sr sr cd cd cu oh mb mo 12 cu sr sr cd cd cu h mb mo oh cu sr sr cd cd cu oh mb mo 13 2h2o 2h 2 h h2o2 14 h2o2 oh 2 15 cu sr sr cd cd cu e mb mo o2 cu sr sr cd cd cu o2 mb mo 16 o2 oh 2 h o2 h2o2 h2o2 oh 2 17 cu sr sr cd cd cu o2 or ho mb

degradation for mb dye while 80 50 and 69 degradation was observed for mo dye within total time of 180 min effect of various operational parameters such as catalyst loading ph and various scavengers was evaluated in detail morever in situ investigations were also carried out in order to determine the active species and hence the mechanism for catalytic reactions these results for dye detoxification and corresponding reaction mechanism suggested the synthesized metal oxides as promising candidates for real toxic water wastes cleanup applications keywords metal oxides photocatalysts solar light methylene blue methyl orange 1 introduction most of the organic dyes used in industry such as textile paper paint and bio medical are non biodegradable these dyes have created many negative consequences and are thus categorized as a serious issue for environment these dyes are highly toxic and cause various human health problems such as heavy perspiration cerebral misperception and methemoglobinemia 1 2 adverse and long lasting effects are being recognized upon ecological systems it is estimated that dyeing process utilizes only 10 of total dyestuff and rest of the amount being released into water reservoirs these hazardous dyes form a foam layer on water surface thus decreasing supply of oxygen to aquatic life for both flora and fauna industries such as metal plating ammunition and battery manufacturing release lead and heavy metals which enter into body through food chain causing adverse effects on human health special attention must be paid in order to remove these hazardous dyestuff from waste water keeping in view their toxicity non biodegradable nature and slow decolorating rate 3 5 there are two main types of dyes cationic and anionic anionic dyes are water soluble and cause a bright color removal of such dyes is thus difficult the common forms of cationic dyes are azo methane phthalocyanine anthraquinone polycarbocyclic while anionic dyes are acid dyes which are typically applied to a textile at low ph values 6 10 mb and mo are the most common contaminants affecting both water quality and human health mb is a cationic dye highly toxic to environment causing various health issues like eye infection breathing complications worming abundant sweating mental weaknesses and blood disorders 11 13 mo is a hazardous azodye which has also been documented as mutagenic or cytotoxic 14 19 various techniques such as adsorption coagulation precipitation and photocatalytic oxidation have been adopted for remediation of contaminated water 20 25 photocatalytic technique can be utilized as an excellent strategy for waste water treatment in photocatalysis organic elements of the dyes are disintegrated into safe and harmless constituents i e co2 h2o and mineral ions 20 nanotechnology involving nanosize particles ranged from 1 100 nm is believed to be a major development in 21st century demonstrating high photocatalytic efficiency 26 28 semiconducting nanomaterials are emerged as a popular class to function as photocatalysts due to their diverse composition morphology size and structure they have been fabricated through simple synthetic procedures with attractive optical properties 29 30 however these photocatalysts have the ability to absorb only uv radiation due to their large band gap energies moreover low quantum yield has greatly affected photo degradation efficiency of semiconducting nanocatalysts 31 33 therefore visible light active catalysts have been developed through different strategies for clean environment and energy applications addition of transition rare earth metals non metal ions fabrication of composite photocatalysts with single and heterogeneous metal oxides can be validated for exclusive properties with maximum yield product under easy and mild conditions recombination between charge carriers within a composite material can be greatly suppressed by adjusting charge transfer mechanism between various constituents metal nanostructures are favored for the fixation of organic dyes not only because of their efficient performance but also due to low cost and non toxic final products which are easily degradable catalytic performance of transition metals has been enhanced by doping with other elements 34 ru doped co3o4 significantly improved number of surface oxygen species acting towards a higher hydro thermal stability and catalytic activity absorption of surface oxygen and electron density is highly promoted by adding k and cs to co al catalyst smaller particle size and increased surface area is reported in a similar study for sno2 co3o4 and mgxceyco1 x yco2o4 catalysts in mixed metal oxides cations provide best support for catalytic activity stress and defects with increased chemical activity are induced into host lattice of mixed metal oxides by adding various dopants increased photocatalytic activity with efficient separation of charge carriers is reported for tio2 cdo decorated with pd similarly ce and cu doping has induced a rapid degradation of mo with enhanced efficiency for zno al2o3 nanocomposites materials among various transition metals cu nanoparticles pure as well as doped are greatly contributing towards various valuable applications at relatively low cost when compared to expensive noble metals such as pt ag and au 35 38 nanocomposites such as cuo zno and zno nio have been reported for novel technological applications as compared to single oxides various protecting elements i e polymers and organic ligands have been employed to prevent the aggregation of cu nanoparticles 39 but most of the active sites within these nanoparticles are blocked by heavy polymers acting as protecting agents and hence restricting their efficient implementation as heterogeneous catalysts 40 41 several studies have been conducted to propose some reductant and antioxidants for protecting the cu nanoparticles similarly partial substitution of sr into copper oxide composites has offered a wide range of promising opportunities to optimize and enhance the catalytic performance faster degradation 60 min for orange 8 is obtained by using srfeo3 compounds after replacing ba by sr 42 cdo of nano scale size has been found to degrade various organic dyes quite effectively due to its thermal stability high carrier mobility and favorable visible light adsorption 43 however cdo has a limited degradation efficiency due to lower band gap and rapid recombination of charge carriers additionally release of toxic cd ions is a critical issue which cannot be overlooked in practical applications previous studies have shown that these problems could be solved either by preparing cdo through green synthesis routes 44 45 or by addition of non toxic metal oxides 46 47 therfore these strategies are adopted here to remove the toxicity of cdo various synthesis routes have been adopted for the preparation of nanoparticles including thermal decomposition sol gel co precipitation and aqueous chemical reduction the method being usually favoured has to be simple cost effective and efficient in many aspects size microstructure surface area and uniformity of nanoparticles can be effectively controlled through various processing conditions such as precursors time temperature and reducing agent 48 52 the most effective and result oriented methods for the fixation and detoxification of toxic dyes organic compounds and heavy metals consist in advanced oxidation processes aops during photocatalysis in photocatalytic reactions light of suitable frequency strikes the surface of photocatalysts which excite negative charge carriers between valance band and conduction band this excitation creates an electron hole e h pair which leads to redox reactions photocatalytic reaction produces highly reactive radicals oh produced from oh anions and o2 radicals by reduction of o2 which can cause degradation of toxic pollutants 53 in this current work we have developed several catalysts with great efficiency in solar light for degradation of toxic dyes this work has been carried out to adopt a mild low cost and an effective method to fabricate stable and oxidation resistant nanomaterials with small and uniform size distribution in aqueous solution cu sr and cd based metal oxides were

collected are summarized as in table 1 cu sr metal oxides revealed four peaks for cu2p at 962 18 ev s1 to 2p1 2 or s2 to 2p1 2 954 17 ev cuo 2p1 2 943 12 ev s1 to 2p3 2 cuo or s2 to 2p3 2 cuo and 935 24 933 35 ev cu 2p3 2 or cuo2 2p3 2 revealing the presence of either cuo or cuo2 or both 64 65 similarly cd cu metal oxides had six distinct peaks for cu2p as s1 to 2p1 2 s2 to 2p1 2 cu 2p3 2 and cuo 2p3 2 at binding energies 963 73 955 50 945 08 942 83 and 935 47 ev respectively 49 as explained in fig 2 b and g sr3d doublets 3d3 2 and 3d5 2 were detected for cu sr and sr cd metal oxides as shown in fig 2 c and d main peaks were found at 135 64 and 133 87 ev for cu sr metal oxides first doublet could be due to sr o at surface whereas second doublet showed presence of sr2 second doublet is caused by desorption of carbon srco3 from surface due to increased sensitivity of xps equipment some sr2 was initially expected but that probably overlapped with c1s region 27 in sr cd metal oxides sr3d3 2 and sr3d5 2 peaks were shifted from 135 64 133 87 ev towards 135 62 133 84 ev respectively cd3d peaks had well separated spin orbit components and were recorded at 411 83 ev 3d3 2 and 405 06 ev 3d5 2 within sr cd metal oxides but for cd cu metal oxides peaks were shifted to 411 96 ev 3d3 2 and 405 16 ev 3d5 2 respectively as shown in fig 2d previously similar results were concluded for binding energy of cd 3d to the cd2 bonding state 28 30 high resolution spectrum for oxygen contained one component at 532 09 ev for cu sr metal oxides one component at 532 45 ev for sr cd oxides while two peaks were found in cd cu metal oxides at 531 63 and 530 17 ev as shown in fig 2 h j peaks at low binding energies could be assigned to o but higher energy peaks revealed presence of co3 at the surface highest peak at 532 45 ev could be associated with adsorbed oxygen species 24 3 3 sem analysis sem images suggested that all the metal oxides were grown in aggregates of small particles particle morphology and shapes are shown by low and high resolution images in figs 3 a f nanomaterials in diameter range of 44 97 52 26 and 87 9 8 nm were observed for cu sr sr cd and cd cu metal oxides respectively 3 4 drs and bet studies the in resonance effect of light and prevention to electron hole carriers may be attributed to effective photocatalytic activity of various nanomaterials a proper band gap is necessary for generation of free radicals energy difference between highest occupied and lowest un occupied orbitals was measured by solid state drs calculated band gap energies were 1 57 1 64 and 1 61 ev for cu sr sr cd and cd cu metal oxides respectively as shown in fig 4 a c band gap variations were attributed towards structural transitions by mixing various metals together band gap can be decreased inside transition metals due to p d spin exchange interactions between band electrons and localized d electrons 42 43 another reason for decreased band gap is due to strong p d mixing of o and cu 24 second order perturbation for s d and p d exchange interactions are the theoretical basis for shift in band gap interactions originated from many bodies could also narrow the band gap due to merging effects of an impurity band into conduction band 49 bet adsorption desorption isotherms for cu sr sr cd and cd cu metal oxides are displayed in fig 4 d f bet surface area as well as total pore volume and average pore radius are reported in table 2 maximum surface area was found for cd cu metal oxides 49 78 m2 g with total pore volume as 0 1080 ml g and average pore radius as 0 9254 nm 3 5 photocatalytic degradation of dyes cu sr sr cd and cd cu metal oxides were examined for photocatalytic degradation of mb and mo dyes under solar light exposure these dyes showed no degradation when exposed to solar light without catalysts indicating the fact that light alone has no prominent effect on degradation process initially degradation experiments were performed for 30 min in dark to know the adsorption desorption mechanism afterwards reactions were transferred to solar light 5 ml of sample solution extracted after every 30 min through pipette was investigated by uv vis spectrum a small decrease in mb and mo was recorded during first half hour revealing low efficiency of catalysts in dark as shown in fig 5 a f degradation of mb and mo dyes is represented by absorbance recorded by uv vis spectrum with maximum peak at 665 nm for mb and 485 nm for mo dye decreased absorption intensity for mb and mo dyes was recorded as function of time and decreased intensity of uv light concentration decrease and increase in degradation for mb and mo dyes with synthesized metal oxides are shown in fig 6 a and b cu sr sr cd and cd cu metal oxides showed 88 78 and 67 degradation for mb dye while 80 50 and 69 degradation for mo dye respectively total time recorded for complete degradation was 180 min pollutant reduction rate was evaluated by utilizing first order kinetics and linear correlation between ln ct co and reduction time as explained in eq 2 and depicted in fig 6 c f numerical data for degradation experiments is summarized in table 3 revealing a sequence as cu sr sr cd cd cu for mb and cu sr cd cu sr cd for mo dye and as a whole it is cu sr mb cu sr mo sr cd mb cd cu mo cd cu mb sr cd mo a comparison between present work and previous reported literature is summarized in table 4 effects of various parameters such as catalytic amount ph and different types of scavengers were also investigated all these parameters were studied by utilizing 0 03 mm of mb and mo dyes with 85 mg of each catalyst 3 5 1 effect of catalytic amount greater amount of catalysts provide more active sites for removal of pollutants however there is a certain limit beyond which the degradation rate is decreased even with increasing catalytic amount 58 as shown in fig 7 a reaction rate was decreased with decreased catalytic amount from 80 mg 85 ml to 10 mg 85 ml 3 5 2 effect of ph ph of catalyst can greatly influence surface charge which in turn can effect degradation efficiency degradation of mb and mo dyes was thoroughly investigated against all the catalysts at ph values of 3 6 9 and 12 sr cd metal oxides indicated lowest catalytic activity for degradation of mb dye at ph value of 3 whereas cu sr metal oxides showed highest performance for mo dye at ph value of 6 as shown in fig 7b 3 5 3 free radical scavenging study free radical scavenging activity was performed using ethanol and h2o2 as scavengers rate of photocatalytic degradation of dyes in presence of h2o2 scavenger was a little higher than that of ethanol scavenger as shown in fig 7c 3 5 4 reusibility and stabilty test the synthesized metal oxides were utilized over three successive cycles in order to evaluate their regeneration the photocatalysts were recovered after each degradation experiment washed with enough acetone and water mixture and were reused for three consecutive cycles as shown in fig 7d and table 5 degradation efficiency for all the samples were found to be more or less decreased indicating the reduced recycled amount and accumulated pollutant particles at active sites of photocatalysts 13 19 additionally stability of the prepared metal oxides was also tested by investigating xrd and ftir patterns after degrading mb and mo dye as shown in fig 7 e h no apparent change was indicated in xrd peaks and ftir functional groups the results indicated that the as synthesized nanoparticles had great stability and potential to be applied as an efficient photocatalyst 3 6 active species determination and mechanism for photocatalytic degradation active species such as holes h electrons e hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide radicals o2 were analyzed through in situ method 0 1 ml of ethanol and hydrogen peroxides were added as scavengers to capture holes and superoxide radicals and the role of active species was determined through change in concentration of dyes addition of ethanol decreased degradation for cu sr mo from 80 64 enhanced for sr cd mo from 50 to 67 whereas no effect was observed for cd cu mo similarly addition of h2o2 scavenger enhanced catalytic performance for cu sr mo from 80 72 sr cd mo from 50 to 74 and from 69 to 80 similar observations were made for mb dye degradation against all the synthesized catalysts under solar light irradiations variations in degradation efficieny could be explained as electrons were excited from valance band to conduction band with exposure to solar light generating an electro hole pair recombination of excited electrons and holes induced photocatalytic activities addition of ethanol and h2o2 controlled recombination by capturing holes and hence more electrons were excited at surface of the photcatalyst which reacted with o2 to produce more superoxides o2 these super oxides radicals reacted with h producing hydrogen peroxide hydroxyl radicals oh2 afterwards oh2 were decomposed into hydrogen peroxides h2o2 and combined with o2 to generate oh h2o2 could also be decomposed into oh by absorbing solar light the complete pheneomenon can be expressed by the following eqs 4 10 4 hf energy nanomaterials nanomaterials e h 5 hf energy cu sr sr cd cd cu cu sr sr cd cd cu e h 6 e o2 o2 7 o2 h oh2 8 2 oh2 o2 h2o2 9 h2o2 o2 oh oh o2 10 h2o2 oh2 these results have revealed that super oxide free radicals o2 are the main active species and hydroxyl radicals oh have played a supplementary role during photocatalytic reactions based on the suggested active species a mechanism for photocatalytic degaradtion can be explained as the oh and o2 were generated by electron hole pair h and h2o2 were produced when water molecules reacted with generated hole h dyes were degraded when two oh ions were obtained by splitting of h2o2 molecule similarly h2o2 molecules were formed due to high reactive nature of super oxides free radicals o2 within conduction band 59 61 the overall degradation mechanism from oh o2 to h2o co2 is summarized in eqs 11 17 and fig 8 11 cu sr sr cd cd cu h mb mo h2o h cu sr sr cd cd cu oh mb mo 12 cu sr sr cd cd cu h mb mo oh cu sr sr cd cd cu oh mb mo 13 2h2o 2h 2 h h2o2 14 h2o2 oh 2 15 cu sr sr cd cd cu e mb mo o2 cu sr sr cd cd cu o2 mb mo 16 o2 oh 2 h o2 h2o2 h2o2 oh 2 17 cu sr sr cd cd cu o2 or ho mb mo h2o co2 4 conclusion this study involved synthesis and utilization of cu sr sr cd and cd cu metal oxides for solar light degradation of mb and mo dyes all the catalysts were developed as nano oxides with an average particle size ranged form 40 90 nm low band gaps 1 57 1 64 and 1 61 ev were calculated for cu sr sr cd and cd cu metal oxides respectively cu sr sr cd and cd cu metal oxides showed 86 78 and 67 degradation for mb dye while 80 50 and 69 degradation was observed for mo dye during 180 min detailed investigation about physiochemical properties and photocatalytic degradation efficiency declared cu sr metal oxides as best among the three synthesized samples furthermore various operational parameters stabily check active species analysis and proposed mechanism provided a

of 855 45 l m 2 h 1 the separation efficiency exceeds 99 81 when driven by gravity merely in addition pvdf pdms blend membranes have an excellent reusability in separating the surfactant stabilized water in oil emulsions these results clearly demonstrate that this membrane forming method may provide a new reliable pathway for membrane fabrication for oil water emulsion separation keywords superhydrophobic superoleophilic oil water emulsion separation poly vinylidene fluoride polydimethylsiloxane membrane 1 introduction the separation of oil water mixtures is developing into a universal problem since the increasing scales of oily wastewater from industrial productive process oil spill accidents and leakage of water insoluble organic solvents every now and then 1 2 a typical example is the gulf of mexico oil spill in 2010 which threaten the ecosystem of ocean and coast near the oilfield severely in order to prevent the environment and public health from being damaged by those many cleaning technologies have been used including skimming centrifugation filtration flotation electrochemical and magnetic separation technologies 3 4 however these methods are not capable and effective for emulsions especially with the existence of surfactants 5 6 the separation of emulsified oil water mixtures is quite difficult and challenging as suspended droplets typically have micron and nanoscale size and can stably exist for a long time therefore effective methods and materials for the separation emulsions is needed recently membranes with superwetting surfaces have received extensive attention 7 membrane separation technologies are energy efficient convenient in operation relatively low cost and applicable across a wide range of industrial processes 8 11 the oil can permeate the superwetting membranes quickly while water is trapped on the surface of the membrane endowing an efficient separation performance for oil water mixtures emulsions 12 13 a myriad of technologies has been proposed to construct superwetting surfaces such as phase inversion layer by layer assembly template methods electrochemical anodization sol gel self assembly plasma techniques hydrothermal treatment electrospinning and interfacial polymerization 14 20 gao et al reported a carbon nanotube polydopamine polyethyleneimine composite membranes prepared by vacuum filtration with the superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic properties for high speed separation of oil in water emulsions 21 in zeng et al s research a superhydrophilic bumps superhydrophobic superoleophilic stainless steel mesh filter could be used in water in oil emulsions efficient separation 22 pan et al prepared a superhydrophobic superoleophilic poly ethylene chlorotrifluoroethylene ectfe sio2 hybrid porous membrane by blending hydrophobic sio2 particles using thermally induced phase separation technique for efficient oil water separation 23 however the complex preparation process high cost small scale or the poor affinity between polymer and inorganic particles make them difficult to meet the demands of practical applications the oil removing type of materials such as polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane poss 24 poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf 25 polydimethylsiloxane pdms 26 polypropylene pp 27 and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe 28 are attractive candidates to prepare superhydrophobic membranes for efficient water in oil emulsions separation because their reasonable cost inherent hydrophobicity and stable physicochemical properties 29 30 pvdf is one of the most common usage film forming materials for fabricating mf and uf membranes own to its low price thermal stability chemical resistance and high mechanical strength 31 32 in addition the intrinsic hydrophobicity of pvdf endows it a promising material for superhydrophobic materials 5 29 30 for the sake of separating all sorts of water in oil emulsions efficiently the prepared membrane should have excellent superhydrophobic superoleophilic properties and high porosity generally the membrane separation performance could be improved by using hydrophobic materials and pore forming agents 6 33 34 these methods are often limited by the material costs and cumbersome preparation processes to solve the above problems pdms with low surface free energy chemical inactivity thermal stability and good compatibility with pvdf was chosen to blend with pvdf to prepared the membrane 35 the membrane was made by a facile low cost reliable and effective phase inversion approach the structure of blend membrane could be controlled by changing the content of pdms 36 herein a serious pvdf pdms blend membrane is prepared by phase inversion method using ethanol as coagulant the ethanol can cause a slow aggregation and crystallization process of the pvdf which may result in a micro nano structure and superhydrophobic superoleophilic surface properties the membrane separation performance was measured by water in oil emulsions separation tests the results reflected that the blend membrane could separate both micrometer and nanometer size surfactant stabilized water in oil emulsions with high separation efficiency and high flux 2 experimental 2 1 materials poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf powder solef 1015 mn 100 000 was bought from solvay polydimethylsiloxane pdms sylgard 184 elastomer base and curing agent was gained from dow tetrahydrofuran thf 99 5 and nmp 98 were supplied by tianjin fuyu fine chemical co ltd non ionic surfactant span 80 98 was obtained from tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute absolute ethanol 99 7 isooctane 99 7 and petroleum ether 98 were acquired from tianjin fengchuan chemical reagent technologies co ltd toluene 99 5 and cyclohexane 97 were procured from merck all these reagents can be used directly without purifying 2 2 preparation of porous pvdf pdms blend membranes the membrane fabrication process is presented in fig 1 first pvdf powder was added in nmp solution under constant agitation at 50 c for 12 h pdms the mass ratio of elastomer base and curing agent is 10 1 was dissolved into thf under strongly stirring for 2 h at ambient temperature then the solutions containing pdms and pvdf were mutual mixed with a mass ratio of 1 1 followed by mixing 5 h at room temperature to prepare a uniform pdms pvdf casting solution afterwards the pdms pvdf casting solution was cast onto a glass plate using a casting knife with a gap of 300 μm after being degassed under vacuum oven entirely and then the glass plate was dipped into an ethanol bath for 4 h immediately to precipitate the polymer subsequently the membrane was peeled off from the glass after washed by di water to get rid of the residual solvents nmp and thf finally the superhydrophobic membrane was prepared successfully after dried in an oven at 80 c for 12 h blend membranes with different concentration ratio of pdms and pvdf were prepared to explore the effects of pdms as a benchmark pure pvdf membranes were prepared in accordance with the above experimental methods the preparation parameters and assigned labels of the membranes prepared in this research are showed in table 1 2 3 preparation of surfactant stabilizedwater in oil emulsions four kinds of oils including isooctane cyclohexane petroleum ether and toluene were selected as the oil phases in this work the surfactant stabilized water in isooctane emulsion water in cyclohexane emulsion water in petroleum ether and water in toluene emulsion were labelled as sse 1 sse 2 sse 3 and sse 4 0 04 g span 80 and 1 ml water were mixed into 100 ml oil phase followed by 4 h strongly stirring to obtain homogeneous emulsions there is no de emulsification or sedimentation occurred throughout the whole experiment process 2 4 separation experiments of the membrane the prepared emulsion was filled into the feed side with a liquid column height of 10 cm and the separation process was promoted solely by gravity the permeation flux j l m 2 h 1 was calculated according tothe following equation 1 j v a δ t in the process of separation the height of the feed solution was remained constant at the original position to obtain an average three times were conducted at least for each sample the separation efficiency was calculated by measuring the weight ratio of water and oil in the feed solution and in the collected filtrate using a karl fischer analyzer 831 k f coulometer the rejection was defined as follows 2 r 1 c p c f 2 5 membranes characterization the surface and cross section morphology and microstructure of the resultant membranes were observed by a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope zeiss auriga fib sem germany fourier transforms infrared spectra thermo nicolet ir 200 usa and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis supra were employed to characterize the chemical composition of the membranes the wetting behavior was analyzed by a contact angle goniometer kruss germany using a 2 μl di water droplet the mechanical property of the membranes 3 cm 1 cm was tested by a tensile testing instrument with a tensile rate of 2 mm min dynamic light scattering dls measurements malvern 3600 uk and optical microscopy using an olympus bx51 microscope were applied to measure the droplet diameter and the size distribution of emulsions the water content in the filtrate was measured by a coulometric karl fischer titrator 831 k f coulometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface chemical properties the chemical constitutions of pvdf membrane and pvdf pdms blend membrane were ascertained by ftir and xps measurement as shown in fig 2 a both m3 and m5 have two typical peaks at 1405 cm 1 c h deformation vibration and 1181 cm 1 c f stretching vibration they are typical the characteristic peaks of 7 the pvdf 6 37 pvdf as a polymeric material has various forms of crystalline phases named nonpolar α form polar β γ and δ forms 38 characteristic peaks of nonpolar α crystallites 976 795 614 and 532 cm 1 and polar β crystallite 840 cm 1 were observed in the ftir spectra of m3 and m5 such crystallization represents a slow crystallization dominated precipitation process 39 compared with m3 si ch3 1259 cm 1 and si o si 1014 cm 1 from pdms are showed for m5 verifying the addition of pdms 40 the chemical compositions of m3 and m5 were further determined by xps measurement fig 2b two characteristic peaks at 285 and 691 ev which attributed to the binding energy of c1s and f1s were observed in m3 and m5 5 in contrast for the blend membrane m5 two new characteristic peaks appeared at about 539 and 108 ev corresponding of o1s and si2p3 of pdms indicating the addition of pdms in m5 37 the analysis of ftir and xps above demonstrate the successful preparation of pvdf pdms blend membranes by phase inversion 3 2 surface morphology of membranes the surface morphology of pure pvdf membranes and pvdf pdms blend membranes were identified by sem see fig 3 as is seen from the graphs that all the pure pvdf membranes have a petal like supramolecular structure fig 3 a c the formation of a petal like structure was caused by the slow aggregation and crystallization process of pvdf using ethanol as nonsolvent 41 with the augment of the concentration of pvdf the size of petal like structure reduced whereas the intensity of the petal like structure increased ultimately giving the surface of the m3 membrane a micro nano structure in addition as the augment of the concentration of pvdf the size of petal like structure reduced whereas the intensity of the petal like structure increased ultimately giving the surface of the m3 membrane a micro nano structure this is because the high pvdf concentration diminishes the solid liquid demixing time while the reduced mass transfer time between the casting solution and the gelation bath is unfavorable to the formation of large petal like structures for pvdf macromolecules the surface morphology of pvdf pdms blend membranes fig 3 d f is significantly different from that of pure pvdf membranes with increasing pdms ratio the petal like structure on the membrane surface gradually disappeared while irregular blocky protrusions and massive pores appeared furthermore the size of blocky protrusions and pores became larger with higher pdms concentration fig 3c and d as the petal like structure is mainly originating from the pvdf macromolecules the addition of the pdms may impede the phase inversion rates of the coating solution and thus inhibit the aggregation of pvdf macromolecules ultimately yielding an irregular blocky structure 42 beyond that large pores appeared on the membranes surface and the size of pores was boosted with the elevated proportion of pdms in the mixing solution to further investigate the influence of the pdms concentration on the membrane morphologies the cross section structure of m3 m4 m5 and m6 were measured by sem the mass fraction of the membrane forming material in all casting solutions was fixed at 20 wt as shown in fig 4 a m3 has the highest thickness 108 μm and no macrovoids were observed in its cross section image from fig 4 the thickness of the pvdf pdms blend membranes decrease with the increased pdms content the thickness of m4 m5 and m6 are 89 70 and 59 μm respectively with the elevating of pdms concentration massive micron scale pores appeared gradually on the cross section of the membrane furthermore the pore size also increases with the pdms content and the decreased pvdf concentration fig s4 these results demonstrate that the pvdf pdms ratio has a decisive effect on the surface morphology of the blend membranes adding pdms to the pvdf casting solution not only reduces the thickness of the membrane but also facilitates the formation of the pores inside the membrane this is caused by the low viscosity of the pvdf pdms casting solution fig s5 43 from the viewpoint of the macrovoid formation mechanism a casting solution with lower viscosity is beneficial to pore initiation 3 3 wettability of membranes superhydrophobic property of a material is closely related to its surface morphology and surface energy furthermore the hierarchical micro nano structure is a prerequisite for the superwetting surface for the purpose of exploring the hydrophobicity of the resultant membrane their water contact angles were measured and shown in fig 5 the water contact angle of m1 m2 and m3 pvdf membranes are 146 1 7 149 2 8 and 151 2 2 respectively with the increasing concentration of pvdf the pure pvdf membrane has a richer micro nano hierarchical structure and shows better hydrophobicity because of the inherent hydrophobicity of pvdf the rougher membrane surface will have a preferable hydrophobic property 44 the water contact angles of pvdf pdms blend membranes m4 m5 and m6 are 158 2 6 164 1 9 and 155 2 4 respectively the surface of m4 became rougher comparing with the pure pvdf membrane because more microscale protruding structures and micropores appeared fig 3d in addition the inherent hydrophobicity of pdms can further enhance the hydrophobicity of the membrane for m5 the nanostructures of the membrane surface are less significant than the pure pvdf membrane but it still has a considerable number of nanostructures as there are micropores on its surface fig 3e the surface of pvdf pdms blend membrane with micro and nano scale dual structures are crucial for obtaining superhydrophobic property see movie s1 m5 shows similar phenomenon to what was observed in lotus leaves 45 when the water droplets came into contact with the membrane surface of m5 and forms a water air solid composite interface was shaped owing to the air trapped in the micro and nano scale hierarchical structures leading to an increased water contact angle for m5 164 1 9 compared with m5 the nanostructures on the surface of m6 almost disappeared and the size of the blocky protrusions and pores reached the micron level fig 3f which can increase the contact area between the membrane and water droplets thus the water contact angle of m6 is lower than m5 besides the membrane with m5 s casting solution but using water as nonsolvent is also prepared its contact angle is much lower than m5 128 6 fig s5 confirm the advantage of using ethanol as nonsolvent 3 4 mechanical performance of membranes the mechanical performance is an important index of a membrane as it can directly affect its practical application the tensile strength and elongation ratio of m3 m4 m5 and m6 were recorded and presented in fig 6 m3 the pure pvdf membrane has a large tensile strength and a low elongation ratio compared with m3 the breaking stress of both m4 and m5 decreases while the breaking elongation enhanced nevertheless as to m6 a high pdms concentration will simultaneously reduce the tensile strength and elongation ratio pdms could be used as a plasticizer of pvdf to improve the activity of the pvdf chain and massive pores fig 4 in the blend membranes provide more free space for the deformation of the membrane 37 however defects or macrovoids inside the blend membrane fig 4d red cycle are caused by an excessive amount of pdms thus endowing the blend membrane with worse mechanical properties 3 5 membranes separation performance it is difficult to separation surfactant stabilized emulsions due to their long term colloidal stability and the micro nanometer size of the emulsion droplets 46 to study the separation capability all samples were tested using a surfactant stabilized water isooctane emulsion sse 1 with micro nanometer droplet size when the prepared emulsions were poured onto the surface of the superhydrophobic superoleophilic membranes water was retained on the feed side and oil permeate through the membranes fig 7 a b and movie s2 the results of flux and separation efficiency in filtration are presented in fig 8 a the pure pvdf membrane m1 m2 and m3 have a flux of 52 4 67 7 and 87 5 l m 2 h 1 when sse 1 was applied simultaneously the separation efficiency of m1 m2 and m3 reaches up to 99 98 99 95 and 99 97 normally the membranes flux decreases with the increased membrane thickness due to the growth of mass transfer resistance and the extended permeation transfer path 6 however an abnormal tendency was observed for the pure pvdf membrane the flux increases with the promotion of the membrane thickness the thickness of m1 m2 and m3 are 46 81 and 108 μm respectively since both of the membrane thickness and the membrane surface property can have a vital effect on the separation performance of the membrane such abnormal flux tendency could be explained by the enhanced hydrophobicity and lipophilicity of m2 and m3 which could enhance the affinity between membrane and oil yielding an increased membrane flux fig 5 it can be concluded that the membrane surface property has a greater impact on membrane flux in addition with the addition of pdms the membrane flux is boosted to 318 15 738 39 and 996 53 l m 2 h 1 for m4 m5 and m6 respectively the separation efficiency of m4 m5 and m6 is 99 93 99 88 99 75 it is apparent that the pvdf pdms blend membrane has higher flux and separation efficiency when compared with pvdf membrane the thickness of the pvdf pdms blend membranes decrease with the increase of pdms content in the mixing solution the thickness of m4 m5 and m6 is 89 70 and 59 μm respectively macrovoids appeared throughout the pvdf pdms blend membranes and the size of the pores increases with the promotion of pdms content fig s4 all these aspects significantly decreased the mass transfer resistance for permeation in addition the enhanced affinity between membrane and oil originating from the improved hydrophobicity and lipophilicity of pvdf pdms blend membranes fig 5 could also enhance the membrane flux this indicates that the prepared pvdf pdms blend membranes with protrusion structure and superior surface property have an excellent separation performance considering the mechanical strength porosity and superhydrophobic superoleophilic properties the pvdf pdms blend membranes m5 was chosen to further investigate the separation performance of emulsions the flux and separation efficiency of those emulsions are shown in fig 8b the flux of m 5 for sse 1 sse 2 sse 3 and sse 4 is 738 39 713 24 855 45 and 791 32 l m 2 h 1 respectively with separation efficiency for sse 1 sse 2 sse 3 and sse 4 of 99 88 99 93 99 89 and 99 81 respectively fig 8c shows the optical microscope images of the water in oil emulsions before and after separation the micrometer emulsion droplets are scattered well in the original emulsion while no emulsion droplets were observed in the corresponding collected filtrate indicating the efficient separation performance the droplets size distribution of the original emulsion and filtrate were measured by dls as we can see in fig 8d the size distribution of the feed by intensity ranges from 90 to 1200 nm it shifted to 5 11 nm of the filtrate after separation confirming the high separation efficiency and excellent de emulsification of the membrane the droplets size distribution of sse 2 sse 3 and sse 4 before and after separation is shown in fig s1 fig s2 and fig s3 respectively it can be seen that m5 exhibits a high flux for all surfactant stabilized water in oil emulsions used in this experiment the flux is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the liquid in addition the size distribution of emulsion droplets and the demulsification process also have significant effects on the flux 3 6 antifouling performance of pvdf pdms blend membranes in practical applications the membrane is exposed to complex feed fluid conditions which may lead to cause unavoidable membrane fouling thereby causing the reduction of the lifespan and separation performance of the membrane 47 therefore antifouling is a significant parameter for membrane to verify the reusability of pvdf pdms blend membranes m5 was repeatedly used for 10 filtration cycles fig 9 after each separation test the prepared membrane was briefly washed with ethanol and then dried under vacuum conditions the flux remained at a high level of 709 l m2 h1 and the separation efficiency exceeded 99 8 after 10 cycles the above results show

14078,surfactant stabilized emulsions a main type of hazardous oil water mixtures have been afflicting human beings for decades in this work a highly porous pvdf pdms blend membranes with superhydrophobic superoleophilic property was successfully prepared through ethanol induced phase inversion this facile low cost and effective one step membrane forming method endowed the membrane

of 855 45 l m 2 h 1 the separation efficiency exceeds 99 81 when driven by gravity merely in addition pvdf pdms blend membranes have an excellent reusability in separating the surfactant stabilized water in oil emulsions these results clearly demonstrate that this membrane forming method may provide a new reliable pathway for membrane fabrication for oil water emulsion separation keywords superhydrophobic superoleophilic oil water emulsion separation poly vinylidene fluoride polydimethylsiloxane membrane 1 introduction the separation of oil water mixtures is developing into a universal problem since the increasing scales of oily wastewater from industrial productive process oil spill accidents and leakage of water insoluble organic solvents every now and then 1 2 a typical example is the gulf of mexico oil spill in 2010 which threaten the ecosystem of ocean and coast near the oilfield severely in order to prevent the environment and public health from being damaged by those many cleaning technologies have been used including skimming centrifugation filtration flotation electrochemical and magnetic separation technologies 3 4 however these methods are not capable and effective for emulsions especially with the existence of surfactants 5 6 the separation of emulsified oil water mixtures is quite difficult and challenging as suspended droplets typically have micron and nanoscale size and can stably exist for a long time therefore effective methods and materials for the separation emulsions is needed recently membranes with superwetting surfaces have received extensive attention 7 membrane separation technologies are energy efficient convenient in operation relatively low cost and applicable across a wide range of industrial processes 8 11 the oil can permeate the superwetting membranes quickly while water is trapped on the surface of the membrane endowing an efficient separation performance for oil water mixtures emulsions 12 13 a myriad of technologies has been proposed to construct superwetting surfaces such as phase inversion layer by layer assembly template methods electrochemical anodization sol gel self assembly plasma techniques hydrothermal treatment electrospinning and interfacial polymerization 14 20 gao et al reported a carbon nanotube polydopamine polyethyleneimine composite membranes prepared by vacuum filtration with the superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic properties for high speed separation of oil in water emulsions 21 in zeng et al s research a superhydrophilic bumps superhydrophobic superoleophilic stainless steel mesh filter could be used in water in oil emulsions efficient separation 22 pan et al prepared a superhydrophobic superoleophilic poly ethylene chlorotrifluoroethylene ectfe sio2 hybrid porous membrane by blending hydrophobic sio2 particles using thermally induced phase separation technique for efficient oil water separation 23 however the complex preparation process high cost small scale or the poor affinity between polymer and inorganic particles make them difficult to meet the demands of practical applications the oil removing type of materials such as polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane poss 24 poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf 25 polydimethylsiloxane pdms 26 polypropylene pp 27 and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe 28 are attractive candidates to prepare superhydrophobic membranes for efficient water in oil emulsions separation because their reasonable cost inherent hydrophobicity and stable physicochemical properties 29 30 pvdf is one of the most common usage film forming materials for fabricating mf and uf membranes own to its low price thermal stability chemical resistance and high mechanical strength 31 32 in addition the intrinsic hydrophobicity of pvdf endows it a promising material for superhydrophobic materials 5 29 30 for the sake of separating all sorts of water in oil emulsions efficiently the prepared membrane should have excellent superhydrophobic superoleophilic properties and high porosity generally the membrane separation performance could be improved by using hydrophobic materials and pore forming agents 6 33 34 these methods are often limited by the material costs and cumbersome preparation processes to solve the above problems pdms with low surface free energy chemical inactivity thermal stability and good compatibility with pvdf was chosen to blend with pvdf to prepared the membrane 35 the membrane was made by a facile low cost reliable and effective phase inversion approach the structure of blend membrane could be controlled by changing the content of pdms 36 herein a serious pvdf pdms blend membrane is prepared by phase inversion method using ethanol as coagulant the ethanol can cause a slow aggregation and crystallization process of the pvdf which may result in a micro nano structure and superhydrophobic superoleophilic surface properties the membrane separation performance was measured by water in oil emulsions separation tests the results reflected that the blend membrane could separate both micrometer and nanometer size surfactant stabilized water in oil emulsions with high separation efficiency and high flux 2 experimental 2 1 materials poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf powder solef 1015 mn 100 000 was bought from solvay polydimethylsiloxane pdms sylgard 184 elastomer base and curing agent was gained from dow tetrahydrofuran thf 99 5 and nmp 98 were supplied by tianjin fuyu fine chemical co ltd non ionic surfactant span 80 98 was obtained from tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute absolute ethanol 99 7 isooctane 99 7 and petroleum ether 98 were acquired from tianjin fengchuan chemical reagent technologies co ltd toluene 99 5 and cyclohexane 97 were procured from merck all these reagents can be used directly without purifying 2 2 preparation of porous pvdf pdms blend membranes the membrane fabrication process is presented in fig 1 first pvdf powder was added in nmp solution under constant agitation at 50 c for 12 h pdms the mass ratio of elastomer base and curing agent is 10 1 was dissolved into thf under strongly stirring for 2 h at ambient temperature then the solutions containing pdms and pvdf were mutual mixed with a mass ratio of 1 1 followed by mixing 5 h at room temperature to prepare a uniform pdms pvdf casting solution afterwards the pdms pvdf casting solution was cast onto a glass plate using a casting knife with a gap of 300 μm after being degassed under vacuum oven entirely and then the glass plate was dipped into an ethanol bath for 4 h immediately to precipitate the polymer subsequently the membrane was peeled off from the glass after washed by di water to get rid of the residual solvents nmp and thf finally the superhydrophobic membrane was prepared successfully after dried in an oven at 80 c for 12 h blend membranes with different concentration ratio of pdms and pvdf were prepared to explore the effects of pdms as a benchmark pure pvdf membranes were prepared in accordance with the above experimental methods the preparation parameters and assigned labels of the membranes prepared in this research are showed in table 1 2 3 preparation of surfactant stabilizedwater in oil emulsions four kinds of oils including isooctane cyclohexane petroleum ether and toluene were selected as the oil phases in this work the surfactant stabilized water in isooctane emulsion water in cyclohexane emulsion water in petroleum ether and water in toluene emulsion were labelled as sse 1 sse 2 sse 3 and sse 4 0 04 g span 80 and 1 ml water were mixed into 100 ml oil phase followed by 4 h strongly stirring to obtain homogeneous emulsions there is no de emulsification or sedimentation occurred throughout the whole experiment process 2 4 separation experiments of the membrane the prepared emulsion was filled into the feed side with a liquid column height of 10 cm and the separation process was promoted solely by gravity the permeation flux j l m 2 h 1 was calculated according tothe following equation 1 j v a δ t in the process of separation the height of the feed solution was remained constant at the original position to obtain an average three times were conducted at least for each sample the separation efficiency was calculated by measuring the weight ratio of water and oil in the feed solution and in the collected filtrate using a karl fischer analyzer 831 k f coulometer the rejection was defined as follows 2 r 1 c p c f 2 5 membranes characterization the surface and cross section morphology and microstructure of the resultant membranes were observed by a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope zeiss auriga fib sem germany fourier transforms infrared spectra thermo nicolet ir 200 usa and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis supra were employed to characterize the chemical composition of the membranes the wetting behavior was analyzed by a contact angle goniometer kruss germany using a 2 μl di water droplet the mechanical property of the membranes 3 cm 1 cm was tested by a tensile testing instrument with a tensile rate of 2 mm min dynamic light scattering dls measurements malvern 3600 uk and optical microscopy using an olympus bx51 microscope were applied to measure the droplet diameter and the size distribution of emulsions the water content in the filtrate was measured by a coulometric karl fischer titrator 831 k f coulometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface chemical properties the chemical constitutions of pvdf membrane and pvdf pdms blend membrane were ascertained by ftir and xps measurement as shown in fig 2 a both m3 and m5 have two typical peaks at 1405 cm 1 c h deformation vibration and 1181 cm 1 c f stretching vibration they are typical the characteristic peaks of 7 the pvdf 6 37 pvdf as a polymeric material has various forms of crystalline phases named nonpolar α form polar β γ and δ forms 38 characteristic peaks of nonpolar α crystallites 976 795 614 and 532 cm 1 and polar β crystallite 840 cm 1 were observed in the ftir spectra of m3 and m5 such crystallization represents a slow crystallization dominated precipitation process 39 compared with m3 si ch3 1259 cm 1 and si o si 1014 cm 1 from pdms are showed for m5 verifying the addition of pdms 40 the chemical compositions of m3 and m5 were further determined by xps measurement fig 2b two characteristic peaks at 285 and 691 ev which attributed to the binding energy of c1s and f1s were observed in m3 and m5 5 in contrast for the blend membrane m5 two new characteristic peaks appeared at about 539 and 108 ev corresponding of o1s and si2p3 of pdms indicating the addition of pdms in m5 37 the analysis of ftir and xps above demonstrate the successful preparation of pvdf pdms blend membranes by phase inversion 3 2 surface morphology of membranes the surface morphology of pure pvdf membranes and pvdf pdms blend membranes were identified by sem see fig 3 as is seen from the graphs that all the pure pvdf membranes have a petal like supramolecular structure fig 3 a c the formation of a petal like structure was caused by the slow aggregation and crystallization process of pvdf using ethanol as nonsolvent 41 with the augment of the concentration of pvdf the size of petal like structure reduced whereas the intensity of the petal like structure increased ultimately giving the surface of the m3 membrane a micro nano structure in addition as the augment of the concentration of pvdf the size of petal like structure reduced whereas the intensity of the petal like structure increased ultimately giving the surface of the m3 membrane a micro nano structure this is because the high pvdf concentration diminishes the solid liquid demixing time while the reduced mass transfer time between the casting solution and the gelation bath is unfavorable to the formation of large petal like structures for pvdf macromolecules the surface morphology of pvdf pdms blend membranes fig 3 d f is significantly different from that of pure pvdf membranes with increasing pdms ratio the petal like structure on the membrane surface gradually disappeared while irregular blocky protrusions and massive pores appeared furthermore the size of blocky protrusions and pores became larger with higher pdms concentration fig 3c and d as the petal like structure is mainly originating from the pvdf macromolecules the addition of the pdms may impede the phase inversion rates of the coating solution and thus inhibit the aggregation of pvdf macromolecules ultimately yielding an irregular blocky structure 42 beyond that large pores appeared on the membranes surface and the size of pores was boosted with the elevated proportion of pdms in the mixing solution to further investigate the influence of the pdms concentration on the membrane morphologies the cross section structure of m3 m4 m5 and m6 were measured by sem the mass fraction of the membrane forming material in all casting solutions was fixed at 20 wt as shown in fig 4 a m3 has the highest thickness 108 μm and no macrovoids were observed in its cross section image from fig 4 the thickness of the pvdf pdms blend membranes decrease with the increased pdms content the thickness of m4 m5 and m6 are 89 70 and 59 μm respectively with the elevating of pdms concentration massive micron scale pores appeared gradually on the cross section of the membrane furthermore the pore size also increases with the pdms content and the decreased pvdf concentration fig s4 these results demonstrate that the pvdf pdms ratio has a decisive effect on the surface morphology of the blend membranes adding pdms to the pvdf casting solution not only reduces the thickness of the membrane but also facilitates the formation of the pores inside the membrane this is caused by the low viscosity of the pvdf pdms casting solution fig s5 43 from the viewpoint of the macrovoid formation mechanism a casting solution with lower viscosity is beneficial to pore initiation 3 3 wettability of membranes superhydrophobic property of a material is closely related to its surface morphology and surface energy furthermore the hierarchical micro nano structure is a prerequisite for the superwetting surface for the purpose of exploring the hydrophobicity of the resultant membrane their water contact angles were measured and shown in fig 5 the water contact angle of m1 m2 and m3 pvdf membranes are 146 1 7 149 2 8 and 151 2 2 respectively with the increasing concentration of pvdf the pure pvdf membrane has a richer micro nano hierarchical structure and shows better hydrophobicity because of the inherent hydrophobicity of pvdf the rougher membrane surface will have a preferable hydrophobic property 44 the water contact angles of pvdf pdms blend membranes m4 m5 and m6 are 158 2 6 164 1 9 and 155 2 4 respectively the surface of m4 became rougher comparing with the pure pvdf membrane because more microscale protruding structures and micropores appeared fig 3d in addition the inherent hydrophobicity of pdms can further enhance the hydrophobicity of the membrane for m5 the nanostructures of the membrane surface are less significant than the pure pvdf membrane but it still has a considerable number of nanostructures as there are micropores on its surface fig 3e the surface of pvdf pdms blend membrane with micro and nano scale dual structures are crucial for obtaining superhydrophobic property see movie s1 m5 shows similar phenomenon to what was observed in lotus leaves 45 when the water droplets came into contact with the membrane surface of m5 and forms a water air solid composite interface was shaped owing to the air trapped in the micro and nano scale hierarchical structures leading to an increased water contact angle for m5 164 1 9 compared with m5 the nanostructures on the surface of m6 almost disappeared and the size of the blocky protrusions and pores reached the micron level fig 3f which can increase the contact area between the membrane and water droplets thus the water contact angle of m6 is lower than m5 besides the membrane with m5 s casting solution but using water as nonsolvent is also prepared its contact angle is much lower than m5 128 6 fig s5 confirm the advantage of using ethanol as nonsolvent 3 4 mechanical performance of membranes the mechanical performance is an important index of a membrane as it can directly affect its practical application the tensile strength and elongation ratio of m3 m4 m5 and m6 were recorded and presented in fig 6 m3 the pure pvdf membrane has a large tensile strength and a low elongation ratio compared with m3 the breaking stress of both m4 and m5 decreases while the breaking elongation enhanced nevertheless as to m6 a high pdms concentration will simultaneously reduce the tensile strength and elongation ratio pdms could be used as a plasticizer of pvdf to improve the activity of the pvdf chain and massive pores fig 4 in the blend membranes provide more free space for the deformation of the membrane 37 however defects or macrovoids inside the blend membrane fig 4d red cycle are caused by an excessive amount of pdms thus endowing the blend membrane with worse mechanical properties 3 5 membranes separation performance it is difficult to separation surfactant stabilized emulsions due to their long term colloidal stability and the micro nanometer size of the emulsion droplets 46 to study the separation capability all samples were tested using a surfactant stabilized water isooctane emulsion sse 1 with micro nanometer droplet size when the prepared emulsions were poured onto the surface of the superhydrophobic superoleophilic membranes water was retained on the feed side and oil permeate through the membranes fig 7 a b and movie s2 the results of flux and separation efficiency in filtration are presented in fig 8 a the pure pvdf membrane m1 m2 and m3 have a flux of 52 4 67 7 and 87 5 l m 2 h 1 when sse 1 was applied simultaneously the separation efficiency of m1 m2 and m3 reaches up to 99 98 99 95 and 99 97 normally the membranes flux decreases with the increased membrane thickness due to the growth of mass transfer resistance and the extended permeation transfer path 6 however an abnormal tendency was observed for the pure pvdf membrane the flux increases with the promotion of the membrane thickness the thickness of m1 m2 and m3 are 46 81 and 108 μm respectively since both of the membrane thickness and the membrane surface property can have a vital effect on the separation performance of the membrane such abnormal flux tendency could be explained by the enhanced hydrophobicity and lipophilicity of m2 and m3 which could enhance the affinity between membrane and oil yielding an increased membrane flux fig 5 it can be concluded that the membrane surface property has a greater impact on membrane flux in addition with the addition of pdms the membrane flux is boosted to 318 15 738 39 and 996 53 l m 2 h 1 for m4 m5 and m6 respectively the separation efficiency of m4 m5 and m6 is 99 93 99 88 99 75 it is apparent that the pvdf pdms blend membrane has higher flux and separation efficiency when compared with pvdf membrane the thickness of the pvdf pdms blend membranes decrease with the increase of pdms content in the mixing solution the thickness of m4 m5 and m6 is 89 70 and 59 μm respectively macrovoids appeared throughout the pvdf pdms blend membranes and the size of the pores increases with the promotion of pdms content fig s4 all these aspects significantly decreased the mass transfer resistance for permeation in addition the enhanced affinity between membrane and oil originating from the improved hydrophobicity and lipophilicity of pvdf pdms blend membranes fig 5 could also enhance the membrane flux this indicates that the prepared pvdf pdms blend membranes with protrusion structure and superior surface property have an excellent separation performance considering the mechanical strength porosity and superhydrophobic superoleophilic properties the pvdf pdms blend membranes m5 was chosen to further investigate the separation performance of emulsions the flux and separation efficiency of those emulsions are shown in fig 8b the flux of m 5 for sse 1 sse 2 sse 3 and sse 4 is 738 39 713 24 855 45 and 791 32 l m 2 h 1 respectively with separation efficiency for sse 1 sse 2 sse 3 and sse 4 of 99 88 99 93 99 89 and 99 81 respectively fig 8c shows the optical microscope images of the water in oil emulsions before and after separation the micrometer emulsion droplets are scattered well in the original emulsion while no emulsion droplets were observed in the corresponding collected filtrate indicating the efficient separation performance the droplets size distribution of the original emulsion and filtrate were measured by dls as we can see in fig 8d the size distribution of the feed by intensity ranges from 90 to 1200 nm it shifted to 5 11 nm of the filtrate after separation confirming the high separation efficiency and excellent de emulsification of the membrane the droplets size distribution of sse 2 sse 3 and sse 4 before and after separation is shown in fig s1 fig s2 and fig s3 respectively it can be seen that m5 exhibits a high flux for all surfactant stabilized water in oil emulsions used in this experiment the flux is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the liquid in addition the size distribution of emulsion droplets and the demulsification process also have significant effects on the flux 3 6 antifouling performance of pvdf pdms blend membranes in practical applications the membrane is exposed to complex feed fluid conditions which may lead to cause unavoidable membrane fouling thereby causing the reduction of the lifespan and separation performance of the membrane 47 therefore antifouling is a significant parameter for membrane to verify the reusability of pvdf pdms blend membranes m5 was repeatedly used for 10 filtration cycles fig 9 after each separation test the prepared membrane was briefly washed with ethanol and then dried under vacuum conditions the flux remained at a high level of 709 l m2 h1 and the separation efficiency exceeded 99 8 after 10 cycles the above results show that the pvdf pdms blend membranes have good recycling and antifouling properties 4 conclusions to summarize highly porous superhydrophobic superoleophilic pvdf pdms blend membranes were prepared by a feasible ethanol induced phase inversion approach the optimal pvdf pdms blend membrane m5 shows a water contact angle of 164 1 9 and an oil contact angle of 0 with its high wettability and hierarchical structure m5 can efficiently separate various emulsions with droplet sizes of micro nanometer level showing a high filtration flux of up to 713 24 855 45 l m 2 h 1 and a separation efficiency exceeding 99 8 driven solely by gravity furthermore the membrane exhibited a superior antifouling performance is easy to recycle and has good mechanical properties beyond that the preparation process is facile reliable and conducive to large scale production consequently it is believed that this membrane forming method could be a promising strategy for membrane fabrication for commercial applications of oil water emulsion separation declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts to declare acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science

14079,this study evaluated the performance of aluminum and iron plate electrode systems on the continuous electrocoagulation of boron from produced water under varying conditions of retention time initial concentration and electrode distance the experimental data were validated for mass transfer resistance using the modified mass transfer factor mmtf model results show a similar trend for both electrode systems boron removal decreased from 78 7 60 for aluminum electrode and 67 3 53 3 for iron electrode with shortening retention time from 45 to 30 min boron removal further decreased from 84 to 72 7 for aluminum electrode and 76 to 61 3 for iron electrode with increasing electrode distance from 0 5 cm to 1 5 cm analyses of the mass transfer resistance showed that the driving force b for boron mass transfer was concentration dependent and increased from 0 1037 to 0 4002 mg g for aluminum electrode and 0 0445 to 0 1258 mg g for iron electrode with increasing initial boron concentration from 5 to 15 mg l a similar trend was observed for the affinity between boron and the electroactive species analyses of boron mass transfer resistance related to the global and film mass transfer and porous diffusion show that boron mass transfer resistance correlated to the film mass transfer for both electrode systems aluminum electrode system showed better performance for boron removal and higher mass transfer kinetics this study clearly demonstrates that continuous electrocoagulation is a suitable alternative for boron removal from produced water keywords electrode boron electrocoagulation mass transfer resistance electrified interface produced water 1 introduction oil and gas exploration involves the consumption and generation of large volume of water relatively associated with extraction activities in both offshore and onshore streams wastewater generated from oil and gas exploration is called produced water and is highly complex due to its association with refining activities 1 during oil and gas extraction water is injected into the reservoir to optimize hydraulic pressure and improve oil recovery therefore produced water is the combination of water found in underground formation and water injected into the reservoir which is brought to the surface during oil and gas exploration it is the largest waste stream of oil and gas exploration highly saline and consists of complex mixtures of dissolved and dispersed organic and inorganic compounds such as k b cl na so4 2 co3 2 hco3 heavy metals chemicals applied during exploration radionuclides btex benzene toluene ethylbenze and xylenes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs organic acids and phenols 1 3 these produced water characteristics primarily depend on geographical locations of the oil field geologic formation nature of hydrocarbon produced extraction method chemical composition of reservoirs and chemicals used during exploration 4 6 therefore there is legitimate concern over the disposal and management of produced water indiscriminate disposal of inadequately treated produced water can be deleterious to the environment inorganic produced water components such as boron have complex chemistry and are difficult to manage boron is a multipurpose element essentially required as micronutrient for plant growth it is widely applied in various industries including mining pharmaceuticals cosmetics detergents adhesive electric condensers fertilizers herbicides insecticides and many other manufacturing processes 7 it penetrates into the environment from natural and anthropogenic activities in produced water it originates from borate based chemicals added to the exploration process and the geological formations of the aquifer 8 long term consumption of boron contaminated water can cause several health related issues including blood circulation disorder gastrointestinal and reproductive disorders in rats boron can impact embryo development and affect their sexual organs in a manner that can cause sterility 9 boron removal from major waste streams such as produced water has been a subject of intense research due to the ability of boron to exist in different ionic forms based on solution ph at low ph boron exists as boric acid but changes to borate ion at high ph 9 this boron chemistry is a significant demerit for single stage reverse osmosis ro membrane technologies 10 electrodialysis 11 and biological processes 12 therefore there is a dire need for the application and scaling up of suitable alternative boron removal technology electrocoagulation ec has emerged as a suitable alternative to conventional treatment of industrial wastewater due to its associated benefits such as simplicity low operating cost and high efficiency 13 the basic mechanism of ec involves the oxidation of the sacrificial electrode material under the influence of electric field when the sacrificial anode oxidizes metal ions released into the aqueous phase neutralize wastewater pollutants repel their similar charges and agglomerate with them as a sweep floc this process involves the following three basic successive steps 14 i formation of electroactive species through electrolytic dissolution of sacrificial anode ii contaminant destabilization and neutralization through the interaction of electroactive species with colloidal particles iii flocculation of insoluble particles for removal through floatation or sedimentation the insoluble metal hydroxides generated in situ from the electrodes serves as electroactive species that neutralize the pollutants and enhance removal the hydrogen gas bubble produced at the cathode and oxygen released at the anode enhances the removal of flocculated particles through floatation or sedimentation electrode materials are primary components of ec system which can influence process performance the choice of electrode material largely depends on availability and oxidation potential iron and aluminum electrodes are the most widely used electrodes due to their availability low cost and higher electrode potential these electrodes generate different metal hydroxides during ec the behavior of the electrochemical process using aluminum and iron electrodes in the continuous electrocoagulation of boron needs to be investigated the adsorption isotherm kinetics and thermodynamics of boron adsorption from aqueous solution and produced water by electrocoagulation in batch regime are well documented 15 17 however studies related to the mass transfer resistance of continuous electrocoagulation of boron from produced water are scarce mass transfer knowledge defines the steps involved in the liquid solid interaction and the suitability of the adsorbing material the transport of adsorbate in aqueous solution can be influenced by many factors such as adsorbate concentration adsorbent size mixing rate and adsorbate adsorbent affinity 18 19 the mass transfer resistance of solutes from the bulk liquid to the film zone and to the active sites can be determined using the global and film mass transfer and porous diffusion thus the net transfer of mass can be examined using mass transfer kinetic models to the best of our knowledge there are no studies comparing the electrochemical behavior of aluminum and iron electrodes on the continuous electrocoagulation of boron from produced water and the mechanism of mass transfer resistance on the electroactive sites therefore this study aims to first explore the behavior of aluminum and iron electrodes during ec compare boron removal efficiency of aluminum and iron electrodes from real produced water under various conditions of retention time initial boron concentration and electrode distance during continuous electrocoagulation investigate the driving force and affinity between boron and the electroactive species under the conditions evaluated and finally determine boron mass transfer resistance relating to the global and film mass transfer and porous diffusion based on the percentage of outflow 1 1 electrode behavior aluminum electrode has unique characteristics it is naturally passive due to the formation of a uniform natural oxide film on its surface according to the reaction 20 1 2 a l 3 2 o 2 a l 2 o 3 this oxide film consists of three different elements anodic pores cathodic barrier layer and neutral thicker areas these layers can grow rapidly form thicker films and protect the metal surface from corrosion 20 while aluminum metal is a conductor the natural oxide film is an insulator and significantly influences electrode behavior stability and corrosion resistance however under very acid caustic and other special conditions including the presence of halide and other ions such as cl f cu2 no3 and so4 2 the oxide film can undergo pitting and allow the metal surface to oxidize furthermore hard water can aggressively react with the oxide film 21 22 produced water is hard contains trace amount of halide and other ions capable of causing a pitting corrosion on the metal surface when aluminum oxidizes it loses three electrons to ions present in solution and the degree of such oxidation is related to its electrode potential metals with electronegative potential are highly oxidizing than electropositive metals 20 with a high negative standard electrode potential of 1 66 v aluminum can readily oxidize than most metals in ec and produce the following primary reactions 23 2 a n o d e a l a l 3 3 e 3 c a t h o d e 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h secondary reactions can occur when the anode potential is very high and produce the following reactions 4 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e the metal coagulants al3 generated from the oxidation of anode in eq 2 can spontaneously hydrolyze to produce various monomeric species 24 5 a l 3 h 2 o a l o h 2 h 6 a l o h 2 h 2 o a l o h 2 h 7 a l o h 2 h 2 o a l o h 3 h other forms of dimeric trimeric and polynuclear hydrolysis products such as al2 oh 2 4 al3 oh 4 5 al6 oh 15 3 al7 oh 17 4 al8 oh 20 4 al13o4 oh 24 7 al13 oh 34 5 can form the occurrence of hydrolysis at the anode and hydrogen evolution at the cathode makes both electrode vicinities acidic and alkali respectively these cationic products of hydrolysis can react with the hydroxyl ions ho and transform into amorphous al oh 3 s in the bulk solution iron electrode also has a similar passive film on its surface with a structure close to γ fe2o3 that can act as a semiconductor the passive layer has an outer interphase which is suggested to contain high concentration of cation interstices predominantly fe iii while at the metal oxide interphase fe ii vacancies is expected 25 this tetrahedral and octahedral interstites of the passive layer are occupied by fe atoms 26 atoms in electrical environments consist of free electrons that can be in motion throughout the metal when metal atoms oxidize they form ions in the aqueous phase and create an electron flux within the metal towards the direction of solution the ions or molecules in the aqueous phase accept electrons from the oxidized metal and get reduced into other chemical species 20 the passive film surface can be electrochemically dissolved during the oxidation and reduction reactions of iron the fe ii centers acts as electron donors 25 with a negative standard

portable turbidimeter and conductivity meter myronl conductivity respectively boron concentration was determined according to the standard method for water and wastewater treatment 28 2 2 ec unit two rectangular acrylic ec reactors with similar dimensions of 10 5 18 cm h x w x l and a working volume of 0 9 l was simultaneously used for this study the inlet and outlet of the reactors was located 1 5 cm from the bottom and top respectively a homopolymer engraved electrode hanger containing four pairs of two groups of alternating electrodes cathode and anode made from aluminum and iron plates were placed on a baffle 0 5 cm from the top the electrodes were connected to a digital dc supply instek dc supply model gpr 30hi0d china in the range of 0 3 amperes and 0 30 volt a magnetic stirring bar was placed inside the bottom of the reactors and the reactors were placed on a magnetic stirrer operating at 150 rpm the current and voltage passing through the electrodes was regulated using a multimeter samples were fed to the reactor using a peristaltic pump at different influent flowrates after each experimental run the aluminum electrodes was polished washed with acetone rinsed with deionized water and dried at 105 c before placing into the electrode hanger while the used iron plate electrodes were chemically washed with dilute hydrochloric acid and rinsed with deionized water to remove surface impurities prior to reuse fig 1 shows the diagram of the reactor 2 3 experimental design the influence of retention time rt on the continuous electrocoagulation of boron ceb from produced water was evaluated by gradually increasing the influent flowrate in the range of 20 25 and 30 ml min corresponding to rt of 45 36 and 30 min respectively for both reactors the retention time was calculated using the following expression 12 τ v q where τ is the retention time d v is the reactor volume l and q is the influent flowrate l d the effect of concentration on ceb was determined by means of dilution to achieve three experimental conditions of 5 10 and 15 mg l the influence of electrode distance was determined at three spacing of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 cm respectively current density and ph were applied at optimized conditions 3 16 effluent samples of electrochemically treated produced water were collected at 15 min intervals to examine boron removal efficiency all sample analyses were triplicated 2 4 mass transfer analyses boron removal efficiency from produced water under continous electrocoagulation was calculated using the expression in eq 13 13 e c o c s c o where e co and cs are boron removal initial concentration and concentration at any time mg l respectively the amount of boron removed at any time within a given τ was expressed using the following expression 29 14 q

m3 and electrode consumption kg m3 csludge kg m3 represent sludge generation during ec 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of retention time fig 2 compares the effect of retention time τ on boron removal at the pre determined conditions of current density and ph three different retention time τ of 30 36 and 45 min were examined at electrode distance of 0 5 cm and boron concentration of 15 mg l the results show a similar trend for both the aluminum and iron electrode boron removal increased with increasing the retention time from 30 to 45 min boron removal efficiencies at τ of 30 36 and 45 min were 60 69 3 and 78 7 for aluminum electrode and 53 3 60 7 and 67 3 for iron electrode respectively this phenomenon could be explain thus at short retention time the solute boron and the electroactive species have insufficient time to react coagulate agglomerate and precipitate out of the reactor environment before the effluents flow out of the reactor while at longer retention time the solute and the electroactive species have sufficient time to react before the effluent flows out of the reactor this scenario has also been reported in a submerged membrane bioreactor mbr when hydraulic retention time hrt was decreased from 3 to 1 h 32 furthermore short τ is associated with higher hydraulic application it is well known that ec involves pollutant destabilization and floc formation higher hydraulic application can increase internal mixing within the system and break the sludge blankets of the formed ec floc causing re stabilization a phenomenon that can desorb adsorbed pollutants back into the aqueous phase this phenomenon was mentioned by moussa et al 33 who noted that rapid mixing can break particle bridging between colloids and cause re stabilization boron removal was higher with the aluminum electrode system this could be attributed to the standard electrode potential effect of the electrodes aluminum has a higher standard electrode potential 1 66 v than iron 0 44 v and would readily oxidize and attract electrons towards itself in aqueous phase than iron therefore higher boron molecules were attracted to the aluminum electroactive species a similar observation was made by ilhan et al 34 treating leachate the authors obtained a cod removal of 52 and 42 for aluminum and iron electrodes respectively 3 2 effect of concentration the influence of initial boron concentration was examined through three levels of 5 10 and 15 mg l fig 3 shows the effect of concentration at τ of 45 min and electrode spacing of 0 5 cm the results show a negative effect on boron removal when concentration is increased for both aluminum and iron electrodes boron removal decreased from 88 to 78 7 for aluminum electrode and 78 to 67 3 for iron electrode when initial concentration was increased from 5 to 15 mg l this phenomenon could be explained thus at fixed τ 45 min current density 12 5 ma cm2 and ph 7 84 the amount of electroactive species generated at low initial boron concentration of 5 mg l is insufficient to treat samples of higher boron concentration therefore when initial concentration was increased removal efficiency decreased this result is in agreement with alizadeh et al 35 who noted that dye removal efficiency decreased with increasing initial dye concentration the negative effect observed with increasing initial boron concentration was prominent for iron electrode due to the standard electrode potential of both systems aluminum has a higher standard electrode potential and can attract more boron molecules towards itself causing lower effluent residue boron concentration than for iron electrode 3 3 effect of electrode distance the effect of electrode distance on boron removal was examined at pre determined conditions of current density and ph at fixed τ 45 min and boron concentration 15 mg l boron removal efficiency decreased with increasing electrode distance fig 4 shows that boron removal decreased from 84 to 72 7 for aluminum electrode and 76 to 61 3 for iron electrode with increasing electrode distance from 0 5 to 1 5 cm previous reports suggests that the nature of pollutant electrode set up and some process hydrodynamic conditions can influence pollutant removal at various electrode distance 36 37 higher boron removal at electrode distance of 0 5 cm could be attributed to rapid generation of electroactive species and stronger electric field strength due to the closeness of the electrodes this further implies that ohmic resistance between electrodes decreased and hydrogen bubble gas generation at the cathode increased at short electrode distance increasing the distance between electrode spacing causes a decrease of electric field intensity a similar observation was made by dolati et al 9 treating aqueous solution at the same condition of electrode distance 0 5 cm boron removal was higher for aluminum electrode than iron electrode 3 4 process cost the process cost for the continuous electrocoagulation of boron using aluminum and iron electrodes was examined using the expression in eq 21 the process cost analyses clearly show that the cost of continuous electrocoagulation of boron from produced water for aluminum and iron electrode is approximately similar the electrical energy consumption cenergy for aluminum and iron electrodes under the same experimental conditions of current density 12 5 ma cm2 and retention time 45 min were 1 73 and 1 71 kw h m3 respectively the overall cost of continuous electrocoagulation of boron from produced water at τ of 45 min was in the range 0 2 m3 and 0 18 m3 for aluminum and iron electrode respectively the cost decreased with decreasing τ due to reduction from electrode and energy consumption and sludge production while longer τ was suitable for higher boron removal it was undesirable for cost implications therefore the application and upgrading of continuous ec systems requires adequate consideration on moderate operating conditions 3 5 linear regression the linear regression representing the transfer of solute and the resistance to solute transport onto the electroactive sites was examined using the modified mass transfer factor mmtf model developed by fulazzaky et al 31 the mmtf model was used to examine the driving force and affinity between the solute and the electroactive species fig 5 shows the trend of the driving force and affinity of boron for the electroactive sites at optimized conditions of current density 12 5 ma cm2 ph 7 84 τ 45 min concentration 15 mg l and electrode distance 0 5 cm the driving force and affinity constants at different concentrations are shown in table 1 the results shows that the driving force of boron mass transfer onto the electroactive sites for aluminum and iron increased with increasing concentrations the driving force b for aluminum electrode at boron concentrations of 5 10 and 15 mg l were 0 1037 0 3059 and 0 4002 mg g while it was 0 0445 0 1166 and 0 1258 mg g for iron electrode the increase of driving force with increasing initial boron concentration was caused by the effects of concentration gradient and van der waals force of attraction when metal atom oxidizes they form ions in the aqueous phase which creates an electron flux from the metal towards the direction of the solution these reactions destabilize and neutralize the repulsive forces that cause particle stability in solution and introduce the van der waals force of attraction which bridge particles allowing them to coagulate and producing a zero net charge in the process the coagulated particle forms a floc which creates a sludge blanket to entrap and bridge colloidal particles that was not coagulated 38 at higher boron concentration higher boron molecules diffuse to the electroactive sites since the produced water ph is indicative of the presence of borate ions therefore evaluation of the potential effect of concentration dependent diffusion of boron onto the electroactive sites in a multicomponent system at fixed current density clearly demonstrates that concentration gradient correlated to the driving force the accumulation of boron on the electroactive sites were very rapid at the initial stage in all initial concentration but slowed down as time progresses a higher initial concentration generates the driving force necessary to overcome the resistance between boron and the electroactive species and cause an increase of the uptake rate this phenomenon indicates that once the active sites on the surface of the electroactive species are occupied and filled boron mass transfer gradually decreased due to insufficient active sites furthermore the collision and diffusion between boron and the electroactive species increased at higher initial concentration at higher concentration gradient the diffusion of solute from the region of high mass transfer potential was higher additionally boron has a low molecular weight of 10 811 which can enhance its diffusion onto the electroactive sites with fewer collisions this observation is in agreement with fulazzaky et al 31 who obtained an index b of 2 472 mg g 1 and 3 084 mg g 1 for al3 and nh4 adsorption onto gac respectively the higher driving force obtained from the aluminum electrode was due to higher force of attraction between boron and aluminum due to the high standard electrode potential of aluminum the affinity β between boron and the electroactive species demonstrated similar trend with increasing initial boron concentration the affinity β of boron for the electroactive species increased in the range of 1 0712 1 1244 and 1 163 g h mg for aluminum electrode and 1 0699 1 1396 and 1 2069 g h mg for iron electrode respectively it is well known that the affinity of the solute for the electroactive species is related to the energetic heterogeneity associated to the molecular structure molecular weight and solubility polarity of the solute and the electroactive species 18 several mechanisms involved in the affinity of boron for the electroactive sites are related to the atomic structure of matter matter consists of primary particles that carry electric charges known as ions and electrons and electrically neutral particles known as atoms and molecules atoms in electrical environments consist of free electrons that can be in motion throughout the metal in aqueous phase positive cations and negative anions ions and neutral molecules such as water can exist these reactions could be influenced by the oxidation potential of metals which is classified based on the strength of their charges metals with electronegative potential are highly oxidizing when two atoms of equal electronegativity bind the bonding pair of electrons can be found on average half way between the two atoms but when one atom is highly electronegative the less electronegative atom loses control of its electron to the highly electronegative atom completely to form ionic bond aluminum 1 66 v and iron 1 83 v are highly electronegative metals boron can readily attract and bond with electroactive species generated from these metals in ec the results clearly indicate that initial boron concentration has a significant effect on boron affinity towards the electroactive species generated from aluminum and iron electrodes the results are in contrast to khamidun et al 39 who obtained a close β of 1 462 1 416 and 1 420 g h mg 1 at bed depths of 4 9 and 15 cm respectively for ammonium adsorption onto coconut shell granular activated carbon csgac 3 6 global mass transfer the variations of the global mass transfer kla g rate was examined based on the percentage of outflow to determine the mass transfer resistance of boron onto the electroactive species validation of the experimental data representing the variations of kla g relative to the percentage of outflow in fig 6 shows a decreasing trend for aluminum and iron electrodes the kla g rate decreased from a high to a low mass transfer potential with increasing percentage of outflow and initial boron concentration in both electrode systems the kla g rate was rapid at the initial stage and decreased as time progresses at boron concentration of 5 mg l the kla g rate was rapid until it reached 18 outflow and slowed down for aluminum electrode the maximum and minimum kla g rate for this condition 5 mg l was 2 34 and 0 72 h 1 at 12 and 52 outflow respectively at boron concentration of 10 mg l the maximum and minimum kla g rate was 2 25 and 0 43 h 1 at 18 and 72 outflow while it was 2 18 and 0 29 h 1 at 21 and 81 outflow at 15 mg l respectively for iron electrode a similar trend was obtained the maximum kla g rate at boron concentration of 5 mg l was 1 58 h 1 at 22 outflow then the kla g rate progressively decreased to 0 64 h 1 with increasing the percentage of outflow to 54 when boron concentration was increased the maximum kla g rate decreased the maximum kla g rate at boron concentrations of 10 and 15 mg l was 1 37 and 1 24 h 1 at 29 and 32 outflow but progressively decreased to 0 38 and 0 33 at 71 and 74 outflow respectively the results for both electrodes show a significant decrease of the kla g rate from the region of high to low mass transfer potential with increasing percentage of outflow and initial concentration the potential mass transfer of boron was energetic at all initial concentrations but exponentially decreased with increased accumulation of the electroactive sites by boron these reactions occur primarily in the electrified interface consisting of the solution and metal interface the solution interface has a compact and diffuse layer the compact layer has different planes inner and outer helmholtz planes defined by their closest approach to the metal surface the outer helmholtz plane ohp contains hydrated ions mostly cations within the bulk solution their hydrated shell increases their size as they move towards the plane of closest approach away from the metal surface in solution the ions cations are stable and dispersed due to repulsive forces caused by the presence of similar surface charges primarily negative charges 40 the repulsive forces make the ions in solution stable and prevent coagulation and agglomeration to destabilize the suspension neutralize similar charges and achieve coagulation counter ions with opposite charges arising from the oxidation of sacrificial anode are introduced into the solution the counter ions create forces of attraction that bind with the surface charges of the dispersed particles forming an electrical double layer 33 the ions in the diffused layer also interact with the counter ions from ec therefore while boron mass transfer was rapid the forces of attraction between the adsorbate and the electroactive species decreased with simultaneous accumulation of the adsorbate on the electroactive sites since the force of attraction between boron and the electroactive species decreased with an increased accumulation of boron the variation of kla g decreased progressively after exceeding the 18 30 and 32 outflow for aluminum electrode and 34 48 and 54 outflow for iron electrode for 5 10 and 15 mg l respectively this could be attributed to the reduction of affinity between the solute and the electroactive species by the repulsive forces the mass transfer constants are summarized in table 2 3 7 film mass transfer the film mass transfer model was used to examine boron mass transfer resistance on the electroactive species relative to the percentage of outflow fig 7 shows that the kla f rate for aluminum and iron electrode exhibited similar trend the kla f rate increased progressively for both electrode systems with increasing the percentage of outflow but decreased with increasing initial concentration at 5 mg l boron concentration using aluminum electrode the kla f showed a breakthrough curve at 18 outflow ascended progressively to 40 outflow reached maximum peak at 52 outflow with a kla f rate of 3 7 10 2 h 1 and attained zero at saturation of the electroactive sites boron concentrations of 10 and 15 mg l demonstrated similar film mass transfer trend the maximum kla f rate for 10 and 15 mg l at 72 and 81 outflow were 2 6 10 2 and 1 9 10 2 h 1 respectively for iron electrode the kla f rate at boron concentration of 5 mg l showed a breakthrough curve at 44 outflow then ascended progressively and attained saturation at 54 outflow with a maximum kla f rate of 3 4 10 2 h 1 for boron concentrations of 10 and 15 mg l the kla f rate increased spontaneously developed breakthrough curves at 68 and 63 outflows and attained saturation at 71 and 74 outflow with maximum kla f rate of 1 97 10 2 and 1 6 10 2 h 1 respectively the uptrend of the kla f rate from the region of low to high mass transfer potential could be attributed to the affinity between the solutes in solution and the surface accumulation of the electroactive species the mass transfer resistance which occurred before the breakthrough curve largely depended on film mass transfer due to the difficulty in the transport of solute from the bulk solution to the film zone this difficulty is further exacerbated by the interspecific competition of solutes in solution which impedes solute mobility onto the external surface of the electroactive sites causing an increase of the transport time required for the solutes to arrive on the external surface the reactions on the film zone typically define the electrified interface the metal interface is made up of atoms connected to a lattice structure these atoms in the lattice wells cannot freely move into the solution without crossing the activation energy barrier when direct current is applied to electrodes they oxidize and release these electrons which interact with the oppositely charged ions in the solution interface in the outer helmholtz layer ohl of the solution interface hydrated cations attracted towards the metal have limited access towards the metal surface due to their solvation shells during electrostatic interaction ions in the solution approach the electrode surface within the limit allowed by their solvation shell in the inner helmholtz layer ihl water molecules can adsorb anions and contain specifically adsorbed anion while the diffuse layer consists of dispersed excess ions that freely move these colloidal charges in the compact and diffuse layer of the solution interface interact with the counter ions from the oxidation of the sacrificial anode in the metal interface since colloids are tiny particles having large surface area ions from the surrounding environment can absorb on the surface of colloids 33 when the surface of the colloids adsorb the counter ions released from the sacrificial anode the counter ions reduce the repulsive forces that prevent colloidal particles from coagulating and form an electrical double layer the electrical double layer consists of the stern and outer layer the stern layer as the internal region of the double layer contains tightly bound oppositely charged ions on the surface of the colloidal particles the maximum potential that exists on the surface of colloidal particles known as nernst potential decreases across the stern layer due to the presence of oppositely charged particles yielding an overall net charge on the surface shear known as zeta potential 41 when the charges on the surface of the colloidal particles reduce the zeta potential reduces and a zero net charge is produced in the outer layer excess charge ions cation or anions freely move due to diffusion these charges constitute electroactive species on the electrode surface within the double layer where electron transfer occurs when particles are adsorbed the surface charge rearranges the ions and dipoles within the electrical double layer and causes a flow of electrons into or out of the electrode surface this can change the double layer to a structure appropriate to the new reaction and influence charge distribution 40 visual and microscopic examination of the electrode surfaces clearly indicated a pitting corrosion due to the application of direct current and the release of ions film mass transfer controlled boron transport from the bulk solution to the film zone and delayed the diffusion into the interior zone additionally the increase of kla f rate from the region of low to high mass transfer potential in fig 7 indicate that the influence of concentration on film mass transfer was significant this result is in line with souza et al 42 who obtained an increasing external mass transfer kf rate during the adsorption of malachite green mg the mass transfer analyses constants is shown in table 2 3 8 porous diffusion application of the porous diffusion model on the mass transfer resistance of boron onto the electroactive sites in fig 8 shows that both aluminum and iron electrodes exhibited similar trend the mass transfer of boron for both electrode systems decreased from the region of high to low mass transfer potential the kla d rate decreased with increasing the percentage of outflow and initial boron concentration at 5 mg l initial concentration boron mass transfer on aluminum electrode was rapid until 18 outflow and slowed down until 52 outflow with a kla d maximum rate of 2 32 h 1 the maximum kla d rate at 10 and 15 mg l decreased spontaneously from the region of high to low mass transfer potential and were 2 24 and 2 16 h l respectively for iron electrode the maximum kla d at boron concentration of 5 mg l was 1 57 h 1 at 22 outflow but decreased progressively to 0 61 h 1 with increasing percentage of outflow to 54 at boron concentrations of 10 and 15 mg l the maximum kla d rate was 1 36 and 1 23 h 1 at 29 and 32 outflow but decreased progressively to 0 36 and 0 32 h 1 with increasing percentage of outflow to 71 and 74 outflow respectively the decreasing trend of mass transfer of ions on the surface of colloidal particles into the interior pores of the electroactive sites can be explained thus first the ions migrated from the bulk solution to the film zone and accumulate the exterior pores on the surface of the electroactive sites when the exterior pores on the surface of the electroactive sites are filled and no further uptake can occur un adsorbed and loosely bound ions on the exterior surface slowly migrate into the interior pores while the transfer of boron from the bulk solution to the film zone was rapid the transfer of boron from the film zone into the interior pores of the electroactive sites was slow this scenario could be attributed to the accumulation of large amount of solute on the film zone allowing only the transfer of un adsorbed molecules into the interior of the internal electroactive sites inorganic or organic compounds with lower molecular weight will travel faster with fewer collisions towards the interior pores of the electroactive sites furthermore the repulsive forces between the solute and the electroactive species can contribute to the decreasing trend of kla d the repulsive forces can originate from the competition between solutes in solution for the acceptor sites in the interior pores of the electroactive sites produced water is a complex mixture of organic and inorganic compounds which can compete for the active sites on the surface of the electroactive sites in a related study fulazzaky 43 noted that the maximum rate of porous diffusion for the adsorption of atrazine and simazine onto granular activated carbon gac occurred at 5 outflow above 5 the porous diffusion curves decreased this was attributed to the reduction of the attractive forces between adsorbate and adsorbent due to the accumulation of the solutes furthermore wastewater characteristics the nature of adsorbate and electroactive species could influence porous diffusion the mass transfer constants are summarized in table 2 4 conclusion the results obtained from the continuous electrocoagulation of boron show that both electrode systems adequately eliminated boron from produced water however aluminum electrode had a superior performance process performance was clearly influenced by retention time electrode distance and initial boron concentration both electrode systems also displayed similar mass transfer kinetic trend the driving force and affinity for boron mass transfer on both systems increased with increasing initial boron concentration due to the forces of attraction between boron and the electroactive species mass transfer resistance correlated to film mass transfer kla f involving the transfer of solutes from the bulk solution to the external sites of the electroactive species this study clearly demonstrate that continuous electrocoagulation of boron using both aluminum and iron electrode is a suitable alternative for the treatment of produced water the system is cheap feasible and can be easily upgraded declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this study was supported by universiti teknologi petronas utp

14079,this study evaluated the performance of aluminum and iron plate electrode systems on the continuous electrocoagulation of boron from produced water under varying conditions of retention time initial concentration and electrode distance the experimental data were validated for mass transfer resistance using the modified mass transfer factor mmtf model results show a similar trend for both electrode systems boron removal decreased from 78 7 60 for aluminum electrode and 67 3 53 3 for iron electrode with shortening retention time from 45 to 30 min boron removal further decreased from 84 to 72 7 for aluminum electrode and 76 to 61 3 for iron electrode with increasing electrode distance from 0 5 cm to 1 5 cm analyses of the mass transfer resistance showed that the driving force b for boron mass transfer was concentration dependent and increased from 0 1037 to 0 4002 mg g for aluminum electrode and 0 0445 to 0 1258 mg g for iron electrode with increasing initial boron concentration from 5 to 15 mg l a similar trend was observed for the affinity between boron and the electroactive species analyses of boron mass transfer resistance related to the global and film mass transfer and porous diffusion show that boron mass transfer resistance correlated to the film mass transfer for both electrode systems aluminum electrode system showed better performance for boron removal and higher mass transfer kinetics this study clearly demonstrates that continuous electrocoagulation is a suitable alternative for boron removal from produced water keywords electrode boron electrocoagulation mass transfer resistance electrified interface produced water 1 introduction oil and gas exploration involves the consumption and generation of large volume of water relatively associated with extraction activities in both offshore and onshore streams wastewater generated from oil and gas exploration is called produced water and is highly complex due to its association with refining activities 1 during oil and gas extraction water is injected into the reservoir to optimize hydraulic pressure and improve oil recovery therefore produced water is the combination of water found in underground formation and water injected into the reservoir which is brought to the surface during oil and gas exploration it is the largest waste stream of oil and gas exploration highly saline and consists of complex mixtures of dissolved and dispersed organic and inorganic compounds such as k b cl na so4 2 co3 2 hco3 heavy metals chemicals applied during exploration radionuclides btex benzene toluene ethylbenze and xylenes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs organic acids and phenols 1 3 these produced water characteristics primarily depend on geographical locations of the oil field geologic formation nature of hydrocarbon produced extraction method chemical composition of reservoirs and chemicals used during exploration 4 6 therefore there is legitimate concern over the disposal and management of produced water indiscriminate disposal of inadequately treated produced water can be deleterious to the environment inorganic produced water components such as boron have complex chemistry and are difficult to manage boron is a multipurpose element essentially required as micronutrient for plant growth it is widely applied in various industries including mining pharmaceuticals cosmetics detergents adhesive electric condensers fertilizers herbicides insecticides and many other manufacturing processes 7 it penetrates into the environment from natural and anthropogenic activities in produced water it originates from borate based chemicals added to the exploration process and the geological formations of the aquifer 8 long term consumption of boron contaminated water can cause several health related issues including blood circulation disorder gastrointestinal and reproductive disorders in rats boron can impact embryo development and affect their sexual organs in a manner that can cause sterility 9 boron removal from major waste streams such as produced water has been a subject of intense research due to the ability of boron to exist in different ionic forms based on solution ph at low ph boron exists as boric acid but changes to borate ion at high ph 9 this boron chemistry is a significant demerit for single stage reverse osmosis ro membrane technologies 10 electrodialysis 11 and biological processes 12 therefore there is a dire need for the application and scaling up of suitable alternative boron removal technology electrocoagulation ec has emerged as a suitable alternative to conventional treatment of industrial wastewater due to its associated benefits such as simplicity low operating cost and high efficiency 13 the basic mechanism of ec involves the oxidation of the sacrificial electrode material under the influence of electric field when the sacrificial anode oxidizes metal ions released into the aqueous phase neutralize wastewater pollutants repel their similar charges and agglomerate with them as a sweep floc this process involves the following three basic successive steps 14 i formation of electroactive species through electrolytic dissolution of sacrificial anode ii contaminant destabilization and neutralization through the interaction of electroactive species with colloidal particles iii flocculation of insoluble particles for removal through floatation or sedimentation the insoluble metal hydroxides generated in situ from the electrodes serves as electroactive species that neutralize the pollutants and enhance removal the hydrogen gas bubble produced at the cathode and oxygen released at the anode enhances the removal of flocculated particles through floatation or sedimentation electrode materials are primary components of ec system which can influence process performance the choice of electrode material largely depends on availability and oxidation potential iron and aluminum electrodes are the most widely used electrodes due to their availability low cost and higher electrode potential these electrodes generate different metal hydroxides during ec the behavior of the electrochemical process using aluminum and iron electrodes in the continuous electrocoagulation of boron needs to be investigated the adsorption isotherm kinetics and thermodynamics of boron adsorption from aqueous solution and produced water by electrocoagulation in batch regime are well documented 15 17 however studies related to the mass transfer resistance of continuous electrocoagulation of boron from produced water are scarce mass transfer knowledge defines the steps involved in the liquid solid interaction and the suitability of the adsorbing material the transport of adsorbate in aqueous solution can be influenced by many factors such as adsorbate concentration adsorbent size mixing rate and adsorbate adsorbent affinity 18 19 the mass transfer resistance of solutes from the bulk liquid to the film zone and to the active sites can be determined using the global and film mass transfer and porous diffusion thus the net transfer of mass can be examined using mass transfer kinetic models to the best of our knowledge there are no studies comparing the electrochemical behavior of aluminum and iron electrodes on the continuous electrocoagulation of boron from produced water and the mechanism of mass transfer resistance on the electroactive sites therefore this study aims to first explore the behavior of aluminum and iron

transfer resistance relating to the global and film mass transfer and porous diffusion based on the percentage of outflow 1 1 electrode behavior aluminum electrode has unique characteristics it is naturally passive due to the formation of a uniform natural oxide film on its surface according to the reaction 20 1 2 a l 3 2 o 2 a l 2 o 3 this oxide film consists of three different elements anodic pores cathodic barrier layer and neutral thicker areas these layers can grow rapidly form thicker films and protect the metal surface from corrosion 20 while aluminum metal is a conductor the natural oxide film is an insulator and significantly influences electrode behavior stability and corrosion resistance however under very acid caustic and other special conditions including the presence of halide and other ions such as cl f cu2 no3 and so4 2 the oxide film can undergo pitting and allow the metal surface to oxidize furthermore hard water can aggressively react with the oxide film 21 22 produced water is hard contains trace amount of halide and other ions capable of causing a pitting corrosion on the metal surface when aluminum oxidizes it loses three electrons to ions present in solution and the degree of such oxidation is related to its electrode potential metals with electronegative potential are highly oxidizing than electropositive metals 20 with a high negative standard

cathode makes both electrode vicinities acidic and alkali respectively these cationic products of hydrolysis can react with the hydroxyl ions ho and transform into amorphous al oh 3 s in the bulk solution iron electrode also has a similar passive film on its surface with a structure close to γ fe2o3 that can act as a semiconductor the passive layer has an outer interphase which is suggested to contain high concentration of cation interstices predominantly fe iii while at the metal oxide interphase fe ii vacancies is expected 25 this tetrahedral and octahedral interstites of the passive layer are occupied by fe atoms 26 atoms in electrical environments consist of free electrons that can be in motion throughout the metal when metal atoms oxidize they form ions in the aqueous phase and create an electron flux within the metal towards the direction of solution the ions or molecules in the aqueous phase accept electrons from the oxidized metal and get reduced into other chemical species 20 the passive film surface can be electrochemically dissolved during the oxidation and reduction reactions of iron the fe ii centers acts as electron donors 25 with a negative standard

portable turbidimeter and conductivity meter myronl conductivity respectively boron concentration was determined according to the standard method for water and wastewater treatment 28 2 2 ec unit two rectangular acrylic ec reactors with similar dimensions of 10 5 18 cm h x w x l and a working volume of 0 9 l was simultaneously used for this study the inlet and outlet of the reactors was located 1 5 cm from the bottom and top respectively a homopolymer engraved electrode hanger containing four pairs of two groups of alternating electrodes cathode and anode made from aluminum and iron plates were placed on a baffle 0 5 cm from the top the electrodes were connected to a digital dc supply instek dc supply model gpr 30hi0d china in the range of 0 3 amperes and 0 30 volt a magnetic stirring bar was placed inside the bottom of the reactors and the reactors were placed on a magnetic stirrer operating at 150 rpm the current and voltage passing through the electrodes was regulated using a multimeter samples were fed to the reactor using a peristaltic pump at different influent flowrates after each experimental run the aluminum electrodes was polished washed with acetone rinsed with deionized water and dried at 105 c before placing into the electrode hanger while the used iron plate electrodes were chemically washed with dilute hydrochloric acid and rinsed with deionized water to remove surface impurities prior to reuse fig 1 shows the diagram of the reactor 2 3 experimental design the influence of retention time rt on the continuous electrocoagulation of boron ceb from produced water was evaluated by gradually increasing the influent flowrate in the range of 20 25 and 30 ml min corresponding to rt of 45 36 and 30 min respectively for both reactors the retention time was calculated using the following expression 12 τ v q where τ is the retention time d v is the reactor volume l and q is the influent flowrate l d the effect of concentration on ceb was determined by means of dilution to achieve three experimental conditions of 5 10 and 15 mg l the influence of electrode distance was determined at three spacing of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 cm respectively current density and ph were applied at optimized conditions 3 16 effluent samples of electrochemically treated produced water were collected at 15 min intervals to examine boron removal efficiency all sample analyses were triplicated 2 4 mass transfer analyses boron removal efficiency from produced water under continous electrocoagulation was calculated using the expression in eq 13 13 e c o c s c o where e co and cs are boron removal initial concentration and concentration at any time mg l respectively the amount of boron removed at any time within a given τ was expressed using the following expression 29 14 q o v c o c s d v m the influence of concentration on the driving force and the affinity between the solute and the electroactive species can be determined using the modified mass transfer factor mmtf

electroactive species g b is the mass transfer index related to driving force mg g β is the affinity between boron and the electroactive species g h mg 1 t is reaction time the mass transfer index b related to the driving force and the affinity between the solute and the electroactive species β was determined from the intercept and slope of the plot of ln q vs ln t the global mass transfer gmt

generate metal ions required for electrocoagulation the amount of ions generated at any condition during ec was calculated using the faraday s expression in eq 19 19 w i t m z f the electrical energy

m3 and electrode consumption kg m3 csludge kg m3 represent sludge generation during ec 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of retention time fig 2 compares the effect of retention time τ on boron removal at the pre determined conditions of current density and ph three different retention time τ of 30 36 and 45 min were examined at electrode distance of 0 5 cm and boron concentration of 15 mg l the results show a similar trend for both the aluminum and iron electrode boron removal increased with increasing the retention time from 30 to 45 min boron removal efficiencies at τ of 30 36 and 45 min were 60 69 3 and 78 7 for aluminum electrode and 53 3 60 7 and 67 3 for iron electrode respectively this phenomenon could be explain thus at short retention time the solute boron and the electroactive species have insufficient time to react coagulate agglomerate and precipitate out of the reactor environment before the effluents flow out of the reactor while at longer retention time the solute and the electroactive species have sufficient time to react before the effluent flows out of the reactor this scenario has also been reported in a submerged membrane bioreactor mbr when hydraulic retention time hrt was decreased from 3 to 1 h 32 furthermore short τ is associated with higher hydraulic application it is well known that ec involves pollutant destabilization and floc formation higher hydraulic application can increase internal mixing within the system and break the sludge blankets of the formed ec floc causing re stabilization a phenomenon that can desorb adsorbed pollutants back into the aqueous phase this phenomenon was mentioned by moussa et al 33 who noted that rapid mixing can break particle bridging between colloids and cause re stabilization boron removal was higher with the aluminum electrode system this could be attributed to the standard electrode potential effect of the electrodes aluminum has a higher standard electrode potential 1 66 v than iron 0 44 v and would readily oxidize and attract electrons towards itself in aqueous phase than iron therefore higher boron molecules were attracted to the aluminum electroactive species a similar observation was made by ilhan et al 34 treating leachate the authors obtained a cod removal of 52 and 42 for aluminum and iron electrodes respectively 3 2 effect of concentration the influence of initial boron concentration was examined through three levels of 5 10 and 15 mg l fig 3 shows the effect of concentration at τ of 45 min and electrode spacing of 0 5 cm the results show a negative effect on boron removal when concentration is increased for both aluminum and iron electrodes boron removal decreased from 88 to 78 7 for aluminum electrode and 78 to 67 3 for iron electrode when initial concentration was increased from 5 to 15 mg l this phenomenon could be explained thus at fixed τ 45 min current density 12 5 ma cm2 and ph 7 84 the amount of electroactive species generated at low initial boron concentration of 5 mg l is insufficient to treat samples of higher boron concentration therefore when initial concentration was increased removal efficiency decreased this result is in agreement with alizadeh et al 35 who noted that dye removal efficiency decreased with increasing initial dye concentration the negative effect observed with increasing initial boron concentration was prominent for iron electrode due to the standard electrode potential of both systems aluminum has a higher standard electrode potential and can attract more boron molecules towards itself causing lower effluent residue boron concentration than for iron electrode 3 3 effect of electrode distance the effect of electrode distance on boron removal was examined at pre determined conditions of current density and ph at fixed τ 45 min and boron concentration 15 mg l boron removal efficiency decreased with increasing electrode distance fig 4 shows that boron removal decreased from 84 to 72 7 for aluminum electrode and 76 to 61 3 for iron electrode with increasing electrode distance from 0 5 to 1 5 cm previous reports suggests that the nature of pollutant electrode set up and some process hydrodynamic conditions can influence pollutant removal at various electrode distance 36 37 higher boron removal at electrode distance of 0 5 cm could be attributed to rapid generation of electroactive species and stronger electric field strength due to the closeness of the electrodes this further implies that ohmic resistance between electrodes decreased and hydrogen bubble gas generation at the cathode increased at short electrode distance increasing the distance between electrode spacing causes a decrease of electric field intensity a similar observation was made by dolati et al 9 treating aqueous solution at the same condition of electrode distance 0 5 cm boron removal was higher for aluminum electrode than iron electrode 3 4 process cost the process cost for the continuous electrocoagulation of boron using aluminum and iron electrodes was examined using the expression in eq 21 the process cost analyses clearly show that the cost of continuous electrocoagulation of boron from produced water for aluminum and iron electrode is approximately similar the electrical energy consumption cenergy for aluminum and iron electrodes under the same experimental conditions of current density 12 5 ma cm2 and retention time 45 min were 1 73 and 1 71 kw h m3 respectively the overall cost of continuous electrocoagulation of boron from produced water at τ of 45 min was in the range 0 2 m3 and 0 18 m3 for aluminum and iron electrode respectively the cost decreased with decreasing τ due to reduction from electrode and energy consumption and sludge production while longer τ was suitable for higher boron removal it was undesirable for cost implications therefore the application and upgrading of continuous ec systems requires adequate consideration on moderate operating conditions 3 5 linear regression the linear regression representing the transfer of solute and the resistance to solute transport onto the electroactive sites was examined using the modified mass transfer factor mmtf model developed by fulazzaky et al 31 the mmtf model was used to examine the driving force and affinity between the solute and the electroactive species fig 5 shows the trend of the driving force and affinity of boron for the electroactive sites at optimized conditions of current density 12 5 ma cm2 ph 7 84 τ 45 min concentration 15 mg l and electrode distance 0 5 cm the driving force and affinity constants at different concentrations are shown in table 1 the results shows that the driving force of boron mass transfer onto the electroactive sites for aluminum and iron increased with increasing concentrations the driving force b for aluminum electrode at boron concentrations of 5 10 and 15 mg l were 0 1037 0 3059 and 0 4002 mg g while it was 0 0445 0 1166 and 0 1258 mg g for iron electrode the increase of driving force with increasing initial boron concentration was caused by the effects of concentration gradient and van der waals force of attraction when metal atom oxidizes they form ions in the aqueous phase which creates an electron flux from the metal towards the direction of the solution these reactions destabilize and neutralize the repulsive forces that cause particle stability in solution and introduce the van der waals force of attraction which bridge particles allowing them to coagulate and producing a zero net charge in the process the coagulated particle forms a floc which creates a sludge blanket to entrap and bridge colloidal particles that was not coagulated 38 at higher boron concentration higher boron molecules diffuse to the electroactive sites since the produced water ph is indicative of the presence of borate ions therefore evaluation of the potential effect of concentration dependent diffusion of boron onto the electroactive sites in a multicomponent system at fixed current density clearly demonstrates that concentration gradient correlated to the driving force the accumulation of boron on the electroactive sites were very rapid at the initial stage in all initial concentration but slowed down as time progresses a higher initial concentration generates the driving force necessary to overcome the resistance between boron and the electroactive species and cause an increase of the uptake rate this phenomenon indicates that once the active sites on the surface of the electroactive species are occupied and filled boron mass transfer gradually decreased due to insufficient active sites furthermore the collision and diffusion between boron and the electroactive species increased at higher initial concentration at higher concentration gradient the diffusion of solute from the region of high mass transfer potential was higher additionally boron has a low molecular weight of 10 811 which can enhance its diffusion onto the electroactive sites with fewer collisions this observation is in agreement with fulazzaky et al 31 who obtained an index b of 2 472 mg g 1 and 3 084 mg g 1 for al3 and nh4 adsorption onto gac respectively the higher driving force obtained from the aluminum electrode was due to higher force of attraction between boron and aluminum due to the high standard electrode potential of aluminum the affinity β between boron and the electroactive species demonstrated similar trend with increasing initial boron concentration the affinity β of boron for the electroactive species increased in the range of 1 0712 1 1244 and 1 163 g h mg for aluminum electrode and 1 0699 1 1396 and 1 2069 g h mg for iron electrode respectively it is well known that the affinity of the solute for the electroactive species is related to the energetic heterogeneity associated to the molecular structure molecular weight and solubility polarity of the solute and the electroactive species 18 several mechanisms involved in the affinity of boron for the electroactive sites are related to the atomic structure of matter matter consists of primary particles that carry electric charges known as ions and electrons and electrically neutral particles known as atoms and molecules atoms in electrical environments consist of free electrons that can be in motion throughout the metal in aqueous phase positive cations and negative anions ions and neutral molecules such as water can exist these reactions could be influenced by the oxidation potential of metals which is classified based on the strength of their charges metals with electronegative potential are highly oxidizing when two atoms of equal electronegativity bind the bonding pair of electrons can be found on average half way between the two atoms but when one atom is highly electronegative the less electronegative atom loses control of its electron to the highly electronegative atom completely to form ionic bond aluminum 1 66 v and iron 1 83 v are highly electronegative metals boron can readily attract and bond with electroactive species generated from these metals in ec the results clearly indicate that initial boron concentration has a significant effect on boron affinity towards the electroactive species generated from aluminum and iron electrodes the results are in contrast to khamidun et al 39 who obtained a close β of 1 462 1 416 and 1 420 g h mg 1 at bed depths of 4 9 and 15 cm respectively for ammonium adsorption onto coconut shell granular activated carbon csgac 3 6 global mass transfer the variations of the global mass transfer kla g rate was examined based on the percentage of outflow to determine the mass transfer resistance of boron onto the electroactive species validation of the experimental data representing the variations of kla g relative to the percentage of outflow in fig 6 shows a decreasing trend for aluminum and iron electrodes the kla g rate decreased from a high to a low mass transfer potential with increasing percentage of outflow and initial boron concentration in both electrode systems the kla g rate was rapid at the initial stage and decreased as time progresses at boron concentration of 5 mg l the kla g rate was rapid until it reached 18 outflow and slowed down for aluminum electrode the maximum and minimum kla g rate for this condition 5 mg l was 2 34 and 0 72 h 1 at 12 and 52 outflow respectively at boron concentration of 10 mg l the maximum and minimum kla g rate was 2 25 and 0 43 h 1 at 18 and 72 outflow while it was 2 18 and 0 29 h 1 at 21 and 81 outflow at 15 mg l respectively for iron electrode a similar trend was obtained the maximum kla g rate at boron concentration of 5 mg l was 1 58 h 1 at 22 outflow then the kla g rate progressively decreased to 0 64 h 1 with increasing the percentage of outflow to 54 when boron concentration was increased the maximum kla g rate decreased the maximum kla g rate at boron concentrations of 10 and 15 mg l was 1 37 and 1 24 h 1 at 29 and 32 outflow but progressively decreased to 0 38 and 0 33 at 71 and 74 outflow respectively the results for both electrodes show a significant decrease of the kla g rate from the region of high to low mass transfer potential with increasing percentage of outflow and initial concentration the potential mass transfer of boron was energetic at all initial concentrations but exponentially decreased with increased accumulation of the electroactive sites by boron these reactions occur primarily in the electrified interface consisting of the solution and metal interface the solution interface has a compact and diffuse layer the compact layer has different planes inner and outer helmholtz planes defined by their closest approach to the metal surface the outer helmholtz plane ohp contains hydrated ions mostly cations within the bulk solution their hydrated shell increases their size as they move towards the plane of closest approach away from the metal surface in solution the ions cations are stable and dispersed due to repulsive forces caused by the presence of similar surface charges primarily negative charges 40 the repulsive forces make the ions in solution stable and prevent coagulation and agglomeration to destabilize the suspension neutralize similar charges and achieve coagulation counter ions with opposite charges arising from the oxidation of sacrificial anode are introduced into the solution the counter ions create forces of attraction that bind with the surface charges of the dispersed particles forming an electrical double layer 33 the ions in the diffused layer also interact with the counter ions from ec therefore while boron mass transfer was rapid the forces of attraction between the adsorbate and the electroactive species decreased with simultaneous accumulation of the adsorbate on the electroactive sites since the force of attraction between boron and the electroactive species decreased with an increased accumulation of boron the variation of kla g decreased progressively after exceeding the 18 30 and 32 outflow for aluminum electrode and 34 48 and 54 outflow for iron electrode for 5 10 and 15 mg l respectively this could be attributed to the reduction of affinity between the solute and the electroactive species by the repulsive forces the mass transfer constants are summarized in table 2 3 7 film mass transfer the film mass transfer model was used to examine boron mass transfer resistance on the electroactive species relative to the percentage of outflow fig 7 shows that the kla f rate for aluminum and iron electrode exhibited similar trend the kla f rate increased progressively for both electrode systems with increasing the percentage of outflow but decreased with increasing initial concentration at 5 mg l boron concentration using aluminum electrode the kla f showed a breakthrough curve at 18 outflow ascended progressively to 40 outflow reached maximum peak at 52 outflow with a kla f rate of 3 7 10 2 h 1 and attained zero at saturation of the electroactive sites boron concentrations of 10 and 15 mg l demonstrated similar film mass transfer trend the maximum kla f rate for 10 and 15 mg l at 72 and 81 outflow were 2 6 10 2 and 1 9 10 2 h 1 respectively for iron electrode the kla f rate at boron concentration of 5 mg l showed a breakthrough curve at 44 outflow then ascended progressively and attained saturation at 54 outflow with a maximum kla f rate of 3 4 10 2 h 1 for boron concentrations of 10 and 15 mg l the kla f rate increased spontaneously developed breakthrough curves at 68 and 63 outflows and attained saturation at 71 and 74 outflow with maximum kla f rate of 1 97 10 2 and 1 6 10 2 h 1 respectively the uptrend of the kla f rate from the region of low to high mass transfer potential could be attributed to the affinity between the solutes in solution and the surface accumulation of the electroactive species the mass transfer resistance which occurred before the breakthrough curve largely depended on film mass transfer due to the difficulty in the transport of solute from the bulk solution to the film zone this difficulty is further exacerbated by the interspecific competition of solutes in solution which impedes solute mobility onto the external surface of the electroactive sites causing an increase of the transport time required for the solutes to arrive on the external surface the reactions on the film zone typically define the electrified interface the metal interface is made up of atoms connected to a lattice structure these atoms in the lattice wells cannot freely move into the solution without crossing the activation energy barrier when direct current is applied to electrodes they oxidize and release these electrons which interact with the oppositely charged ions in the solution interface in the outer helmholtz layer ohl of the solution interface hydrated cations attracted towards the metal have limited access towards the metal surface due to their solvation shells during electrostatic interaction ions in the solution approach the electrode surface within the limit allowed by their solvation shell in the inner helmholtz layer ihl water molecules can adsorb anions and contain specifically adsorbed anion while the diffuse layer consists of dispersed excess ions that freely move these colloidal charges in the compact and diffuse layer of the solution interface interact with the counter ions from the oxidation of the sacrificial anode in the metal interface since colloids are tiny particles having large surface area ions from the surrounding environment can absorb on the surface of colloids 33 when the surface of the colloids adsorb the counter ions released from the sacrificial anode the counter ions reduce the repulsive forces that prevent colloidal particles from coagulating and form an electrical double layer the electrical double layer consists of the stern and outer layer the stern layer as the internal region of the double layer contains tightly bound oppositely charged ions on the surface of the colloidal particles the maximum potential that exists on the surface of colloidal particles known as nernst potential decreases across the stern layer due to the presence of oppositely charged particles yielding an overall net charge on the surface shear known as zeta potential 41 when the charges on the surface of the colloidal particles reduce the zeta potential reduces and a zero net charge is produced in the outer layer excess charge ions cation or anions freely move due to diffusion these charges constitute electroactive species on the electrode surface within the double layer where electron transfer occurs when particles are adsorbed the surface charge rearranges the ions and dipoles within the electrical double layer and causes a flow of electrons into or out of the electrode surface this can change the double layer to a structure appropriate to the new reaction and influence charge distribution 40 visual and microscopic examination of the electrode surfaces clearly indicated a pitting corrosion due to the application of direct current and the release of ions film mass transfer controlled boron transport from the bulk solution to the film zone and delayed the diffusion into the interior zone additionally the increase of kla f rate from the region of low to high mass transfer potential in fig 7 indicate that the influence of concentration on film mass transfer was significant this result is in line with souza et al 42 who obtained an increasing external mass transfer kf rate during the adsorption of malachite green mg the mass transfer analyses constants is shown in table 2 3 8 porous diffusion application of the porous diffusion model on the mass transfer resistance of boron onto the electroactive sites in fig 8 shows that both aluminum and iron electrodes exhibited similar trend the mass transfer of boron for both electrode systems decreased from the region of high to low mass transfer potential the kla d rate decreased with increasing the percentage of outflow and initial boron concentration at 5 mg l initial concentration boron mass transfer on aluminum electrode was rapid until 18 outflow and slowed down until 52 outflow with a kla d maximum rate of 2 32 h 1 the maximum kla d rate at 10 and 15 mg l decreased spontaneously from the region of high to low mass transfer potential and were 2 24 and 2 16 h l respectively for iron electrode the maximum kla d at boron concentration of 5 mg l was 1 57 h 1 at 22 outflow but decreased progressively to 0 61 h 1 with increasing percentage of outflow to 54 at boron concentrations of 10 and 15 mg l the maximum kla d rate was 1 36 and 1 23 h 1 at 29 and 32 outflow but decreased progressively to 0 36 and 0 32 h 1 with increasing percentage of outflow to 71 and 74 outflow respectively the decreasing trend of mass transfer of ions on the surface of colloidal particles into the interior pores of the electroactive sites can be explained thus first the ions migrated from the bulk solution to the film zone and accumulate the exterior pores on the surface of the electroactive sites when the exterior pores on the surface of the electroactive sites are filled and no further uptake can occur un adsorbed and loosely bound ions on the exterior surface slowly migrate into the interior pores while the transfer of boron from the bulk solution to the film zone was rapid the transfer of boron from the film zone into the interior pores of the electroactive sites was slow this scenario could be attributed to the accumulation of large amount of solute on the film zone allowing only the transfer of un adsorbed molecules into the interior of the internal electroactive sites inorganic or organic compounds with lower molecular weight will travel faster with fewer collisions towards the interior pores of the electroactive sites furthermore the repulsive forces between the solute and the electroactive species can contribute to the decreasing trend of kla d the repulsive forces can originate from the competition between solutes in solution for the acceptor sites in the interior pores of the electroactive sites produced water is a complex mixture of organic and inorganic compounds which can compete for the active sites on the surface of the electroactive sites in a related study fulazzaky 43 noted that the maximum rate of porous diffusion for the adsorption of atrazine and simazine onto granular activated carbon gac occurred at 5 outflow above 5 the porous diffusion curves decreased this was attributed to the reduction of the attractive forces between adsorbate and adsorbent due to the accumulation of the solutes furthermore wastewater characteristics the nature of adsorbate and electroactive species could influence porous diffusion the mass transfer constants are summarized in table 2 4 conclusion the results obtained from the continuous electrocoagulation of boron show that both electrode systems adequately eliminated boron from produced water however aluminum electrode had a superior performance process performance was clearly influenced by retention time electrode distance and initial boron concentration both electrode systems also displayed similar mass transfer kinetic trend the driving force and affinity for boron mass transfer on both systems increased with increasing initial boron concentration due to the forces of attraction between boron and the electroactive species mass transfer resistance correlated to film mass transfer kla f involving the transfer of solutes from the bulk solution to the external sites of the electroactive species this study clearly demonstrate that continuous electrocoagulation of boron using both aluminum and iron electrode is a suitable alternative for the treatment of produced water the system is cheap feasible and can be easily upgraded declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this study was supported by universiti teknologi petronas utp
